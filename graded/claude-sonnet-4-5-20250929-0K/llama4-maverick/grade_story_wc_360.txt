<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Echo remains a cipher throughout—motivation is stated ("to understand the mathematics of emotion") but never embodied through concrete choice under pressure. The "habitually borrowed personalities" trait is mentioned twice but never constrains an action or creates visible cost. Interiority consists entirely of abstract declarations ("eyes gleamed with intensity," "sense of clarity") without contradictory impulses or embodied emotion. No meaningful change occurs; Echo begins obsessed and ends purposeful, but no path is foreclosed with felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (density of imagery around stars, press, fragment), but no meaningful tightening or cost appears at closure. The final paragraph asserts "crucial step" and "lucidity of vision" without demonstrating what options narrowed or what price was paid. Orientation anchors who/where/when early enough. The piece teaches a lyric pattern but the closure image ("walked into the night") does not reconfigure prior stakes or charge the Halo fragment with new weight—it simply stops.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Topaz workshop, letterpress, luminescent orbs, and Halo fragment are named but remain static set-dressing. The vanishing stars create atmospheric pressure but never constrain Echo's choices—work continues unaffected. Spatial choreography is vague (Echo "positioned" the fragment, "stepped back," then "disappeared into the night" with no tracked movement). The press and fragment are handled in two beats, meeting minimal threshold, but neither object alters tactics or charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>One dominant stake is signaled early (understand emotion's mathematics), but no on-page reversal or tightening occurs. Echo arranges text, inserts the fragment, prints a maze—each step proceeds without friction or cost. The vanishing stars create a declared time pressure ("timeframe was limited") but Echo's actions do not accelerate or adapt. The final "crucial step" is asserted, not earned; no live option is foreclosed and no trade-off appears. Accumulative lens would require density increase or cadence shift to reweight the stake—neither lands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Transposed empathy" and "mathematics of emotion" are stated repeatedly but never emerge from concrete image or choice. The final paragraph moralizes directly: "the power of transposed empathy." The Halo fragment could function as a charged object but is introduced late (past midpoint) and its "secrets" remain abstract. Ambiguity is declared ("deliberate ambiguity," "multiple layers of meaning") rather than demonstrated through scene pressure. One modest credit: the vanishing stars offer a non-literal frame, but the ending does not reweight them—it simply walks away.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited on Echo. Psychic distance wobbles between close ("Echo felt a thrill") and distant summary ("It was a quest that had consumed Echo for years"). Perceptual signature is generic—Echo's way of noticing (press, stars, fragment) could belong to any character. Diction is elevated and consistent but not character-particular; "lucid turbulence," "transposed empathy," and "palpable sense of anticipation" read as authorial rather than Echo's idiom. No dialogue. Brief violation: "the air seemed to thicken" (unmoored perception) in a high-pressure beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Severe paraphrase loops and template cadence throughout. Paragraph 13: "The timeframe was limited… Echo knew that they had to make the most of the time remaining" restates identical content. Paragraphs 16–19 recycle "sense of" four times in close succession ("sense of urgency," "sense of anticipation," "sense of clarity," "sense of purpose"). Stock metaphor strings: "thrill of anticipation," "swirling vortex of meaning," "beacon guiding." Register drifts into thesis-speak ("concept of transposed empathy," "underlying mathematics of emotion") mid-beat without POV anchor. Applying loop/scaffold penalties (−0.6), metaphor stack (−0.4), register drift (−0.3) totals baseline −1.3 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Core premise (letterpress + ancient tech shard to decode emotion) offers moderate freshness, but execution defaults to template moves: obsessed artisan, mysterious artifact, countdown clock, vague epiphany. "Transposed empathy" and "mathematics of emotion" are prompt labels recycled without transformation. The vanishing-stars timeframe is atmospheric but inert—no causal link to Echo's work. Final image ("disappeared into the night") is stock departure rhetoric. Transformation test fails: swap "letterpress" for "loom" or "synth" and the arc remains unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Echo (cryptic letterpress operator) is present throughout and performs actions (arranges type, positions fragment, prints text), meeting setup and development gates. However, no choice creates a key turn—each action proceeds without friction or consequence. Closure participation is weak: Echo "stepped back" and "disappeared into the night" are observations, not decisions that alter stakes. Swappable with "mysterious alchemist" or "reclusive coder." Present and functional but not causal.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Halo fragment is introduced at midpoint (late signal, −0.4), handled in two beats (positioned in press, resulting print is described), and mentioned in the final paragraph ("armed with their letterpress and the Halo fragment's secrets"). Setup missed; development and payoff present. The fragment's "delicate curves" and "hidden patterns" remain abstract—no specific property constrains Echo's choice or charges the closure image. Functional role in the press scene lifts it above ornamental, but swappable with "ancient lens" or "crystal shard."</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Transposed empathy is defined early ("emotions could be translated and transmitted through… language and symbol") but never dramatized. It shapes the stated motivation and appears in summary ("hoped to induce… lucid turbulence… empathy was transposed"), yet no on-page action tests or enacts the concept. The printed "maze of deliberate ambiguity" is described, not shown affecting a reader. Closure mentions "the power of transposed empathy" as theme claim. Present but ornamental; does not constrain tactics or alter options.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Habitually borrows personalities" is mentioned twice: paragraph 6 ("slipped into the skins of various characters") and briefly implied when Echo shifts between "poet" and "detached scientist." No on-page cost or constraint—the trait is label-only. The personality shifts do not alter Echo's actions or complicate a choice. Removing the trait would not change any beat. Present but purely decorative.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Disorient" appears in paragraph 11: "The resulting print was a maze of deliberate ambiguity, a text that disoriented and disarmed the reader." This is summary of an effect, not a dramatized action Echo performs. No reader is on the page to be disoriented; no turn traces to this. The concept recurs in the final line ("lucidity… turbulent landscape") but remains abstract. Mentioned and consistent with theme, but does not drive a beat or redefine options. Functional but replaceable with "confuse" or "unsettle."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Through deliberate ambiguity" is the method tied to the disorienting print (paragraph 11: "maze of deliberate ambiguity"). Signaled at setup, but mechanics never constrain Echo's process—ambiguity is asserted as output, not shown shaping attempts. Does not enable or complicate a tactic. The final image does not leverage ambiguity; it offers "lucidity of vision," contradicting the method. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Topaz workshop is named in the opening and closing, present under the star-filled sky with luminescent orbs and the letterpress. The space provides tools (press, metal type) but does not pressure choices—Echo works unimpeded. The vanishing stars occur outside but do not alter what happens inside the workshop. Micro-setting: the press is handled in two beats but remains static. Postcard description without tactical constraint. Setup, development, and cameo payoff present; functional but generic workspace.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Between vanishing stars" frames the story: stars vanish one by one from paragraph 13 onward, and "the last star vanished" at paragraph 18. The timeframe is declared urgent ("timeframe was limited… sense of urgency") but does not tighten Echo's decisions—work proceeds at the same pace throughout. No action is cut short or adapted due to the clock. Time is tracked visually (stars) but does not alter tactics. Present across setup, middle, and ending; functional but inert pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"To understand the mathematics of emotion" is stated in paragraph 4 and drives Echo's project (experimenting with transposed empathy, integrating the Halo fragment). The motivation is told rather than dramatized—no on-page moment shows Echo torn between competing desires or facing friction. Paragraph 20 asserts "mathematics of emotion were within their grasp" without showing what was grasped or what cost was paid. Present throughout and consistent, but no conflicted choice enacts the desire. Functional but lacks friction between want and cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Lucid turbulence" is declared in paragraph 12 as the intended effect on readers and recurs in the final line ("lucidity of their vision… turbulent landscape"). Tone throughout is elevated and abstract, with some atmospheric charge from the vanishing stars. However, the prose remains static—no modulation under pressure, no cadence shift at closure. The final image offers "lucidity" and "purpose," flattening the turbulence rather than charging it. Present as label and in the final image, but does not modulate or intensify with pressure.</comment>
