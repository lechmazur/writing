<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Aria is defined by her role and her "persistently curious gaze," but these remain labels without embodied contradiction or cost. The woman's grief is sketched through tears and a tight grip, yet no micro-choice reveals competing impulses or genuine struggle—her acceptance arrives without visible trade-off. The hearing aid device and Aria's method are told rather than dramatized through consequential action, leaving motivation abstract and unmotivated by prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The story presents a continuous scene in the atrium with clear spatial anchors (no orientation penalty). However, the drive lens remains ambiguous: the hearing aid pulses suggest causal method, the mist-clearing implies accumulative atmosphere, yet neither proves dominant by closure. The ending offers comfort but no legible cost—Aria departs unchanged, the woman vanishes with closure already granted, and no option is foreclosed on the page. Without a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration with felt price, or conceptual repricing that reweights prior material, closure does not meet the required standard.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium at twilight is established early and sustained through sensory detail (fog, hush, gentle hum). The mist clears as Aria speaks, offering one moment where setting mirrors internal state, yet it does not constrain choice or alter tactics—Aria's approach and the woman's acceptance proceed identically whether the mist lifts or not. The hearing aid functions as a conceptual beacon but is never handled or used in a way that shapes the final image with cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reconnecting lost hearts—is signaled early, but no on-page reversal or tightening narrows options. Aria tracks the pulses, approaches, speaks comfort, and succeeds without complication or price; the woman accepts immediately. No live choice forces a trade-off, no escalation tests commitment, and the resolution arrives without agency-driven cost. Coincidence may complicate under Situational designs, but here convenience grants closure without pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The theme of memory and connection emerges through the photograph and the hearing aid, yet the final paragraph ("incidental heroism," "reeling hush") states the theme rather than letting the image charge it. No epiphany is earned by prior struggle, and the woman's peace arrives without ambiguity or felt complexity. The ending moralizes ("she had made a difference") instead of offering a resonant, non-literal answer rooted in scene particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited remains stable with no head-hopping. The dialogue ("I've been searching for my sister") is functional but generic; the woman's voice lacks distinct idiom or subtext. Aria's perceptual signature—tracking pulses, curious gaze—is told more than shown through specific sensory bias. The prose carries consistent tense and filter-verb use, though the final paragraphs drift toward summary ("the work she did, the lives she touched") that flattens immediacy at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops cluster densely: "tears streaming / tears flowed harder," "whispers of the past / whispers of the dead," "faint pulses / faint pulses," "mist-clad / mist swirling," and three near-identical constructions stating Aria's vocation across opening paragraphs. Template cadence runs through multiple "As she…" openers and "The woman…" stems without variation. Stock metaphors ("beacon guiding," "balm to her sorrow," "shroud") and filter-verb stacks ("felt," "seemed," "realized") dull high-pressure beats. Information density is low—many sentences restate mood without advancing situation or knowledge—and the final third summary further drags momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The premise—contact tracer for hearts using a decades-old hearing aid to track a dead girl's presence—offers a fresh setup, but the execution follows a template comfort-plot without transformation: mystic helper arrives, offers solace, departs unchanged. The mist-clearing and the photograph are stock gestures. No turn, intensification, or final reconfiguration grows unpredictably from prior particulars; the woman's peace and Aria's departure are median safe choices that avoid bold risk or earned complexity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Aria appears throughout but her choices are passive observation and comfort-giving without on-page cost or tactical shift. She decides to approach and to speak, yet neither decision narrows options or charges closure—her role could be filled by any empathetic figure with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The photograph is introduced in the middle beat, held by the woman, and identified as depicting two girls. It appears again when the woman pockets it at closure, but this reprise does not reweight meaning or impose cost—it simply confirms comfort granted. It shapes one beat (the recognition) but remains swappable with any keepsake.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Incidental heroism" is named explicitly in the final third as thematic label ("this moment of incidental heroism") rather than demonstrated through choice or cost. It does not shape stakes or tactics on the page; removing the phrase would not alter Aria's actions or the woman's outcome.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Persistently curious" is stated twice as a trait label but never constrains or enables an on-page action with visible cost. Aria's tracking and approach would proceed identically without this attribute—generic empathy suffices for the narrative arc as written.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Assure" drives the central action: Aria speaks comfort, and the woman's tears flow harder then yield to peace. This action appears in two beats (initial comfort, final smile) and defines the arc, yet it carries no dramatized cost or complication—reassurance succeeds immediately without friction, making the action essential but low-stakes.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The hearing aid is introduced early as Aria's method, emits a gentle hum, and guides her through pulses. It appears in three beats (discovery mention, tracking, fading at end) but its mechanics remain vague—how she listens, what the pulses reveal, or how they direct her is told not shown. It shapes attempts in concept but not in tactical pressure; a generic psychic beacon could replace it with minimal rewrites.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium at twilight is established in the opening line and sustained through fog, hush, and the mist clearing as Aria speaks. It appears in setup, middle, and closure, yet it does not constrain choice—Aria's approach and the woman's acceptance are unaffected by the environment. The mist-clearing mirrors theme but does not impose cost or alter tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"When the dead call" is mentioned once in the opening as background lore ("a phenomenon she had grown accustomed to") but does not tighten decisions or impose a live clock. The timeframe remains abstract—twilight descends, but no urgency or temporal cost shapes Aria's actions or the woman's response.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"To protect vulnerable voices" and "keep memories alive" are stated as Aria's motivation in the final third, but no on-page choice dramatizes friction between this desire and competing costs. The motivation is told, not tested—Aria pursues comfort without obstacle or trade-off, making it ornamental rather than causally active.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Reeling hush" is named twice (setup and final third) and the prose sustains quiet, mist-swirled atmosphere throughout. Tone remains static—gentle, mystical, somber—without modulation under pressure or sharpening at closure. The phrase charges mood but does not charge the final image with additional cost or reconfigured meaning, leaving it functional but mid-band.</comment>
