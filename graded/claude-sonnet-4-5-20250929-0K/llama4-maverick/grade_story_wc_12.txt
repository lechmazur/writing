<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The priest remains an abstract vessel throughout—eyes closed, fingers moving "deftly," no embodied contradiction or micro-choice under pressure. Interiority consists of label-only states ("his awareness was acute") without specificity or internal conflict. The final smile and knowledge that "his work was done" arrive as declaration rather than earned transformation with visible cost. No competing impulses act simultaneously; the character floats through the ritual without genuine struggle or foreclosed options.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural attempted but underdelivered. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive by the opening lines, waiving that penalty. The closure unit—"the stillness...was beginning to unravel" followed by the priest's satisfaction—asserts completion without demonstrating a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with legible cost on the page. The "possession...averted" appears as summary two paragraphs before the end, undercutting closure immediacy. No meaningful tightening or pattern break reweights the dominant stake; the ritual proceeds in a single register from start to finish. Cost is claimed ("he had played a small part") but never shown through a forfeited option or felt price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dimensional anchor, sandalwood/myrrh scent, and loop pedal establish place and tool early. However, the environment remains static postcard description—no spatial choreography, no evolving constraints. The palette's single blue color is mentioned three times but never handled or used to alter a tactic. Sensory hierarchy is absent; the POV does not filter details through professional or personal priority, and no setting element constrains a choice or charges the final image, capping the score below 7.0 per the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"unravel the stillness" and avert possession—is signaled early but never tested by reversal or tightening choice. The ritual proceeds in a single upward curve without narrowed options, trade-offs, or visible cost. Agency is limited to continued performance; no decision forecloses a path. The possession threat is resolved off-page ("had been averted") in summary, denying closure its earned cost. No escalation under the Accumulative lens; the soundscape "built to a crescendo" describes intensity without altering tactics or knowledge.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme of "illuminating hidden assumptions" is stated three times but never dramatized through specific conflict or image. The blue palette, silence-as-presence, and "muffled clarity" are offered as symbols without constraining choice or accumulating into a non-literal answer. The final paragraph moralizes: "he had illuminated hidden assumptions and revealed the underlying truths"—a thematic echo that replaces earned resonance with declaration (−0.6). No insight emerges from experience; the priest's satisfaction is asserted, not shown through particulars that reweight prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with no head-hopping. However, perceptual signature is generic: "the air was heavy," "the whispers grew louder," recycled across beats without character-specific bias. Diction drifts into abstract elevation ("underlying currents," "palpable force," "essence of the divine") that clashes with immediate sensory experience. Template cadence in the middle third: "The priest's eyes were closed...The priest's use...The priest's fingers" across adjacent paragraphs (−0.4). Filter verbs ("seemed to") cluster without voice motivation. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "the whispers...were loud" / "the whispers...grew louder" / "the whispers...grew louder still" repeats the same content without added pressure (−0.2). Template stems: "The priest's [noun]" opens five sentences in close succession (−0.4). Synonym churn: "unravel the stillness" / "to create a sense of tension and release" / "the stillness...was beginning to unravel" cycle without advancing cause/effect (−0.3). Stock metaphors: "thread by thread," "veil of their everyday perceptions," "web of sound" (−0.3). These artifacts dull the closure image, escalating the Q7 penalty to −1.2 total and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The loop-pedal priest at a dimensional anchor offers a surface-novel juxtaposition, but the premise follows a template: mystic performs ritual to avert disaster, succeeds without complication. Emotional and plot arc are generic—no transformation test failure because substituting "exorcist / altar / demon" would not alter structure or stakes. The blue palette and silence motifs are mentioned but not made specific through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. No bold risk heightens coherence; the piece retreats to abstraction ("essence of the divine") rather than committing to concrete implication.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>The loop pedal priest is present throughout but makes no key choice that alters tactics. His ritual proceeds uninterrupted from start to finish; no reversal or tightening traces to his decision. Observation and performance dominate; agency is absent. Missing development and closure participation per the gate model, capping at 2.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The artist's palette with one color appears in three separate beats (opening, middle, near-end) but is never handled or used—only described as lying at his feet and seeming to glow. No causal pressure; swappable with any other static object. Meets setup and recurrence but lacks development and closure linkage, capping below 4.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Unraveled stillness" is named in the opening paragraph, referenced in the middle ("unravel the stillness"), and claimed resolved near the end. It frames the stake but does not constrain a tactic or choice on the page—no before/after shift in options. Present in setup and payoff but purely thematic, landing mid-band per the rubric.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Decorates with silence" appears once as description: "he decorated the space around him with silence." No action is enabled or constrained by this trait; it functions as metaphor without cost or tactical consequence. Label-only mention, missing development and closure gates, capping below 3.0.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Plumb" appears once as a verb: "plumping the depths of the human experience" (likely a typo for "plumbing"). No turn traces to this action; it describes ongoing process rather than a decision point. Easily swappable with "explore" or "seek." Functional mention but replaceable, capping at 3.8.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Through rhetorical devices" is stated twice as method ("Through rhetorical devices, he wove a narrative"; "his use of rhetorical devices became more pronounced") but the mechanics never appear on the page—no example of metaphor, allegory, or speech shaping a beat. Summary-only use without dramatization or causal role, missing all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The dimensional anchor is named in the opening line, described as a place "where the fabric of reality was thin," and mentioned again in the final third. It provides setting framing but does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that affects outcome. Present in setup and payoff; micro-setting potential unrealized, landing mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.3</grade><comment>"Before the possession completes" appears once, two paragraphs before the end, as summary: "Before the possession completes, the priest had acted." No live clock tightens decisions or alters tactics on the page. Time is vague throughout; the ritual's duration and urgency are untethered. Late arrival, summary-only, missing development, capping below 4.0.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"To illuminate hidden assumptions" is stated as motivation in the opening third and restated verbatim in the final paragraph. The priest's actions align with this goal, but no friction arises between want and cost—no dramatized choice where this desire competes with another value. Told rather than shown through conflicted micro-choices, landing below 5.0.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Muffled clarity" is named explicitly in the middle third and again in the final sentence. The tone is coherent—abstract, reverential, distanced—but does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image through contrast or shift. Static mood throughout; no cadence break at closure. Present in setup and payoff, functional but not transformative, mid-band.</comment>
