<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The protagonist remains fundamentally passive—he walks, observes, touches a lock—but never makes a choice that forecloses an option or reveals values under pressure. Interiority consists of atmospheric abstractions ("weight of his father's legacy," "desire to thread the labyrinth") rather than embodied contradiction. The line "before they found the bodies" dangles without dramatized cost or consequence, reading as mood rather than earned tension. No visible stake crystallizes into a decision with felt price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test applied: who/where/when anchors arrive by the opening paragraph, but the Drive Lens remains ambiguous throughout—touches of accumulative texture clash with attempted causal pressure ("driven to uncover them all") that never narrows options. No on-page closure: the boy stands at a locked door contemplating possibilities; no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing occurs. The final phrase "before they found the bodies" introduces a timeframe element without dramatizing its cost or integrating it causally. Lens ambiguity at closure triggers −0.4 and cap at 7.2; absent closure lands the score in the 3–4 band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse prison, reef, lattice, and copperlight are vivid and consistent, but none constrains a choice or charges the ending image—the boy merely walks and observes. Spatial choreography is clear (door → corridor → metal door) yet the environment functions as backdrop rather than pressure. The Q3 9+ gate (environment/object constrains choice or charges closure) is not met, capping eligibility at 8.8; actual execution remains mid-band due to lack of tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>A dominant stake is declared ("uncover the truth") but never tested on the page—no reversal, tightening, or choice narrows options. The boy's journey is a tourist walk without agency: he notices scuffs, touches a lock, and stops. The phrase "before they found the bodies" suggests urgency but is never linked to a tactic or cost. No escalation under any lens; pressure is asserted rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme is asserted through abstractions ("legacy," "impossibilities," "thread the labyrinth") rather than earned from concrete choices. The copperlight lattice recurs but does not reweight prior material at closure; the final image is a static tableau. The closing "before they found the bodies" adds no thematic repricing—it simply hangs. No resonant answer emerges from particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Single-POV narration remains stable and the perceptual signature is consistent ("heavy with the scent of salt and decay," "copperlight repose"), but psychic distance drifts into expository abstraction ("driven by a desire to uncover the truth") that tells rather than shows thought under pressure. No dialogue present; filter verbs ("could feel," "seemed to") appear frequently but remain voice-coherent. The prose exhibits template cadence ("As he walked… As he stood… And as he walked") across multiple beats, triggering −0.4 in Q7 without bleeding here.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Template-cadence runs ("As he approached… As he walked… As he stood… And as he walked") appear in at least four opening positions, triggering −0.4 to −0.6. Paraphrase loops recur: "thread the labyrinth" appears three times in identical phrasing; "seeking to uncover" and "driven to uncover" in adjacent paragraphs. Stock metaphors ("specter," "whispered secret," "weight of the unknown") and filter-verb stacks ("could feel," "seemed to," "felt himself") dull immediacy in peak beats. Cumulative artifact penalty totals −1.2 in Q7; baseline 5.3 minus deductions = 4.1.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The cry-wolf-boy's-son premise offers a narrative hook, but the execution remains atmospheric wandering without transformation of the trope or earned inflection. "Chasing hush" and "thread the labyrinth" read as prompt echoes rather than lived particulars. The lighthouse-prison and lattice-from-confessional are vivid but function as mood tokens, easily swapped for any gothic setting. No fresh turn or synthesis; the story could be retitled and relocated without altering its emotional arc (which itself never completes).</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>The cry-wolf-boy's son is present throughout but makes no decision that alters tactics or stakes. He walks, observes, and touches a lock—all passive actions. The character label carries thematic potential (legacy of lies) but is never dramatized in a choice. Present at setup, ornamental in development, absent from any closure turn. Late-pattern artifact (label-only trait) −0.3; swappability −0.5; lands low in the functional-but-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The confessional lattice appears at setup ("lattice from a confessional… casting copperlight repose"), recurs mid-story ("seemed to sustain impossibilities," "seemed to glow"), and frames the final paragraph ("copperlight repose… seemed to settle around him"), meeting the two-beat minimum and lyric reprise. However, it never constrains a choice or is handled/used—it remains descriptive backdrop. Lyric-resonance allowance permits 5.5–6.3 when the return reweights the stake; here the reprise is static mood without cost linkage. Ornamental use −0.7; lands mid-functional band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Chasing hush" appears once as thematic assertion ("chasing the whispers, seeking to uncover the truth") without shaping tactics or altering options. The concept is told rather than enacted—no beat dramatizes silence as obstacle or resource. Mentioned in the second half; no closure participation; swappable with "seeking mystery." Late introduction −0.4; label-only −0.3; swappability −0.6; lands in the ornamental band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Sustains impossibilities" is attributed to the lattice ("seemed to sustain impossibilities, holding the very air together") but remains metaphorical decoration—no on-page action tests or trades on this attribute. Label-only mention without cost or constraint. Swappable with any atmospheric descriptor. Ornamental use −0.8; swappability −0.7; lands below functional threshold.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Hover" appears once ("hovered between the shadows and the faint light") as a spatial metaphor without driving a turn or enabling/constraining movement. The boy walks and stands; hovering is not dramatized as an action that alters tactics. Single ornamental mention; swappable with "lingered" or "moved." One-touch penalty −0.5; ornamental use −0.7; swappability −0.5; lands low-functional.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The narrow door "left ajar" appears at setup ("narrow door left ajar, the wood worn smooth") and is used once (he pushes it open), meeting minimal gate requirements. The "scuffs on the door" recur as a method of glimpsing prior stories ("Through the scuffs on the door, he had caught a glimpse"). However, the mechanics of reading through scuffs are never clarified or tested under pressure—it's asserted, not enacted. Present early +0.4; one beat involvement +0.4; ornamental elaboration −0.6; swappability −0.4; lands functional-but-replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The lighthouse prison and jagged reef anchor the opening and frame the atmosphere consistently. The setting is present at setup, provides spatial structure (door → corridor → metal door), and appears in the final image ("copperlight repose"). However, it never pressures a choice or supplies a resource that alters outcome—the boy's path is unobstructed. Early signal +0.5; spatial coherence +0.4; postcard-level description without tactical constraint −0.8; lands mid-functional.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.2</grade><comment>"Before they found the bodies" appears only in the final third as a dangling assertion with no dramatized urgency, no clock shaping tactics, and no integration with prior beats. The timeframe is not signaled early, does not tighten decisions, and contributes no cost at closure. Late introduction (final third) −0.8; summary-only mention −0.6; no closure participation −0.9 (piggyback cameo); lands near-absent.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"To thread a labyrinth with your own story" is stated twice as desire ("felt an overwhelming urge to thread this labyrinth," "his desire to thread the labyrinth… grew stronger") but never tested or conflicted—the boy simply walks without encountering friction between want and cost. Told-only motivation without dramatized choice. Present at setup +0.3; two mentions across beats +0.5; no causal pressure or cost linkage −0.9; swappability −0.5; lands low-functional.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Copperlight repose" anchors tone at setup ("copperlight repose over the space") and recurs in the final paragraph ("copperlight repose of the lattice seemed to settle around him"), creating lyric coherence. However, the tone remains static—calm contemplation throughout—without modulation under pressure or tonal shift that charges the ending. Lyric reprise +0.6; early signal +0.4; static mood without peak modulation −0.7; lands functional but one-note.</comment>
