<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The revolutionary-turned-archaeologist has clear interiority and a consistent scholarly drive, but her transformation from "fiery voice" to chronicler feels asserted rather than embodied through on-page contradictions. Embodied emotion is sparse—"burnished sorrow" repeats as a label without varied physical manifestation under pressure. The final choice to continue her work registers as Earned Stasis, but the cost is conceptual (loneliness, isolation) rather than a visible forfeiture that we watch unfold in a key beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the shard discovery seeds a project that deepens through reflection and verse-writing, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration where the protagonist is "reborn as a chronicler." Orientation anchors (baroque asteroid, dim galleries, laboratory) arrive early. The closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (the revolutionary reimagines herself alongside the civilization), but the cost—solitude, the weight of unrecoverable truth—is more asserted ("burnished sorrow") than dramatized in a single pivotal image or choice that forecloses a concrete path.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid with its ornate carvings, labyrinthine passages, and shimmering time-aura is vividly established and recurring. The shard and laboratory workbench anchor micro-setting. The storm and covered mirrors add atmospheric pressure. However, no environmental constraint decisively narrows a tactical choice in a high-pressure beat—the setting frames mood and discovery but does not force a tradeoff or enable a key turn.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—unlocking the asteroid's true history and resolving the dispute with colleagues—is signaled early and sustained. The shard discovery provides one meaningful tightening (a potential key to the truth), and her persistence through the storm deepens commitment. However, no on-page reversal or escalating cost (a colleague's interference, a resource limit, a discovery that challenges her thesis) tests her commitment with a visible trade-off. The ending crystallizes her new identity, but the path there accumulates rather than escalates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—transformation through loss, the act of reimagining as solace—emerges from the protagonist's shift from revolutionary to chronicler and the recurring shard/verse imagery. "Burnished sorrow" and the covered-mirrors ritual gesture toward comfort in uncertainty. The final paragraph offers a resonant close: she reimagines not just a civilization but herself, finding "beauty, sorrow, and hope." Yet the ending risks mild thematic summary ("it was not just the civilization...but herself") that edges toward statement rather than pure image, and the shard as talisman feels slightly ornamental in the last beats.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with a literary, elevated register that fits an archaeologist-poet. The prose carries a consistent baroque texture (e.g., "burnished sorrow," "river of fire"). However, diction occasionally tilts toward ornamental abstraction ("tantalizing prospect," "weight of her task") without micro-variation under shifting emotional pressure. No dialogue appears to test voice distinction. Psychic distance is controlled, but the narration's uniform elevation slightly flattens urgency in peak moments (storm, shard analysis).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and sentences are generally clear, but several paraphrase loops and synonym chains dull density: "to reimagine, to rewrite…to uncover," "to reimagine, to recreate, and to rediscover," "the burnished sorrow" recurs without new embodiment. Template cadence appears in strings like "As she turned…As she stood…As she made her way…As she worked…As the storm…" Filter-verb stacks ("she realized," "she felt," "she knew") cluster without pressure gain. These artifacts do not obscure causality but reduce propulsion and information density, especially in the final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of defunct revolutionary, baroque asteroid, visible time, and poetic archaeology offers a fresh premise. The covered-mirrors ritual and the "burnished sorrow" motif add specificity. However, the emotional arc—loss channeled into scholarly devotion—follows a familiar template (warrior-to-chronicler), and key beats (shard discovery, storm, notebook completion) resolve predictably without a non-obvious turn. The piece commits to its premise but does not transform it with a surprising inflection or moral calculus.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The defunct revolutionary is named early and her shift to archaeologist frames the premise. She kneels to retrieve the shard (one choice), works through the storm, and closes her notebook at the end (stance crystallization). However, no on-page decision forces a trade-off or alters tactics—her actions accumulate rather than pivot. She observes and persists, but does not face a fork where revolutionary identity conflicts with scholarly method. Mid-band: present across beats, but choices do not create key turns.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The crystal vase shard is handled in three distinct beats: discovery and retrieval, analysis at the workbench, and presence in the final closure image as "talisman" and "symbol of her journey." Its facets reflect light and its secrets "slowly yield," tying it to the protagonist's project. It shapes the middle (drives her laboratory work) and charges the ending (sits on her desk as reminder). However, the shard's properties do not constrain a specific tactical choice or enable a turn—its role is more lyric anchor than causal lever. Solid integration, but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The archaeological dispute with colleagues is mentioned early as context and recurs as her driving question. The shard is framed as "the key to unlocking the truth" in that dispute. However, the dispute itself never materializes on the page—no colleague confronts her, no evidence challenges her interpretation, no tactical choice arises from the conflict. It shapes her motivation (to prove her thesis) but does not alter on-page options or create friction. Functional stake-framing, but one-dimensional.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Poetically inclined" is stated early and returns throughout: she fills a notebook with verse, seeks to "capture the essence," and her words flow "like a river of fire." However, the trait is demonstrated only through summary ("her notebook filled with verse") rather than a specific on-page moment where poetic perception constrains a choice or incurs cost (e.g., choosing metaphor over clarity, losing colleagues' respect). Label-heavy, minimal dramatization.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Devise" appears twice: she must "devise a way to properly analyze" the shard, and later "continue to devise, to create, and to reimagine." The action frames her method (analysis, verse-writing) and recurs in the ending. However, no major turn hinges on devising—her problem-solving occurs off-stage, summarized as "the shard's secrets slowly yielding to her persistence." The verb fits her scholarly identity but does not define a pivotal beat. Swappable with "create" or "discover" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Covering mirrors during storms is mentioned once in the middle ("her colleague…had once espoused the method") as a quaint ritual, then returns at the end ("the mirrors covered") as atmospheric detail during her work. It gestures toward the theme of comfort in uncertainty but does not shape tactics or constrain a choice. The method is observed, not enacted in a way that alters outcome. Present in closure paragraph, but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid with its dim galleries, ornate carvings, labyrinthine passages, and shimmering time-aura is established early and recurring. It supplies the shard, frames her solitary work, and houses her laboratory. The storm and covered mirrors add pressure. The asteroid is her "home" by the end, integral to her reimagining project. However, no architectural feature or resource limit forces a tactical choice in a key beat. Strong atmospheric integration, but the setting does not narrow options or enable a turn.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"After time became visible" is introduced early as a world rule: time appears as a "shimmering aura," and inhabitants report objects moving and a feeling of being watched. The visible time recurs ("time itself had become visible") but does not constrain a choice or create urgency—no clock tightens her decisions, no temporal anomaly complicates her work. The concept adds flavor but does not shape tactics. Present in setup and world-building, absent from escalation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"To reimagine an entire civilization" is stated explicitly and sustained: she seeks to "rewrite its history," "distill its history into a narrative," and ultimately reimagines both the civilization and herself. The motivation drives her shard analysis and verse-writing. However, the desire is told and reiterated more than dramatized through a moment where reimagining conflicts with another want (e.g., accuracy vs. poetry, collaboration vs. solitude). The final paragraph delivers thematic payoff, but friction between want and cost is implied rather than staged.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>"Burnished sorrow" is named twice and its synonyms recur: "weight of her task," "sorrow that…found solace," "beauty, of sorrow, and of hope." The tone is consistent and fits the elegiac mood. It modulates slightly—early melancholy deepens to "sense of accomplishment" tempered by sorrow at the end. However, the phrase itself is abstract and repeated without varied embodiment; under peak pressure (storm, analysis), the prose does not shift cadence or diction to charge the emotion. Coherent but static, trending mid-band.</comment>
