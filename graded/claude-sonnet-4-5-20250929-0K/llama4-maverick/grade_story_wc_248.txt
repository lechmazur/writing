<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elian's characterization relies heavily on telling rather than showing—"analytically intuitive mind," "volcanic tenderness"—without embodying these traits through concrete choices under pressure. The motivation (forgotten promise to a friend) remains abstract throughout; no on-page moment dramatizes conflict between this vow and a competing cost. Internal life consists of stock responses ("felt an inexplicable connection," "spark of inspiration") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final gesture of touching the tapestry carries no visible forfeiture or trade-off that would demonstrate character change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The piece offers summary of Elian's artistic process across "days" without dramatizing a single causal beat where a choice narrows options or changes knowledge. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within the opening, avoiding that penalty, but the narrative operates in pure synopsis mode: "set out to create," "began to leave their mark," "the trail grew." No on-page reversal or tightening occurs; the vandalized portrait mystery is declared solved in exposition ("the truth behind the vandalized self-portrait, a tale of love, loss") without any scene showing discovery or cost. Closure form is absent—no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing lands with felt cost on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The archive setting is established early with sensory hooks (aged parchment scent, fluorescent lights, dusty shelves), but remains static decoration throughout. No environmental constraint shapes a choice: Elian moves freely through corridors, creates art without material limits, and the space never pressures tactics. The tapestry fragment and vandalized portrait function as thematic tokens rather than objects that alter action. Spatial choreography is vague—"labyrinthine corridors," "hidden alcove"—without legible distances or access friction that would ground movement or decision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—rescuing the forgotten promise—is declared but never tested on the page. No antagonist, obstacle, or competing desire forces Elian to weigh costs or make a trade-off. The narrative summarizes artistic creation over "days" without a single beat where a reversal tightens options or a resource constraint (time, material, access) alters tactics. The ending announces resolution ("the promise that they had kept") without showing what was risked or paid to achieve it. Escalation is entirely absent; pressure flatlines in continuous summary.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Theme is stated rather than emergent: "the transformative power of art," "the human spirit," "its capacity to create, to love, and to endure." The final paragraphs deliver meta-commentary ("it would be a tale of art, of love") instead of letting image and action carry meaning. The faded tapestry fragment recurs as a declared symbol without accruing pressure or reweighting prior material through specific use. No thematic question is posed in scene, tested under pressure, or answered by the protagonist's final stance—only asserted in retrospective narration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction carries some texture—"volcanic tenderness," "analytically intuitive"—but these phrases read as imposed labels rather than voice-motivated particulars. Register drifts into abstract philosophizing at closure: "the enduring power of art," "the unbreakable bonds that tie us to the past." Psychic distance collapses into summary mode for the bulk of the narrative, flattening immediacy. No dialogue appears. Perceptual signature is generic; Elian's noticing lacks character-specific bias or rhythm that would distinguish this focalization.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "one that had driven Elian," "one that spoke to the very heart," "one that only Elian could hear" recycle syntax without adding pressure. Template cadence dominates the middle: "With each new piece... As the days passed... As the final piece." Stock metaphors clutter peak beats: "heart still ablaze," "whispers of the past," "canopy of light in the dark expanse." Sentence openings repeat ("The," "As," "With") across consecutive paragraphs. Clarity is adequate but density is low—many lines restate rather than advance. The final third stacks summary sentences that could each be cut without information loss.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Core premise—artist uncovers archive mystery through trail of artworks—follows a familiar template without fresh inflection. "Lending library arsonist" is declared quirky but never integrated into tactics or worldview. The emotional arc (obligation → artistic trail → closure) could transfer unchanged to any forgotten-place setting with any creative protagonist. The vandalized portrait mystery and hidden message are introduced as genre furniture, resolved in exposition, and carry no non-obvious moral calculus. No risk-taking in structure or perspective; the piece hedges toward safe, mid-range choices at every turn.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Lending library arsonist" is mentioned once in the opening but never constrains or enables a choice. No on-page action ties to this trait; Elian's archive work shows no arsonist methodology, no tension between destruction and preservation instincts, no friction with the role. Label-only presence.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The tapestry fragment appears in three beats: first sighting, recurring theme in Elian's art, final touch. Setup and closure participation are present, but the middle "recurring" use is told in summary without showing how its meaning shifts. The final touch is ornamental—no choice depends on the fragment, and its symbolic charge is asserted rather than dramatized. Functional reprise but swappable with any other recurring image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>The vandalized self-portrait is introduced at midpoint, drives Elian's artistic investigation in summary, and appears in the final alcove message—but no scene shows Elian discovering who defaced it, why, or at what cost. The concept is thematically present but does not constrain a single on-page choice or tactic. Summary-only development.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.4</grade><comment>"Analytically intuitive" is a descriptor attached to Elian in one sentence. No beat shows this trait enabling a deduction or constraining an approach; the investigation is summarized without puzzle-solving moments where intuition competes with analysis. Label without embodied trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Portray" appears in Elian's desire to portray the vandalism story, but the action of portrayal is summarized ("began to leave their mark," "trail of artistic creations grew") rather than dramatized. One mid-story beat ties to this action, but it remains generic—"using charcoal, paint, and found objects"—and could be swapped for "investigate," "document," or "interpret" with minor edits. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>The trail leading to a hidden message is announced early, summarized during the creative process, and declared complete at the end. Setup and closure mention present, but mechanics never matter—no beat shows how a clue constrains the next piece, how the initiated would follow it, or what cost the method imposes. Present as plot furniture but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The lost civilization archive frames the opening, supplies the vandalized portrait and tapestry, and hosts the final alcove. It enables discovery and provides objects, shaping two beats (entry and ending). However, the setting does not constrain Elian's movements or creative process; access is frictionless and materials unlimited. Functional across setup and closure but does not pressure tactics in the middle.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>"After going off the grid" is mentioned in the opening and closing but does not function as a live timeframe. No ticking clock, no pressure from limited remaining time off-grid, no trade-off between staying hidden and completing the task. The phrase colors tone but does not alter decisions.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The forgotten promise to a long-lost archaeologist friend is named in the opening, drives Elian's presence in the archive, and returns at closure. Setup and closure participation present, but the promise never competes with a cost or alternative desire in a middle beat. Told as backstory motive rather than dramatized through conflicted choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Volcanic tenderness" appears twice as a phrase but does not modulate through the narrative. The tone remains at one register—earnest, reflective summary—without eruption or intimate softness in scene. No coherent tonal arc; the descriptor is applied rather than embodied in rhythm or image.</comment>
