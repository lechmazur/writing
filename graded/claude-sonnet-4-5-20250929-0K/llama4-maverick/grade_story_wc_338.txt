<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivations are declared but not tested by contradictory impulses in scene. Her "methodically curious approach" and "shielded openness" remain labels without visible tradeoffs under pressure. The ending promises transformation ("she had discovered a language that spoke directly to her soul") but this change is told through abstract reflection rather than earned through dramatized cost. Interior experience consists largely of mood and atmosphere rather than embodied, contradictory emotion during key beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; orientation anchors appear by ~120 words. The closure unit—Elara's discovery of the henge's "secrets" and feeling of wholeness—is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant), but the cost is abstract ("fragile" truth, "sense of peace") rather than a visible forfeiture or tactical constraint. The video-comparison method is introduced early but its mechanics and specific findings remain vague ("subtle patterns, almost imperceptible changes"), obscuring what knowledge actually changed. No meaningful tightening occurs; the "findings began to take shape" is summary without on-page revelation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Rain-scoured fresco vault and henge are anchored with vivid sensory detail ("damp earth and mold," "drumming against the vault's stone roof"). The henge constrains Elara's method (comparing footage) and charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate requirement. However, spatial choreography inside the vault remains vague—where Elara stands, moves, or sets up equipment is untracked. The "spot where a map tears" is metaphorical rather than a literal spatial constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncovering the henge's secrets—is signaled early. However, no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; Elara faces no reversal, obstacle, or cost that narrows her options. The video footage "yields its secrets" without resistance, and the "threshold" moment is metaphorical rather than a dramatized choice under pressure. Agency is observational rather than decisional; no path is foreclosed with visible cost. The accumulative lens allows for deepening through density, but the findings remain abstract and the ending grants satisfaction without trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme of silence, listening, and hidden truths is stated overtly ("to interpret silence with empathy," "discovered a language that spoke directly to her soul") rather than emerging through specific events. The final paragraph moralizes: "The world, it seemed, was full of secrets waiting to be uncovered." The whispered chapel and torn map function as symbolic conveniences without constraining choice or charging closure through prior particulars. No non-literal answer arises from the action; instead, Elara articulates the theme in prompt-like language.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent but generic—Elara notices atmosphere and emotion in broad strokes rather than character-specific bias. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("eerie stillness," "siren call," "resonating within her") that feels authorial rather than filtered through a cartographer's lens. No dialogue appears. Sentence rhythm is steady but syntactically uniform; most paragraphs open with subject-verb or "as she" constructions.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn are pervasive: "secrets hidden" recurs five times; "whispered chapel" and "henge" are mechanically alternated without functional distinction. Template cadence dominates: runs of "Elara felt/knew/sought" across adjacent sentences. Figurative language clusters without payoff: "threshold," "gateway," "boundary," "edge" all describe the same metaphorical moment. Stock phrases ("hidden in plain sight" twice, "sense of wonder," "siren call") flatten texture. Information density is low; most sentences restate mood or reiterate Elara's task without advancing knowledge or choice. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("carried the henge's whispers with her"), triggering the −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Core premise—analyzing silent video to uncover ancient secrets—is functional but not transformed through specific lived detail or non-obvious stakes. The "whispered chapel" and "map tears" remain atmospheric labels rather than plot-altering particulars. Emotional arc (skepticism → reverence → peace) follows a predictable template. The ending hedges with universals ("the world was full of secrets") instead of committing to a specific vision. No bold risk-taking or fresh synthesis; the piece reads as a competent execution of a generic "archaeologist discovers meaning" frame.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout but her choices do not create key turns. She observes, compares footage, and feels emotions; no on-page decision alters tactics or forecloses a path. Present but not causally active at closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Henge appears in setup, middle (as the object of study), and closure (Elara will return to it). It frames the task and charges the final image with "whispers." However, it is not handled or physically interacted with across distinct beats; Elara stands before it and reflects. Causal role is moderate—it enables the investigation but does not narrow options.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Whispered chapel" is mentioned as local legend and atmospheric motif but does not shape stakes or tactics on the page. It recurs at closure ("whispered chapel's siren call") as thematic echo, not a choice constraint. Ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Methodically curious" is label-only; no on-page action demonstrates a tradeoff between method and intuition, or curiosity enabling/constraining a choice. Mentioned in the opening as character summary.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Reopen the henge's secrets" is stated as Elara's task in the setup and summarized as accomplished at closure. No discrete action labeled "reopen" drives a turn; the video comparison is the method, not the reopening itself. Swappable with "discover" or "uncover" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Video comparison is introduced early and defines Elara's method. It enables the investigation and is mentioned in the middle ("poring over the footage") and at closure ("comparisons began to yield their secrets"). However, its mechanics remain vague—what specific changes did the footage reveal? No on-page choice hinges on a detail only this method could provide. Functional but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Rain-scoured fresco vault anchors setting in the opening, provides sensory detail (rain drumming, damp earth), and is present at closure as Elara exits. Rain and vault constrain the atmosphere and prime the mood but do not alter a tactical choice. Micro-setting (the vault's stone roof, the threshold) contributes texture without forcing a decision.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"The spot where a map tears, dividing known from unknown" appears once as metaphorical threshold, not a timeframe. No live clock or temporal pressure tracks across the piece. Hours pass but do not tighten decisions.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"To interpret silence with empathy" is stated in the opening and recurs thematically ("listen to its silences"). Elara's approach is described but not dramatized through a choice where empathy conflicts with another want or cost. Told motivation without friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Shielded openness" is declared once and coheres with the measured, reflective tone throughout. Tone remains stable rather than modulating with pressure; no moment of vulnerability or defensive closure dramatizes the "shielded" aspect. Static mood with minimal charge at the final image.</comment>
