<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lyra's interiority relies heavily on abstract concepts ("spooled wholeness," "empty spaces remembered") rather than embodied emotion or contradictory impulses acting in scene. Her mentor and the telescope are described but never constrain a present choice; the day's storm tracking and her emotional response remain told rather than dramatized through micro-decisions under pressure. The final "sense of peace" arrives without visible cost or a path foreclosed—no competing desire or renunciation shapes the ending. Motivation is declared ("determined to prove") but never tested on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: who (Lyra), where (sky gondola), and when (evening after a storm) arrive piecemeal across the opening paragraphs without a clear anchor by ~120 words, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4) and capping Q3 at 7.0. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (atmospheric layering, introspection, final mood shift), but no decisive change, renunciation with cost, or conceptual repricing occurs—Lyra ends in "peace" without forfeiting an option or facing a dilemma. The closure unit is absent; the story circles its concepts without a legible before/after with felt cost. Backstory (mentor, telescope inheritance, "spooled wholeness" philosophy) occupies ~30% of the text but remains abstract and does not tilt a present choice or charge the ending image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The sky gondola and brass telescope are named and described with some atmospheric detail ("panoramic windows," "etched patterns"), but neither object constrains a choice or alters Lyra's tactics. Sensory selection is generic ("sea of clouds," "deep, foreboding grey") and lacks POV-specific filtering—no professional meteorological detail shapes what she notices or ignores. Spatial choreography is vague (telescope "in the corner," control panel mentioned but not used), and the setting functions as backdrop rather than pressuring action. The Orientation Test penalty in Q2 caps this category at 7.0; even absent that cap, the setting does not charge the final image or supply a resource that affects outcome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Lyra's desire "to prove that empty spaces remember"—is declared in reflection but never dramatized in a choice or tested by opposition. The storm system she tracks in the opening is mentioned as past ("had left a trail of destruction") and does not exert present pressure. Dr. Zhang's call is a brief check-in that deflates immediately without complication. No reversal, tightening, or deepening occurs; Lyra works alone in introspection, and the clouds "calm" in sympathy with her mood rather than resisting her. The ending grants her "sense of peace" and confirmation ("she had found her calling") without visible cost, renunciation, or a path foreclosed—coincidental mood alignment replaces protagonist agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Spooled wholeness" and "empty spaces remember" are repeated as thematic labels without emerging from concrete events or images. The final paragraph states the theme directly ("to prove that even in the most turbulent of times, there existed a deeper truth") rather than letting it resonate through particulars. The telescope and clouds are mentioned but do not accumulate meaning or shift valence across beats. The ending offers mood rather than a non-literal answer to the central question, and Lyra's internal arc is told rather than inextricable from plot.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping, and psychic distance is consistent. However, diction drifts into elevated abstraction ("quietly explosive power still resonating through the atmosphere," "fabric of reality seemed to unravel") that feels authorial rather than filtered through a meteorologist's professional idiom. The single line of dialogue with Dr. Zhang is functional but generic. Perceptual signature is weak—Lyra's observations ("kaleidoscope of shapes and textures," "dusty starlight tone") read ornamental rather than character-particular. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed," "knew") appear frequently without voice motivation, dulling immediacy in reflective passages.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops appear across adjacent paragraphs: "empty spaces remembered" and "spooled wholeness" are restated multiple times without added detail or pressure (−0.3). Sentence stems repeat: "As she..." opens three paragraphs, "Lyra's..." opens two more, creating template cadence (−0.4). Stock metaphors ("sea of clouds," "twinkling like diamonds," "heart swelled with emotion") reduce specificity in peak reflective beats (−0.3). The final third is heavily abstract ("deeper truth," "perfect clarity," "sense of peace"), and figurative language ("dusty starlight," "spooled wholeness") recurs without payoff or clarity. Information density is low—many sentences restate mood rather than advancing knowledge or choice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Categorizing clouds by emotion" offers a fresh premise, but the piece does not follow its implications—no on-page demonstration of the method shaping a tactical choice or revealing storm behavior. The mentor's legacy and the telescope are setup elements common to bildungsroman templates without transformation. "Spooled wholeness" and "empty spaces remember" read as invented concepts but remain abstract; no specific, irreplaceable detail makes them inevitable. The ending's emotional resolution (peace, calling confirmed) is a stock epiphany arc. The atmospheric sky-gondola setting and the introspective meteorologist show potential but default to meditative summary rather than risk or specificity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Lyra is present throughout and her occupation (aviation meteorologist) frames the setting and her reflections, satisfying the setup gate. However, she makes no on-page decision that alters tactics or narrows options—she tracks a storm (past tense), receives a call, works in her logbook, and gazes through the telescope, all observational. The ending grants her peace and confirmation without a choice or renunciation. Mid-band: present and functional but does not drive a turn.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The brass telescope appears in three beats: described in paragraph 3 ("standing in the corner"), recalled as her mentor's legacy in paragraph 24, and used in paragraph 26 ("raised the telescope to her eye"). It satisfies setup and payoff gates. However, its use is ornamental—Lyra gazes at stars for beauty, and the act does not constrain a choice or resolve a conflict. The mentor connection is told in backstory without present friction. Functional but replaceable with any inherited instrument.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Spooled wholeness" is introduced in paragraph 12 as an abstract term coined by her mentor and restated in paragraph 26 ("felt a sense of spooled wholeness"). It appears only in reflective summary, never shaping an on-page stake or altering Lyra's tactics. The concept is ornamental theme-speak without causal involvement. Present but does not affect choices or momentum.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Quietly explosive" appears once in paragraph 2 to describe the storm system's "power still resonating through the atmosphere." It is label-only description; the trait does not constrain or enable an action, and the storm is already past. No cost or tradeoff tied to this attribute. Mentioned without affecting the narrative.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Memorialize" is named in paragraph 19 ("began to memorialize the storm that had passed") and frames Lyra's logbook work through the middle section. It satisfies setup and development gates and connects to her introspective tone. However, the act is summary rather than dramatized—no scene shows her choosing what to record or sacrificing another option to document. The ending references her calling "to memorialize the beauty of the skies" but does not hinge on this action. Shapes one extended beat but could be replaced with "document" or "observe" without breaking the story.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Categorizing clouds by emotion" is introduced in paragraph 4 as a method taught by her mentor and mentioned again in paragraphs 17 and 24 ("her categorization system allowed her to tap into their moods"). Setup gate satisfied. However, the method is never demonstrated—no scene shows her applying it to make a prediction, choose a course, or resolve a problem. It remains backstory flavor without mechanics or consequence. Present but does not shape attempts or outcome.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The sky gondola is named in the opening line and anchors spatial context (windows, control panel, communication system, telescope in corner). Setup and scattered mentions satisfy presence. However, the setting is passive—it does not pressure Lyra's choices, supply a constraint, or alter tactics. The gondola could be swapped for an observatory or weather station with minor edits. Functional backdrop but does not drive the narrative.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.2</grade><comment>"After the string breaks" appears once in paragraph 9 as a recalled phrase tied to "the ancient myth of the Fates." It is an internal metaphor for moments "when the fabric of reality seemed to unravel," but no on-page event enacts this timeframe—no literal or dramatized "break" occurs, and Lyra's evening unfolds without a visible threshold or clock. Mentioned as concept without affecting timeline or tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to prove that empty spaces remember" is stated in paragraph 10 and restated in paragraphs 11 and 28. It satisfies the setup gate and frames Lyra's thematic concern. However, it remains a told desire—no scene shows her testing this belief, facing doubt, or sacrificing another goal to pursue it. The ending affirms her sense of calling without friction between wants and costs. Declared but not dramatized in conflicted choices.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Dusty starlight" appears as a descriptor in paragraphs 20 and 27, coloring Lyra's handwriting and emotional state. The tone is consistent—reflective, atmospheric, elegiac—and modulates gently from storm aftermath to calm acceptance. It charges the final image ("eyes shining with a sense of dusty starlight") with lyric continuity. However, the tone does not shift under pressure or create tension; it remains a single static mood. Coherent and purposeful but lacks dynamic range.</comment>
