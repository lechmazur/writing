<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Aria is conceived as a label—"esoteric realist," "wanderer"—but her interiority remains abstract and generic. No contradictory impulses act simultaneously; her reverence and resolve are declared rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The final departure reads as a stated conclusion rather than an earned foreclosure with visible cost. Emotional states are summarized ("sense of peace," "sense of resolve") in label-speak without embodied particulars.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Drive lens appears Accumulative/Textural, but no meaningful tightening or cadence shift occurs; the story presents a continuous, static mood rather than escalating density. The Orientation Test passes (who/where/when anchored early), but no on-page closure with felt cost: Aria's departure is merely described as an intention, not a renunciation or shift that forecloses a path. The ending asserts "presence lingered" and "power of the human spirit" without a decisive image that reweights prior material. Closure form is RR-aspirational but lacks the undeniable pressure or visible cost required.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The grotto is vividly described with sensory detail (flowers, insects, light, moss), but functions as postcard setting rather than constraining choice. No environmental feature pressures a decision or alters tactics. The moth wing, though recurring, remains ornamental; it is held and gazed upon but does not enable or complicate any action. Spatial choreography is clear, and the verdant imagery is evocative, yet setting remains decorative rather than causal.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—honoring overlooked histories—is declared but never tested on the page. Aria faces no opposition, makes no trade-off, and encounters no reversal; she builds structures and departs without narrowing options or paying a visible price. Escalation is absent: the story proceeds in a single affirmative register from meditative opening to meditative close. No agency decision forecloses a path, and coincidence does not even appear to complicate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Theme (memory, transience, honoring lost stories) is overtly stated rather than emergent: "power of memory," "overlooked histories," "transient and eternal." The final paragraph moralizes directly ("power of the human spirit to create, to connect, and to honor") instead of offering a resonant image. No conceptual repricing occurs; the moth wing glows with "otherworldly light" as decorative symbol, not as a charged object that reweights prior material. Subtext is minimal; ideas are presented as exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, and the perceptual filter is consistent (reverent, meditative). However, the prose voice is generic literary-elevated rather than character-particular; diction ("benediction," "esoteric realist," "blushing stillness") reads as imposed aesthetic rather than Aria's idiom. No dialogue appears. Modesty calibration holds, but the narration lacks a distinct perceptual signature—what Aria notices and how she processes it do not reveal her specific mind under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Prose is grammatically clean but marred by pervasive scaffold and loops. Paraphrase chains appear throughout: "sense of peace…sense of connection…sense of pride…sense of purpose…sense of reverence…sense of resolve" (six "sense of" constructions). Synonym churn on "fragile," "ephemeral," "transient," "temporary" recurs without added meaning. Register drifts into elevated literary ("benediction," "suspended animation") without voice motivation. Template cadence in final third: "Aria felt…Aria felt…Aria knew…Aria turned." Artifacts dull closure and trigger −1.2 in Q7; disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Core premise (artist honors lost histories via ephemeral land art in a cloud grotto) is thematically generic and structurally static. The migration of the last monarch butterfly is mentioned as backstory flavor but does not drive choice. No fresh inflection or non-obvious synthesis; the story could swap character names and setting without altering its emotional arc (transformation test fails). The moth wing and thread-knotting are gestural rather than causal. Elevated diction and abstract theme statements replace lived specificity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Aria ("esoteric realist") is present throughout but makes no on-page choices that create turns. She sits, observes, works, and departs in a single affirmative arc. Setup and closure presence are met, but middle development shows no decision that alters tactics. The character is ornamental to the premise rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The moth wing appears in three beats: lands on hand, rests during work, clutched at departure. Setup and closure presence are met, but the object remains static—a symbol gazed upon rather than a constraint or tool that enables or complicates action. Lyric reprise without middle causal pressure; swappable with any small natural token.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>1.2</grade><comment>"Interrupted cadence" appears once as description of insect wings and echoes in the final reflection. It does not shape stakes, alter tactics, or constrain choice. Thematic mention only; no on-page pressure tied to this concept.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Transiently rooted" is stated once in paragraph four as backstory label ("She was transiently rooted in this place, a wanderer"). It does not enable or constrain an on-page action; the trait is told rather than dramatized through a tradeoff or visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Aria knots thread in paragraph eight and the action is described with reverence, occupying several lines. Setup and development presence are met. However, the knotting does not turn the plot or redefine options; it is one activity among others (building structures) without unique causal weight. Swappable with weaving or arranging without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Building temporary structures appears in setup (paragraph nine), development (Aria works, structures stand), and closure (structures remain as testament). The method is described and its purpose (signals for followers) is stated. However, the mechanics do not constrain a choice or alter an outcome; the structures are presented as accomplished fact rather than process under pressure. Functional but replaceable memorial activity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The verdant grotto above the clouds is established early and described richly throughout. It provides atmosphere and sensory texture but does not pressure a choice or supply a resource that affects outcome. Postcard setting; no tactical constraint or micro-setting feature that alters Aria's moves.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"During the migration of the last monarch butterfly" is mentioned once in backstory (paragraph four) as the occasion when Aria found the grotto. The timeframe does not tighten a decision, create urgency, or track on the page. Vague historical marker without causal weight.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Motivation to honor overlooked histories is stated multiple times (paragraphs six, seven, eighteen, twenty) but never dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost. Aria's desire is declared and affirmed without friction or trade-off. Told-only motivation without on-page test.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Blushing stillness" appears once (paragraph thirteen) as atmospheric description and the tone of reverent quietude is sustained throughout. However, tone remains static; no modulation with pressure or cadence shift that reweights the stake. Coherent but one-note mood without dynamic charge at the final image.</comment>
