<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The collector remains abstract—she is "modestly fearless" by declaration but we see no contradictory impulses or embodied cost in her choices. The young woman's spectral confession unfolds without resistance or complication; the collector's presence simply "calms" energy with no visible internal struggle or hierarchy of values. Interiority is mostly told through generic phrases ("sense of satisfaction," "pang of curiosity") rather than character-particular perception. The crocodile's tooth appears as a described object rather than a choice-point that tests the collector's motives or methods.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early and remain stable. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the collector walks, listens, hums counterpoint, and the woman's spirit dissipates—pressure accumulates through sensory layering rather than because/therefore causality. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the woman's energy fades, the collector turns to pursue the next soul), but the cost is abstract: no visible forfeiture, no choice that forecloses a path on the page. The ending restates the opening frame ("quiet once more," "until the next collector came") without reweighting prior material or charging the final image with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Echo Gorge supplies vivid sensory anchors—mist at ankles, damp earth, waterfall, distorted harp notes—and spatial choreography is clear throughout. The setting provides atmosphere but does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; the collector moves freely and the environment never complicates her task. The crocodile's tooth and harp are described rather than handled in ways that change options. Micro-setting (body, tool, recurring object) does not charge the final image, capping the 9-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—guiding a trapped soul to peace—is signaled early but never tightens or deepens through a meaningful reversal. The collector approaches, listens, hums, and the woman's energy dissipates without resistance, trade-off, or visible cost. No escalation under the Accumulative lens: the harp's discordant notes grow louder, then the collector's counterpoint calms them—opposition vanishes rather than narrows options. Agency is observation and presence rather than a decision or renunciation that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme—"integrate laughter into healing," "luminous ache"—is stated directly in late paragraphs rather than emerging from concrete events or a charged final image. The collector's motivation to find "joy in the sorrow" is told ("she had discovered") instead of dramatized through a micro-choice or trade-off. The crocodile's tooth and the woman's confession could serve thematic resonance but remain plot tokens; the ending does not reweight them in a non-literal way. No symbolic or motif pattern constrains choice or accumulates pressure toward closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on the collector; no head-hopping. Diction is mostly consistent, though occasional phrases ("modestly fearless," "luminous ache," "integrate laughter into healing") drift toward prompt-label register rather than the collector's voice. The woman's dialogue is absent (all is "spectral confession" summarized), so no voice distinction test applies. Perceptual signature is generic—"eyes scanned," "heart beating"—without character-specific bias. Under pressure (the woman's trapped spirit), the prose does not modulate rhythm or compress; it remains at the same descriptive distance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Several paraphrase loops and template-cadence runs appear: "The collector's eyes locked onto the tooth… the collector listened intently… the collector reached out… the collector smiled… the collector felt… the collector's presence… the collector's footsteps… the collector's motivation." Filter-verb stacks cluster in the second half ("felt," "learned," "listened," "turned to pursue"). Figurative language is sparse but some metaphors are stock ("mist swirled," "balm," "beacon of hope"). Information density is low; many sentences restate the frame ("the collector guided souls," "the gorge was quiet") without adding new pressure. The final third repeats the opening mood without reweighting it, and the crocodile's tooth is "forgotten" in a tell rather than shown through an image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The premise—soul collector in a haunted gorge—follows a familiar template without transformation through specific world logic or moral calculus. The spectral confession, misaligned harp, and crocodile's tooth are named but not integrated into a non-obvious synthesis; they could be swapped with other tokens (a locket, a flute) without altering character arc or stakes. The ending restates the frame ("echo gorge was quiet once more, until the next collector came") rather than offering a fresh inflection or risk-taking structural choice. Emotional honesty is present but surfaces remain median.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The lost soul collector is present throughout and frames the narrative, but her choices do not create key turns—she observes, approaches, listens, hums, and the woman's spirit dissipates without resistance or a decision that alters tactics. Setup and development gates are met (she is named and acts in the middle), but closure participation is ornamental: she "turned to pursue the next lost soul" without a causal link to prior pressure. The role is functional but replaceable with any guide archetype; no specific cost or irreplaceable property is demonstrated on the page.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The crocodile's tooth appears once in the middle third as a described object ("now visible in the woman's hand") and once at the end as a static image ("lay forgotten"). It is not handled, does not constrain a choice, and its presence does not alter tactics or charge the closure. No reprise that reweights meaning; it is mentioned, then left behind. Swappable with any token keepsake. Late arrival (well past the first third) and ornamental use cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Spectral confessions are named as the collector's task and the woman's story "spilled out," but the confession itself is summarized ("a tale of love and loss") rather than dramatized. The concept shapes the premise but does not narrow options or create a tactical choice on the page—the collector simply listens and the woman's energy fades. Setup gate is met (task is named early), development is summary-only, and closure participation is indirect (the confession has already occurred before the ending beat). Functional but replaceable with "psychic counseling" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Modestly fearless" is declared in paragraph four ("She was modestly fearless, having grown accustomed") but never constrains or enables an on-page action with cost. The collector moves without hesitation or visible trade-off; no moment tests the balance of modesty and fearlessness. Label-only mention without a dramatized beat. No setup in the opening, no middle choice linked to the trait, and no closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Pursue" appears in the final third ("turned to pursue the next lost soul") and is implied throughout as the collector walks and searches. It shapes the frame and minor beats (she follows the harp sound, approaches the woman) but does not create a major turn or redefine options at closure—the pursuit is ongoing rather than a decisive act that forecloses a path. Setup gate is met (she steps into the gorge to collect souls), development is present (she approaches the woman), but the ending pursuit is a restatement of the opening frame without escalation. Swappable with "collect," "guide," or "seek."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The misaligned harp appears in the middle third, its distorted notes signal the woman's presence, and the collector hums a counterpoint to calm the spirit. Mechanics matter in one beat (the counterpoint soothes), meeting the development gate, but the method is not signaled in setup and does not return or reweight at closure—the harp's notes "grew fainter" and are then "a distant memory." Functional in one causal turn but not indispensable; the collector could hum without the harp's prior presence. Late signal and no closure reprise cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Echo Gorge is named in the opening line and anchors sensory details (mist, damp earth, waterfall) throughout. It provides atmosphere and a search space but does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—the collector moves freely and the environment never complicates her task. The final paragraph restates "the echo gorge was quiet once more," meeting closure participation via lyric reprise, but the gorge itself does not reweight the dominant stake. Setup, development (middle beats in the gorge), and a weak closure reprise are present, but no causal pressure or visible cost tied to the setting's unique properties.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"In the hush of a hidden sunrise" appears in the opening line and the final paragraph mentions "the hush of the hidden sunrise gave way to a new day," but time does not tighten decisions or track across beats. No clock pressure, no urgency tied to dawn; the collector's walk and the woman's release unfold without temporal constraint. Ornamental frame with a lyric reprise but no causal function. Missing development gate (time does not shape a middle choice) and no closure participation beyond restated mood.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"To integrate laughter into healing" is told in the penultimate paragraph ("The collector's motivation was not just to guide the lost, but to integrate laughter into healing") without prior dramatization. No on-page moment shows the collector choosing joy over sorrow or facing friction between laughter and grief. The motivation is declared rather than embodied in a micro-choice or trade-off. Late arrival (final third), summary-only, and no closure participation. Label-only with no visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Luminous ache" appears twice—once mid-story ("there was a luminous ache") and once at the end ("The luminous ache remained"). The phrase coheres with the gorge's atmosphere and the woman's sorrow, and the final reprise reweights the opening "hush" into a glow that "refused to be extinguished," meeting a weak closure gate. Tone modulates slightly (quiet → distorted harp → soothing counterpoint → quiet again) but remains static across turns rather than charging the final image with undeniable pressure. Setup and closure reprise are present; development is implied through sensory texture but not decisively linked to a choice.</comment>
