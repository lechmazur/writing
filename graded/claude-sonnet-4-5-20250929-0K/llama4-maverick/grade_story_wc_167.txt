<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The glazier remains a purely contemplative vessel with no contradictory impulses or embodied emotion. Her "sense of peace," "sense of wonder," and "sense of gratitude" are abstract labels rather than specific, contradictory states acting simultaneously. No meaningful choice or renunciation forecloses a path with visible cost; she arrives peaceful, observes, and leaves peaceful. The final walk away carries no earned alteration or dramatized stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>No on-page closure: the protagonist undergoes no decisive change, renunciation with cost, or stance crystallization that reweights prior material. The piece opens with reflection, sustains reflection, and closes with reflection; the fisherman's stone creates ripples but no causal pressure or narrowing of options. The "before everything shifts" timeframe is declared but never tested. Orientation is present early (who, where, when), but the absence of a legible closure unit with felt cost prevents higher scores.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Pearl Bay at dawn is anchored with mist, water, and sky, and the prism atrium recurs visually. However, no environmental feature constrains a choice or charges the final image; the setting functions as backdrop for abstract contemplation. The ripples from the stone are described but do not alter tactics or supply a resource that affects outcome. Spatial choreography is minimal (standing at edge, turning to leave) and reads as generic postcard description.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>No dominant stake is dramatized or tested on the page. The declared motivation—"illuminate value in the mundane"—remains abstract and never forces a trade-off or tightening choice. The fisherman's stone creates visual ripples but no reversal, escalation, or narrowing of options. The protagonist's "sense of urgency" to "capture the essence of this moment" is told without consequence or visible cost, and no decision alters later tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Noctilucent reckonings" and "illuminate value in the mundane" are asserted repeatedly but never embodied through specific event or image that reweights prior material. The final paragraph moralizes the theme directly ("revealing the world's own noctilucent reckonings") rather than allowing it to emerge from concrete action. The prism atrium recurs but without shifting meaning or cost; it remains a static symbol. No earned wisdom arises from struggle on the page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The voice is stable third-person limited but marred by abstract, essay-like diction ("complex web of interconnected threads," "clear complexity") that sits outside lived perception. Repeated sentence stems—"She felt," "She knew," "The glazier"—create template cadence. Filter verbs stack without voice motivation ("felt a sense of," "knew that she"). Psychic distance remains uniform with no modulation under pressure, and the prose reads as expository summary rather than embodied focalization.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Pervasive paraphrase loops and synonym churn: "sense of peace" / "sense of wonder" / "sense of gratitude"; "hidden patterns" / "hidden meanings" / "hidden beauty" across adjacent paragraphs. Template cadence dominates with "She felt" / "She knew" / "The glazier" opening multiple consecutive sentences. Stock metaphors ("complex web of interconnected threads") and abstract high-level descriptors ("clear complexity") appear in nearly every paragraph without concrete grounding. Information density is low; many sentences restate prior content without advancing pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>The contemplative-artist-at-dawn frame is familiar, and the piece does not transform it through specific choice or causal pressure. "Noctilucent reckonings" and "reads between lines" are prompt labels repeated without dramatization. The emotional arc—peace to wonder to gratitude—follows a predictable, meditative template with no fresh inflection or risk. The prism atrium and ripple patterns are described but not used in a way that feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>The reflective harbor glazier is present throughout but makes no on-page choice that creates a turn or alters tactics. She observes, reflects, and walks away; her contemplative stance remains static from opening to close with no visible cost or decision point.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The prism atrium appears in paragraph 4, recurs visually in paragraph 18, and is mentioned in the final two paragraphs, but it is never handled, used, or reweighted with new meaning. It functions as static scenic decoration without constraining choice or charging the closure image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>1.2</grade><comment>"Noctilucent reckonings" is mentioned in paragraphs 5, 10, and 25 as a thematic label but never shapes stakes, alters options, or changes tactics on the page. It remains an abstract concept echoed without dramatization or cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.5</grade><comment>"Reads between lines" is stated in paragraph 6 ("someone who reads between lines") but never constrains or enables an on-page action with cost. The glazier's observation of ripple patterns does not demonstrate this trait through choice or tradeoff; it is label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Commune" appears in paragraphs 9, 20, and 26 but remains abstract wish rather than dramatized action. No scene depicts the protagonist communing in a way that redefines options or creates a turn; it is told as intention without on-page execution or consequence.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The patterns in the rings after a stone is thrown appear in paragraphs 7, 8, and 10. The fisherman's stone and resulting ripples are described, and the glazier observes them as a "hidden code" and "reflection of the world's own noctilucent reckonings." However, the method does not shape attempts, alter tactics, or drive a turn; it functions as illustrative imagery without causal pressure or cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Pearl Bay at dawn is anchored early (paragraph 1) and recurs through mist, water, and sky across the piece. The bay supplies the visual stage for the stone-ripple observation and frames the opening and closing. However, it does not pressure choices, supply resources that affect outcome, or alter tactics; it remains scenic backdrop. The micro-setting (body, prism, ripples) is described but not used to constrain action.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Before everything shifts" is stated in paragraph 15 as an urgency but never tracked or tested on the page. No live clock tightens decisions or alters moves; the dawn-to-sunrise progression is environmental rather than tactical, and the timeframe does not create cost or foreclose options.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>"Illuminate value in the mundane" is declared in paragraph 13 and restated in paragraphs 14, 21, 25, and 27 but remains abstract intention without dramatized friction, choice, or cost. The desire is told rather than tested through competing wants or obstacles, and no on-page action demonstrates this motivation altering tactics.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Clear complexity" is invoked in paragraphs 21 and 27 and reflected in the piece's steady, contemplative register. Tone remains coherent and calm throughout without modulation under pressure; there is no pressure to modulate against. The tone does not charge the final image because the final image carries no cost or reversal; it restates the opening mood.</comment>
