<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The navigator remains abstract throughout—"patchwork" is label-only, and interiority consists of broad emotional claims ("pain still felt like an open wound") rather than embodied contradictions. No micro-choices under pressure constrain her; she "finds solace," "feels a sense of connection," and "presses on" without visible internal friction or cost. The ending acceptance arrives through summary rather than a dramatized choice that forecloses a path. Motivation is declared but never tested in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Orientation is vague—"starlit signal station," "sprawling landscape," and "great, empty plain" remain placeholders without spatial anchors past the 120-word mark. The piece follows an accumulative lens (journey through loss, cryptic guidance, moon-phase navigation), but the closure—"a sense of peace settle over her, a sense of acceptance"—is told rather than shown through a decisive image or reconfiguration. No on-page cost is legible in the final beat; the "reverse migration" completes off-stage. Causality is loose: cryptic calls guide but their content and mechanics never narrow options on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Setting elements are present but generic: "starlit signal station," "devastated landscape," "great, empty plain" function as mood boards rather than constraining geography. The censer foot is handled twice (recovery, clutched at dawn) but does not alter a choice. No tool, body state, or environmental feature pressures a decision. Spatial choreography is coherent within the station-to-plain journey, but the walk itself remains unanchored—no distance, terrain obstacle, or resource test shapes her path.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—navigate loss and reclaim the past—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. No on-page reversal or tightening forces a trade-off; the navigator simply walks, listens to calls, and arrives at peace. Cryptic messages offer "tantalizing clues" but never create a complication that alters tactics. The ending delivers acceptance without visible cost: no renunciation, no path foreclosed, no agency tested. Pressure is declared ("perilous journey") but not dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Theme—loss, memory, rebuilding—is stated rather than emergent from particulars. The censer foot and starlit station recur but do not shift meaning; they remain symbolic tokens. The final paragraph moralizes: "she would never be the same again, but she was ready to move forward" articulates the theme rather than letting the image speak. "Geography of loss" and "topography of loss and memory" are metaphors asserted, not built through scene pressure. No earned insight arises from a specific on-page struggle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>POV distance is stable third-limited, but the voice is generic and abstract: "the navigator felt," "she knew," "a sense of" repeat without distinct perceptual signature. Diction remains elevated and uniform under all conditions—no compression or shift during the walk or dawn moment. No dialogue present. Reflection dominates (~40% of text) but anchors weakly to present stimuli and does not drive micro-choices. The prose reads like summary rather than lived perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Template cadence pervades: "She had lost…she found," "The navigator's eyes…The navigator's own," "As the moon…so too did," "It was…but the navigator," "The journey was…but she pressed." Paraphrase loops cluster in paragraphs 12–14 (map-building, resilience, determination restated). Filter-verb stacks ("felt a sense," "knew that," "began to") dull immediacy. Stock metaphors: "open wound," "beacon," "lifeline." Figurative language in nearly every sentence without pattern payoff. Apply template-cadence, paraphrase-loop, and filter-stack penalties totaling approximately −1.5.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Navigator rebuilds after disaster through mysterious guidance" is a familiar template executed without transformation. Moon-phase fluctuation and cryptic midnight calls are mentioned but not leveraged for surprise or tradeoff. The "reverse migration" and "geography of loss" remain abstract metaphors rather than specific, non-obvious angles. No bold structural or perspectival choice; the arc is linear summary. Derivative premise penalty applies: −0.8.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Present throughout but makes no key choices on the page. She observes, feels, walks, and arrives at peace—all passive reception. Label-only "patchwork" mentioned once without function. No decision alters tactics or forecloses a path. Swappable with "traveler" or "seeker."</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Handled twice (recovered from wreckage, clutched at dawn) but does not constrain a choice or shift meaning between appearances. Static reminder of loss. Does not drive a beat or charge the closure image with new weight. Lyric reprise present but weak.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Reverse migration" is claimed thematically in paragraph 10 but never enacted on the page—no route traced backward, no prior locations revisited. Remains a metaphor rather than shaping stakes or tactics. Summary-only.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Mentioned in paragraph 6 (senses heightened at full moon) and paragraph 15 (full moon surge), but no on-page action shows the constraint or tradeoff. Label-only trait. Does not alter a choice or cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Map-building and path creation recur across paragraphs but remain told: "began to build a new map," "determined to build something new." No dramatized construction beat. Swappable with "navigate" or "chart." Does not redefine options at closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>Mentioned in paragraph 9 ("cryptic phone calls at midnight") and recurs as "the calls continued," but content and mechanics never shown. Off-stage guidance. Does not shape an on-page attempt or cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Named in opening and paragraph 12 ("became a beacon") but supplies no resource or constraint. Postcard function. Does not alter a tactic or charge the ending, which occurs at the plain's edge.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Weeks ago" in paragraph 2, but the hydraulics failure creates context only—no timeline tightens decisions. The walk and dawn arrival are untimed. Vague duration.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Stated in paragraph 2 and echoed throughout ("reclaim the past," "rediscover contours"), but never dramatized in friction between want and cost. Told motivation without on-page test. Geography of loss remains abstract.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Raw solace" appears three times but remains a label rather than modulating with pressure. Tone is uniformly elegiac and declarative; no shift at peaks or closure. Static mood.</comment>
