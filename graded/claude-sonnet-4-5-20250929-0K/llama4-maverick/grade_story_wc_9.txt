<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The cartomancer remains largely static, contemplating rather than deciding; her movements (unfastening the book, rising to her feet) do not constrain later choices or foreclose paths with cost. Interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("sense of understanding begin to dawn," "sense of peace settle over her") rather than embodied contradiction. The child's birth is mentioned as reflective context but does not generate on-page micro-choices that tilt present stance. Agency reads as passive observation culminating in acceptance without visible struggle or trade-off.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The piece anchors who (cartomancer) and where (midnight glade) early, satisfying orientation. Drive lens infers as Accumulative/Textural: the story accumulates symbols (cards, saucer, hand-tracings) toward a final image of "cloudbound repentance." However, no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration with visible cost, or conceptual repricing occurs on the page—the cartomancer "felt a sense of peace" and "vanished," but no option is foreclosed, no tactic altered, and the cost remains assertion rather than dramatized consequence. The closure unit lacks the required felt or conceptual price that would reconfigure prior material.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The midnight glade, mist, and ozone are vividly described and establish atmospheric consistency. The dolls' tea-set saucer appears as a static object beside the protagonist but does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it functions as symbol rather than spatial pressure. Micro-setting (the body, the saucer, the book) is present but ornamental—removing any would not change the cartomancer's decision path or the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to find where lost time accumulates"—is signaled but never tested by a reversal or tightening that narrows options. The cartomancer examines cards, recalls a memory, flips through a book, and arrives at acceptance without obstacle, cost, or agency-driven turn. No on-page escalation or deepening occurs; the narrative remains contemplative throughout, and the final "sense of peace" is asserted rather than earned by a choice that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Theme of lost time and repentance emerges through recurring images (crack, hand-tracings, mist), and the piece avoids overt moralizing. However, the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary ("a testament to the power of cloudbound repentance") rather than letting the image stand alone. The ending does not offer a non-literal answer that reweights prior material with visible cost; instead it asserts meaning ("lost time accumulates in the spaces between memories") without dramatizing consequence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual filter is consistent (cartomancer's attention to cards, saucer, memories) and diction reflects a lyric, slightly elevated register appropriate to the atmospheric mode. However, the voice relies on repetitive sentence stems ("The cartomancer's eyes," "The cartomancer's thoughts," "The cartomancer felt") and abstract phrasing ("sense of understanding," "sense of peace") that flatten immediacy. No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "sense of understanding," "sense of longing," "sense of peace," and "sense of acceptance" cluster in the final third without varied syntax. Template cadence ("The cartomancer's [noun]" opens five sentences) and synonym churn ("understanding begin to dawn" / "deeper understanding") reduce propulsion. Figurative language ("choking beauty," "halo of mist," "threads in a tapestry") is dense but does not muddle clarity. The accumulation of these artifacts, especially touching the closure beat, triggers baseline −0.6 in Q7 and disallows 9+ globally per the artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The midnight-glade cartomancer premise and the lyric meditation on lost time feel familiar; the emotional arc (contemplation → epiphany → peace) follows a well-worn template without a non-obvious synthesis. The dolls' tea-set saucer crack as metaphor for fractured understanding is on-the-nose rather than transformed through specific action. No bold structural or perspectival risk heightens stakes; the piece plays safe within a lyric-atmospheric mode without fresh inflection in the turn or closure image.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The onyx-ink cartomancer is present throughout and focalizes all action. She examines cards, recalls memories, unfastens the book, and rises to leave—but none of these choices narrows options or alters tactics with visible cost. Her role is observational; the narrative would function identically with a generic "figure" substituted. She appears in the closure image (rising, vanishing) but does not drive a turn. Present in all three gates (setup, middle, ending) but lacks causal pressure or cost linkage: baseline 3.0, ornamental use −0.5, swappability −0.4, rounded down → 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The dolls' tea-set saucer with its crack appears twice: once when the cartomancer's gaze falls upon it and again near the end as "a symbol of the fractures in time itself." Both mentions are descriptive; the saucer is not handled, does not constrain a choice, and could be replaced with any other cracked object without structural change. Two-beat presence +0.9, but ornamental use −0.5, swappability −0.8, no closure participation beyond metaphor −0.6, capped at 4.6 for missing causal middle development, rounded down → 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Cloudbound repentance is named in the opening ("the concept of cloudbound repentance") and recurs in the final paragraph ("the power of cloudbound repentance"). It remains abstract theme language rather than shaping on-page stakes or altering tactics. The concept does not change options or force a choice. Present in setup and closure mention, but ornamental: baseline 3.0, setup +0.3, label-only trait −0.3, no causal pressure, capped at 3.8 for swappability, rounded down → 3.8.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Willingly perplexed appears once in the opening ("a cartomancer willingly perplexed by the mysteries of the cards"). It describes the protagonist's general stance but does not constrain or enable a single on-page action with visible cost. The trait could be removed without altering the narrative arc. Single ornamental mention: baseline 3.0, setup +0.3, label-only −0.3, ornamental −0.5, swappability −0.4, capped at 2.8 for missing middle and closure gates, rounded down → 2.4.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Unfasten appears once ("reached out to unfasten the clasp of a small, leather-bound book"). This action enables the cartomancer to view the hand-tracings, which then trigger memory and the thematic realization. It is a functional pivot but easily swappable (she could "open" or "lift" the book with the same effect). One beat causal involvement +0.4, setup in middle third −0.2, swappability −0.4, no closure participation beyond enabler, rounded down → 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The family custom of tracing hands on birthday tablecloths is introduced in the middle as a memory and reappears when the cartomancer flips through the collected tracings. The custom does not shape an on-page attempt or constrain a choice; it functions as reflective backstory that colors the theme of lost time. Two beats (memory, book pages) +0.9, setup in middle third −0.2, summary-only use −0.4, no causal pressure −0.5, capped at 4.6 for missing causal middle development, rounded down → 4.7.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The midnight glade above the clouds is established in the opening and remains atmospherically consistent (mist, ozone, moon). It does not pressure a choice or supply a resource that affects outcome; the cartomancer could conduct the same contemplation in any isolated setting. Setup +0.8, postcard description −0.5, ornamental −0.5, swappability −0.4, capped at 4.6 for missing middle development, rounded down → 3.6.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.3</grade><comment>After the birth is mentioned once in the middle ("the birth of her own child, and the time that had passed since then"). The timeframe provides reflective context but does not tighten decisions or tactics; no clock or deadline pressures the cartomancer's choices. Single mention, ornamental: baseline 3.0, middle mention with no setup or closure participation, vague time −0.3, capped at 3.4 for missing closure, rounded down → 3.3.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>To find where lost time accumulates is stated in the middle ("driven by a desire to find where lost time accumulates") and echoed in the penultimate paragraph ("lost time accumulates in the spaces between memories"). The motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices or friction between want and cost. Two mentions +0.9, told-only −0.4, no on-page friction or choice driven by this desire −0.5, capped at 4.6 for missing middle dramatization, rounded up slightly for thematic closure link → 4.9.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Choking beauty appears twice: opening ("a choking beauty that clung to every breath") and near the end ("surrounded by the choking beauty of the midnight glade"). The tone is consistent and atmospheric but does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image—it remains a static descriptor. Two mentions +0.9, setup +0.3, static mood −0.5, ornamental reprise −0.4, rounded down → 4.3.</comment>
