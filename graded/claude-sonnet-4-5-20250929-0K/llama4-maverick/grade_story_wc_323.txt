<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lyra remains a cipher throughout—no contradictory impulses, no visible cost to her choices, and no embodied emotion beyond stock intensity markers ("eyes sparkled," "heart swelled"). The final lesson succeeds without friction or trade-off, leaving her stance unchanged. Interiority is absent; we watch her teach but never glimpse internal conflict or a moment where competing values force a decision. The piece reads as outline rather than dramatized character under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>No closure unit is present. The story begins with Lyra as instructor and ends with her as instructor; no decisive change, renunciation with cost, or conceptual repricing occurs on the page. The lesson proceeds smoothly without reversal or tightening that forecloses options. Orientation is delayed—who Lyra is beyond title and what immediate stake drives this lesson remain unclear past the 120-word mark—triggering the Orientation Test penalty and associated caps. The structure reads as sequential exposition rather than causal or accumulative pressure toward a legible ending shift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The benthic city is described but never constrains a choice or alters tactics. Details like "abyssal plain," "dimly lit thoroughfares," and the anchor chain link remain decorative postcards rather than active elements shaping movement or decision. The stars are invoked for thematic weight but do not supply a resource or obstacle that changes what Lyra can do. Spatial choreography is coherent but does not pressure the central conflict.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The stated stake—teaching navigation by starlight—faces no opposition, complication, or cost. The lesson progresses from setup to mastery without a single moment where an option narrows or a price is paid. No reversal, tightening choice, or deepening alters what is possible. The discovery of aliens is mentioned as context but never dramatizes friction or forces Lyra to trade one value for another. Pressure remains flat from first line to last.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme is asserted rather than earned: "unfolded horizons," "mysteries of the cosmos," and transformation from darkness to beacon are stated as abstractions without specific dramatized particulars. The final paragraph moralizes ("the future was bright") rather than offering a resonant, non-literal answer grounded in prior action. No recurring image shifts meaning at the end; the anchor chain link is mentioned once and never returns with reweighted pressure. Thematic Echo artifacts cluster in the closing lines, applying the specified penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Narrative distance is stable but voice is generic and interchangeable—diction like "seismic shift," "stalwart," "somber marvel" could describe any character in any setting. No perceptual signature filters the world through Lyra's particular bias or profession. Reflection dominates without anchoring in present micro-choices; BRR debt is substantial but orientation loss and pressure flatness are routed elsewhere. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance remains consistent but the prose lacks rhythmic modulation or character-specific syntax.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: paragraphs 19–23 restate "students are ready / horizons beckon / future is bright" across five variants without new pressure. Template cadence runs dominate: "As she [verb]… Lyra's [noun]" appears in six consecutive moves. Stock metaphors cluster without fresh angle: "diamonds scattered across velvet," "threshold to infinite possibilities," "launchpad for exploration." Filter-verb stacks ("Lyra's thoughts turned," "Lyra's gaze fell," "Lyra watched") dull immediacy in high-attention beats. Artifacts touch the final third, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The core premise—instructor teaches navigation after alien contact—follows a template lesson-success arc without transformation. Edge geometry and starlight navigation are named but not rendered specific enough to feel irreplaceable; swap "quantum tides" or "void mapping" and the story proceeds unchanged. The benthic city and alien discovery supply atmosphere but do not drive a non-obvious synthesis or moral calculus. No turn or final image feels inevitable in hindsight; the ending fulfills the setup mechanically rather than reweighting prior material through risk or specificity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Lyra appears throughout but makes no decision that alters tactics or forecloses a path. She teaches a lesson that succeeds without friction. Observation and exposition only; no on-page choice with cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>The boat anchor chain link is mentioned once in paragraph 8 as a "relic" and "symbol" but never handled, used, or returned. Static description without evolving function or charged reprise at closure. Ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Unfolded horizons" appears as thematic echo in paragraphs 9, 19, and 30 but never shapes a stake or alters an option on the page. Label-only; does not constrain choice or enable tactics under stress.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.6</grade><comment>"Balancedly curious" is declared in paragraph 2 but never constrains or enables an action with cost. No visible trade-off or decision rooted in this trait. Label-only mention.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Expand" recurs as verb and concept (paragraphs 3, 10, 14, 26) but remains abstract. The students' understanding expands off-page; no on-page moment where expansion redefines options or forecloses a path. Summary-only.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Edge geometry is introduced in paragraph 10 and mentioned again in paragraph 14 as a teaching method but its mechanics never matter to a choice or outcome. The lesson succeeds without demonstrating how this method shaped an attempt. Swappable with any navigational technique.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The benthic city frames the setting from paragraph 1 and recurs through "dimly lit streets," "central square," and "outer rim." It supplies mood but never pressures a choice or alters resources—no door locked, no path blocked, no tactical shift driven by environment. Postcard detail without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.0</grade><comment>The timeframe "after discovering aliens" is stated in paragraph 3 and invoked in paragraphs 17 and 29 but never tightens a decision or clock. No live deadline or temporal pressure alters moves. Context-only; vague and untracked.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to learn to navigate by starlight" drives Lyra's lesson setup but is never dramatized with friction or cost. The students master the skill without struggle; no conflict between want and price. Told rather than tested on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Somber marvel" is signaled in paragraph 13 and recurs in paragraphs 25 and 29. Tone remains consistent through turns but does not modulate with pressure—intensity stays level rather than sharpening at key beats. The final image invokes wonder but without a cadence shift that charges closure. Coherent but static mood.</comment>
