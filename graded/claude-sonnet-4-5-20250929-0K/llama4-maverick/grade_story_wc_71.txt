<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Eli is labeled a "creeping normality noticer" but this trait never constrains a choice or creates visible cost. Her interiority relies heavily on abstract meditation ("sensing that there was more to the shard than met the eye") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The ritual at the house feels performed rather than struggled-through, with no competing impulses or visible trade-offs. The final "realization" arrives as summary epiphany without prior causal earning.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is vague: we learn Eli's role and the bay setting, but no concrete spatial anchors ground where she starts or how far she walks. The story follows an Accumulative lens (collection of images and meditation building toward insight), but the closure—her "understanding" of the house as a living entity—is told rather than shown through a decisive image or cost. The orris root shard is clutched but never used in a way that narrows options or creates friction. No meaningful tightening occurs; the ritual is described but does not encounter resistance or force a trade-off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The "quiet bay in spring" and shop are sketched with pleasant but generic detail (blooming flowers, soft lapping waves, warm orange glow). The orris root shard's "delicate, creamy hue and intricate patterns" is described but never handled in a way that constrains action. Spatial choreography during the house ritual is vague—no sense of distance, objects placed, or how the house's perimeter is navigated. The shard appears in the final paragraph but as a passive token rather than a tool that charges the image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding why some houses feel alive—is signaled early but never tested. Eli's ritual proceeds without obstacle, doubt, or visible cost; she simply walks, places objects (never specified), and experiences a shift. No reversal or tightening narrows her options. The "expectant hush" and "heightened awareness" are asserted rather than earned through on-page pressure. The ending summarizes gratitude without showing what she risked or lost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The theme of sanctifying space and discovering aliveness is stated repeatedly in abstract language ("shard of hush," "hushed blaze of energy," "living, breathing entity") rather than emerging from concrete particulars. The orris root shard is given symbolic weight through the perfumer's explanation but never dramatized in a way that reweights prior material. The final paragraph shifts into direct thematic summary ("she had been forever changed") that replaces scene pressure. The piece gestures toward mystery but resolves into telling rather than resonant image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Eli with no head-hopping. However, the narrative distance fluctuates between immediate perception and abstract philosophizing without clear purpose. Diction drifts into elevated registers ("inadvertently profound presence," "intricate web of energies," "hushed blaze of energy") that feel more authorial than character-particular. The perfumer's dialogue is minimal and functional but carries no subtext. Eli's perceptual signature is not distinct; her noticing reads generic rather than selectively biased.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies adequately, but several paraphrase loops appear: "she wondered if it was possible... The perfumer's orris root shard... seemed to be the key" restates the question without advancing it. The phrase "shard of hush" recurs without functional variation. Abstract constructions ("the essence of its aliveness," "latent energy," "hidden rhythms and resonances") stack in the final third, dulling momentum. No major clarity breaks, but density is low—many sentences describe states rather than doing multiple jobs. The closing lines summarize rather than land an image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The premise—character performs ritual to understand mysterious energy in houses—follows familiar New Age / mystical-realism templates without transformation. The orris root shard, "shard of hush," and streetlights that "daydream" are metaphorically decorative but not integrated into a fresh synthesis. The ritual itself (walking a perimeter, leaving objects) is gestured at but never specified, leaving it vague rather than vividly particular. Eli's "creeping normality noticer" role is interesting in label but never manifests in specific action or constraint.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Eli is labeled a "creeping normality noticer" in the opening and this frames her wandering, but the trait never drives a decision or create a trade-off. She observes, purchases, and performs a ritual without the noticing function constraining or enabling a choice. Present as character description but ornamental to causality.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The orris root shard appears in the shop window (early signal), is purchased and held during the ritual, and is clutched again in the final paragraph. However, it is never used—only carried. Its "shard of hush" quality is explained by the perfumer but does not shape a beat or narrow an option. Present across three touches but passive; removing it would not break the ritual or closure logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The "shard of hush" is explained by the perfumer and echoed in the final phrase "hushed blaze of energy," functioning as a thematic label. It does not constrain a choice or alter tactics on the page. Present as concept and image but not causal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>The shard's "inadvertently profound presence" is asserted once when Eli purchases it. The term does not recur, does not shape her actions, and does not create a tradeoff. Label-only mention.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The act of sanctifying the house is introduced as Eli's goal midway, enacted in the ritual paragraph (walking the perimeter, leaving objects), and referenced in the closing reflection. It frames the structure but the ritual itself is summarized rather than dramatized with obstacles or cost. Present in setup and payoff, but the middle is gestural rather than pressured.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>Eli leaves "small, carefully chosen objects" during the ritual, but they are never named, shown, or used. The method is mentioned once and does not shape any beat or create friction. Placeholder mention without mechanical specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The quiet bay in spring is described in the opening and Eli returns to the bay's edge at the close, creating a lyric frame. However, the setting does not constrain action or supply resources—it remains postcard backdrop. The house where the ritual occurs is not concretely rendered. Present in frame but does not pressure choice.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>"Streetlights daydreaming" appears once near the ritual's conclusion as a metaphorical image. It does not tighten decisions or impose a clock. The phrase is evocative but ornamental; no tactics shift with the arrival of night or artificial light.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Eli's desire to understand why some houses feel alive is stated early, drives her purchase and ritual, and is referenced at closure. However, it is never conflicted—she does not weigh competing wants or face a cost for pursuing this goal. Present across setup, middle, and payoff, but without friction or visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The phrase "hushed blaze" appears once in the final third ("hushed blaze of energy"). Tone throughout is meditative and gentle, with moments of intensity asserted ("expectant hush," "exhilarating and humbling") but not modulated by syntax or rhythm. The final image aims for quiet intensity but summarizes rather than charges. Present as descriptor but not coherently sustained or modulated under pressure.</comment>
