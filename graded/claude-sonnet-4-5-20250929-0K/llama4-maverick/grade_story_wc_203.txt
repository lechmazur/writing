<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Ezra's defining trait (seeing ghosts) remains ornamental—the ghosts watch and flicker but never constrain a choice or force a trade-off. Her motivation ("to discover what ceilings hide") is asserted but not dramatized through on-page conflict or cost; she uncompletes her task smoothly without struggle. Interiority consists mostly of observational summary ("her skillfully observant nature drinking in the details") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The final "weightless burden" phrase is label-speak that tells emotional state instead of showing it through action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening lines, satisfying the test. The closure unit is ambiguous: Ezra leaves with the barrel and "feels the weightless burden," but no visible cost or foreclosed path is dramatized—she simply exits into the crowd, content. The dust-to-logbook sequence reads as because/therefore linkage (Causal lens inferred), yet the discovery of the circus's history does not narrow her options or alter her stance on the page. No meaningful tightening occurs; she completes her exploration without friction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The abandoned ticket office is vividly rendered with faded posters, dusty stubs, and skeletal fluorescent lights. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (Ezra's observant gaze). However, the setting does not constrain a choice or charge the closure; it remains atmospheric backdrop. The mainspring barrel sits on a shelf and is handled, but spatial choreography of the hidden compartment and Ezra's physical engagement with the dust trail lacks concrete blocking.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—uncovering the circus's secrets—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or cost. Ezra's investigation proceeds smoothly: dust → compartment → logbook → ghosts solidify → exit. No on-page reversal or tightening narrows her options; the ghosts grow "more distinct" without consequence. The resolution is achieved through observation alone, with no agency-driven choice or visible price paid. "Weightless burden" names an emotional state without dramatizing the trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the accumulation of forgotten-place imagery (abandoned circus, faded colors, hidden logbook) and the premise that "the world is full of cracks, full of hidden stories." However, the final paragraph explicitly states the theme ("a testament to the power of the forgotten") rather than letting the image earn it. The mainspring barrel as key is asserted ("it was more than just a relic—it was a key") without on-page demonstration of what it unlocks. Ezra's internal arc lacks friction; she begins content to explore and ends content, with no thematic cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. The prose carries a consistent, measured texture ("the weight of forgotten dreams," "ethereal forms flickering at the edge of her vision"). However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("her skillfully observant nature," "a weightless burden") that feels authorial rather than character-particular. Perceptual signature is present (observant gaze on dust, ceilings, patterns) but does not modulate under pressure since no pressure materializes. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction is not tested.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "the ghosts, too, seem to be watching her" / "The ghosts grow more distinct" / "Ezra feels the ghosts fading" cycles without adding pressure. Template cadence runs appear ("She approaches… She's always been… She wonders…"). Stock phrases accumulate: "the weight of forgotten dreams," "whispers of the past," "the scent of decay," "frozen in time." The phrase "weightless burden" is repeated twice in the final third without reweighting. Filter-verb stacks ("seems to," "feels the") dull immediacy in peak beats. Applying the patterned-artifact penalty pack: paraphrase loops, template cadence, and stock metaphor strings across multiple beats trigger −1.2 in Q7, with an additional −0.3 for touching the closure paragraph.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The elevator-technician-who-sees-ghosts premise offers a fresh synthesis, but the story does not follow its implications—Ezra's day job never intersects with the ghost-seeing or the circus investigation. The dust-analysis method is noted but not shown in action. The core arc (discovering a logbook in an abandoned place) is a familiar template executed without transformation; removing "elevator technician" and "ghosts" would leave the emotional beats unchanged. Risk-aversion is evident: the ghosts pose no threat, the discovery costs nothing, and Ezra exits unscathed.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Ezra (elevator repair technician who sees ghosts) is present throughout and her ghost-seeing is mentioned in multiple beats, but her choices do not create key turns. The ghosts watch, flicker, and fade without constraining her investigation or forcing a decision. Her elevator-repair profession is noted in the opening line but never touches the plot. She observes and analyzes; the discovery of the logbook is passive (dust leads her). The element is functional but replaceable—a historian or urban explorer could perform the same actions with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The horologist's mainspring barrel appears early (setup gate met), is handled ("running her fingers over the etched patterns"), and returns in the toolbox at the end ("seems to hum with a quiet energy"). However, it does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic. The text asserts it "was more than just a relic—it was a key" without showing what it unlocks. It is described as ornamental and carried away, but its intricate mechanisms never matter to the plot. Two beats of presence (early touch, final hum) earn mid-band consideration, but the lack of causal pressure and swappability (any relic could serve the same symbolic role) cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Cracks in the façade" is stated explicitly ("the cracks in the façade of this abandoned place beginning to show") and thematically reprised in the final passage ("The world is full of cracks, full of hidden stories"). However, it does not shape stakes or tactics on the page—Ezra does not navigate physical cracks or confront a façade that collapses under her investigation. The concept functions as metaphorical theme rather than plot driver. Present in setup and closure (two gates), but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Skillfully observant" is labeled in the opening ("her skillfully observant nature drinking in the details") and demonstrated through Ezra noticing dust patterns, posters, and the mainspring barrel. However, the trait does not constrain or enable an on-page action with cost—observation flows smoothly without trade-off or mistake. No visible price is paid for her skill; no blindspot counterbalances it. The attribute is functional (she uses observation to find the compartment) but could be replaced with "curious" or "detail-oriented" without altering the plot.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Engage" (with the ghosts) is mentioned once in the middle: "Ezra engages with them, her presence a gentle acknowledgement of their existence." The action is told rather than dramatized—no dialogue, gesture, or visible exchange occurs. The ghosts' response (forms solidifying) happens independently of Ezra's engagement. Major turns (finding the dust trail, opening the compartment, reading the logbook) do not trace to this action. The element is present but ornamental and easily swappable with "observes" or "senses."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Analyzing dust accumulation patterns" is signaled early ("She begins to analyze the dust accumulation patterns") and its mechanics matter: the dust trail leads to the hidden compartment (middle development gate met). However, the analysis itself is not shown—no description of technique, no false lead, no cost. The method appears in one sentence and immediately succeeds. It shapes one key turn (discovery of the compartment) but is told rather than dramatized, limiting band entry. Functional but minimal.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The abandoned circus ticket office is introduced in the opening line (setup gate met), described with vivid detail (faded posters, dusty stubs, skeletal fluorescents), and houses the hidden compartment that Ezra discovers (middle development gate met). It appears in the final reflection ("The memory of the ticket office will stay with her"). However, it does not pressure choices—Ezra moves freely through the space without constraint. The setting provides resources (the compartment, the logbook) but does not alter tactics or force a trade-off. Three gates met with moderate causal work earns mid-band placement.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"When the overhead fluorescent buzz dies off" anchors the opening moment (setup gate met) but does not function as a timeframe that tightens decisions. No clock is tracked; Ezra's investigation proceeds at an unspecified pace without time pressure. The element is a static atmospheric detail rather than a temporal constraint. Present in one beat, ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"To discover what ceilings hide" is stated as Ezra's driving motivation ("She's always been driven to discover what ceilings hide") and reprised in reflection ("Ezra's thoughts drift back to the ceilings she's repaired, the secrets they've kept"). However, the motivation is not dramatized through conflicted choices—Ezra completes her investigation smoothly without friction between want and cost. The ceiling theme does not intersect with the circus plot (the discovery happens in a wall compartment, not a ceiling). Present in setup and closure (two gates) with thematic resonance, but told rather than tested.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Weightless burden" appears twice in the final third ("Ezra's task is complete; she's uncovered the secrets hidden in the cracks of this forgotten façade… feeling the weightless burden of the secrets she's uncovered" and "The weightless burden she's carried from the ticket office will stay with her"). The phrase names an emotional state but does not modulate with pressure—no earlier beats establish what makes the burden "weightless" or how it charges the final image. Tone is asserted rather than embodied. Present in closure (one gate met) but ornamental.</comment>
