<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The maintenance worker's interiority remains generic across most beats—"thrill of excitement," "sense of satisfaction"—without embodied contradiction or character-particular perception. Her ability to identify walks is label-only; it never constrains a choice or creates friction. The stranger encounter at the end offers no meaningful cost or transformation; the protagonist simply walks away carrying objects with vague knowledge, foreclosing no path. Internal life reads as conceptual summary rather than lived pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Orientation is established by ~120 words (worker, containers, storm), so no penalty applies. The piece signals an Accumulative lens (collecting objects, building whisper-proof claim) but never dramatizes the whisper-versus-shout test on the page; the stranger's single whispered line is asserted to prove the point without showing how distance or acoustics were tested. Closure is a stated satisfaction ("proven her point") with no visible cost—she leaves with the same objects and a vague promise to return. No meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; beats are additive without pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The container labyrinth is vivid and consistent—salt, rust, graffiti, flickering lights, howling wind—and spatial choreography tracks cleanly. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics; she navigates "every twist and turn" without friction. The compass spinning wildly is atmospheric set-dressing; the storm does not force a tradeoff. The zodiac coin and key are handled but do not shape movement or access, missing the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving whispers travel farther than shouts—is signaled early but never tested on the page. No escalation or tightening occurs; she walks, finds objects, encounters a stranger who whispers, then leaves. The stranger's whisper is told to carry farther, not shown through acoustics or distance. No option is foreclosed, no tradeoff dramatized, no visible cost paid. Agency is observational wandering, not decision under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The whisper-versus-shout concept remains abstract, never embodied in a specific test or irony. The final paragraph states theme directly: "sometimes it was the quietest voices that traveled the farthest." The zodiac coin and folded maps accumulate but do not reweight prior material or charge the ending. No conceptual repricing or resonant reconfiguration occurs; the ending summarizes rather than transforms.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with occasional vivid sensory anchors—"howling through the containers like a chorus of restless spirits"—and the perceptual filter reflects professional familiarity. However, register drifts into generic abstraction at emotional peaks: "calculated spontaneity," "energy was building." The stranger's dialogue is presented but not quoted or embodied, a missed opportunity for voice distinction. No head-hopping, but interiority leans on labels rather than character-particular rhythm.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops appear: "carrying the key and the coin with her, and the knowledge" restates the prior material without advancing it. Template cadence runs through several mid-section beats: "She picked it up… She tucked… She turned…" with identical stems. "As she walked" opens two sentences in close proximity. Figurative language in the storm description is vivid but occasionally mixed: "chorus of restless spirits" anthropomorphizes wind without grounding the vehicle. Density is moderate; many lines do single work. The closure paragraph summarizes rather than propelling through image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The container-labyrinth premise is vivid but familiar from countless industrial-ruin and urban-exploration narratives. The whisper-versus-shout claim is asserted, not dramatized through fresh mechanics. The zodiac coin, folded maps, and mysterious key assemble a treasure-hunt template without transformation. No bold structural risk or non-obvious synthesis; emotional arc and plot would function unchanged with different proper nouns. The geomagnetic storm is atmospheric ornament, not a constraint that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The maintenance worker is present throughout and her navigation frames the journey, but her choices are observational rather than decisive. She picks up objects, unfolds maps, follows a stranger—actions that do not narrow options or create visible cost. Her professional knowledge ("knew every twist and turn," identifies walks) is asserted but never tested or used to solve a problem. She does not make a key turn; she walks through a sequence and declares satisfaction at the end.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The zodiac coin appears once mid-story ("glint of metal… picked it up… tucked into her pocket") and is mentioned again in the final paragraph as something she carries. It does not return with reweighted meaning, constrain a choice, or participate in closure. Static description; no functional use across beats. Setup and closure cameo gates are met, but no development or causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Folded maps appear early, drive one beat (a key falls out of one), and are mentioned again in the final paragraph. The maps are described as "a mix of navigation aid and puzzle, leading her deeper," but this claim is not dramatized—she does not consult them, solve a puzzle, or use them to constrain a route. The concept shapes expectation but not on-page tactics. Two beats, no visible cost tied to the element.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The ability to identify people's walks is asserted early: "her mind identifying people's walks with ease. She could tell who had taken a shortcut, who had lingered…" But this trait never constrains or enables an on-page action. She does not use it to track the stranger, avoid a threat, or make a choice. Label-only attribute with no causal pressure or cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The challenge to prove whispers travel farther than shouts frames the story's premise and reappears at closure when she declares it proven. However, the challenge is never dramatized through a test, tradeoff, or obstacle. No major turn traces to this action; it could be replaced with "explore the labyrinth" or "solve the map puzzle" with minor edits. Present in setup and closure, but swappable and without development pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The key with no apparent lock appears when it falls from a map, drives one beat (she wonders what it unlocks), and is mentioned in the final paragraph as something she carries. The method is signaled and its mystery noted, but the key does not shape attempts, unlock anything, or participate in the closure decision. Two beats with no causal pressure or visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The towering labyrinth of shipping containers in a port city is established early, remains consistent, and supplies vivid sensory detail throughout (rust, salt, graffiti, flickering lights). Spatial choreography is clear. However, the setting does not pressure choices—she knows every twist and turn, so navigation is frictionless. The containers loom and shift visually but do not block, reveal, or alter tactics. Present in setup, development description, and closure, but does not constrain on-page action.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The geomagnetic storm is present in the opening (compass spinning wildly), mentioned twice in the middle ("storm raging outside seemed to be intensifying," "geomagnetic storm was still raging"), and referenced in the final paragraph. It affects a prop (the compass) but does not tighten decisions, create a deadline, or force tactical adaptation. Atmospheric backdrop without pressure. Three mentions across the arc, no visible cost or constraint on choices.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The motivation to prove whispers travel farther than shouts is stated early, returned to at closure ("She had proven her point"), and described as a "challenge she had set for herself." However, the desire is never dramatized through conflicting wants or visible tradeoffs. She does not sacrifice speed, safety, or another goal to conduct the test. Told-only desire with setup and closure presence, but no friction or cost development.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Calculated spontaneity is asserted once mid-story: "the calculated spontaneity that drove her to take risks and push boundaries." The tone is not coherent or modulated under pressure; most beats read as patient observation, not spontaneous risk. The phrase is a label rather than a lived texture in syntax or choice. Single mention, no development, does not charge the final image.</comment>
