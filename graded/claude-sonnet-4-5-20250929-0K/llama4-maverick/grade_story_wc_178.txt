<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The astronomer is a passive vessel for cosmic events rather than an active agent. No on-page micro-choices reveal conflicting impulses or hierarchy of values—only abstract yearning ("quest for transcendence") that never faces a concrete test. The "frugal" and "empirically ironic" traits are labeled but never constrain or complicate action. The ending declares transformation complete without dramatizing a single foreclosed option or visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>No identifiable closure unit. The astronomer performs a ritual ("raised the tile to the fading light") and the universe simply responds in harmony—no reversal, no cost, no reconfiguration of prior material. The piece offers summary narration of a metaphysical union without showing what changes, what is lost, or what options narrow. Orientation is severely delayed: who/where/when remain vague past 120 words; "ancient Babylonian palace reimagined" never clarifies era, architecture, or physical stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Vivid atmospheric descriptors ("dusky harmony," "twilight and stardust") but the palace remains a postcard backdrop with no spatial choreography or environmental constraint on action. The magic square tile is described lyrically but never handled, manipulated, or used to shape a choice. Setting does not pressure tactics or contribute to the ending's charge.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Stakes are declared ("seal a covenant") but never tested on the page. No reversal, no tightening choice, no trade-off. The astronomer decides to raise a tile and the cosmos complies without resistance or complication. Escalation is replaced by a static crescendo of poetic assertion.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Theme ("unity of celestial and terrestrial") is stated repeatedly in near-identical formulations rather than emerging from action. The final paragraph moralizes directly: "mysteries of the universe were, in fact, a reflection of their own deepest self." No concrete image or irony reweights prior material; the piece tells its thesis rather than earning resonance through particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Omniscient distance with no stable POV anchor; narration claims knowledge ("the astronomer knew") without embodied perception. Diction is uniformly elevated and abstract, drifting into purple ("aglow with an inner fire," "ethereal glow") without character-specific texture. Free indirect style is attempted but collapses into summarized interiority and declarative certainty.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Pervasive paraphrase loops: "dusky harmony" appears four times; "encrypted devotion" seven times, always as a label without functional variation. Template cadence saturates the text: "The astronomer [verb]" opens seven consecutive paragraphs mid-piece. Heavy filter-verb stacks ("sensed," "felt," "knew") dull immediacy in every high-pressure beat. Stock metaphors ("inner fire," "wings of… harmony") and synonym churn ("mysteries," "secrets," "enigmas") replace concrete action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>The core premise—astronomer deciphers ancient artifact to unify realms—is a widely used template executed without transformation. Emotional beats are generic ("overwhelming urge," "sense of wonder") and could apply to any mystic-discovery plot. No fresh angle, no specific lived detail, no risk-taking that heightens stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>The frugal astronomer is present throughout but makes no on-page decisions that alter tactics or cost. "Frugal" is mentioned once and never constrains a choice; the astronomer's actions are passive observations and a final ritual gesture that meets no resistance.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The magic square tile is introduced early, deciphered mid-story, and raised at the climax. However, its use is largely descriptive; the astronomer never manipulates, tests, or wrestles with its mechanics. It appears in three beats but without evolving function or causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Encrypted devotion" is a thematic label repeated seven times but never dramatized as a choice-shaping concept. The decryption happens off-page ("painstakingly deciphered") and does not alter on-page tactics or stakes.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.4</grade><comment>"Empirically ironic" is asserted once in paragraph 5 as a label without any subsequent action that demonstrates skepticism conflicting with wonder. The trait does not constrain or enable a single beat.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Uncloak" appears twice as metaphor ("uncloak the mysteries," "encrypted devotion, now uncloaked") but is never enacted as a distinct physical or intellectual action. The decipherment is summarized, not shown, and could be replaced with "reveal" or "discover" with no structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Through schematic representations" is mentioned once in paragraph 6 as a method of decipherment but never detailed or shown shaping an attempt. It arrives mid-story and does not recur or affect the ending.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The "ancient Babylonian palace reimagined" frames the entire piece and supplies atmospheric detail ("crumbling frescoes," "labyrinthine corridors"). However, it functions as a backdrop rather than a constraint; no architectural feature or spatial limit pressures a choice. Present across beats but not causally active.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Between regimes" is signaled in paragraph 7 as a liminal moment but does not impose a deadline or alter tactics. The timeframe provides thematic flavor ("threshold between eras") without tightening decisions on the page.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"To seal a covenant with the unknown" is stated as the astronomer's motivation in paragraph 8 and recurs at closure. However, it is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or visible friction. The desire meets no resistance or cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Dusky harmony" is named four times and sustained as a tonal register throughout (twilight imagery, blended celestial/terrestrial mood). The tone modulates minimally with pressure but does charge the final image with consistent atmospheric weight. Functional but not dynamic.</comment>
