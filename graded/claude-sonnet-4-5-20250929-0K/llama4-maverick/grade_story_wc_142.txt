<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Ava exists only as a label ("culture shock absorber," "orderly intuitive") without embodied interiority or contradiction. The text summarizes her actions and motivations rather than dramatizing choices under pressure; we never see her sweat, hesitate, or pay a visible cost for her dual allegiance. The final paragraphs assert that "her dual allegiance had been tested, and found true" without showing the test on the page. No micro-choices reveal competing impulses; she moves through the plot as a smoothly competent archetype.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive by the opening paragraph and the threat is signaled early, satisfying basic structure. However, the piece offers no on-page closure: the ending asserts that "residents stood ready" and Ava "would remain," but no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing occurs—the final lines summarize future intention rather than landing a cost-laden image or act. The drive lens reads Causal in setup but dissolves into summary, with no because/therefore linkage tightening options at the end. The cost-proof test fails: no sentence in the ending beat makes visible what Ava or the community has sacrificed or irreversibly altered.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The raft city carnival is vividly sketched in the opening (music, smells, makeshift engineering) and returns in the final third as "a beacon of hope." The foundation stone chip is a concrete object that recurs and charges the graffiti motif. However, the setting never constrains a choice or alters tactics; it remains scenic backdrop rather than pressure. Spatial choreography (food stall, walls) is clear but static. The micro-setting allowance is not met because no object or space forces Ava's hand in a scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving the city's essence against gentrification—is signaled in paragraph five and repeated frequently. Yet escalation is absent: Ava begins leaving messages, the messages spread, unity grows, and the residents "stand ready" in a smooth accumulation without reversal, tightening, or on-page cost. No moment forces Ava to choose between competing goods or pay a price that alters later tactics. The "privatization deadline loomed" at the end, but no decision, renunciation, or act narrows options or forecloses a path on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>A coherent theme—community resilience, collective action versus commodification—emerges from events and the graffiti motif. The foundation stone chip and the carnival recur with modest reweighting. However, the final paragraphs state theme overtly: "a testament to the strength of community, and the power of the human spirit" and "a reminder of the power of collective action." These summary assertions replace a resonant, non-literal image. The ending offers no fresh inflection or ambiguity; it moralizes rather than charging prior material with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited on Ava throughout; no head-hopping. Distance is consistent but generic: "she knew," "filled her with," "drove her" are repeated filter-verb stems that dull immediacy. Diction is competent but lacks a perceptual signature—Ava's way of noticing is not character-specific. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction is not tested. The prose reads as committee consensus rather than a singular idiom. Psychic distance never modulates with pressure; the narrative voice remains at the same register from opening to close.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Frequent paraphrase loops and template cadence mar momentum: "Ava's dual allegiance… drove her" / "Ava's actions were not without risk, but she was driven"; "The city, after all, was more than…" / "The perpetual carnival… would continue to thrive, a testament to…"; "As the days passed" / "In the end" / "As the privatization deadline loomed." Runs of "Ava [verb], [gerund phrase]" and "The [noun], [appositive]" create drumbeat rhythm. Figurative language is sparse and conventional (beacon, spirit, heart), avoiding overwriting but also texture. Information density is low; many sentences restate stakes without advancing pressure. The paragraph-cut test fails for multiple blocks in the final third that summarize rather than advance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The core premise—community organizer uses graffiti to resist gentrification—is familiar from countless urban narratives and writing prompts. The raft-city carnival adds surface novelty but does not transform the template: remove the raft and the plot arc is unchanged. The graffiti method and foundation-stone chip are concrete but not fresh angles. Emotional specificity is absent; Ava's "hopeful desperation" is asserted, not embodied in lived detail. No turn feels inevitable in hindsight; the story progresses as a to-do list. The transformation test fails.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Ava (culture shock absorber) is named and her profession frames the premise, but her choices do not create turns. She begins the graffiti campaign and the text asserts it succeeds; no on-page decision alters tactics or costs her something. Present across beats but replaceable—any community organizer role would serve. Missing middle development (no choice that narrows options) and closure participation (the ending summarizes her continued role without a final act). Late penalty does not apply (introduced paragraph 3), but swappability and ornamental use cap the score. No specific cost tied to her profession.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The foundation stone chip is introduced in paragraph 11, reappears in paragraph 27 as "a symbol of resistance," and is mentioned again in the final paragraph. Setup is late (beyond first third, −0.3); it constrains no choice and is described rather than handled. The chip does gain modest symbolic weight by the end (early-final reprise that reweights meaning, +0.5), qualifying for lyric-resonance allowance. However, no causal pressure or visible cost is tied to it; it remains ornamental. Three touches across beats (+0.9) and closure linkage (mentioned in final paragraph, +0.4) elevate slightly, but swappability and late introduction limit the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Dual allegiance is stated in paragraph 7 ("to her adopted city and to the principles of community") and echoed in paragraph 26 ("Ava's dual allegiance had been tested, and found true"). The concept does not shape on-page choices or create friction; no scene shows Ava torn between conflicting loyalties or paying a cost to honor one over the other. It functions as thematic label rather than stake-driver. Present at setup and closure mention, but missing middle development (no choice constrained by the dual pull). Label-only trait (−0.3), summary-only (−0.3).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Orderly intuitive" appears once in paragraph 4 ("With her orderly intuitive nature, she navigated…") and once obliquely in paragraph 23 ("her orderly intuitive nature"). The trait is asserted but never dramatized: no scene shows Ava's intuition enabling a tactical choice or her orderliness constraining one. Label-only mention with no causal work. Missing all three gates (no setup action, no middle choice, no closure use). Introduced early but purely ornamental; could be cut with zero plot impact. Label-only (−0.3), ornamental (−0.7).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Reorganize" is named in paragraph 8 ("She began to reorganize the city's cultural landscape") and echoed in paragraph 22 ("The residents… began to reorganize themselves"). The action drives the middle section: Ava's reorganization via graffiti is the primary tactic. However, the mechanics are vague and the outcome is summarized rather than shown in a specific scene. Present in setup (paragraph 8), development (graffiti spread, paragraph 13–19), and closure (paragraph 22, residents reorganize), meeting all three gates. Causal role in one extended beat (+0.4), but no visible cost tied to the act itself. Swappability concern: "mobilize" or "unite" could replace with minor edits (−0.5).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Graffiti messages are introduced in paragraph 9, detailed in paragraphs 10–14, and their spread drives paragraphs 17–21. The method shapes the middle third and is present at closure (paragraph 27 mentions "the graffiti"). Setup by first third, development across multiple beats (messages appear, spark unity, avoid detection), and closure linkage (the graffiti narrative "would remain"). However, no specific cost or constraint tied to the method is shown—Ava's messages succeed without friction or detection risk realized on the page. Three beats (+1.4), closure mention (+0.4), early signal (+0.5), but generic execution (graffiti as resistance is familiar) and no felt cost limit the score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The raft city carnival is established in the opening paragraph with vivid sensory detail (music, smells, "makeshift engineering") and returns in the final third as "a beacon of hope" and "a testament." It supplies atmosphere and frames the stakes but never constrains a choice or alters tactics. Ava does not navigate physical obstacles, use the carnival's resources, or adapt her plan based on the setting's properties. Present at setup and closure (reprise in final paragraphs), but missing middle development—no scene where the setting pressures a decision. Postcard description rather than micro-setting that shapes action. Ornamental (−0.7), missing middle gate (cap 3.4 avoided by closure mention, but swappability and lack of causal work hold the score low).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The privatization threat is introduced in paragraph 6 ("gentrification loomed") and recurs in paragraphs 21 ("the threat of privatization drew closer") and 25 ("As the privatization deadline loomed"). The timeframe signals urgency and frames the stakes but does not tighten tactics on the page—no scene shows Ava racing a clock or altering her plan because time is short. Present across beats and at closure, but the deadline is asserted rather than felt. Functional role in framing pressure (+0.4), closure linkage (+0.4), but no visible cost or choice shaped by the ticking clock. Summary-only use (−0.3).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Gentrification is the central external threat named in paragraph 5 and drives Ava's campaign throughout. The motivation is clear and sustained, shaping the graffiti tactic and the residents' eventual unity. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized in conflicted choices—no scene shows Ava tempted by an easier path, torn between preservation and personal cost, or paying a visible price for her stance. Present at setup, development (graffiti campaign), and closure (residents "ready to face"), meeting all gates. Functional across beats (+0.9), but missing friction between want and cost that would elevate into higher bands. Summary-only (−0.3).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Hopeful desperation" is named once in paragraph 6 ("filled her with a sense of hopeful desperation") and echoed in paragraph 28 ("their hopeful desperation giving way to determination"). The tone is asserted rather than embodied in the prose: sentences remain declarative and even-keeled throughout, with no modulation reflecting rising pressure or the contradictory pull of hope and despair. The piece reads as summary rather than felt experience. Present at setup and closure echo, missing middle modulation. Static mood (mid-low band per guidance), label-only (−0.3), summary-only (−0.3).</comment>
