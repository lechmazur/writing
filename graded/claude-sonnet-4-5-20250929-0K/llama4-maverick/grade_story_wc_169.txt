<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Aria is presented with abstract philosophical motivations ("puzzle out new equations for hope") but no contradictory impulses or embodied struggle. Her interiority relies on stock phrasing ("sense of excitement and wonder," "heart pounding in her chest") without character-particular texture. The visionary moment is told rather than dramatized through micro-choices, and no visible cost forecloses a path—she simply returns to peaceful clarity. The final smile and reassurance flatten any tension that might have accumulated.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early enough. However, no decisive change occurs on the page; Aria begins in contemplation, has a vision, and returns to the same state with identical decorations and gauge in hand. The "crucial step forward" is asserted rather than dramatized through altered options or cost. Under a blended lens (leans Accumulative/Textural but never commits), the vision sequence should reweight stakes, yet it resolves into generic affirmation without legible consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The grotto is vividly rendered with tide-polished stone, lapping waves, and filtered light, and the decorations (shells, pebbles, driftwood) are handled on the page. However, the environment never constrains a choice or supplies a resource that alters outcome; it remains atmospheric backdrop. The altitude gauge pulses with blue light but does not functionally shape tactics. Spatial choreography is clear, but the setting serves illustration rather than pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"puzzle out new equations for hope"—is abstract and never tested by a concrete on-page dilemma. No reversal or tightening narrows options; the visionary sequence is presented as affirming rather than complicating. Aria faces no trade-off, loss, or escalating cost. The story declares transformation ("crucial step forward") without dramatizing the pressure or price that would earn it.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme gestures toward hope, imagination, and the multiverse, but it emerges through direct statement ("new equations for hope," "ripple effect...across parallel timelines") rather than concrete particulars. The altitude gauge and trial balloons function as symbols declared by narration instead of accruing meaning through action. The ending reassures without ambiguity or a resonant non-literal answer; the final paragraph moralizes comfort rather than reweighting prior material with cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The prose maintains stable third-person limited focalization with no head-hopping. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("serene upheaval," "vast expanse of the multiverse") that feels more authorial than character-particular. Perceptual signature is generic; Aria's way of noticing lacks idiosyncratic bias. Internal monologue relies on filter verbs and abstraction ("felt a sense of," "knew that she was") without rhythmic modulation under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Multiple paraphrase loops appear: "mysteries of the universe" / "mysteries she sought to unlock"; "soft, ethereal light" / "soft, blue light"; "sense of excitement and wonder" / "sense of peace and clarity." Template cadence clusters around "she felt," "she knew," and "as she" openers. Stock metaphors ("heart pounding in her chest," "glimmer of hope") and therapy-speak ("sense of peace and clarity") dull peak beats. The vision paragraph stacks simultaneity errors and overwriting without propulsion. Applying patterned-artifact penalties: paraphrase loops, template cadence, and stock phrasing across multiple beats trigger baseline −1.0 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The premise—solitary dreamer in a mystical grotto contemplating abstract universal mysteries—follows a familiar template without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. "Trial balloons" and "equations for hope" are metaphors asserted rather than dramatized with specificity. The multiverse vision and decorative patterns feel ornamental rather than inevitable. No bold risk-taking heightens stakes; the story chooses the safety middle, affirming wonder without consequence.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Aria is present throughout but makes no key decision that alters tactics or options. Her "logical dreamer" trait is label-only; observation and reflection dominate without agency. The vision happens to her, and she returns unchanged. Late-setup friction minimal since she's introduced early, but causal pressure and closure linkage are absent. Swappable with "contemplative philosopher" or similar archetype.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The altitude gauge appears in three beats: initial holding, pulsing during the vision, and clutched at the end. However, it is never used or manipulated; it merely glows symbolically. No mechanics matter, no choice depends on it, and removing it would not break story logic—Aria could meditate on decorations alone. Present across beats but ornamental, capped by swappability and lack of causal work.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Trial balloons" are mentioned twice as metaphor for her ideas, with one vision of launching them. The concept does not shape on-page stakes or alter tactics; it functions as thematic decoration. No choice hinges on testing an idea, no balloon "fails" to create pressure. Setup is early, but development and closure participation are summary-only, limiting the score to low-functional band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Lucidly watchful" appears twice as descriptor ("eyes were lucidly watchful," "lucidly watchful and always ready") but never constrains or enables an action with cost. It is label-only attribute without dramatized trade-off. No beat shows her watchfulness catching a detail that alters her next move. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Aria arranges decorations into patterns in the middle section, an act framed as meditative and revitalizing. The action is shown on the page and the grotto "transforms" around her, but no turn traces causally to this arranging—the vision could occur without it. Functional in one beat, but swappable with generic contemplative activity. Closure does not hinge on the patterns she created.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The method appears in one extended beat where she arranges shells, pebbles, and driftwood into intricate patterns. The act is described but its mechanics do not matter; no pattern unlocks insight or constrains a later choice. The decorations "seem to dance" but this is passive observation. Present in middle development, absent from closure, and easily replaceable with journaling or sketching.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The tide-polished grotto with lapping waves is established early, sustained through the middle, and present at the ending ("surrounded by the gentle lapping of the waves"). It provides atmosphere and a meditative frame, and the entrance filters light during the vision. However, it never pressures a choice or supplies a resource that alters outcome. Micro-setting presence across all three gates, but ornamental rather than causal, places it in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>"Across parallel timelines" is mentioned once in the middle as a hopeful effect Aria imagines, with no mechanics, no pressure, and no return. The story unfolds in a single continuous present with no temporal branching or constraint. Timeframe is essentially absent from story logic; the phrase is thematic decoration only.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The motivation "to puzzle out new equations for hope" is stated early and recurs, framing Aria's activity. However, it remains abstract and is never dramatized through a concrete dilemma or conflicting desire. No friction arises between this want and a cost or competing need. The motivation anchors the premise but does not drive a choice that alters tactics, limiting it to functional-but-replaceable range.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Serene upheaval" is named once mid-story ("air was filled with a sense of serene upheaval") and the tone does attempt to balance calm meditation with visionary intensity. The grotto remains peaceful while the vision escalates, creating mild tonal contrast. However, tone does not modulate purposefully with pressure—the ending returns to identical serenity without charging the final image. Present across the arc but static, placing it in the lower end of the functional band.</comment>
