<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Maya's motivations are declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses—she walks through the tunnel "consumed by the case" but also processing her own past without visible friction between investigative duty and personal breakthrough. The "watchfully calm" trait appears as a label without constraining choices; no moment shows her sacrificing speed for caution or vice versa. The final liberation from "controlling influence" arrives through passive absorption of atmosphere rather than a decision that forecloses a path. Internal voice relies on therapy-speak ("fortified vulnerability," "entangled memories") and the epiphany about breaking free feels inserted rather than earned by prior struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Orientation is established early (investigator, tunnel, case), but the causal chain is weak: Maya walks, feels emotions, and emerges transformed without a single decision or discovery that changes her options. The "entangled memories" untangle through ambient exposure to the tunnel rather than through empirical observation or a specific trigger. The closure unit attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (she exits at peace), but no visible cost anchors it—she sacrifices nothing, confronts no choice, and the case itself dissolves into backdrop. The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural by intent, yet the final image merely asserts peace without reweighting prior pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The subway tunnel is anchored early with sensory detail (damp earth, decay, dripping water, graffiti, rusty pipes) and the lantern provides recurring concrete imagery. The inscription "Free at last" is discovered and charged with meaning at the closure. However, the environment never constrains a choice—Maya moves freely without spatial challenge, and the setting functions as mood rather than obstacle. The lantern's "rich history" is told rather than demonstrated through specific mechanics or cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—solving the young woman's death—is declared but never tested on the page; no evidence is gathered, no hypothesis forms, no obstacles appear. The secondary stake (Maya's freedom from her past) unfolds through passive immersion without a single tightening choice. No reversal occurs; the dripping water and lantern light simply accompany her walk until she feels better. Coincidence (the tunnel's atmosphere) resolves both threads without agency, and the final peace arrives without visible cost or foreclosed path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The theme of freedom from the past is overtly stated ("break free from the controlling influence") and repeated in the inscription and final paragraphs rather than emerging from dramatized choices. The lantern's connection to the underground railroad is asserted as thematic resonance without specific historical detail or on-page cost. The ending offers a mood shift (peace) but not a non-literal answer to a dramatized question. The final line's symbolism (lantern's light fading) gestures toward meaning but does not reweight prior material since no prior material involved genuine conflict.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and the perceptual signature (investigator's eye for detail) is present in observations of graffiti and pipes. However, diction drifts into elevated abstractions ("fortified vulnerability," "residual emotions," "catalyst for memories") that feel authorial rather than character-specific. The prose rhythm is uniform across emotional beats—no compression under pressure. No dialogue appears. Filter verbs ("felt," "noticed," "realized") stack throughout without variation, dulling immediacy at key moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: paragraphs 6–7 restate "memories entangled/untangled" three times; paragraphs 14–15 cycle through "dripping water" and "reminder" phrasing. Template cadence runs through the middle third: "Maya's [noun] [verb]" appears in eight consecutive paragraphs. Stock metaphors ("weight of the past," "shedding a skin," "path to freedom") cluster without fresh vehicle. The final third stacks filter verbs ("felt," "knew," "seemed") in nearly every line, flattening momentum. Synonym churn: "watchfully calm" / "at peace" / "grounded" / "connected" rotate without advancement. Deductions: paraphrase −0.4, template cadence −0.6, stock metaphor density −0.5, filter stacks −0.4 = cumulative −1.9, plus artifacts touch closure for additional −0.3; cap at 5.9 with artifacts in final third disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The premise—investigator processes personal trauma while investigating a death—follows a familiar template without transformation; the case itself vanishes into metaphor. The underground railroad lantern and tunnel setting are vivid but not synthesized into a fresh angle; the historical connection is asserted rather than earned through specific period detail or moral calculus. Emotional arc (burdened → liberated) could function with any setting. The turn relies on ambient atmosphere rather than a choice or discovery that grows from prior particulars. No bold risk elevates the execution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Present throughout as POV character, but "preventable death investigator" role is mentioned and not enacted—no evidence is gathered, no investigation unfolds, no professional choice is made. The occupation functions as label. Introduced early but never developed; case is backdrop only. Swappable with "social worker" or "psychologist" without structural change. Cap 4.6 for missing middle development; lower to 3.2 for ornamental use and lack of causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lantern appears early (paragraph 2), is carried throughout, and returns in the final image ("still clutched in her hand," "light fading"). Its underground railroad history is told but never shown through specific use or constraint. It illuminates but does not enable or narrow a choice. Three beats (intro, middle mention, final image) with early setup and closure participation meet two-of-three gates, but causal pressure is absent. Charged reprise at end lifts score within 5.5–6.3 range; no higher due to lack of cost or irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Entangled memories" appear in paragraph 7 and are referenced throughout as theme, but they do not create stakes or constrain tactics—Maya simply feels them "untangle" through passive exposure. The concept is told rather than dramatized through specific memory content or friction. No decision hinges on disentangling them. Introduced in second third (late signal −0.4); ornamental/thematic use without action pressure −0.8; summary-only −0.6; cumulative −1.8 from baseline 5.9 = 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Watchfully calm" is mentioned three times (paragraphs 4, 15, 24) but never constrains or enables an action with cost. No moment shows her choosing observation over speed, or calm over urgency. Label-only trait without tradeoff. Early signal present but no middle development or closure participation beyond final reprise; missing two gates caps at 2.8. Label-only use −0.3, swappable with "focused" or "composed" −0.4 = 2.1, but lyric reprise in final line slightly elevates to 2.6.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Reverberate" appears twice: dripping water reverberates (paragraph 5) and continues to reverberate (paragraph 14), marking a mood shift from death-reminder to life-reminder. The action does not drive a turn; it accompanies Maya's internal shift. Swappable with "echo" or "resound" without altering structure. Present early and at closure (two gates), but no middle causal role; charged slightly by reweighting in final third. Cap 6.9 for two-gate eligibility; lower for passivity and swappability to 5.4.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Through empirical observation" appears once (paragraph 9) as a summary claim that Maya "had pieced together" events, but no observation, evidence-gathering, or method is shown on the page. The investigation itself is absent. Introduced mid-story, never enacted, and absent from closure. Missing all three gates caps at 2.8; summary-only use −0.6, complete swappability −0.8 = 1.4, but single mention prevents zero score; settle at 1.8.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Subway maintenance tunnel is introduced in opening line, provides sensory detail and the inscription discovery (paragraph 11), and frames the entire journey to closure. However, it never constrains movement or choice—Maya walks freely without obstacle. The setting supplies atmosphere but does not alter tactics. Present in all three gates (setup, middle discovery, closure frame) and causally involved in one beat (inscription), but lacks pressure or irreplaceability. Eligible for ≥6.1; causal involvement in one beat +0.4, closure linkage (frame only, not active) +0.3, but no constraint on choice holds score at 6.2.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.2</grade><comment>"After the drought ends" and "rains came" appear in opening line and closing paragraph but exert no pressure on decisions or tactics. The timeframe is backdrop; no urgency, deadline, or temporal constraint shapes Maya's investigation. Present at setup and closure (two gates, eligible to ~6.0), but entirely ornamental. Cap 4.6 for missing middle development; ornamental use −0.8, swappable with any weather −0.6, no causal work −1.0 = 1.2.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"To break free from a controlling influence" is explicitly stated (paragraph 12) and revisited at closure (paragraph 23), but the motivation is declared rather than dramatized through conflicted choices. No on-page moment shows the controlling influence, the friction it creates, or a cost Maya pays to resist it. The breakthrough is passive. Present at setup (implicit in her discomfort) and closure (stated resolution), missing middle dramatization; two gates eligible to ~6.0. Told-only friction −0.8, no visible cost −0.6, late explicit statement (paragraph 12, second third) −0.3 = cumulative −1.7 from 6.8 baseline = 5.1.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Fortified vulnerability" appears once (paragraph 16) as a label without modulation. The tone throughout is consistently somber and introspective; no intensification under pressure or shift that charges the final image. Single static mood. Introduced late (past midpoint), never developed, and absent from closure paragraph. Missing setup and development caps at 3.4; label-only use without tonal embodiment −0.4, but lyric vocabulary slightly elevates to 3.8 within cap.</comment>
