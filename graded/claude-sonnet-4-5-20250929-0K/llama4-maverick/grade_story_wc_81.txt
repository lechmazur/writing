<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to "trace honest origins" is declared but never dramatized through contradictory impulses or genuine stakes. Her "tranquilly perceptive" state and "dappled resolve" read as label-only attributes without embodied contradiction or cost. The decryption work and stamp use unfold without visible struggle, mistake, or trade-off—she succeeds linearly. Internal experience consists of satisfaction and excitement rather than competing pressures that force a choice with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who and where early, though the "sunken city" and "blackout above" remain abstract backdrops. The story follows a single continuous scene but lacks a legible closure unit with on-page cost: Elara deciphers the code, stamps the margin, and ascends with renewed purpose—no path is foreclosed, no stance crystallized with felt price. The narrative reads as a sequence of successful steps (causal lens inferred) but delivers no decisive change or resonant reconfiguration at the ending. The Cost Proof Test fails: no exact sentence in the final third demonstrates a visible or felt sacrifice that reweights prior material.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The forgotten library and antique ink stamp are established early and described with concrete detail (dusty tomes, aged paper, ornate handle). The stamp is handled multiple times and leaves a visible mark, satisfying micro-setting criteria. However, the environment does not constrain choice or materially affect outcome—Elara's decryption proceeds unhindered by the water, darkness, or blackout. The stamp's "deep, rich blue" impression charges the final beats modestly, but spatial choreography and the sunken city remain largely postcard description without tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"trace honest origins"—is signaled early but never tightened or tested by opposition. Elara encounters a coded text and solves it through "alternative hypothesis" without visible friction, error, or competing pressures. No reversal or deepening narrows her options; the blackout and sunken setting impose no clock or resource constraint. The ending declares "hope" and "pride" without demonstrating a trade-off or foreclosed path. Escalation is absent under the causal lens; the narrative advances through "and then" rather than "therefore."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>A theme of reclaiming forgotten knowledge emerges from the setting and Elara's task, and the ink stamp accrues modest symbolic weight as a "tangible connection to the past." However, the final paragraph lapses into abstraction ("dappled resolve," "lessons she had learned") and moralizes the journey without a resonant non-literal image. The "alternative hypothesis" and code-breaking remain plot mechanics rather than thematic particulars that reweight the premise. No tension between wants and needs or competing goods sharpens the peak choice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction is consistent but leans toward elevated register ("tranquilly perceptive," "reclaimed stillness") that feels imposed rather than character-particular. No dialogue appears. Perceptual signature is generic—Elara notices "dusty tomes" and "aged paper" without bias or selective attention tied to her profession. Interior thought alternates between declaration of purpose and summary of satisfaction, lacking the compression or rhythm shift that would reflect stress or discovery.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "Elara felt…" appears five times; "the antique ink stamp" recurs in near-identical constructions; adjacent sentences restate content without added pressure (e.g., paragraph 2's "deep connection" and "silence had been waiting"). Stock metaphors ("pieces began to fall into place") and abstract intensifiers ("sense of excitement building") replace concrete progression. Register drifts into corporate-speak ("formulate an alternative hypothesis") mid-peak without voice motivation. Deductions: paraphrase −0.2, template stems −0.5, stock phrasing −0.4, totaling −1.1 in Q7. Final artifacts touch the closure paragraph ("dappled resolve," "lessons she had learned"), triggering the artifact-in-final-third cap at 8.8 globally and disallowing 9+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The premise—lone scholar deciphers code in a forgotten library—follows a familiar template without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The "sunken city" and "blackout" remain cosmetic rather than integral to the decryption puzzle. The ink stamp and "alternative hypothesis" could be swapped for generic equivalents (a pencil, a different cipher approach) with minimal structural change. Emotional specificity is thin; Elara's arc from curiosity to satisfaction avoids bold risk or ambiguity. The transformation test fails: the plot and emotional beats work unchanged with different names and setting.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her decryption work drives beats, but her choices do not create reversals or force trade-offs. She decides to "readjust her approach" and "formulate an alternative hypothesis," yet these decisions unfold without visible cost or narrowed options. Her role as "logical page indexer" is stated but does not constrain her methods or shape the final image. Setup and development gates are met; closure participation is ornamental (she ascends with the stamp). Functional but swappable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The antique ink stamp appears in setup (paragraph 3), is handled and described (paragraph 9), used to annotate (paragraphs 12–13), and present at closure (final paragraph). It enables the annotation beat and its "deep, rich blue" impression charges that moment modestly. However, the stamp does not constrain choice—a modern pen could serve the same plot function—and it does not return with reweighted meaning at the ending. All three gates met; two beats involved; modest causal pressure and specificity lift it into mid-band, but swappability and lack of cost connection cap it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Reclaimed stillness" is mentioned in paragraphs 2 and 14 but functions as thematic echo rather than shaping stakes or tactics. It does not alter Elara's decryption approach, constrain her choices, or participate visibly in the closure image. Setup gate met; middle development and closure participation missing. Ornamental use; no causal pressure. Cap at 2.8 (missing closure participation).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Tranquilly perceptive" appears in paragraph 1 and is referenced indirectly in paragraph 20. It reads as a label-only attribute without enabling or constraining on-page action. Elara's perception does not narrow or sharpen under pressure, and no visible trade-off (e.g., missing a threat due to calm focus) arises. Setup gate met; middle and closure gates missing. Decorative mention; no cost. Cap at 2.8 (missing closure), then apply label-only deduction −0.3 and ornamental use −0.1 → 2.4.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Readjust" appears once in paragraph 6 when Elara feels "the need to readjust her approach" and consider an alternative hypothesis. This moment signals a method shift but does not create a reversal or redefine options—she proceeds directly to successful decryption. The action is not revisited or tied to the closure image. Setup gate met; middle development weak; closure gate missing. Swappable with "reconsider" or "revise." Functional but not essential. Cap at 2.8 (missing closure), one beat involvement +0.4, weak causal signal +0.2 → 3.4; round to 4.1 floor (cap is 4.6 for missing setup, but setup is present; apply mid-development weakness instead).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Alternative hypothesis" is introduced in paragraph 6, elaborated in paragraph 10, and validated in paragraph 20. It shapes Elara's decryption method across multiple beats and proves correct at closure. However, the mechanics remain abstract—no on-page demonstration of how the hypothesis differs from a simpler cipher or what cost it imposes. All three gates met; two beats involved; modest causal pressure. Swappability (could be "layered cipher" or "recursive key") and abstraction limit it. Specificity is weak; closure linkage modest.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The forgotten library in the sunken city is anchored early and provides continuous setting. It supplies the coded text and the context for Elara's work. However, the waterlogged environment, blackout, and submersion do not constrain her choices or supply resources that alter tactics—she reads, deciphers, and annotates without impediment. The library participates in the closure image (she "ascended into the darkness") but does not charge it with new meaning. All three gates met; two beats (arrival, departure); weak causal pressure. Postcard description dominates over tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"During the blackout" is mentioned in paragraph 5 and implied in the final ascent, but the timeframe does not tighten decisions or impose a clock. Elara works "as the hours passed" (paragraph 17) without urgency or resource constraint. The blackout functions as backdrop rather than active pressure. Setup and closure gates met; middle development missing. No causal tightening. Cap at 2.8 (missing development), then apply vague tracking −0.2 and lyric reprise +0.5 (it frames and closes the piece) → 3.1; adjust upward for presence in two paragraphs +0.5 → 3.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Trace honest origins" is stated in paragraph 4, motivates the decryption work throughout, and is referenced obliquely at closure ("uncovered a piece of history"). It provides continuous motivation but is never dramatized through conflicting desires or visible friction—Elara wants to understand, encounters a code, and solves it without internal debate or cost. All three gates met; two beats; weak causal pressure (desire drives action but faces no opposition). Told-only motivation with no friction or trade-off caps it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Dappled resolve" appears explicitly in paragraphs 8 and 21 and is evoked by "tranquilly perceptive" and "hope" throughout. However, tone remains static—Elara's calm satisfaction does not modulate with pressure or deepen through conflict. The final paragraph repeats the phrase without reweighting it. Setup and closure gates met; middle development weak (no tonal shift under stress). Single static mood with lyric reprise. Cap at 2.8 (missing development), apply lyric-resonance allowance +0.8, template repetition −0.2 → 3.4; adjust for presence in final image +0.5 → 3.9.</comment>
