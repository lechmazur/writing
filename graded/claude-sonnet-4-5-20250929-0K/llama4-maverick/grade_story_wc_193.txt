<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lyra's interiority is largely absent; we receive label-only characterization ("virtuously mischievous grin") without embodied emotion or contradictory impulses acting in scene. The pyramid-scheme backstory is mentioned but never shapes a present choice or creates visible friction. Her decision to volunteer and experiment with the messages proceeds without internal resistance or cost, reading as plot convenience rather than earned character pressure. The final moment offers no renunciation or visible trade-off—diamonds rain down and she smiles, foreclosing nothing.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: who Lyra is beyond a name, where exactly she stands in the farm, and what the quantum promise concretely means remain vague past the 120-word mark, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). The closure lacks visible cost; diamonds appear, Lyra laughs, and walks away with no option foreclosed or price paid on the page. Causality is thin: glitchy messages guide her actions, but the link between her touching the bolt, the machines behaving erratically, and the diamond shower is asserted rather than dramatized through motivated steps. The drive lens is ambiguous—neither strict causal linkage nor accumulative pattern is taught—and closure does not land as DC, RR, or CR with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The bioluminescent mushroom farm supplies vivid sensory anchors (sweet scent, ethereal glow) and the lab machines hum and whir, but spatial choreography within the lab remains generic. The submarine porthole bolt is handled twice (found, then touched in pocket) but does not constrain a choice or charge the final image in a way that alters tactics. Sensory detail is present but not filtered through Lyra's professional or personal priorities; the setting reads as backdrop rather than crucible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—translating pressure into diamonds—is signaled early, but escalation is absent. Lyra experiments, machines behave erratically, pressure builds, then diamonds rain down without a reversal, tightening choice, or visible trade-off. Coincidence (the glitchy messages) enables the resolution rather than protagonist agency narrowing options. No on-page cost forecloses a path; the ending grants success without renunciation or price, failing the escalation and cost-clarity tests under any inferred lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Theme is asserted through labels—"quantum promise," "shadowseam wonder"—rather than emerging from concrete particulars. The porthole bolt and glitchy messages are mentioned but never constrain a choice or accumulate pressure that reweights meaning at closure. The final image (diamonds raining, Lyra smiling) offers no non-literal answer to a central question; it is a literal wish-fulfillment without resonance or conceptual cost. Thematic statements ("magic was waiting to be found") replace earned insight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited, and the narrative distance is consistent. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("virtuously mischievous," "shadowseam wonder") that feels authorial rather than rooted in Lyra's perceptual signature. No dialogue appears, so subtext and voice distinction tests do not apply. Filter verbs ("felt," "knew") are frequent but not egregiously obscuring. Psychic distance remains steady, though the prose lacks rhythmic control under pressure—the climax unfolds in the same cadence as exposition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn are pervasive: "strange, glitchy text messages" becomes "cryptic" then "glitchy text messages" again within a few lines; "virtuously mischievous grin" recurs unchanged; "shadowseam wonder" is repeated verbatim. Template cadence runs appear ("As she worked… As she looked around… As Lyra walked"). The closure beat is dulled by scaffold phrasing ("She slipped… feeling its weight as a reminder"). Figurative language is sparse but the prose lacks propulsion—information density is low, with beats restating rather than advancing. Apply artifact penalties (−1.4 cumulative for loops, template stems, and closure contamination).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The premise—bioluminescent mushroom farm, glitchy messages, translating pressure into diamonds—assembles disparate prompt elements without a unifying logic or fresh synthesis. The pyramid-scheme backstory is ornamental, the submarine bolt is a token, and the quantum promise remains an abstract label. The turn (diamonds raining) is not earned in hindsight; it feels like a prompt-checklist resolution rather than an inevitable synthesis. No bold risk or lived-in specificity transforms the material; the ending opts for tidy wish-fulfillment over complexity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Pyramid scheme survivor is mentioned once in backstory ("she had survived the pyramid scheme that had ravaged her family's finances") but never shapes a present choice, constrains an action, or alters tactics. It does not participate in closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The submarine porthole bolt appears in two beats: Lyra finds it on a shore walk (backstory), then touches it in her pocket after reading a message. One message says "The submarine porthole bolt holds the key," but the bolt is never used, manipulated under pressure, or causally active. It slips into her pocket at the end as a "reminder" without reweighted meaning. Present but ornamental; swappable with any small keepsake.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>Quantum promise is mentioned in the glitchy messages and Lyra "felt an inexplicable connection," but the concept is never defined, dramatized, or shown to change options. The ending asserts "she had fulfilled the quantum promise" without demonstrating what that entailed or what cost it carried. Label-only integration.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>Virtuously mischievous appears as a repeated label ("virtuously mischievous grin," "virtuously mischievous to the end") but never constrains or enables an on-page action. No trade-off or visible cost is tied to this trait; it functions as authorial assertion rather than dramatized attribute.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Lyra decides to volunteer at the experimental lab in the middle third, and this action grants her access to the machines. However, the decision is frictionless—no competing pull, no visible cost—and the volunteer role itself is passive: she "threw herself into the work" and "began to experiment" in summary. The action opens the setting but does not drive a major turn; it could be replaced with "was assigned" or "stumbled upon" without breaking logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Glitchy text messages from parallel dimensions appear in the first third, and Lyra uses them to "guide her actions" in the lab. One message mentions the bolt. The mechanics are never clarified—how do the messages arrive, what makes them "glitchy," what do parallel dimensions contribute?—and they do not constrain attempts or impose a cost. They function as a convenient enabler rather than a method with friction.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The bioluminescent mushroom farm is vividly described (sweet scent, ethereal glow) and recurs in the opening and closing images. The lab is a subset location where the climax occurs. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome; Lyra could achieve the same result in any lab. The mushrooms celebrate at the end ("seemed to glow with an new intensity") but this is cosmetic rather than causal. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.2</grade><comment>When concepts become physical is mentioned once as context for the messages but never dramatically enacted or used to tighten decisions. The timeframe does not create a live clock, and no tactical shift hinges on it. Vague ornamental framing.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>To translate pressure into diamonds is Lyra's stated goal, signaled early and pursued across multiple beats: she volunteers at the lab, observes the process, experiments with the messages, and the machines release diamonds at the climax. However, the desire is never conflicted—no competing want, no visible cost in pursuing it—and success is granted without friction. The motivation shapes one key turn (volunteering) and is present at closure, reaching the two-gate threshold, but lacks the friction and cost required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Shadowseam wonder is invoked twice as a label ("the shadowseam wonder of the moment") but never defined through image, rhythm, or modulation. The tone is declarative and static rather than charging the final image with ambiguity or pressure. Asserted rather than enacted.</comment>
