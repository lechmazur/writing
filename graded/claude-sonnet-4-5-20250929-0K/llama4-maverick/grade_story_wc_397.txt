<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's interior is presented largely through abstract reflection rather than embodied contradiction. The "changed" state remains vague—no on-page actions demonstrate what the gift or alteration cost or enabled. The shift from escape-desire to purpose is told rather than shown through micro-choices that narrow options. Therapy-speak ("sense of detachment," "raw and unprocessed") appears in high-pressure beats without embodied cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural but closure arrives as a stated mood ("I was at peace") rather than a decisive image or cadence shift that reweights prior material with cost. The Orientation Test is borderline: who/where anchor by ~120 words, but "woke up changed" remains abstract past midpoint. No meaningful tightening occurs—volunteering appears but does not narrow options or force a trade-off. The final paragraph loops "windborne solace" and "approaching endings" without a visible price paid on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina is anchored early with concrete sensory detail (creaking ice, cold air, light on ice). The parasol tip is handled twice but remains ornamental—it does not constrain a choice or charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean across the dock-to-shore-to-relief-center moves. The setting supplies atmosphere but does not pressure tactics; the protagonist could perform the same emotional arc in any disaster zone.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding peace or purpose post-suicide-attempt—is signaled early but never tested by a concrete choice. Volunteering is presented as backdrop labor without a moment where the protagonist must choose between escape and engagement with visible cost. "A fold in patience" is named but not dramatized as a tightening. The resolution is declared ("it was enough") rather than earned through agency that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme of impermanence and second chances emerges from the premise but is stated rather than shown: "approaching endings" and "windborne solace" are repeated as labels without accumulating pressure or reweighting prior material. The final paragraph moralizes ("cherish every moment") instead of offering a resonant image. No epiphany is earned through specific on-page struggle; the protagonist simply decides peace is enough.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>POV distance is stable first-person, and the parasol/ice sensory filtering reads character-particular. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("disparate group," "testament to the human spirit's capacity") that clashes with crisis urgency. Interiority relies on filter verbs ("I felt," "I knew") in clusters that dull immediacy. No dialogue appears. The perceptual signature is present but not rhythmically controlled under pressure—syntax remains uniform across calm and intense beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "sense of detachment"/"observing…from outside my body"; "fragile peace"/"fragile…world"; "sound of approaching endings" recurs four times without evolving. Template cadence: "I felt…I felt…I knew…I was" across the final third. Stock metaphors: "thread that might lead me back," "capacity for resilience." Filter-verb stacks in high-pressure beats (≥3 lines) dull propulsion. These artifacts touch the closure paragraph, triggering −1.7 baseline and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The euthanasia-tourist-who-survives premise is widely templated; transformation through disaster-relief volunteering is earnest but predictable. The parasol is a quirky object that does not alter the emotional arc. "Grips reality loosely" and "fold in patience" are prompt labels inserted without specific lived detail that would make them indispensable. The ending's peace-through-labor arc could port to any post-trauma setting with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The euthanasia tourist identity is revealed early but does not create key turns—no on-page choice tests the conflict between prior suicidal intent and new survival. The character observes and reflects rather than deciding under pressure. The tourist label is backstory that frames mood but does not constrain present action or charge closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>The heirloom lace parasol tip appears in two beats: gripped on arrival, mentioned again at the end. It remains a static symbol of "the life I once knew" without evolving use or reweighted meaning. Removing it would not alter any choice or the closure image; it is ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"A fold in patience" is named once in abstract language ("I felt a sense of a fold in patience") without shaping stakes or tactics. The concept is echoed thematically but does not change options on the page. Swappable with "moment of stillness" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Grips reality loosely" appears as a single label in the first third without constraining or enabling action. No on-page beat shows the protagonist misperceiving, making a mistake, or trading accuracy for creativity. The trait is told, not demonstrated with cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Trawl" is used literally (disaster cleanup) and metaphorically (searching memories). It appears in three beats and structures the middle section's labor. Removing the trawling action would thin the story, but it does not create a major turn or redefine options—it is a vehicle for reflection rather than a causal lever.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Disaster relief volunteering is signaled early and occupies the middle third. Its mechanics (shoveling debris, hauling ice) are described but do not matter—no choice hinges on the method. The protagonist could find the same solace through any communal labor. The method is present and functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina is anchored early with vivid detail (floating chunks, creaking dock, cold air). It supplies atmosphere and a backdrop for the relief work. The setting does not pressure a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome, but the ice imagery recurs and lightly charges the final image of movement-in-stillness. Micro-setting use is minimal.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"After waking up changed" frames the story and "three days since" provides a rough anchor. The timeframe does not tighten decisions—no clock or deadline alters tactics. The protagonist's arc unfolds at an untracked pace; days pass in summary without pressing urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"To learn the sound of approaching endings" is stated twice as a motivation but never dramatized in a choice. The protagonist hears the sound and feels solace; no friction appears between the desire and a competing cost. The motivation is told rather than tested under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Windborne solace" is named three times and matches the quiet, reflective tone across most beats. The tone does not modulate with pressure—emotional intensity remains uniform. The final image echoes the opening's serene detachment rather than charging it with new cost, yielding a static mood rather than a tonal shift that reweights the stake.</comment>
