<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Aria remains purely observational throughout, never facing contradictory impulses or making a choice that forecloses a path. Her "serenely electric" state is declared but never embodied through physical sensation or micro-choice under pressure. The discovery sequence unfolds as passive reception rather than earned struggle—she "feels" connections and "knows" truths without dramatized cost. The Hollywood star fragment functions as a prop she carries rather than an object that constrains her decisions or reveals character through handling.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The orientation arrives adequately (moon, tower, gorge, Aria's role by paragraph two), but no causal escalation occurs—Aria moves from tower summit to chamber to summit again without narrowing options or paying visible cost. The "shard of hush" remains metaphorical window-dressing; no on-page action demonstrates what tuning into it requires or what price she pays to access the hidden chamber. The ending offers summary assertion ("truth that would change her life forever") rather than a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with felt cost. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, yet no pattern breaks or cadence shifts reweight the dominant stake—only thematic declarations accumulate.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The abandoned radio tower city suspended over a gorge is vividly sketched with ozone, decay, rusty metal, and the gorge's rush below. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics—Aria navigates freely without spatial friction. The Hollywood star fragment and hidden chamber appear as set pieces rather than resources that shape her path. Micro-setting credit: the tower's foundation and the etched wall charge the discovery moment moderately, lifting the score into mid-band despite lack of choice-constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—uncovering a hidden truth—is signaled early but never tightened through reversal or cost. Aria encounters no opposition, makes no trade-offs, and faces no failure that narrows her options. The "shard of hush" and cryptic message arrive as gifts rather than hard-won discoveries; coincidence provides the chamber rather than protagonist agency forcing access. No meaningful escalation occurs under the Accumulative lens—each beat adds ornament without deepening pressure or altering what is at risk.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme of "finding the beginning in every ending" and "beauty in decay" is overtly stated rather than earned through particulars. The final paragraph moralizes directly ("the art of discovery was a lifelong journey"), undercutting resonance. The Hollywood star fragment could serve as a charged motif but remains static—it does not shift meaning between first touch and closure. Thematic Echo penalty: Aria's interior articulates the prompt's thesis in lines like "motivation to find the beginning in every ending" and the closing "art of discovery" summary, which replace scene pressure with statement (−0.6).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Narrative distance is stable third-limited, and the prose maintains a consistent elevated register ("serenely electric," "symphony that guided her"). However, diction frequently drifts into abstraction ("overwhelming motivation," "lens of fantasy practicality") that feels imposed rather than arising from Aria's lived perception. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she knew") dominate peak moments, dulling immediacy. The perceptual signature is generic—what she notices (ozone, metal, echoes) could belong to any observer. No dialogue present to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: paragraph 11 restates the message's content across three sentences without new information; "serenely electric" and "celestial signals" recur as labels without varied embodiment. Template cadence runs in paragraphs 17–19 ("As she…," "And as she…," "As she vanished…") create mechanical rhythm (−0.5). Stock metaphors ("fabric of reality," "edge of perception," "threads of every ending") cluster without fresh vehicle (−0.4). Register drift: "fantasy practicality" and "cryptic message" read as academic shorthand rather than POV-filtered perception (−0.3). Cumulative artifact penalty touches the closure beat (final three paragraphs), triggering the −1.7 floor and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The core premise—interpreter discovers hidden city truth via celestial signals—follows a familiar quest template without transformation. The Hollywood star fragment, lunar perigee, and "shard of hush" ornament the frame but do not synthesize into a non-obvious moral or perceptual calculus. Emotional specificity is absent; Aria's arc (curiosity → discovery → wonder) traces a generic learning journey. The ending's "lifelong journey" and "art of discovery" closure are platitudes. No bold structural risk or lived detail distinguishes this from similar prompt-driven discovery narratives.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Aria (celestial signal interpreter) is present throughout and her role frames the concept, but she makes no key choice that alters tactics or forecloses a path—she observes, feels, and receives revelations passively. Setup present, middle involvement is observational only, and closure mentions her but no decision lands. Swappable with "mystic" or "psychic" with minor edits. Late penalty avoided by early presence, but lack of causal pressure and decision caps score.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The Hollywood star fragment appears in paragraph 4 (setup ✓), Aria holds it in paragraph 10 (middle ✓), and clutches it in paragraphs 17–18 (closure ✓). However, its function is static—she retrieves it, feels a connection, and carries it without the object constraining choice or its meaning reweighting at the end. The fragment could be any relic; its specific properties (etched starlet name) never matter. Three-gate presence keeps it functional-replaceable band; lack of evolving use or charged reprise prevents higher.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Shard of hush" appears as metaphor in paragraph 3, recurs in paragraphs 12–13 as echo of vitality, and is mentioned in paragraph 14. It never alters tactics or narrows options on the page—Aria does not choose to pursue it over another path or pay cost to access it. The concept is told as theme rather than demonstrated as stake-shaping force. Setup present, middle thematic claim only, closure absent. Replaceable with "hidden frequency" or "lost signal" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Serenely electric" is declared in paragraph 2 and recurs as label in paragraphs 13 and 17, but never constrains or enables an on-page action with cost. No scene demonstrates how this attribute changes her perception or choices under pressure—it remains aesthetic descriptor. Setup present as label, middle repeats the label, closure mentions it; no causal work. Swappable with "calmly energized" or "peacefully charged."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Tune" appears in paragraph 6 as the action she must perform (setup ✓) and is obliquely referenced in paragraph 8 ("listened," "discern a pattern"). However, the mechanics are never shown—what tuning requires or costs on the page is absent. The turn (finding the chamber) does not trace to tuning as a dramatized action; resonance "guides" her passively. Present in setup and middle gesture, but the action itself is summary-only and does not redefine options. Replaceable with "listen" or "sense."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"By discarding assumptions" is named in paragraph 6 as method (setup ✓), executed off-page ("she closed her eyes, breathed deeply"), and not revisited at closure. The mechanics—what assumptions she held or how discarding them alters her perception—are never specified. It appears once and does not shape later attempts or the ending. Functional mention but entirely swappable with "clearing her mind" or "opening herself."</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The abandoned radio tower city suspended over gorge is vividly present from paragraph 1 (setup ✓), provides the hidden chamber in the foundation in paragraph 10 (middle ✓), and frames the final image in paragraphs 21–22 (closure ✓). The suspension over the gorge and tower height guide her spatial movement, and the foundation's chamber is essential to the discovery. However, the setting does not pressure a choice or force a trade-off—Aria accesses all areas freely. Three gates met with moderate causal role (chamber location matters) but no constraint that alters tactics, keeping it in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Lunar perigee is anchored in paragraph 1 (setup ✓) and reaches peak in paragraph 15, framing the climax timing (middle ✓ as backdrop). However, no on-page urgency or tactical change arises from the timeframe—Aria does not race the moon's position or lose opportunity when it passes. The perigee could be removed and discovery unfold identically. Setup and middle presence as atmospheric marker only; no clock pressure or closure linkage. Replaceable with "full moon" or "midnight."</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"To find the beginning in every ending" is declared as motivation in paragraph 9 (setup ✓), echoed in paragraph 19 ("next beginning hidden in the threads of every ending"), but never dramatized through conflicted choice or cost. Aria does not weigh this desire against competing wants or pay a price to pursue it—she simply succeeds. The motivation is told and thematically restated rather than tested under pressure. Setup and thematic closure echo present, but no friction or trade-off; entirely swappable with "to uncover hidden truths."</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Fantasy practicality" is named once in paragraph 14 ("lens of fantasy practicality") without being demonstrated through diction, rhythm, or scene logic. The prose oscillates between elevated abstractions ("fabric of reality," "celestial whispers") and grounded description (ozone, rusty metal), but the blend does not cohere into a purposeful tonal stance that modulates with pressure or charges the ending. Single explicit mention, no pattern taught, closure tone is summary-declarative rather than charged by this specific register. Replaceable with "magical realism" or "mystical clarity."</comment>
