<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lena remains static across the narrative—her "decisively kind touch" is told rather than tested through contradictory impulses. Emma's arc from "frail yet determined" to peaceful acceptance occurs largely off-page; the story summarizes her "eyes would often drift" and "began to grow heavy" without dramatizing internal resistance or ambivalence. The final choice—executing a "flawless goodbye"—arrives without visible cost or foreclosed path; Lena's interiority consists of therapeutic labels ("reunify," "pulsing stillness") rather than embodied stakes. Motivation remains abstract and uncontested throughout.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The piece orients who/where/when adequately (hospice haven, after blood work, Lena tending Emma). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the "scent of hope" motif recurs, cadence slows toward Emma's death. However, closure lacks on-page cost—Emma's passing is described as peaceful resolution ("soft smile," "flawless goodbye") without a visible price paid or path foreclosed. The final paragraphs loop thematic claims ("spirit remained," "scent of hope continued") rather than landing a decisive image that reweights prior material. No meaningful tightening or trade-off crystallizes at the end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The haven anchors locale early with sensory markers (sweet air, blooming flowers, candlelight, wooden floorboards). Micro-setting elements—the vinyl shard on Lena's lapel, the creaks woven into soundscape—are present and described. However, environment does not constrain choice or alter tactics; the haven remains postcard backdrop. The vinyl shard is handled twice (Emma's gaze, final significance claim) but does not pressure the closure moment. Setting supports atmosphere without driving story mechanics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—"execute a flawless goodbye"—is signaled early but never tested. No on-page reversal or tightening narrows options; Lena's plan (hum, hymn the mundane, weave soundscape) proceeds without resistance or complication. Emma's cooperation is frictionless, her death arrives as scheduled resolution. The "blood work" timeframe sets a deadline that exerts no tactical pressure. Escalation is absent; the arc moves in one smooth descent from stated goal to declared success without cost, adaptation, or live choice under competing goods.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Theme of hope/peace in hospice care emerges clearly but through repeated assertion rather than particulars. The "scent of hope" functions as thematic label ("tangible presence," "heady mix") without grounding in a specific image that shifts meaning. Final paragraphs state resonance ("spirit remained," "power of music") instead of dramatizing it through a non-literal answer. The vinyl shard is mentioned three times but its "deep significance" and "new significance" are told, not earned through events that reweight prior material. Subtext is minimal; interiority often explains itself.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Voice leans on elevated register ("radiant haven," "pulsing stillness," "decisively kind") that reads slightly generic rather than character-particular. Diction remains consistent but lacks perceptual signature—Lena's way of noticing does not differ under stress. No dialogue present. The prose carries a uniform calm texture across beats; sentence rhythm does not modulate with Emma's decline or Lena's peak effort. Filter verbs ("began to sense," "seemed to") appear frequently without voice motivation, dulling immediacy in key moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn are pervasive: "scent of hope" appears seven times with minimal variation; "flawless goodbye" recurs as label; "soft," "gentle," "pulsing stillness" cycle through adjacent paragraphs. Template cadence: runs of "Lena [verb]" and "Emma's eyes [verb]" across multiple sentences without taught pattern. Stock metaphors: "soft rustle of leaves," "warm, golden light." Figurative density in the music-therapy passages (humming "from the mundane itself," "soundscape of gentle sounds") muddles rather than clarifies. Information density is low; many sentences restate atmosphere without advancing situation. These artifacts touch the closure beat, where "remained" and "continued" loop thematic claims.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Hospice music therapist premise is familiar; the story executes it without transformation. The vinyl-shard motif and "scent of hope" conceit are introduced but not developed into non-obvious synthesis. Emotional arc (peaceful acceptance through music) follows expected template; no fresh inflection surprises in hindsight. The final image—Lena humming as sun sets, spirit lingering—reads as postcard closure rather than earned particular. Details (attic grandmother, broken vinyl, "hymning the mundane") are present but ornamental, not integrated into a risky or memorable stance.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Lena (serene hospice music therapist) is present throughout but her choices do not create key turns. She decides to "focus on the task" and "execute a flawless goodbye," then implements without complication. Observation and therapeutic action dominate; no decision alters tactics or forecloses a path. The character is functional but replaceable—any competent therapist could perform the same role. Setup clear, middle actions present, ending participation via summary claim of success. Swappability and absence of causal pressure cap score.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The vinyl shard appears three times: Lena wears it (paragraph 5), Emma gazes at it (paragraph 13), it "seemed to shine with a new significance" (paragraph 21). Touches span setup, middle, and ending but remain ornamental—Emma's gaze does not alter her choice, final "significance" is asserted rather than dramatized. The object is described, not used; its broken state and "long-forgotten melody" do not constrain tactics or charge the closure image with specific cost. Functional but decorative.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Scent of hope" is introduced early (paragraph 7) as "tangible presence," recurs as "fragrance" during Emma's death (paragraph 15), and loops in final paragraphs as thematic anchor. However, it remains metaphorical—Lena "senses" it, it "wafts," but does not shape on-page stakes or tactics. The concept echoes theme without altering options. No moment where the scent's presence or absence changes a choice. Swappable with "spirit of peace" or similar abstraction. Present across beats but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Decisively kind" appears once (paragraph 1 "decisively kind touch") and is reasserted in paragraph 22 ("decisively kind"). The trait is labeled, not dramatized—no on-page moment where Lena's decisiveness conflicts with or enables a choice under cost. Kindness is constant backdrop, not a lever that forecloses a path. Mentioned in setup and ending but without causal pressure. Label-only use and swappability (could be "gently skilled" or "compassionately steady") lower score.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Reunify" is stated as Lena's aim (paragraph 10: "reunify Emma with the world") and declared achieved (paragraph 17: "succeeded in reunifying Emma"). The action is summarized, not dramatized—no scene shows Emma's separation or the mechanics of reunion. The term could be replaced with "help Emma find peace" or "ease Emma's transition" with no structural change. Present in middle and closure participation claimed, but key turn is told rather than shown. Swappability and summary-only use cap score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Hymning the mundane" is introduced (paragraph 9) as Lena's method: she hums a melody "from the mundane itself" and incorporates creaks/wind. The means is signaled and demonstrated in one beat (paragraphs 9–12: weaving soundscape, singing wordless melody). However, it does not shape attempts—Lena's plan succeeds frictionlessly without the method being tested or adapted. Mechanics are described but do not constrain tactics or charge the ending. Present in setup and middle; closure participation is thematic claim only. Functional but mid-band due to swappability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Radiant haven above the clouds" is established early (paragraph 1) with sensory detail (sweet air, flowers, choirs, candlelight). Setting recurs in final sunset (paragraph 20) and closing anchor (paragraphs 23–25). However, the haven functions as postcard—no choice is pressured by altitude, access, or spatial constraint. Micro-setting elements (wooden floorboards, leaves) are mentioned but do not alter tactics. Closure participation is descriptive ("warm, golden light") rather than causal. Present across beats but ornamental; could be "serene garden" or "quiet hospice room" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"After the blood work came back" anchors time (paragraph 8) and signals terminal prognosis, setting the story window. The timeframe recurs implicitly in Emma's decline and "days that followed" (paragraph 22). However, no on-page clock tightens decisions—Lena proceeds at her own pace without urgency or deadline pressure. The "after" does not alter tactics; the story could begin "during Emma's final days" with identical structure. Setup and closure framing present, but time does not function as live constraint. Functional but mid-band due to lack of tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Execute a flawless goodbye" is stated as goal (paragraph 8), pursued through middle beats (paragraphs 9–18), and declared achieved (paragraphs 19–20: "executed a flawless goodbye"). Desire is clear and drives structure but not dramatized through conflicting costs—no moment where "flawless" conflicts with "honest" or where Lena sacrifices ease for Emma's need. The motivation shapes attempts but lacks friction; success arrives as stated outcome. All three gates met, beat involvement substantial, but causal pressure and cost connection are weak. Mid-band due to told-only tension.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"Pulsing stillness" appears three times: paragraph 3 (haven's atmosphere), paragraph 7 (hope's presence), paragraph 23 (haven's heart). Tone is signaled and recurs but remains static—no modulation under pressure. The phrase labels mood without rhythmic embodiment; sentence cadence does not pulse or contract. Closure participation is thematic echo rather than charged final image. The tone could be "serene calm" or "gentle peace" with no structural change. Present in setup and ending, functional descriptor, but does not charge the final moment. Swappability and static application cap score.</comment>
