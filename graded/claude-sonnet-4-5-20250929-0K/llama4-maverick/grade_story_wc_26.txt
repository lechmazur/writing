<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The protagonist is defined almost entirely by label ("sharp-eyed dusk noticer") rather than through contradictory impulses or embodied choices under pressure. Her "softly deliberate" movement and motivation to "preserve the shape of hope" remain abstract declarations. The climactic moment—disappearing into clouds with newfound understanding—lacks visible cost or foreclosed options. Internal experience reads as therapeutic self-awareness ("luminous regret," "sense of purpose") rather than contradictory emotion driving action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Orientation Test: who (dusk noticer), where (library above clouds), and when (after dreams shareable) arrive by the opening paragraph, so no penalty. The piece accumulates atmospheric detail and thematic claims but offers no on-page decisive change or visible cost at closure. The protagonist's journey from study to "newfound determination" to walking through shelves represents intent, not transformation; she exits with the same stone and no foreclosed path. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural, yet the ending restates theme ("metamorphose her understanding into deeper insight") without reweighting prior material through image or action.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The blooming library, floating shelves, and luminescent orbs establish vivid sensory anchors early. The river stone recurs across beats and the clouds frame the final image, satisfying micro-setting criteria. However, no environmental constraint materially alters a choice or tactic; the library functions as backdrop rather than pressure. Spatial choreography (moving through shelves, sitting, walking) remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving hope against encroaching shadow—is signaled early but never tested on the page by a forced trade-off or narrowed option. The protagonist studies footage, notices a pattern, feels determination, and walks away; no reversal or tightening alters her tactics. The shadow remains abstract metaphor rather than embodied opposition. Agency at closure is intent to share findings, not a choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme (hope versus shadow, connection versus disconnection) is declared rather than earned through specific image or irony. The river stone and "luminous regret" recur but carry static symbolic weight without transformation. The final paragraph moralizes: "she had found a way to metamorphose her understanding into a deeper insight, one that would guide her through the darkness." No resonant image answers the thematic question; the piece tells its meaning rather than showing cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited throughout. Diction is consistent—elevated, ornate, slightly archaic—though perceptual signature is generic ("sharp eyes scanning," "sense of purpose"). Filter verbs appear frequently but suit the contemplative register. The voice lacks character-particular idiom; phrases like "metamorphose her understanding" and "luminous regret" read as imposed rather than emerging from the focalizer's mind. No dialogue to assess.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops cluster in the middle third: "the dusk noticer felt…," "she knew…," "she felt…" cycle without added pressure. Template cadence appears in the closing paragraphs: "She rose… She moved… She walked… She felt… She knew…" across six consecutive beats (−0.5). Mixed metaphors: a shadow "seeping" yet "spreading tendrils" and "feeding" blurs vehicle logic (−0.4). Stock phrases ("sense of peace," "weight of her task") dull specificity. Information density is low; many sentences restate mood without advancing situation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The shareable-dreams premise and floating library offer surface novelty, but the emotional arc (solitary scholar finds insight and walks away with determination) follows a template. The shadow as metaphor for collective fear is stated rather than dramatized. No turn arises from character logic that feels inevitable in hindsight. The river stone, vanished friend, and "shape of hope" function as ornamental motifs rather than irreplaceable particulars driving choice.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The sharp-eyed dusk noticer is present as label and profession throughout. She studies footage, notices a pattern, and decides to share findings—one middle beat (development) and presence at closure (payoff). However, her choices do not narrow options or create visible cost; "sharp-eyed" describes role rather than constraining a decision. Setup, development, and closure participation are met (eligible ~6.0 under gate model), but no causal pressure or irreplaceability (−0.8 swappability, −0.5 ornamental use). Late first functional beat ~second third (−0.3).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The river stone appears in the opening third (setup), is held and described in the middle as it "seemed to grow warmer" (development), and remains "still in hand" at closure (payoff). All three gates met, eligible ≥6.1. However, the stone is ornamental: its warmth is told, not dramatized as altering a choice, and it could be replaced by any keepsake (−0.7 swappability, −0.6 ornamental use). No specific cost tied to the stone's presence.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"A shadow unbound" is introduced in the opening third as backstory context (setup), identified in the middle as "a shadowy presence" in footage (development), and recognized at closure as "a manifestation of humanity's deepest fears" (payoff). All three gates met, eligible ≥6.1. Yet the shadow remains metaphor; it does not constrain tactics or force a trade-off on the page (−0.9 ornamental use, −0.7 swappability with "collective unconscious darkness"). Summary-only in climax (−0.3).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Softly deliberate" appears twice: "softly deliberate fingers" tracing illustrations and "softly deliberate pace" while studying. Both are descriptive labels without on-page cost or constraint. Setup gate met (opening third), no middle development beat, and no closure participation (missing two gates → ineligible above 4.6). Label-only trait (−0.3), ornamental (−0.5), swappable with "careful" or "measured" (−0.6).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Metamorphose" appears once in the middle third ("to metamorphose her understanding into a deeper insight") and again in the final sentence. Setup gate missing (not introduced early), development minimal (told, not enacted), and closure uses it as label (−0.7 late arrival second third, −0.6 summary-only, −0.5 swappable with "deepen" or "transform"). The action does not redefine options on the page; it is a synonym for internal process.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The method is signaled in the opening third ("silent video footage from decades apart"), used across two middle beats (comparing expressions, noticing patterns), and informs the closure realization ("follow this thread"). All three gates met, eligible ≥6.1. The footage enables discovery of the pattern (causal +0.6), but the mechanics are told rather than shown (summary-only −0.4), and "silent footage" could be swapped for journals or interviews (−0.4). No visible cost tied to the method itself.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The blooming library above clouds is established in the opening sentence (setup), described as "a beacon of hope" in the middle (development), and appears in the final image as it "seemed to glow" (payoff). All three gates met, eligible ≥6.1. However, the library supplies no constraint or resource that alters a choice; it is postcard description (−0.7 ornamental use, −0.5 swappability with any sanctuary setting). No cost connection (−0.3).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"After dreams became shareable" is stated in the opening third (setup) and mentioned once more as context for collective unconscious access (development). Missing closure participation (two gates → cap ~6.0). The timeframe provides world context but does not tighten decisions or create a live clock (−0.6 ornamental use, −0.5 swappable with any post-event setting). No visible pressure from the timeframe itself.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"To preserve the shape of hope" is stated explicitly in the middle third (setup missing in opening → −0.3 late signal) and restated at closure ("the shape of hope was still present, still burning bright"). Development and payoff gates met, eligible ~6.0 under two-gate allowance. The motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting choices (−0.6 summary-only, −0.4 ornamental). No on-page friction between wanting to preserve hope and a cost required to do so.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Luminous regret" appears twice: once in the middle third and again near closure. Setup, development, and payoff gates met, eligible ≥6.1. The tone is coherent and matches the elevated voice, but it remains a static label rather than modulating with pressure or charging the final image through cadence shift (−0.5 ornamental use, −0.4 swappable with "wistful sorrow"). No visible cost tied to the tone's presence.</comment>
