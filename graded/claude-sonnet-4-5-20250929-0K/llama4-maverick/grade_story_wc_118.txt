<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Emilia's interior voice is established through "sensitively perceptive" and her method of "collecting stories walls have heard," but these remain largely label-only traits. The piece offers no meaningful internal contradiction or embodied emotion under pressure; she moves through the silo without genuine struggle or cost. Her final "smile" and sense of "completion" feel unearned because no on-page choice forecloses a path or tests her commitment. The motivation to collect stories is declared but never dramatized through conflicting impulses or visible sacrifice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The orientation test is satisfied early (silo library, Emilia as historian), but the piece lacks a coherent drive lens. The narrative reads as a leisurely tour through atmospheric description rather than causal progression or accumulative pressure toward a closure unit. No Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing occurs on the page; Emilia departs unchanged, carrying memories but without visible or felt cost. The "displaced axis" of the dragons is mentioned twice but never reweights options or meaning at closure, leaving the ending diffuse.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The silo library is anchored early and sensory detail is selective: "scent of old books and dust," "bronze quiet," narrow windows casting shadows. The fragment of the tapestry is handled physically ("carefully lifted," "clutched in her hand"), and the half-burned diaries are present as tactile objects. However, the environment never constrains a choice or charges the final image; the setting remains a backdrop rather than a pressure. The "bronze quiet" tone is maintained but does not evolve with any escalation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—uncovering the silo's secrets—is signaled early but never escalates or tightens. Emilia encounters no meaningful resistance, no trade-offs, no cost; she simply reads, ponders, and departs satisfied. The "displaced axis" is mentioned as "a key to unlocking deeper meaning," yet this insight never narrows her options or forces a choice. No reversal or deepening occurs; the piece is a static procession of observations. The final departure carries no visible price or forfeited path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>A theme of forgotten histories and the past's resonance emerges through the silo, tapestry, and diaries, but it remains abstract and stated rather than embodied in a specific choice or cost. The "displaced axis" is invoked twice as meaningful but never dramatized through a concrete on-page consequence. The ending—"the silo's walls stood watch, their secrets safe once more"—offers mild resonance but no non-literal answer to a central question. The "bronze quiet" and "whispers of the past" risk becoming platitudes without a grounded thematic test.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV is stable, and the narrative distance remains consistent. Diction is somewhat elevated ("testament to the past," "vivid imagery," "poignant and profound") but does not violate the historian's register. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction is not tested. The prose carries a lyric, contemplative rhythm that supports the "bronze quiet" tone, though it occasionally tips into generic phrasing ("the world around her began to take shape"). No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks appear, and the perceptual signature is controlled if mild.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and the prose is generally clear, but several passages loop or paraphrase without adding pressure: "As she pondered the tapestry, Emilia's thoughts turned to the half-burned diaries" immediately followed by "With the diaries in hand, Emilia set to work" restates the same move. Stock metaphors ("scars of time," "treasure trove of secrets," "vivid imagery") recur without fresh inflection. The phrase "displaced axis" appears three times with minimal variation in context, suggesting template reliance. No major clarity breaks, but information density is low and momentum sags in the middle third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The premise—historian collecting stories from a reclaimed silo—combines familiar elements (post-apocalyptic library, mysterious tapestry, burned diaries) without a fresh synthesis. The "displaced axis" concept is mentioned but never transformed into a non-obvious insight or structural choice. The narrative arc could swap the tapestry for any artifact and the diaries for any text with minimal adjustment, signaling weak specificity. The "after the last human dream is dreamt" timeframe is evocative but ornamental, not integrated into stakes or choices. The piece reads as competent execution of a prompt checklist rather than an inevitable artistic vision.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Emilia is present throughout and her role as "odd historian" frames her method, but she makes no on-page decision that alters tactics or forecloses a path. She observes, reads, and departs—functional but passive.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The tapestry fragment appears in three beats: discovery, examination for "displaced axis," and final mention as "clutched in her hand" at departure. It is handled physically and its "displaced axis" is invoked as meaningful, but the axis never constrains a choice or reweights the closure. Functional involvement without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Displaced axis" is mentioned three times as a thematic claim ("hint at deeper meaning," "key to unlocking," "reminder of mysteries") but never shapes stakes, tactics, or options on the page. Ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Sensitively perceptive" is declared early and restated ("attuned to subtleties"), but the trait is never shown to constrain or enable a specific action with cost. Label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Probe" appears as verb and intent ("probe the secrets," "probed the mysteries") in two beats, but the action is generic investigation without a unique causal signature. Swappable with "investigate" or "explore" with no structural change.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The half-burned diaries are discovered, examined, and used to "reconstruct events" across multiple beats. They are tangible and their "cryptic message" and "charred pages" are noted, but the method of interpretation never creates friction or a visible cost. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The reclaimed silo library is anchored early and described with sensory detail ("weathered walls," "narrow windows," "empty halls"). It provides atmosphere but never constrains a choice or supplies a resource that alters outcome. Postcard description.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"After the last human dream is dreamt" is mentioned once in the middle as context for diary entries but does not tighten decisions or tactics. The timeframe is ornamental and could be omitted without affecting the narrative.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to collect the stories walls have heard" is declared early and restated at closure ("collected another tale"), but it is never dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost. Told-only.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Bronze quiet" appears twice and the tone of contemplative stillness is maintained throughout. The prose modulates minimally—no escalation or tonal charge at the ending. Static mood that does not evolve with pressure but remains coherent.</comment>
