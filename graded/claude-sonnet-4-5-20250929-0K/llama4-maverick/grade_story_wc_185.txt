<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The mapkeeper's motivation is clear but her interiority relies heavily on abstract sensory description rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The "deep motivation to find the quiet in the storm" is asserted rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses. Her method (examining crack patterns) and the echo chamber stone allow some tactical engagement, but the emotional arc from disruption to satisfaction proceeds too smoothly without genuine internal friction or visible cost to her renunciation of other paths. The energy beings adjust their resonance conveniently without the mapkeeper making a choice that forecloses options.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening paragraph; the piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens as the mapkeeper's study of crack patterns leads to the bloom of hush. However, the closure lacks a decisive change or visible cost: the bloom simply "takes hold" and the mapkeeper smiles, satisfied. The energy beings "sensing the change" adjust without resistance, which undercuts agency and cost. The final image reconfigures the caves' state but does not reweight prior material with felt consequence—no path is foreclosed, no price paid. The midpoint shift in crack patterns signals change, but the resolution feels granted rather than earned.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The harmonic caves and the echo chamber stone anchor the setting with purposeful sensory detail (vibrations, luminosity, ice crack patterns). The ice examination constrains the mapkeeper's method and the stone's glow tracks her progress, giving micro-setting weight. The "hammered repose" tone and "gentle luminosity" at closure charge the final image. However, spatial choreography within the caves remains vague—she walks away from the stone at the end, but her movement and the cave's layout are not tracked across beats. The setting supports atmosphere and method but does not pressure a choice with visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring balance to the harmonic caves—is signaled early and remains coherent. The mapkeeper's examination of crack patterns provides one meaningful tightening (noticing the subtle shift), but escalation is weak: the energy beings adjust their resonance in response to her work without resistance or complication, and no on-page choice narrows her options or forces a trade-off. The "bloom of hush" arrives as a result of her study, but the cost is invisible—no visible price, no foreclosed path, no endurance with consequence. Pressure remains static rather than building to a charged final moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The theme of balance and harmony emerges from the mapkeeper's craft and the interplay of vibrations, resonating with the "bloom of hush" as a conceptual anchor. The echo chamber stone and crack patterns offer concrete particulars, and the final image of "hammered repose" resists overt moralizing. However, the ending leans toward telling ("a testament to the power of her craft") and thematic summary rather than letting the scene image reweight prior material. The energy beings' peaceful integration feels too tidy, and the repeated abstractions ("delicate harmony," "intricate web of vibrations") soften the thematic charge. The piece gestures at depth but does not fully earn its resonance through specific cost or ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited on the mapkeeper throughout; no head-hopping. The voice carries a formal, slightly elevated register consistent with the character's role and setting, and perceptual signature is present in her attention to vibrations and crack patterns. However, the prose occasionally drifts into generic abstraction ("deep connection," "sense of belonging") that feels more like narration than character-specific thought. The final paragraphs loop thematically without adding new perceptual texture, and the diction sometimes inflates ("testament to the power of her craft") beyond the POV's embodied experience. Distance control is mostly clean, but the voice does not modulate distinctly under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The prose is generally clear and grammatically clean, with purposeful sentence variety in the opening beats. However, paraphrase loops and synonym churn appear frequently: "the mapkeeper's task," "the mapkeeper's method," "the mapkeeper's thoughts," "the mapkeeper's surroundings," and repeated sentence stems ("As she worked," "As she studied," "As she stood") create template cadence. The final third recycles thematic content across multiple paragraphs without advancing knowledge or pressure. Figurative language ("storm of vibrations," "threads of vibration and resonance") leans generic in peak moments. Information density is moderate, but scaffolding and redundancy dull momentum, especially in the extended resolution. Loop and template penalties apply: baseline −0.8 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The mapkeeper protagonist and the harmonic caves setting offer a mildly fresh frame, and the method of examining crack patterns in ice to infer resonance provides some specificity. However, the core arc—restoring balance to a disrupted sanctuary through patient study—follows a familiar template without transformation. The energy beings adjust conveniently without complication, and the "bloom of hush" resolves the conflict without visible trade-off or non-obvious synthesis. The echo chamber stone and crack patterns are particular to this world but do not drive a turn that feels inevitable in hindsight. The piece reads competent but safe, choosing median options and avoiding bold risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The ripple-mark mapkeeper is present throughout and her goal (charting disturbances, seeking the bloom of hush) frames the story. She examines crack patterns, holds the echo chamber stone, and conjures the image of the bloom. However, her key "decisions" are largely observational: she studies, infers, and refines understanding without a moment where her choice narrows options or incurs visible cost. The energy beings adjust in response to her work rather than her making a trade-off. Present in setup, development, and ending, but decision pressure is low. Three gates met; some causal involvement; no visible cost tied to her choice. Mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The echo chamber stone appears early ("trusted echo chamber stone"), is held and felt in a second beat ("soothing vibrations"), glows brighter when she conjures the bloom image, pulses in harmony with her heartbeat near the end, and is "dimly glowing" in the final paragraph. Present across setup, development, and ending; handled in multiple beats; its glow tracks her progress. However, it does not constrain a choice or impose cost—it supports her method without trade-off. Charged reprise (bright → pulse → dim) reweights atmosphere but not stakes. All three gates; beat involvement; closure linkage weak. Upper mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The bloom of hush is introduced early as the phenomenon the mapkeeper seeks, she conjures its image at midpoint ("vision of serene silence"), and it "begins to take hold" as vibrations subside, shaping the ending state ("bloom of hush would continue to flourish"). Present in setup, development, and ending. It names the goal and the resolution, but does not constrain tactics or force a trade-off—she achieves it by study without visible cost or complication. The concept frames the story but remains abstract; removing it would require renaming the goal, not restructuring the arc. All three gates; shapes one turn (its arrival); no cost; swappable with "restoration" or "harmony." Mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Gently luminous" describes the echo chamber stone in one line and the caves' final state ("gentle luminosity") in another. The trait anchors atmosphere but does not constrain or enable an on-page action with cost. Present in setup and ending; label-only use; no causal pressure. Two gates (setup, payoff); ornamental. Low band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Conjure" appears twice: the mapkeeper must "conjure the right conditions" early, and she "conjured the image of the bloom of hush" at midpoint, after which the stone glows brighter and the tone shifts. Present in setup and development; tied to one key turn (the bloom beginning to take hold). However, the act of conjuring is abstract—visualization rather than a physical or tactical choice with cost. Swappable with "imagine" or "envision" without structural change. Two gates (setup, development); one beat involvement; low causal specificity. Mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Examining crack patterns in ice is introduced early ("passed down through generations"), used at midpoint ("began to notice a subtle shift in the crack patterns"), and continued ("continued to examine the ice, refining her understanding") as the bloom takes hold. Present in setup, development, and ending; drives the key turn (shift in patterns signals resonance change); the method is specific and irreplaceable. However, no visible cost or constraint is tied to the method—she studies and succeeds without complication. Three gates; two beats; causal pressure moderate; no cost. Upper mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The harmonic caves frame the entire story, provide the cacophony that motivates the mapkeeper, and supply the ice walls and vibrations she studies. Present in setup, development, and ending. The caves' "resonance" and the energy beings' disruption create the problem, and the setting's transformation (to "hammered repose" and "gentle luminosity") marks the resolution. However, the caves do not pressure a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics—the mapkeeper's method works without environmental constraint or trade-off. Three gates; beat involvement high; causal pressure low; no visible cost. Mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the energy beings arrive" anchors the story's inciting condition (cacophony, disrupted balance) and is present in the opening paragraph. However, time does not tighten decisions or create urgency—the mapkeeper works at her own pace, and the energy beings adjust "slowly" without a clock. The timeframe sets up the problem but does not constrain tactics or shape the ending. Setup gate met; development and payoff absent; ornamental. Low band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The motivation "to find the quiet in the storm" is stated explicitly early ("driven by a deep motivation") and reappears at the end ("she had found the quiet in the storm"). It frames her goal and the resolution. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost. She seeks quiet, studies, and achieves it without friction or trade-off. Present in setup and ending; shapes one turn (achieving the bloom); no visible cost or conflicted choice. Two gates; low dramatization. Mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Hammered repose" appears at midpoint ("tone of hammered repose") as the vibrations shift, reappears near the end ("in this state of hammered repose"), and the prose maintains a formal, elevated, slightly archaic register throughout. The tone is coherent and modulates from cacophony to tranquility, charging the final image of the mapkeeper's satisfaction. However, the tone does not pressure a choice or deepen under stress—it announces the shift rather than embodying it in rhythm or diction change. Present in setup (implied), development, and ending; reweights atmosphere; no causal pressure. Three gates; closure linkage moderate; specificity high. Mid-band.</comment>
