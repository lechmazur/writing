<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The timekeeper remains abstract throughout, defined by role rather than embodied traits or contradictory impulses. Interiority consists of generic declarations ("their anticipation building," "sense of purpose") without character-particular texture. The final "smile" and "eyes gleaming" read as stock gestures rather than earned emotion rooted in prior struggle. No micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test failure: who, where, and when remain vague past 120 words; "borrowed-time timekeeper" is a label without grounding, and the emerald silo's function is never anchored. The piece operates in Accumulative mode but no decisive tightening or deepening occurs—each paragraph restates the same mood without altering options or knowledge. The ending ("ready for whatever came next") is pure deferral with no on-page closure effect, no felt cost, and no reconfiguration of prior material. Waiver tests for Track B (mosaic pattern taught by 25%) are not met; the piece loops rather than transitions.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The emerald silo is named but never grounded in sensory detail, spatial layout, or functional constraints. Generic placeholders ("vintage clock," "damaged time capsule") appear without embodied handling or tactical pressure. Micro-setting allowance cannot apply when no object constrains a choice or charges the final image. The Orientation Test penalty in Q2 caps this category at 7.0, but execution alone merits mid-4s.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"understand the texture of time passing"—is declared but never tested on the page. No reversal or tightening narrows options; the timekeeper's task remains static from opening to close. Agency is observation without decision cost. The "response to one of their messages" hints at discovery but immediately deflates into summary ("their understanding grew") with no live dramatization or trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Theme is asserted in prompt-like abstractions ("texture of time passing," "world's transformation") rather than emerging from concrete particulars. The final paragraph moralizes overtly: "testament to the power of human curiosity," "honored to be a part of its unfolding narrative." Symbolic objects (cremation urn fragment, vintage clock) are introduced for thematic resonance but never constrain choice or accumulate pressure. No non-literal answer to a central question; the ending summarizes rather than reweights.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Voice lacks perceptual signature; diction is uniformly elevated and generic ("poignant reminder," "palpable," "haunting and profound"). Syntactic monotony pervades: template stems recur ("The timekeeper's [noun]," "As they [verb]," "The [noun], once [phrase], now [phrase]"). No dialogue appears. Free indirect style is attempted but collapses into committee narration with no character-particular filter. The POV could belong to any archetypal seeker.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Pervasive paraphrase loops and synonym churn: "slowly revealing its secrets" / "slowly coming into focus" / "slowly revealing its secrets" across adjacent paragraphs. Template cadence dominates ("The timekeeper's X," "As they Y," "The Z, once A, now B"). Stock metaphors ("heartbeat remains," "holding their breath") lack transformation. Filter-verb stacks ("felt," "became aware," "knew") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats. Artifacts touch the closure paragraph, triggering the −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The core premise—damaged time capsule in a timeless world—is a familiar post-apocalyptic trope executed without fresh inflection. The timekeeper's method (embedding messages in garage sale descriptions) is mentioned but never shown or used to create friction. Emotional and plot beats are median and safe: discovery → excitement → understanding → readiness. The transformation test fails: swap names and the arc remains unchanged. No bold risk or non-obvious synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>The borrowed-time timekeeper is present throughout but makes no on-page decisions that alter tactics. Observation and declaration dominate; the character's agency is passive reception of responses and feelings rather than choices with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The cremation urn fragment appears twice (falls from capsule, later "held deeper significance") but is never handled in a second beat or returned with reweighted meaning that changes a choice. Setup and thematic mention only; no middle development or closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The damaged time capsule frames expectation, is worked on mid-story ("carefully repairing"), and its contents deepen understanding at the end. Present in all three gates (setup, development, payoff) and drives two beats. However, the mechanics remain vague and the element could be swapped for any symbolic container without altering the arc, capping the score.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Suddenly timeless" is asserted as a world trait but never constrains a choice or enables an action. The timekeeper's task is described in relation to it, but no on-page cost or tradeoff demonstrates the attribute in pressure. Label-only mention.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Rediscover" is the stated task and recurs thematically, shaping the framing and ending ("continued to rediscover the world"). However, no major turn traces causally to an act of rediscovery; the verb is summary rather than dramatized action. Setup and thematic payoff present, but middle development is absent.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Embedding messages in garage sale item descriptions is introduced early and mentioned mid-story ("embedded more messages"). The method is described but never shown in use—no garage sale scene, no customer interaction, no friction from the method itself. Setup and summary development only; no closure participation or causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>The emerald silo is named throughout and serves as the spatial anchor, but it never pressures a choice or supplies a resource that affects outcome. Postcard description ("monument," "beacon") without tactical function. Setup and thematic presence only; no middle or closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"After numbers change meaning" is a world-building detail mentioned once ("numbers had lost their meaning") but never tightens a decision or alters tactics. The timeframe is static backdrop rather than live constraint. Ornamental setup only.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The motivation to "understand the texture of time passing" is stated early, repeated, and frames the ending ("understanding grew"). However, it is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices or visible costs. Setup and thematic payoff present, but no friction between want and price in middle beats.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The tone of "anticipated mysteries" is signaled early ("air of anticipated mysteries," "anticipation building") and recurs at the close ("heart beat with anticipation"). The tone is static rather than modulating with pressure, and does not charge the final image with new meaning. Setup and thematic mention present; no middle pressure or closure transformation.</comment>
