<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Luna is defined solely by her external role and mission statement—"to bring back the vibrancy of life"—without internal contradiction or embodied struggle. The statues transition instantly from stone to human with no felt cost or individual resistance; their gratitude is generic. The locust shell is held throughout but never constrains a choice or reveals character under pressure. Interiority consists of abstract declarations ("the key to breaking free") rather than lived, contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive promptly. However, no causal linkage drives the transformation: Luna plays, statues crack and awaken, orchard blooms—each beat unfolds as inevitable result of her presence rather than because/therefore pressure. The closure offers no visible cost or foreclosed path; the statues are freed, Luna departs to repeat the formula elsewhere, and the mechanical world's "grip" is merely "loosened" without on-page consequence. Under a causal lens, the story reads as a declarative sequence; under accumulative, no pattern break or cadence shift reconfigures the stake.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The orchard is vividly described—flowers "shimmered like stardust," sky-bridge gains "ethereal light"—but remains postcard scenery. The living statues police the grounds yet never obstruct Luna or test her music against resistance. The locust shell is clutched but not handled or used to alter tactics. Setting does not constrain choice or charge the final image; it decorates the declared transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"reawaken beauty"—is declared but never tested by opposition or cost. Luna plays, statues awaken without struggle, and she departs confident of future success. No reversal, tightening, or deepening narrows her options; coincidence (the orchard's inherent magic) does all the work. The mechanical world's "grip" is told to loosen but no on-page loss, trade-off, or adaptation shapes her tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Theme is asserted in prompt language—"breaking free," "mechanical world," "tarnished wonder"—rather than emergent from scene particulars. The final paragraph explicitly moralizes: "the power of music to reawaken beauty in a world that had forgotten its song." The locust shell recurs as a static symbol without shifting meaning. No thematic question is tested by contradiction or ambiguity; the piece declares its thesis rather than dramatizing it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent lyric register and stable third-person distance on Luna. However, diction often inflates into abstraction—"the gap between knowing and understanding," "resonantly soft music"—without grounding in Luna's perceptual signature. The statues speak and dance in the denouement but carry no distinct voice. Purposeful compression is not taught as pattern; the repeated grandiosity reads as unmodulated elevation rather than controlled rhythm.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "brought back to the world" / "reawakened to its beauty" / "breaking free the beauty that was dormant" across adjacent paragraphs. Template cadence runs: "As she played…"; "As the music reached out…"; "As the last notes…"; "As they danced…" Figurative language saturates every sentence without variation—"weaving a spell," "like a river," "like a gentle breeze"—dulling rather than sharpening the image. Stock metaphors (stardust, golden glow) and therapy-speak ("emotional aftereffect," "renewed vitality") flatten the line. Final-third artifacts disallow 9+ globally and trigger cumulative Q7 penalty of −1.4.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The premise—artist's music breaks enchantment and reawakens frozen figures—is a familiar fairy-tale template executed without transformation. Luna encounters no obstacle, makes no sacrifice, and departs to repeat the formula. The locust shell, sky-bridge, and "heart rhythms" are named but not integrated into a specific, non-obvious synthesis. Emotional template (gratitude, celebration, departure) could transfer unchanged to any similar story.</comment>
