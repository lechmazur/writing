<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elys is established early with clear traits (empathetic, reclusive) but remains largely passive throughout. The protagonist observes and reflects extensively but makes no difficult choices under pressure until the very end, when they "tuck the invitation back" and continue reading—a gesture without visible cost or foreclosed options. The mistake mentioned as motivation is never dramatized, leaving the core wound abstract. Internal contradiction is present (hiding while staying connected) but operates as told concept rather than enacted tension in pivotal beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening, satisfying the test. However, no meaningful causal linkage drives the sequence: Elys searches, finds a book, reads a message, feels peace—a series of and-then beats without because/therefore pressure. The "closure" is a mood shift (enlarged tranquility) rather than a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost, or Conceptual Repricing that reweights prior material. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, but no cadence break or density surge charges the final image; the ending summarizes emotional state rather than delivering an on-page reconfiguration with felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The secret library is vividly established with sensory detail (dusty tomes, lantern glow, musty scent) and remains coherent throughout. The setting provides atmosphere but does not constrain a single choice or alter tactics; Elys moves freely within it without spatial friction. The book *The Harmony of Opposites* functions as a micro-setting object that delivers the message, meeting the minimum threshold for a purposeful detail that charges the ending moment, though the library itself remains backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—unearthing wisdom in a past mistake—is signaled early but never tested on the page. No opposition arises, no options narrow, and no visible price is paid; Elys finds the book easily and the message affirms rather than challenges. The "nestled paradoxes" operate as theme rather than tactical problem. Under an Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is required; here the text offers only a declarative mood shift without foreclosing a path or imposing cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme (paradox, hiding/staying, wisdom in mistakes) is woven throughout and avoids overt moralizing until the final lines, which declare "truth is not in the destination, but in the journey itself"—a platitude that replaces image with assertion. The invitation's reweighting is present but mild; the shift from "reminder of failure" to "possibility of growth" is told rather than shown through a concrete choice. The message "truth is not in the answer, but in the question" lands with modest resonance but does not interrogate or complicate prior material in a non-obvious way.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and the narrative voice carries a consistent meditative texture with elevated diction ("unobtrusive as a whispered secret," "enlarged tranquility"). Filter verbs appear frequently but fit the reflective register. No dialogue is present. The perceptual signature is coherent but generic; many descriptors could apply to any contemplative narrator. Elys's way of noticing does not reveal character-specific bias or blind spots that would sharpen voice under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and error-free, but heavy with paraphrase loops and synonym churn: "hiding yet connected," "staying while leaving," "physically present, yet emotionally detached" repeat the same paradox across multiple paragraphs without added pressure. Template cadence: "As the clock struck," "As midnight drew near," "As the first light" creates rhythmic monotony. Stock metaphors ("thick with the scent," "soft whisper") and elevated diction ("unobtrusive," "enlarged tranquility") stack without adding information density. The Text Artifact Screen triggers −0.6 for paraphrase loops and template stems across the piece, including in the final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The premise—recluse finds solace in a secret library through paradoxical wisdom—is serviceable but leans on familiar beats: character retreats from mistake, finds meaningful book, experiences epiphany. The "nestled paradoxes" concept and "staying while leaving" method offer modest freshness but remain abstract rather than dramatized through specific, irreplaceable detail. The invitation as recurring motif is conventional. No bold structural or perspectival risk elevates the material; the arc follows a predictable comfort trajectory without transformation test challenge.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elys is present throughout and their traits (compassionate, reclusive, empathetic) are labeled, but they make no key on-page choice that alters tactics or stakes. The decision to keep the invitation and continue reading is low-cost and does not foreclose a competing path. Setup and development gates are met (character is present early and mid-story), but closure participation is passive observation rather than decisive action. Late first-third, mild causal involvement in one beat (finding the book), no visible cost tied to character choice. Swappable: a generic "seeker" could fulfill the same function with minor edits. Deductions: ornamental use −0.5, swappability −0.5, summary-only key moment (the past mistake) −0.5; start 3.0 + early signal +0.4 + one beat +0.4 − ornamental/swap/summary −1.5 = 2.3, round down to nearest accessible band given gate failures → 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The crumpled invitation appears in three distinct beats: beside the armchair (setup), pondered mid-search (development), and tucked back into pocket at the end (closure participation). It is handled on the page and its meaning shifts from "reminder of failure" to "possibility of growth." However, the shift is told rather than dramatized through a choice the invitation constrains; it remains symbolic rather than causally active. Setup +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.8, specificity (edges worn, crumpled) +0.4, but ornamental in closure (cameo mention, not causal) −0.7, summary-only final use −0.5; start 3.0 + 2.6 − 1.2 = 4.4, but all three gates met allows ≥6.1 eligibility and lyric reprise lifts modestly → 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Nestled paradoxes" is introduced early (first third) and recurs thematically, but it never constrains a choice or changes tactics on the page. The concept operates as abstract fascination rather than a problem Elys must solve or navigate. It shapes the thematic layer but not the dramatic stakes. Setup gate met, development and closure gates missed (theme echo only). Early signal +0.5, ornamental use −0.8, label-only in peak beats −0.3; start 3.0 + 0.5 − 1.1 = 2.4, round to 2.4, but missing development/closure gates cap at 2.8; however, thematic presence across multiple paragraphs lifts slightly within allowable band → 3.6.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Keenly empathetic" is mentioned twice as a trait ("able to sense the emotional resonance of texts," "allowing them to sense the harmony") but never enables or constrains an on-page action with visible cost. No tradeoff, no decision driven by empathy, no friction between empathy and another need. Setup gate met (labeled early), development and closure gates missed. Early signal +0.4, label-only use across all appearances −0.6, ornamental −0.5; start 3.0 + 0.4 − 1.1 = 2.3, round to 2.3, but missing development/closure gates cap at 2.8; slight thematic echo lifts within band → 2.9.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The action "hide" is present thematically (Elys hides from the world in the library) and mentioned explicitly in the final third ("able to hide from the world, yet remain connected"). However, it does not drive a major turn or create a choice with stakes; it describes Elys's static condition rather than a decisive act. Setup met (retreat established early), development weak (no choice to hide vs. engage), closure participation ornamental (theme mention only). Early signal +0.4, one beat (retreat described) +0.4, ornamental in closure −0.7, summary-only −0.5; start 3.0 + 0.8 − 1.2 = 2.6, round to 2.6, but thematic presence and lyric mention lift modestly → 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Staying while leaving" (physically present, emotionally detached) is introduced in the second third, described as a method Elys has mastered, and echoed in the final third ("a form of staying while leaving"). It appears twice but does not shape an attempt or constrain a tactic; it is told as accomplished skill rather than dramatized struggle. Late setup (second third) −0.4, ornamental use −0.7, swappable (could be "withdrawal" or "detachment") −0.5, summary-only −0.5; start 3.0 − 2.1 = 0.9, but thematic recurrence and final echo lift within cap of 3.8 for swappable elements → 3.8.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The secret society library is established early with vivid detail (hidden façade, dusty tomes, lanterns) and remains the continuous setting. It provides atmosphere and the resource (rare books section, *The Harmony of Opposites*) that Elys uses, meeting the functional threshold. However, it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; Elys accesses what they need without friction. Setup +0.6, one beat (finding the book) +0.4, causal enablement (provides resource) +0.6, specificity (secret society, hidden in plain sight) +0.5, but no constraint on choice −0.0, postcard description in places −0.3; start 3.0 + 2.1 − 0.3 = 5.8, but "hidden in plain sight" detail never pressures access → 4.9.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Within arm's reach of midnight" is signaled early ("clock struck eleven," "As midnight drew near," "quarter hour before midnight," "clock struck one") and the narrative tracks time across multiple beats. However, the clock does not tighten decisions or create urgency; Elys searches and reflects at leisure with no time-driven stakes. Setup +0.6, spans multiple beats +0.9, but no tactical pressure from time −0.0, ornamental ticking −0.5, does not constrain final choice −0.0; start 3.0 + 1.5 − 0.5 = 4.0, but missing development gate (time does not force a choice) caps at 3.4.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to unearth wisdom in a mistake" is stated explicitly in the first third ("driven by a motivation to unearth wisdom in a mistake they had made years ago") and recurs at the ending ("the paradox of seeking wisdom in a mistake began to unravel"). However, the mistake itself is never dramatized, remaining abstract. The motivation frames the search but is not conflicted or tested by friction between want and cost. Setup +0.6, closure linkage (named at end) +0.8, but told-only throughout −0.6, ornamental in closure (theme statement, not causal action) −0.5, no visible tradeoff −0.0; start 3.0 + 1.4 − 1.1 = 3.3, missing development gate (no on-page friction) caps at 3.4, but thematic continuity lifts slightly → 4.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Enlarged tranquility" appears explicitly in the resolution paragraph ("Elys felt a sense of enlarged tranquility wash over them") and is echoed in the final lines ("deep sense of peace," "tranquility of the library"). Tone is meditative and calm throughout, coherent with the concept, and modulates mildly as Elys moves from searching to finding to reflecting. However, the tone does not charge the final image with undeniable pressure; it describes achieved stasis rather than a fraught poise. Setup (calm from opening) +0.5, closure linkage (named and reinforced at end) +0.9, coherent modulation +0.4, but static mood (no tonal turn under pressure) −0.6, single-note serenity −0.3; start 3.0 + 1.8 − 0.9 = 3.9, but lyric reprise and thematic fit lift within band → 5.1.</comment>
