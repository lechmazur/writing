<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Aria's interior motivation ("to turn confusion into exploration") is stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The sketching action near the end provides a concrete micro-choice, but her emotional progression reads as smooth contemplation rather than contradictory desire under pressure. The "blessed pariah" label never constrains a choice or creates visible friction. Her final step forward lacks a felt cost that forecloses an alternate path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece establishes orientation adequately (who, where, when by ~120 words). A single tightening occurs when Aria moves from passive observation to sketching, aligning the compass and distant light, but the closure reads as meditative affirmation rather than a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with visible cost. The final paragraph's "promise of a new horizon" asserts transformation without demonstrating what path has been foreclosed or what price paid.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The observation deck is anchored early with selective sensory detail (metallic walls, compass rose applique, stars against blackness). The gilded compass functions as a micro-setting element that charges the final act when it "glows" and aligns with the distant light. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. However, much description serves atmosphere over constraint; the deck does not meaningfully limit Aria's options or force tactical adaptation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Aria seeking to understand the flickering light and move beyond confusion—is signaled early. One tightening occurs when the compass aligns with the light and she begins sketching, narrowing her stance from aimless wandering to purposeful action. However, no visible price is paid; the "trepidation and excitement" are told rather than tested. Agency at closure is a first step forward with asserted promise, not a choice that visibly forecloses an alternate path under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: stillness holding potential for movement, disconnection yielding to wonder. The compass rose and sketching custom provide non-literal vehicles. However, the final paragraph moralizes ("even in stillness, there was always the potential for movement") rather than trusting the image to carry meaning. The ending offers a resonant image (stars, whisper of possibility) but undercuts it with explicit summary, reducing the felt complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Single POV with stable third-person limited focalization throughout. Perceptual signature is present but generic (roaming eyes, footsteps echoing, gazing into void). Diction remains consistent, though some phrases drift toward elevated abstraction ("temporally stretched existence," "essence of the night sky"). No dialogue to evaluate. The final sequence maintains narrative distance but relies on summary assertions ("felt a sense of wonder") rather than showing perception shift under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Multiple paraphrase loops and scaffold sentences are present: "The observation deck...a relic of a bygone era" then "once bustling hub...now a vast, empty space" restate the same idea. Template cadence runs appear ("Aria's curiosity was piqued...Aria's thoughts turned...Aria began to sketch...Aria smiled"). Stock metaphors recur without fresh angle ("stars twinkling like diamonds" appears twice). The closure paragraph stacks summary statements that dull momentum. These artifacts pervade the final third, triggering the cross-category cap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The core premise—lone wanderer on an abandoned observation deck seeking meaning in emptiness—follows a familiar template without fresh synthesis. The gilded compass rose and sketching custom provide specific details, but the emotional arc (confusion → wonder → renewed spirit) unfolds predictably. The "temporally stretched" attribute and time dilation setting are mentioned but never leveraged for narrative pressure or conceptual surprise. The ending's "brighter tomorrow" and "promise of a new horizon" are stock closures.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Aria ("blessed pariah") is present throughout but makes no key decision that narrows options or alters tactics. Her wandering, sketching, and final step are contemplative actions without visible tradeoff. The "pariah" label is never dramatized in scene.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The gilded compass rose applique appears in three beats: initial observation, glowing alignment with the distant light, and guiding the final step. It charges the closure image by pointing "true north" toward Aria's path. However, its function is symbolic rather than causal; Aria's choices do not depend on its properties, and removing it would require only minor rewording.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"True north" is named explicitly in connection with the compass applique and appears in the final guiding image. It operates thematically (direction, clarity) but does not constrain an on-page choice or create tactical friction. It echoes the stake without changing options.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Temporally stretched" is mentioned once as a label ("the weight of her temporally stretched existence") without demonstrating how it constrains or enables action. No visible tradeoff or tactical consequence arises from this attribute.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Glimpse" is realized when Aria spots the "faint, flickering light on the horizon." This moment piques her curiosity and frames the central question, but the story could proceed with "noticed" or "saw" with minimal structural change. The glimpse does not redefine options at closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The family custom of sketching the night sky on anniversaries is introduced in a reflective paragraph, then enacted when Aria begins to sketch. The act is meditative and provides a concrete micro-choice that connects her to her past and present. However, the custom's mechanics do not shape her approach or constrain her options; it functions as a thematic accent rather than a tactical method.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The time dilation observation deck is named and described early, providing spatial grounding (metallic walls, railing, void beyond). It frames the post-shutdown desolation and the temporally stretched existence. However, the setting does not pressure Aria's choices or supply resources that alter her tactics; it serves primarily as atmospheric backdrop.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"After the shutdown" establishes a post-event timeframe that motivates the deck's emptiness and Aria's isolation. However, no ticking clock or temporal pressure shapes her decisions; the timeframe is static context rather than a dynamic constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Aria's motivation "to turn confusion into exploration" is stated in the opening and demonstrated when she shifts from wandering to sketching and taking a step forward. However, the desire is not dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost; it unfolds as smooth progression without friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Echoed silence" is named explicitly and reinforced through description (footsteps echoing, palpable silence, universe holding its breath). The tone remains coherent and modulates slightly as Aria moves from stillness to wonder. However, the final paragraphs shift to asserted warmth ("soft whisper of possibility," "brighter tomorrow") that dilutes the echoed-silence charge rather than charging the final image with it.</comment>
