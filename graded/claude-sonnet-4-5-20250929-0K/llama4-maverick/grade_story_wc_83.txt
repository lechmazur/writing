<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Amira's motivation shifts abruptly from trauma survivor to quest-driven investigator without intermediate emotional steps. The geode crystal grants her "calm" and "purpose" through label-only interiority rather than embodied contradiction. Dr. Patel exists as an exposition vessel with no pressure applied to Amira's choices. The final transformation into resilience reads as assertion ("tempered, like the geode crystal") without visible cost or foreclosed paths on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: wedding wreckage → observatory transition lacks spatial or temporal anchors until Dr. Patel's greeting. The "hunt for answers" is told rather than dramatized; perturbation theory analysis occurs off-stage in summary ("pored over the data"). Closure attempts Charged Poise ("ready, armed with the geode crystal") but the cost is conceptual only—no on-page action or renunciation forecloses a live option. The lens reads as intended Causal but collapses into thematic summary in the final third.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The wedding wreckage is anchored through "scent of smoke and blood" and tactile geode touch. The Floating Observatory is described generically ("gentle hum," "soft glow") without spatial choreography or constraint. Circuit breakers cooling is mentioned but never shown to limit Amira's movement or choices. The geode crystal returns frequently but as talisman rather than environmental pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding the drone strike's cause—is declared but never tested by on-page opposition or scarcity. The "hunt" consists of told collaboration ("pored over the data," "refined their search") without visible setbacks or trade-offs. The "shocking revelation" that unused potential is a catalyst arrives without prior dramatized complication. No meaningful tightening occurs; the protagonist's stance at the end is identical to her intention after boarding the station.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Theme of "unused potential" is stated repeatedly ("unused potential that had led to her wedding's destruction") rather than emerging from concrete particulars. The geode crystal is forced into symbolic duty without organic integration. The final paragraph moralizes directly: "unfiltered awakening had been a brutal awakening, but it had also given her a chance to rediscover herself" and "illuminating the path ahead, and beckoning her towards a brighter tomorrow." Thematic Echo penalty applies (−0.6): prompt language like "unfiltered awakening" is repeated verbatim in lines 28 and 29.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is generic: "frazzled nerves," "newfound sense of purpose," "heart still bearing the scars" rely on stock emotional phrases. Diction drifts into elevated register ("intangibly tangible essence," "bleak exhilaration") without character-specific grounding. Dr. Patel has no dialogue; all interaction is summarized. Internal voice lacks contradiction or degradation under trauma.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops dominate: "unused potential" appears six times with synonym churn ("stagnant potential pooling," "hidden reservoirs of unused potential"). Template cadence runs through paragraphs 19–22: "As [subject] [verb]" opener pattern repeats four times. Filter-verb stacks in peak beats: "felt the world around her begin to shift," "felt the full weight," "felt the intangibly tangible presence." Stock metaphors: "brutal confrontation," "beacon, illuminating the path." Artifacts touch closure (final two paragraphs), triggering the −1.7 Q7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Core premise—trauma survivor seeks data-driven answers on floating research station—combines familiar elements without transformation. The geode crystal as mystical focus object is a well-worn trope. Perturbation theory is name-dropped but not dramatized through specific application. Emotional arc (numbness → determination → resilience) follows a predictable template. No risk-taking in structure, voice, or moral calculus.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Amira is present throughout and drives the hunt, but her choices are told rather than shown in scene. She decides to escape, boards the station, and collaborates with Dr. Patel—all summarized. No on-page reversal results from her agency; the revelation arrives through data analysis off-stage. Present in closure but does not create the final turn.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The geode crystal appears in beat one (paragraph 3), is "clutched" during the journey (paragraph 11), used as "focal point" during analysis (paragraph 17), serves as "talisman" (paragraph 22), and is mentioned in the final image (paragraph 27). However, its function is ornamental: it soothes and focuses but does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic with visible cost. The "vibrate with an otherworldly energy" moment (paragraph 25) tells rather than shows causal work.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Unfiltered awakening" is named explicitly in paragraph 8 and repeated in paragraph 28. It frames the inciting trauma but does not shape on-page tactics or narrow options. The concept is thematic label rather than active constraint. Mentioned at closure but as summary rather than decisive reweighting.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Intangibly tangible" appears three times as descriptor of the geode's "essence" (paragraphs 5, 18, 29). It is label-only; the attribute does not enable or constrain an action. No visible tradeoff results from this quality. Used ornamentally to add mystique without mechanical consequence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The hunt is stated as motivation (paragraph 15) and drives the middle section, but the search itself is summarized: "pored over the data," "refined their search." No on-page beat shows Amira pursuing a false lead, adapting tactics, or paying a cost to continue. Present in closure framing ("hunt would continue") but swappable with "quest" or "search" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>Perturbation theory is introduced in paragraph 16 and mentioned twice more (paragraphs 16, 17) but its mechanics are never shown. Dr. Patel "had been analyzing" and "they pored over the data" but no on-page demonstration of how the method shapes their approach. Name-only presence without causal work or cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The Floating Observatory is described in paragraph 13 with "gentle hum" and "soft glow." It provides isolation (paragraph 11) but does not constrain movement or supply resources that alter tactics. The setting is backdrop rather than active pressure. Circuit breakers cooling (paragraph 14) is told but never shown to limit access or force a workaround.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>Circuit breakers cooling is mentioned in paragraph 14 as "a few hours" and their return in paragraph 22 ("systems humming back to life"). No on-page moment shows time pressure altering a decision or forcing a choice before the window closes. The timeframe is decoration without causal consequence.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The motivation "to find where unused potential pools" is stated in paragraph 15 and drives the collaboration. However, it is told as desire without on-page friction or competing want. No scene shows Amira weighing the cost of this search against rest, safety, or mourning. Present in closure but not conflicted in choices.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>"Bleak exhilaration" is named twice (paragraphs 20, 30) and the opening establishes devastation, but the tone does not modulate with pressure. The middle section (observatory analysis) reads neutral-optimistic rather than bleakly exhilarated. The final image shifts to hopeful ("brighter tomorrow") without tonal cost or contradiction.</comment>
