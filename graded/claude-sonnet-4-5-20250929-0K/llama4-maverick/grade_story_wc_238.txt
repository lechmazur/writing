<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lyra remains abstract throughout—her "gossip-column exorcist" role is label-only and never constrains a single on-page choice. Interiority consists of generic mystical declarations ("true power lay not in grand gestures") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The reconciliation with Astra is told rather than dramatized; we never see Lyra weigh competing impulses or pay a visible cost. Therapy-speak and stock phrasing ("mixture of reverence and desperation") flatten what should be a charged moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test penalty (−0.4): by 120 words we know only "dimly lit sheet music archive" and "Lyra sat," with no grounding of time, spatial layout, or why she is there now. The dominant stake—reconnecting with Astra—is declared but never tested on the page; the "induced currents" method appears as metaphor without causal mechanism, and the closure is pure summary ("her message had been sent"). No visible cost or reversal occurs; the hum and glow are atmospheric props, not beats that narrow options. The orchard's destruction is seeded early but never paid off in the ending, leaving a promised tension unresolved.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The archive is vividly sketched ("scent of aged paper," "raised notes and rests embossed into the covers") and the antique perfume bottle anchors one sustained beat. However, spatial choreography is vague—we never learn room layout, shelf arrangement, or how Lyra navigates the space. The orchard timeframe is poetic but remains external decoration; it does not constrain her method or alter her tactics. The bottle's etchings and hum charge the middle section, lifting the score into mid-range, but the setting does not shape the final image or force a choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (reconnect with Astra) is signaled early but never escalates or tightens on the page. No reversal occurs; Lyra finds the bottle, deciphers the code offstage ("her mind weaving together the threads"), and the apology is sent via summary ("the air seemed to still"). The orchard's impending destruction is set up as a ticking clock but never intersects with Lyra's task or forces a trade-off. Agency is absent—no choice forecloses a path, and no cost is legible in the final beats.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Theme ("imperfect miracles," connection through subtle moments) is asserted repeatedly in exposition ("true power lay not in grand gestures," "the imperfect, gritted moments that hold the most beauty") rather than emerging from scene work. The antique bottle and sheet music could charge a resonant image, but their final use is summarized, not dramatized. The orchard motif is seeded but abandoned; its destruction does not reweight Lyra's apology or reflect her internal arc. The ending defaults to comfort ("sense of peace") without ambiguity or cost, producing a tidy moral rather than earned complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited voice maintains stable distance and some perceptual signature ("her fingers trailed over the spines," "the grit of the world's imperfections"). However, diction drifts into generic mystical register ("ethereal energy," "metaphorical tapestry") that does not distinguish Lyra's thought from authorial narration. Reflection dominates the middle third without anchoring in micro-choices, and key beats are summarized ("began to decipher the code") rather than shown. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction cannot be tested. Purposeful compression is absent; the prose is leisurely rather than taut.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops abound: "imperfect miracles" recurs across four paragraphs without evolving pressure; "the air seemed to vibrate / start to vibrate" and "hush before the orchard's trees were cut down" (repeated verbatim) are synonym-churn artifacts. Template cadence runs appear ("That's when she spotted it," "As she did so," "As she finished"). Stock metaphors ("river," "tapestry," "sentinels") stack without fresh specificity. Filter-verb stacks ("felt a pang," "felt the air," "felt a sense") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats. Cumulative artifact penalty (−1.4) plus closure-scene touch (−0.3) disallows 9+ globally and caps this category at mid-4s.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Gossip-column exorcist" is a quirky label, but the story defaults to generic mystical romance beats—estranged friends, cryptic messages, glowing artifact—without transformation. The "induced currents" concept is invoked as metaphor but never given unique mechanics or cost. The orchard hush is poetic setup but pays off with platitude ("sometimes, it's the imperfect, gritted moments that hold the most beauty"). No fresh synthesis or risk-taking; removing the exorcist label and archive setting would leave the emotional arc unchanged. Proximity to template plots and stock closure imagery lowers originality to low-mid range.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Lyra is present throughout but makes no choices that create turns. Her role as "gossip-column exorcist" is mentioned twice without shaping tactics or stakes. She observes, handles the bottle, and declares her method offstage. Observation without decision trends low per the rubric.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The antique perfume bottle appears at ~25%, is handled in one sustained beat (lifted, etchings glow, focal point for intentions), and is stowed at the end. It enables Lyra's method but does not constrain a choice or return with reweighted meaning. Two-gate presence (development, payoff cameo) with mid-level causal involvement places it in the 5.5–6.3 band; no visible cost tied to the object itself caps it below 6.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Imperfect miracles" is asserted in exposition four times but never shapes an on-page choice or alters tactics. It functions as theme label, not a stake-driver. Label-only use without action pressure trends low.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Advises through metaphors" is stated ("using metaphors to guide them toward their own truths") but never dramatized. Lyra's apology method is described as metaphorical code, yet we see no actual metaphor-use that constrains her approach or costs her clarity. Label-only mention without visible tradeoff trends low.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Reconnect" is the declared goal and frames the narrative, but the act occurs offstage via summary ("her message had been sent"). No major turn traces to this action on the page; the apology could be delivered by any method without structural change. Functional but swappable places it mid-4s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>1.2</grade><comment>"Induced currents" appears twice as metaphor ("principles of induced currents," "carried on the induced currents") in the final third without mechanics or prior signal. It does not shape attempts or constrain method. Late ornamental mention trends low.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The sheet music archive is named early and anchors sensory detail ("scent of aged paper," "embossed covers"), meeting setup. It houses the bottle and provides thematic resonance, but does not pressure Lyra's choices—she could perform the same method anywhere. Postcard description without tactical constraint trends low-mid; early setup and thematic fit lift it to ~4.6.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"The hush before the orchard's trees are cut down" is seeded at ~40% and repeated twice, but it never tightens Lyra's decisions or imposes a deadline. Time is vague and untracked. Late arrival and no tactical pressure cap it below 4.0; thematic echo provides minor lift to 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Deliver an overdue apology" is stated early and frames Lyra's goal across the piece. It drives her archive search and bottle use, meeting setup and development. However, the apology itself is summarized offstage with no on-page friction between want and cost. Two-gate presence with functional involvement but no closure dramatization places it at 5.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Ethereal grit" is attempted through contrasts ("dimly lit," "grit of the world's imperfections tempered by the ethereal beauty"), but tone flattens into static mystical reverence without modulation under pressure. The orchard motif gestures toward grit, yet the ending resolves to comfort. Present but not charged by the final image trends low-mid.</comment>
