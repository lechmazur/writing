<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is presented through abstract labels ("scheming pacifist," "shifting grace") rather than embodied contradiction. Her "subtle spell of persuasion" and reaching through "cellular memory" are told conveniences without micro-choices that reveal cost or internal conflict. The mass transformation of the audience occurs off-camera through vague "hypnotic quality" and "golden light," bypassing individual resistance or dramatized struggle. No visible choice forecloses a path with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation test applied: who/where anchored early, but the "when" and causal stakes remain vague throughout. The dominant lens cannot be confidently inferred—moments gesture toward accumulative (recurring music box) but the mass healing and "reality shifts" imply causal magic without cost or constraint. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration but offers no on-page cost: the sanctuary becomes "a beacon" through summary, and Elara's later fame is told in epilogue rather than dramatized. The broken pin "lay forgotten" without charging the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The "soundless sanctuary" anchors location but remains generic; no specific sensory detail or spatial constraint shapes Elara's choices. The music box is described but not used as a tool—its broken pin does not constrain action. The "golden light" and "melody from the walls" are ornamental atmosphere without affecting tactics. Micro-setting elements (her seat, the audience's spatial arrangement) are absent, leaving choreography unclear.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—teaching release from resentment—is declared but never tested through resistance or trade-off. No on-page reversal narrows options; the audience shifts from pain to peace without dramatized friction. Elara's "moment to act" involves no visible cost or tactical adjustment. The ending's summary spans years without a single choice that forecloses a path or deepens pressure under any coherent lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Shifting grace" and "cellular memory" are thesis statements rather than emergent particulars. The final paragraph moralizes directly: "beauty that could emerge from the most unexpected places" and "enduring legacy" replace scene pressure with summary. The music box is symbolic convenience—broken yet functional when needed—without irony or earned contradiction. No thematic question receives a non-literal answer through image or action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains stable distance and the prose carries a distinct, slightly elevated register throughout. However, the narration withholds mechanics ("weave a subtle spell," "tapping into cellular memory") to manufacture mystery, and Elara's perception never embodies stress or doubt.句法 is controlled but uniform: most paragraphs open with "As" or "The" constructions, creating template cadence. No dialogue present to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "broken cylinder pin, a reminder of the fragility of harmony" / "broken music box cylinder pin lay forgotten, a reminder"; "she pondered" / "As she pondered"; "the music box...had found a way to reappear" / "reappears when needed." Template cadence: six consecutive paragraphs in the epilogue open with noun-phrase subjects followed by linking verbs. Stock metaphors: "faint melody," "soft, golden light," "beacon of hope." Filter-verb stack in mid-scene: "felt," "knew," "began to feel" across three lines. Artifacts touch closure (final third), triggering cap and 9+ disqualification globally per artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The premise—pacifist heals collective trauma through mystical music—follows familiar spiritual-teacher templates without transformation. "Shifting grace" and "cellular memory" are new-age labels rather than specific mechanical constraints. The broken-but-functional music box is symbolic convenience. No fresh synthesis or risk distinguishes this from dozens of similar sanctuary-healing tales. Derivative Premise Guardrail applies: −1.0 within Q8.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Scheming pacifist: present as label ("scheming," "pacifist stance") but no on-page scheme shapes a turn. Elara's "subtle spell" is asserted, not chosen through tactical friction. Missing middle development and closure participation as causal agent; outcomes are told. Late label (ornamental) + swappable (could be "wise healer") + no causal pressure = cap 3.8, adjusted down for summary-only use.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Music box cylinder pin: described in opening and mentioned in closing ("lay forgotten") but never handled or used. The box "plays" via magic, bypassing the broken pin's constraint. No middle beat involves the object. Two touches (ornamental frame) meet lyric-resonance minimum, but no reweighting of cost or meaning occurs—it remains a static symbol. Lyric allowance reaches ~5.5–6.3 only when return charges closure; here it is discarded. Cap 4.6 for missing development, −0.6 ornamental + −0.3 summary-only = 3.7, round to 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Shifting grace: Elara "pondered the concept" and "lived by" it, but it never constrains a choice or alters tactics on the page. Theme claim only. Missing all three gates (no setup action, no middle constraint, not operational at closure). Cap 2.8 for missing closure + −0.3 label-only.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>Reappears when needed: the melody "reappear[s] when needed" and later "the mysterious force that reappears when needed" are told meta-commentary, not demonstrated trait with cost. No setup, no middle constraint, cameo mention at closure. Cap 2.8 for missing closure participation, −0.4 for late first clear reference (final third summary) and −0.3 ornamental = 2.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Convince: Elara's goal is "to convince them" and she "began to weave a subtle spell of persuasion," but the action is asserted, not dramatized through dialogue or resistance. The audience shift is told ("faces around her began to change") without individual friction. Present in setup and referenced at closure, but no middle beat shows failed or adjusted persuasion attempt. Two gates (setup + closure cameo) allow ~6.0 max; missing middle development and summary-only execution = cap 3.4, but lyric goal-frame across story lifts slightly to 4.7 within allowed band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>Cellular memory: Elara "believed" it and "through the power of cellular memory, she reached out," but mechanics are never shown or constrained. Introduced late (second half), no setup, no cost, ornamental mention. Cap 4.6 for late intro, −0.6 ornamental + −0.5 summary-only + −0.3 late first appearance = 2.8, further reduced to 1.8 for pure assertion without dramatization.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Soundless sanctuary: setting frames the entire piece and returns in closure summary ("remained a sacred space"). Generic description without spatial constraint or resource pressure—no choice depends on silence or layout. Two gates (setup + closure), but postcard use without tactical pressure. Lyric frame allows ~5.5–6.0 when charged; here it remains inert. Cap 6.0 for two gates, −1.0 ornamental + −0.6 swappable (any "peaceful place") + −0.3 no causal pressure = 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>While reality shifts: "reality itself seemed to be bending" and "reality that had shifted...slowly settled back" are ornamental atmospheric claims. No time pressure, no ticking constraint, no before/after choice tied to the shift window. Missing all gates; pure decoration. Cap 2.8 + −0.4 ornamental = 2.4.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>To teach resentment to release: motivation is declared early ("determined to teach...particularly those consumed by resentment") and frames the action throughout. Elara's interior goal drives middle moves (the spell, the cellular reach) and closure references success ("taken the first step towards teaching"). Friction is minimal—no dramatized conflict between desire and cost—but the goal is present in all three gates and causally active. Three gates met; present across beats but no visible trade-off = eligible for 6.1–7.0 band, placed at 5.8 for lack of on-page friction or specific cost tied to teaching.</comment>
