<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The protagonist remains a passive vessel guided entirely by "the whispering advisor's voice," never making an independent choice or exhibiting internal contradiction. Motivation is told ("morbid curiosity," "determination to trick fear") but never embodied in a difficult micro-choice with visible cost. The "resuscitation" and "unbosom my deepest fears" are mentioned without dramatization. Emotional states are labeled ("unsettling connection," "creeping sense of dread") rather than shown through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive adequately early. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (building atmosphere through layered Gothic images), but no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs—the protagonist drifts through rooms collecting atmospheric details without narrowing options or changing knowledge. The blackout and awakening constitute a non-causal reset rather than closure with cost; the protagonist exits unchanged, and the "forever marked" claim is asserted, not demonstrated. No on-page Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with legible cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The funhouse setting provides vivid Gothic detail (tattered banner, dusty dream dictionary, cracked mirror) and is present across beats. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics—the protagonist moves freely through corridors without spatial friction. The opera cloak clasp and poster are described but do not pressure decisions. Micro-setting allowance partially met through recurring objects, but they remain ornamental rather than functional.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("to trick fear into revealing its weakness") is declared but never tested on the page through a choice with trade-offs. No escalation or tightening occurs; the protagonist passively follows the advisor's voice through a series of rooms in flat succession. The blackout and awakening are coincidental rather than earned by protagonist agency. No visible cost forecloses a path; the ending loops back to the beginning ("funhouse is always waiting") without transformation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The theme of confronting fear and "repulsive allure" is repeatedly stated ("trick fear," "confronting the dark recesses," "terror that lurked within") rather than emerging from concrete particulars. The opera cloak clasp and photographically cursed model are introduced as potential motifs but never constrain choice or accumulate pressure. The final image offers no resonant, non-literal answer—only restatement ("funhouse is always waiting"). Thematic echo in "forever marked by the experience" articulates thesis without scene pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>POV remains stable first-person throughout. The perceptual signature is generic Gothic-tourist rather than character-specific; diction stays in a narrow register of atmospheric declaration. The "whispering advisor's voice" device creates ambiguity about agency and knowledge source without thematic payoff. Psychic distance is consistent but the narrative stance offers no distinct texture—syntax and rhythm do not modulate with claimed emotional intensity ("shiver," "dread," "terror" are told, not embodied in prose rhythm).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Pervasive paraphrase loops and synonym churn: "The whispering advisor's voice echoed/grew louder/grew more insistent/whispered/laughed/remained" across nine beats without propulsion. Template cadence runs ("I pushed...I spotted...I recalled...I shuddered...I stumbled...I caught sight") span the entire piece. Stock metaphors ("siren's call" appears twice, "dark presence," "cold, dead weight") and filter-verb stacks ("I felt," "I knew," "I realized") dull immediacy in peak beats. Closure beat itself is abstract summary ("forever marked") rather than concrete image. Apply −1.4 for spread artifacts touching closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The core premise (cursed funhouse, mysterious woman, guiding voice) follows a standard Gothic-horror template without transformation. The "whispering advisor" and "photographically cursed model" are stock tropes used without fresh inflection. Specific details (opera cloak clasp, dream dictionary) are introduced but never made irreplaceable through causal necessity. The circular ending (protagonist exits but is haunted, funhouse waits for next victim) replicates familiar closure without synthesis or risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The whispering advisor appears in nine beats but makes no decisions—it only urges, guides, goads, laughs, whispers. The protagonist follows without friction or cost. No key turn results from the advisor's agency. Present throughout but purely ornamental guidance device.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The opera cloak clasp appears twice: once in the poster description ("glinting with an opera cloak clasp") and once in the mirror scene ("pulsed with an eerie energy"). Both uses are static description without handling or tactical constraint. No evolution or reweighted meaning; swappable with any Gothic jewelry.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Lingering luminance" is mentioned three times as atmospheric description ("faint glow," "luminance grew brighter," "lingering luminance faded") but never shapes stakes or alters options. The protagonist does not interact with or harness it despite the stated goal. Theme-label only.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.2</grade><comment>The "photographically cursed model" is recounted in exposition ("story of the photographically cursed model, whose image was said to be trapped") and reappears in the poster image. No on-page constraint or enabled action with cost; the curse is told, not demonstrated through tradeoffs.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Unbosom" appears once in a transitional clause ("Through the notes, I began to unbosom my deepest fears") without dramatization or consequence. The action does not create a turn; easily swappable with "confront" or "examine." Summary-only mention.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.3</grade><comment>The dream dictionary with paradoxical notes appears once in the middle third and is described as guiding the protagonist's hand, but the mechanics (what the notes say, how they unlock mysteries) remain opaque. The method is present but does not shape tactics or constrain attempts; replaced immediately by the mirror scene.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival funhouse frames the entire story, provides the labyrinthine corridors and props (poster, dictionary, mirror), and returns in the final image as a persistent threat. Setting supplies resources (the mirror reveals the woman) and pressures the journey through atmosphere. Falls short of constraining tactics—the protagonist moves freely—but participates in setup, development, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.6</grade><comment>"After the resuscitation" is mentioned once near the end ("The resuscitation, it seemed, had not been just a physical revival") but the timeframe is never dramatized or made urgent. No clock pressure on decisions; the protagonist wanders at leisure. Ornamental backstory reference only.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>The motivation "to trick fear into revealing its weakness" is stated once in exposition but never dramatized through a conflicted choice or visible friction between want and cost. The protagonist follows the advisor without resistance or tactical adaptation. Told-only desire.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Repulsive allure" is named explicitly once and echoed in descriptions of the woman's "otherworldly light" and "malevolent glee." Tone is coherent Gothic-dread throughout and modulates slightly with the mirror encounter, but remains largely static. Present in the final image ("repulsive allure that still lingered, a siren's call") as a charged callback, earning partial lyric-resonance credit.</comment>
