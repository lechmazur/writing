<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The courtesan remains an abstraction—"bodily poetic form" is label-only, never shown through gesture or physical choice under pressure. Interiority consists entirely of generic elevation ("heart heavy with the weight of expectation") without embodied contradiction or character-particular perception. The final "newfound sense of resolve" arrives unearned; no on-page micro-choice with visible cost bridges the untangling process to a changed stance. Motivation is declared ("to defy the lullaby of conformity") but never tested through competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within acceptable window. However, closure fails the cost-proof test: the courtesan "walks away" changed, but no on-page sentence identifies what path was foreclosed or what she renounced. The "untangling threads" sequence summarizes process without showing a single concrete choice that narrows options. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (snow, prism, echoes recur), yet the final image ("disappeared into the snowy landscape") does not reweight the dominant stake with undeniable pressure—it asserts transformation via travel metaphor.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The silver courtyard and prism are described vividly but remain postcard backdrops. No environmental feature constrains a choice: the courtesan could untangle threads anywhere. Snow "continued to fall" as atmospheric filler; the prism "began to glow" as spectacle without altering her tactics or options. Spatial choreography is clean, but the setting does not charge the final image or supply resources that affect outcome, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("defy the lullaby of conformity") is signaled early but never tested on the page. The untangling unfolds without opposition, cost, or reversal—each thread releases "echoes" in summary, no concrete price paid. The prism's glow arrives as external event, not protagonist agency. Escalation is asserted ("lighter, freer") rather than dramatized through a choice that narrows options. No tightening forecloses a live path or forces a trade-off with visible consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme (defiance of conformity) is stated repeatedly rather than emerging from particulars. The prism and threads function as convenient symbols harvested at the end without prior constraint. The final paragraph moralizes directly: "the beauty of being true to oneself" and "no longer a call to conformity" replace resonance with thesis. No non-literal answer arises from concrete experience; the courtesan articulates the prompt's theme in near-identical phrasing ("defy the lullaby of conformity"), triggering the Thematic Echo penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Diction is consistently elevated but generic: "bodily poetic form," "harvest of echoes," "alarming serenity" stack ornamental phrases without character-particular perception. Free indirect access remains stable, but perceptual signature is absent—any elevated narrator could produce this voice. Syntax is uniform (declarative statements of ~15–20 words) without modulation under pressure. No dialogue present. Register is controlled but lacks specificity; the courtesan's way of noticing (visual, kinesthetic, memory-led) never emerges.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "threads that bound her" / "threads began to unravel" / "each thread that was untangled" / "last thread was untangled" recycle the same image without added pressure. Template cadence: "As she [verb]" opens five sentences, creating mechanical rhythm. Figurative density is high without payoff: "lullaby of conformity," "harvest of echoes," "bodily poetic," "alarming serenity" cluster in every paragraph, violating the overwriting density check (−0.5). Mixed metaphor: threads are "woven around her like a shroud" yet she untangles them—shrouds are not woven nor untangled. Artifacts touch closure ("disappeared into the snowy landscape"), disallowing 9+ globally and applying the −1.7 deduction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Core premise (character sheds societal bonds via symbolic prism and thread-untangling) closely matches widely used self-actualization templates without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The courtesan's occupation ("chaste courtesan") is ornamental, never shaping stakes or worldview. Snow, starlight, prism, and threads are interchangeable high-fantasy set dressing. No turn feels inevitable in hindsight; the prism's glow and the courtesan's resolve arrive on schedule. Derivative Premise Guardrail applies (−1.0).</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Character present throughout but makes no on-page decision that alters tactics. Observation and summary dominate; the untangling is recounted, not shown through choice. No causal turn traces to her agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Prism appears in three beats (initial view, mid-story pull, glow at climax) and returns in final image ("remained, a beacon"). However, it is never handled or used—only gazed at and described. Its "facets glinting" and "pulsing light" are spectacle without mechanical specificity. No cost tied to the prism; it does not constrain choice or reweight prior material with undeniable pressure. Setup + closure present but middle development is passive; swappable with any magical object.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>Concept mentioned twice as label ("harvest of echoes") but never operationalized. Echoes are "released" and "fade into the distance" in summary; they do not change options or create stakes. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>Attribute appears three times as phrase ("bodily poetic form") without constraint or action. No cost, no choice enabled or foreclosed. Label-only mention.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Unlock occurs on-page ("the very essence of the prism had been unlocked") and is tied to the climax. However, the action is passive (prism glows, courtesan receives energy) rather than protagonist-driven. The unlock does not redefine options—she was already untangling threads. One key turn, but swappable with "activate" or "awaken."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Method signaled early ("began to untangle the threads") and recurs across multiple beats. However, mechanics are absent: how does she untangle? What cost or tool? The method is summarized ("worked," "painstaking") without on-page demonstration. Functional but generic; could be replaced with "cutting" or "dissolving" threads.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Setting (silver courtyard under snow) is anchored early and frames opening and closing. Snow and courtyard recur, reweighted in the final image ("snow-covered ground crunched beneath her feet"). However, neither courtyard nor snow constrains choice or supplies resources—they are atmospheric. Lyric reprise with modest reweighting, but no tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.2</grade><comment>Timeframe appears once in summary ("time it took was brief, a span between sigh and smile") with no clock, tightening, or tactical consequence. Vague metaphor, untracked.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Motivation stated explicitly in opening third ("defy the lullaby of conformity") and recurs in final paragraph ("no longer a call to conformity"). However, it is never dramatized through conflicted choice or on-page friction. Told-only; no visible cost tied to defiance.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Tone phrase ("alarming serenity") appears once near closure and is gestured at through "stillness," "silence," "tranquility." Mood is consistent but static; no modulation with pressure. The juxtaposition (alarm + serenity) is not embodied in the courtesan's perception or choice. Present as label, not charged in the final image.</comment>
