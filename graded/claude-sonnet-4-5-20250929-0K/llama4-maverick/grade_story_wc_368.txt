<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Kaito's interiority is consistently abstract and declarative rather than embodied. His motivation to "learn why some people magnetize stories" remains a told-only goal with no micro-choices that test competing impulses—he contemplates the wing without friction or price. The "insatiable curiosity" and epiphanies ("some individuals...possessed a unique ability to refract and reflect the light") arrive as summary rather than emerging through scene pressure. The donor heart backstory floats without anchoring present action or constraining choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The piece orients adequately by ~120 words (Kaito, tea house, blue morpho wing) and adopts an Accumulative/Textural lens, but closure remains ambiguous: the final paragraph asserts understanding and wonder without a decisive on-page shift in options or knowledge. The wing's colors "danced" and Kaito "realized" connections, yet no specific cost or foreclosed path is dramatized—the tea house "drifted on" unchanged. The narrative loops back to valley-mist wonder and iridescent caution without a visible before/after alteration or price paid.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The floating tea house is sketched early ("ancient engineering," "mist-shrouded valley") but never constrains a choice or shapes tactics—it remains a postcard backdrop. The blue morpho wing is handled twice (gazed at, then refracted), meeting minimal beat involvement, but does not alter movement or options. Sensory detail is generic ("soft, ethereal glow," "warm, golden glow") and filtered through abstract language rather than Kaito's professional dye-master lens. Spatial choreography is vague (no anchor for where others sit, how Kaito positions the wing).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding the wing's secrets—is signaled early but never tightened or tested. Kaito performs a single contemplative action (refracting light) without opposition, cost, or a narrowing of options. No reversal occurs; the "other occupants" watch passively and provide no friction. The ending asserts clarity and connection but dramatizes no choice, renunciation, or price—Kaito remains content, his exploration unchanged.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The theme of magnetism and storytelling is stated outright in the penultimate paragraph ("some individuals...possessed a unique ability to refract and reflect the light") rather than emerging through particulars. The blue morpho wing functions as an on-the-nose symbol for allure without complication or counterpoint. The final image—"iridescent caution" dissolving into mist—echoes the opening without reweighting prior material or offering a non-literal answer to the premise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice is stable third-person limited, but diction is generic and elevated ("ethereal glow," "realm of contemplation," "fabric of reality") rather than reflecting a dye master's perceptual signature. Interiority defaults to abstract summary ("he felt an iridescent caution," "his understanding...expanding"). No dialogue appears. Filter verbs ("he felt," "he was certain," "he believed") accumulate without voice-motivated purpose, dulling immediacy in several beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops abound: "secrets hidden within the wing's shimmering colors" → "the wing's secrets" → "secrets of the blue morpho wing" across paragraphs with no new information. Template cadence runs appear ("Kaito's eyes never left...," "Kaito's thoughts turned...," "Kaito decided...," "Kaito felt...," "Kaito smiled...," "Kaito rose"). Stock metaphors ("moths to a flame," "heart of the mystery," "sea of wonder") and elevated diction ("insatiable curiosity," "mesmerizing...testament") blur specificity. The final third recycles "valley-mist wonder" and "iridescent caution" without evolving their meaning, triggering artifact caps.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The premise—observing a butterfly wing to understand human magnetism—reads as a metaphor-first construction rather than an organically motivated investigation. The dye master's occupation is mentioned but never employed (no dye, no craft vocabulary). The mystical tea house, donor heart, and morpho wing feel assembled from a prompt checklist rather than synthesized into a unified world logic. The final epiphany is stated as platitude without transformation or risk.</comment>
