<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The mirror maker remains abstract throughout—no embodied contradictions, no micro-choices under pressure, only summary motivation ("to capture a runaway dream") that never faces dramatized resistance. Interiority consists of generic declarations ("eyes lit up," "heart swelled") without character-particular texture. The protagonist acts without friction: she gathers materials, breathes, completes the mirror, and vanishes, all in smooth sequence with no visible cost or renunciation that forecloses a path. The sextant connection is asserted ("inexplicable connection") rather than earned through on-page choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed and vague: who the mirror maker is, her concrete location within the orchard, and the timeline remain impressionistic past the first third (−0.4). The piece offers outline sequencing ("As she held… As she began… As the mirror neared completion") without causal because/therefore linkage—each step succeeds without resistance or trade-off. The ending presents a Resonant Reconfiguration (she vanishes into her dream-world), but the cost is told rather than shown: "leaving behind only the faintest whisper" is metaphor without dramatized forfeiture. No persistent constraint shapes tactics; the fog, sextant, and synchronized breathing serve as atmospheric props rather than pressure points.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The ruined orchard and twilight frost establish mood, and the sextant appears as a concrete object with tactile detail ("brass surface tarnished and worn"). However, the setting never constrains a choice: the fog is backdrop, the undergrowth a discovery site without spatial consequence. The body and tool (sextant) are held but not used to alter options. The final image ("glass mountains… reflected in the mirror maker's masterpiece") charges closure with lyric weight, meeting the micro-setting allowance and lifting the score into mid-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—capturing a runaway dream—is declared but never tested on the page; no on-page obstacle resists her. The sequence is additive: she feels grounded, breathes, gathers materials, and succeeds without reversal or tightening. Synchronized breathing and sextant use could narrow options or impose cost, but both appear as smooth enablers. The ending reconfigures meaning (boundaries erased), yet the transformation lacks agency-driven escalation or visible price paid during the process. One outline-like deepening (dream becomes mirror) is present but unearned by prior pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The theme of erasing boundaries emerges through the glass mountains image and the mirror's recursive reflection, avoiding overt thesis statements. The final image ("shimmering expanse") reweights prior material and offers non-literal resonance. However, the piece leans on abstract phrasing ("boundaries between reality and fantasy were erased" appears verbatim three times) rather than embodying the theme through dramatized cost. The sextant's transformation from broken to "whole in spirit" is asserted, not earned. The recurring frost motif charges the ending without being ornamental, meeting threshold resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, but narrative distance oscillates between impressionistic lyricism and summary reporting. Perceptual signature is generic: "eyes lit up," "heart swelled," "spirit soared" recur as unearned declarations. The prose employs elevated diction ("morbid perfume," "specter on the horizon") without voice-specific grounding in the mirror maker's worldview. Sentence stems loop: "As she… As the mirror… As she gazed…" across multiple beats (−0.5 in Q7, noted here for voice monotony). No dialogue present; focalization remains clean but lacks interior specificity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Template cadence pervades: "As [subject] [verb]" opens six sentences across the middle third, flattening rhythm (−0.5). Paraphrase loops appear: "erasing the boundaries" is restated three times without added pressure (−0.3). Stock metaphors cluster without transformation: "shards of splintered light," "specter on the horizon," "ethereal glow." Figurative language appears in most sentences of key beats without pattern-teaching, creating density without clarity (−0.4). The final third maintains the same looped cadence and elevated register, dulling the closure image. Information density is low: many lines restate mood rather than advancing situation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The mirror-maker premise and dream-capturing motive are familiar, executed without fresh inflection. The sextant as instrument of transformation offers slight specificity, but its use remains ornamental. The ending's boundary-erasure and vanishing-into-art trope echo well-worn fantasy templates without lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The piece commits to its lyric mode but does not risk structural boldness or perspectival surprise. Emotional particularity is absent: the mirror maker could be swapped with any artisan-dreamer archetype. Mid-band: competent synthesis of existing ideas without distinctive synthesis or transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The mirror maker is present throughout but makes no key choices; she observes, feels, and completes tasks in smooth sequence. No decision alters tactics or forecloses an option with cost. Setup clear, closure participation present (she vanishes), but middle development consists of enacted steps rather than agency-driven turns. Swappable with any artisan protagonist.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The sextant appears early (setup gate met) and is held/felt in two beats: discovery and anchoring moment. Its "fragments" are mentioned at closure ("once broken, now seemed whole in spirit"), offering lyric reprise. However, it does not constrain a choice or enable a specific tactic; the mirror maker succeeds whether or not the sextant is present. Functional but replaceable; a talisman or any tool could serve the same role with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Erasing boundaries is signaled early ("boundaries between reality and fantasy were erasing"), recurs in the middle ("boundaries… begin to blur"), and anchors the ending image ("boundaries… were erased"). The concept shapes the thematic lens and charges the final reconfiguration. However, it does not alter on-page tactics or impose a visible cost; it remains thematic rather than causal. Two gates (setup, closure) met; middle development is conceptual mention. Lyric reprise reweights the stake, reaching lower 5-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Firmly grounded" appears once as a felt state ("she felt firmly grounded") without constraining or enabling a subsequent action. No trade-off or cost is tied to this trait; it is label-only. Setup gate missed (appears mid-story), no middle or closure participation. Ornamental mention.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Recreate" is declared as motive, drives the middle sequence (gathering materials, shaping glass), and produces the closure artifact (the mirror). It is present across all three gates and essential to the plot's forward motion. However, the process is smooth and unopposed; the action could be "construct" or "forge" with identical beats. Strong setup and payoff lift it into mid-6s, but lack of unique causal pressure or visible cost caps further elevation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Synchronized breathing is named in the middle third as the method and executed in one beat ("breathe in tandem with the rhythm of the fog"). Setup gate missed (introduced late), middle use present, no return at closure. The mechanics do not constrain choice or impose cost; it is one step in a smooth sequence. Functional mention without causal weight, capped at mid-4s by late introduction.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The ruined orchard district and fog frame the entire story (setup gate met) and return at closure ("remained lost in the fog"). The setting supplies the sextant discovery site and mood but does not constrain tactics or alter options; the mirror maker's work proceeds unaffected by spatial or atmospheric pressure. Lyric reprise and sustained presence across beats lift it into lower 5-band, but lack of causal pressure limits further scoring.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Upon the shimmer of twilight frost" anchors the opening and recurs at the ending ("when the frost shimmered"). Twilight marks the discovery beat and the closure window. The timeframe shapes pacing (approaching twilight → completion by night) and charges the final image with atmospheric specificity. Setup and closure gates met; middle development is implicit. The time element does not impose a ticking-clock constraint, but its lyric return reweights the ending, reaching lower 6-band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The motivation to capture a runaway dream is declared early, drives every middle beat (gathering, breathing, mirror-making), and is fulfilled at closure ("she had succeeded in capturing the runaway dream"). All three gates met. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicting choices or visible cost; the mirror maker never faces friction between want and price. Essential to structure but lacks on-page tension, capping at mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Glass mountains" appear as the dream's content, shape the mirror's final image, and anchor the ending's lyric charge ("the glass mountains could be seen, reflected in the mirror maker's masterpiece"). The motif is present across setup, middle (vision), and closure, and its shimmering, fragmented quality modulates the tone from morbid to ethereal. The tone coheres and charges the final image with specificity. Strong closure linkage and irreplaceability lift it into lower 6-band, just meeting the threshold for causal contribution to the ending's resonance.</comment>
