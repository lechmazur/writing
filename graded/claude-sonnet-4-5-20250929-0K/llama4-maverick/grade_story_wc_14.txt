<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The stationer remains a static figure throughout; her "earnestly studious" nature and fascination with textures are asserted but never tested or complicated by genuine internal conflict. Actions are all aligned—she charts, she walks, she records—with no contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The ending satisfaction ("smiled, knowing") reads as unearned because no path was foreclosed and no cost was paid; she simply continues collecting with no alteration or renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Drive lens appears Accumulative/Textural, but the piece never deepens or tightens pressure; it circles the same texture-collection activity from start to finish. Orientation is delayed—who, where, and when coalesce only gradually across the opening paragraphs, breaching the ~120-word anchor window without taught pattern or payoff (−0.4). No closure unit is legible: the stationer ends exactly as she began, with no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing; the final image merely restates her ongoing project without visible cost or reweighting of prior material.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The bonsai labyrinth and mountaintop setting are vividly described with sensory detail (cherry blossoms, chirping birds, dappled light), but they function as backdrop rather than constraint or resource. The fluorescent lamp on a tree stump is spatially incongruous and its presence is never justified by world logic. The setting does not pressure a single choice or alter tactics; the stationer moves through it freely, collecting textures without friction.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>One dominant stake—collecting textures—is signaled early, but it never faces opposition, tightening, or cost. The stationer completes her dawn charting, then walks and charts again; each beat is additive without escalation or trade-off. No reversal or deepening occurs; the lamp's hum fades simply because dawn ends, not because of protagonist choice. The resolution is not earned by any alteration or renunciation; she continues her work with no visible price paid or path foreclosed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme of "invented histories" and texture-collection is stated explicitly rather than emerging from dramatized tension ("She believed that every object...held a unique texture"). The piece asserts depth ("incandescent restraint," "kaleidoscope of sensations") but offers no concrete conflict or ambiguity for the reader to interpret. The final image restates the premise without reweighting it; no resonant answer to a central question is offered, only reiteration of the stationer's ongoing project.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited, and the perceptual filter remains consistent (texture-focused, studious). However, diction drifts into elevated register that strains the focalizer's immediate experience: "incandescent restraint," "kaleidoscope of sensations," "refract the essence" feel authorial rather than character-particular. Sentence stems repeat frequently ("The stationer's...," "The air was filled..."), flattening rhythm. No dialogue is present, so those bullets do not apply.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops are pervasive: the stationer's dedication and the forest's textures are restated across multiple paragraphs without added pressure. Template cadence runs through the piece ("The stationer's eyes sparkled," "The stationer's pencil moved," "The stationer's footsteps"). Stock metaphors ("labyrinth of secrets," "symphony of textures") and synonym churn ("unique texture," "intricate web of histories," "fragment of the world's essence") dull specificity. Artifacts appear throughout, including in the final third, triggering −1.4 in Q7 and disallowing 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The core premise—an artist collecting ephemeral textures—echoes familiar "sensitive observer" templates without transformation through lived conflict or non-obvious stakes. The fluorescent lamp on a mountaintop bonsai forest juxtaposes incongruous elements but does not synthesize them into a coherent world logic or fresh thematic angle. No turn or intensification arises from prior particulars; the piece recycles its own assertions. The middle-ground hedging (beauty without friction, satisfaction without cost) avoids bold choices.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>The gilded-leaf stationer is present throughout and performs actions (charting, walking, opening notepad), but none of her choices create key turns or narrow options. She observes and records without facing resistance or alteration. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The battered notepad appears in the opening, mid-forest, and closing beats, fulfilling the two-touch test. However, its use is static description across all appearances: she holds it, opens it, closes it, clutches it. No evolving function or reweighted meaning emerges; it remains a passive recording tool without causal pressure or closure charge. Functional but replaceable with any similar object.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Invented histories" is asserted as her belief system in the opening but never shapes stakes, creates friction, or alters tactics on the page. It functions as thematic label rather than active concept that changes options. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>"Earnestly studious" is claimed in the opening ("as an earnestly studious collector") but exists only as label. The trait does not constrain or enable a single on-page action with cost; she studies freely without trade-off or friction. Label-only mention.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Refract" appears twice as a verb describing her aim (to refract the lamp's hum, to refract light around her), but the action is metaphorical and non-specific. No concrete mechanics tie refracting to plot turns; the word could be swapped with "capture" or "record" with no structural impact. Present but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Charting the fluorescent lamp's hum is signaled early, detailed in the dawn sequence (pencil capturing vibrations on notepad), and mentioned again at the very end. The method is shown across two beats, but its mechanics do not alter tactics or create cost—the lamp simply fades as dawn ends, not because of her choices. Functional use across beats but no closure linkage or causal pressure; mid-band at best.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The blooming labyrinth of bonsai forests on a mountaintop is vividly described and present throughout. However, it functions as backdrop: the stationer moves freely without the setting constraining choices or supplying resources that affect outcome. The path "wound its way" and revealed clearings, but no spatial challenge or environmental pressure emerges. Functional but replaceable with any picturesque forest setting.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>"After the town goes silent" frames the opening and is mentioned once more mid-story, but time does not tighten decisions or alter tactics. The dawn sequence unfolds without a live clock; the lamp's hum fades because morning arrives, not because of time pressure on the protagonist. Vague timeframe that does not constrain action.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to collect the textures of different times" is stated explicitly and drives her actions (charting, walking, recording). However, the desire is never conflicted or tested; she collects freely without friction between wants and costs. No on-page struggle or trade-off dramatizes the motivation. Told and functional but not dramatized with conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Incandescent restraint" is named once in the air mid-story. The tone itself—lyrical, contemplative, measured—remains stable throughout without modulation under pressure. The final image does not charge or shift the tone; it simply continues the same register. Static mood that does not evolve with narrative pressure; mid-low band.</comment>
