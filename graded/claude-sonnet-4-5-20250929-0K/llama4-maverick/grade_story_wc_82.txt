<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Kaito's motivation—to transform grief into origami cranes—is signaled but never tested by a concrete choice. The "shadow detached" backstory remains abstract; we never see what was lost or how folding cranes costs him something now. Interior life consists largely of poetic summary ("his heart ached with a deep longing") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The final crane release reads as symbolic gesture without foreclosing a live option or revealing a hierarchy of values.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: we learn "floating island tea garden" and "lantern maker" early, but the inciting pressure and timeframe anchor ("after the shadow detached") arrive only through reflective asides, never dramatized. The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode—lyric meditation on grief—but no meaningful tightening or pattern break occurs; the final crane release is presented, not earned by prior tactical choices. Closure lacks visible cost: releasing one crane does not foreclose a path or reweight prior stakes on the page. The Cost Proof Test fails: no sentence shows what Kaito loses or sacrifices by this act.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The floating-island setting and glass basilica supply vivid atmospheric detail, and the filigree of lanterns at the garden's edge provides spatial grounding for the final beat. However, environment never constrains a choice: Kaito could perform identical actions in any workshop. Sensory detail (clouds, mist, orange glow) remains decorative rather than filtered through urgent POV priorities. The tea garden functions as backdrop, not crucible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—transforming grief—is declared but never tested by on-page opposition or escalation. No reversal or tightening narrows Kaito's options; he moves from working on a lantern to releasing a crane without friction. The story lacks agency-driven pressure: coincidence (sunset, breeze) enables the final act rather than a costly decision. Under the Accumulative lens, we expect density increase or cadence shift; instead the piece loops thematically without deepening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The theme of grief-as-craft emerges through concrete images (lanterns, cranes, gem polishing) and avoids overt moralizing in the final paragraph. However, "luminous torment" and similar phrases veer toward poetic abstraction rather than particular experience. The crane release offers a visual answer to the thematic question but lacks the narrative cost that would make the answer resonate beyond metaphor. Backstory about the shadow remains generic sorrow rather than specific loss.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV holds stable, and diction ("crafty," "testament," "hallowed halls") conveys a faintly archaic, elevated register consistent with the fantastical setting. Yet the voice lacks a perceptual signature: descriptions catalog beauty without bias or omission tied to Kaito's craft expertise. Repeated syntactic stems ("As he worked," "As the light danced," "As the sun began to set," "As the stars began to twinkle") create template cadence that dulls urgency. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed") stack without voice motivation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "transforming sorrow into something radiant" echoes "transform his grief into something tangible," and "luminous torment" recurs without reweighting. Stock metaphors ("damp shroud," "lotus flower") and elevated diction ("ephemeral whispers," "hallowed halls") drift into purple register. Template cadence—runs of "As [subject] [verb]" and "The [noun], [descriptor], seemed to [verb]"—flattens rhythm across high-pressure beats (the final sequence). Information density is low: many sentences restate mood without advancing knowledge or choice. These artifacts touch the closure paragraph, triggering the −1.7 line-level penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The floating-island tea garden and dream-recording basilica offer surface novelty, but the emotional arc—artist transmutes grief through craft—follows a familiar template without transformation. The "shadow detached" frame and "fold grief into origami cranes" read as prompt fulfillment rather than organic synthesis. No bold structural or thematic risk distinguishes the piece; the final crane release could slot into dozens of similar grief-and-art narratives with minimal edits.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Kaito is present throughout and performs actions (working on a lantern, producing a crane, releasing it), satisfying setup and closure gates. However, his choices do not create key turns: he decides to release the crane without visible cost or tactical constraint. "Crafty" is mentioned once as a label and never demonstrated. The character is functional but replaceable—any artisan grieving could execute the same beats.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The glass basilica appears in paragraph 3 as distant scenery, reappears in paragraph 15 as "a distant, shimmering presence," and is mentioned again in paragraph 21 as beckoning. It is never handled, entered, or causally engaged; it functions as atmospheric backdrop. No choice hinges on its presence, and its "dream recording" function remains decoration. Missing middle development and closure participation gates cap the score at 2.8; ornamental use lowers it further.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>Dream recording is mentioned once (paragraph 4: "the art of dream recording was perfected") and alluded to vaguely ("his thoughts ascending to the realm of the dreamers"). It never shapes stakes, alters tactics, or appears in the ending. The concept is ornamental exposition without causal pressure. Missing all three gates and introduced late in narrative focus.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Descends while ascending" is illustrated once in paragraph 6 as a sensation Kaito has grown accustomed to—no cost, no constraint on action. The paradox is told rather than dramatized and does not recur or influence the ending. Label-only use; missing middle and closure gates.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Transform" appears throughout (grief into tangible form, sorrow into radiance) and anchors the thematic spine. Setup is early, and the final crane release enacts transformation visibly. However, the action is not exclusive to this story: "create," "craft," or "shape" would serve identically. One major beat (the ending) involves it, but the middle lacks a turn where transformation is tested or costs something, limiting the score despite closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Gem polishing is introduced in paragraph 8 as a method Kaito employs on lantern glass. It signals craft detail but never recurs or constrains a later choice. The ending involves folding and releasing a crane, not polishing. Setup gate met; middle development and closure participation missing. Swappable with any artisan technique.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The floating island tea garden anchors the setting from the opening and hosts the final beat (Kaito at the garden's edge). The mist, clouds, and lantern filigree supply atmosphere. However, the setting never pressures a choice or supplies a resource that alters outcome—Kaito could perform identical actions in any elevated workshop. Setup and closure gates met; middle development (causal constraint) missing. Postcard description rather than tactical crucible limits the score to mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"After the shadow detached" is mentioned in paragraph 5 as context for Kaito's vivid dreams. The timeframe is vague (no clock, no urgency tied to the detachment event) and does not tighten decisions. The story unfolds in a single evening with no time pressure. Setup gate barely met; middle and closure gates missing. The phrase functions as backstory label rather than narrative engine.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The motivation—to fold grief into origami cranes—is signaled in paragraph 9, drives Kaito's actions (folding in secret, producing the crane, releasing it), and appears in the final beat. The desire is thematically consistent and shapes the ending image. However, it is never dramatized as conflicted: no friction between wanting to fold cranes and another cost or fear. All three gates met; causal pressure present but weak (no visible trade-off on the page). Specificity and closure linkage lift the score into the 6-band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Luminous torment" is named in paragraph 10 and recurs in paragraphs 19 and 24, establishing tone coherence. The oxymoron—beauty and pain—colors descriptions of lanterns and the creative process. However, the tone remains static rather than modulating with pressure; the final image does not charge or resolve the torment with new meaning. Setup, middle echo, and closure presence satisfy the gate model, but the lack of dynamic shift or cost connection limits the score. Phrase repetition without reweighting trends mid-band.</comment>
