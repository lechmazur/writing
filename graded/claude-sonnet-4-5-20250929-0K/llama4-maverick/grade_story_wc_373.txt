<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lena's motivation to find the watch fob is established, but her interior landscape remains generic ("heart quickened," "comforting unease"). The rival-runner subplot and "capture the sound of trust breaking" introduce competing stakes without integration; the standoff with The Shadow resolves through mere confrontation rather than a choice that forecloses a path. "Curiously steadfast" appears twice as a label without constraining action. The closing reflective passage tells accomplishment rather than embodying transformation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land within the first paragraph. The piece follows a causal design: Lena seeks the fob, acquires it, then confronts The Shadow. However, the closure unit is weak—the standoff "dissipates" into "fragile understanding" without a decisive change or visible cost on the page; the final paragraph summarizes her feelings rather than landing an image that reweights prior material. The "truce of hush" and "sound of trust breaking" remain abstract, never dramatized as concrete stakes that narrow options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The pirate market setting is vividly anchored early with sensory detail (saltwater, rotting pier, rusting machinery). However, the environment remains decorative rather than constraining choices—Lena navigates stalls without spatial friction, and the sunrise timeframe doesn't pressure her tactics. The watch fob is handled twice (vendor handoff, Lena clutches it during standoff), which charges the final third modestly but doesn't alter the outcome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding the fob to uncover family secrets—is signaled early but shifts mid-story to thwarting The Shadow without clear integration. The vendor transaction passes without friction, and the standoff escalates only through atmosphere ("tension was palpable") rather than narrowing Lena's options. The resolution occurs off-page as tension "dissipates" into understanding; no on-page cost or trade-off forecloses a path. One tightening point (the fob exchange) exists, but it doesn't drive the climax.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme of secrets and fragile peace emerges from particulars (the fob, market whispers, standoff), but "capture the sound of trust breaking" remains abstract—never dramatized in scene. The final paragraph moralizes ("power of determination," "secrets hidden in the shadows") rather than trusting the image. The "truce of hush" appears twice but functions as a label, not a constraint that reweights prior material. Subtext in the vendor exchange ("knowing glint") is present but underexploited.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is generic (Lena notices "hushed conversations," "furtive glances") without character-specific bias. Dialogue is minimal but functional; the vendor's "sweetheart" and Shadow's "low, menacing chuckle" serve purpose. Psychic distance shifts intentionally at the reflective close, though the register elevates into summary. Free indirect style is clean, but diction lacks texture under pressure—no syntactic degradation during the standoff.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear with varied syntax, but several loops and scaffolds accumulate: "the sound of" appears three times, "curiously steadfast" twice, and the final third recycles "fragile peace/understanding" and "secrets hidden" without added pressure. The standoff paragraph stacks filter verbs ("saw a glimmer," "spoke," "never leaving") that dull immediacy. Information density is moderate; the middle vendor transaction and Shadow confrontation both advance plot, but the closing reflection paraphrases on-page events. No loops touch the closure beat directly, so −0.6 for cumulative pattern.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The pirate market beneath a pier and moonshine-runner daughter offer specificity, but the core arc—retrieve object, confront shadowy rival—follows a familiar template. The "sound of trust breaking" remains an intriguing but undramatized metaphor. The Shadow's identity mystery and the watch fob's "secrets" hint at originality but neither pays off with a non-obvious turn. Emotional specificity is limited by generic interiority. The piece commits to its premise but doesn't transform it through lived detail or moral calculus.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Lena is present throughout and makes two key decisions: purchasing the fob and confronting The Shadow. However, both actions are reactive rather than altering tactics under pressure. The fob acquisition is frictionless, and the standoff resolves through external dissipation ("tension began to dissipate") rather than her choice. Her agency is visible but does not transform the closure unit. Setup present, two beats involved, but closure linkage is weak and cost is absent.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The antique watch fob is introduced early, acquired mid-story, and clutched during the standoff, meeting the two-beat minimum. It seeds the quest and reappears in the climax when The Shadow recognizes it, creating a moment of charged connection. However, its "secrets" remain abstract—never revealed or reweighted—so closure participation is partial. Causal pressure is moderate; it motivates the search but doesn't constrain the confrontation's outcome. Setup + middle + weak closure = ~5.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"A truce of hush" appears twice as atmospheric description (the crowd's hush after the fob purchase, the lingering hush at close) but never shapes stakes or tactics. It functions as a thematic label rather than a constraint that alters Lena's options. The concept is ornamental, mentioned but not dramatized in choice. Present but does not create pressure or reweight meaning at closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Curiously steadfast" is applied twice as a label (father's expression, father's determination) but never constrains or enables an on-page action with cost. It describes backstory mood rather than driving a present choice. Ornamental use without integration into Lena's tactics or the standoff dynamics.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Thwart" is stated as Lena's mission and motivates her presence at the market and confrontation with The Shadow. However, the thwarting itself is passive—she observes, speaks one line, and the tension dissipates without her forcing a turn. The action is swappable with "confront" or "expose" with minor edits. Setup present, middle involvement modest, closure participation weak. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>1.2</grade><comment>"Through false starts" is never depicted on the page. The Shadow's sabotage is summarized in exposition ("false starts and sabotage"), but no false start is dramatized in Lena's quest or confrontation. The method is mentioned but not enacted, failing setup, development, and payoff gates. Ornamental backstory reference.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The pirate market hidden beneath a rotting pier is established early with sensory anchors and remains the sole location. It supplies the fob and stages the standoff, providing essential resources and atmosphere. However, the setting doesn't pressure Lena's choices—navigation is frictionless, spatial layout doesn't constrain tactics, and the pier's decay is decorative. Setup strong, development present (fob acquisition), closure participation moderate (standoff location). Causal role in two beats but no tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Until sunrise" is signaled early ("hours ticked by," "darkness slowly beginning to recede," "standoff continued until sunrise") and marks the confrontation's temporal boundary. However, the timeframe doesn't tighten decisions—Lena and The Shadow simply wait as light arrives, with no urgency or tactic shaped by the approaching deadline. The clock is tracked but passive. Setup present, development weak, closure participation as marker only. Functional but does not alter tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"To capture the sound of trust breaking" is stated as Lena's mission but never dramatized. She does not pursue this goal through concrete action—no recording, listening, or choice framed by this desire. The phrase recurs in exposition but remains abstract, disconnected from the fob quest and Shadow confrontation. Told-only without on-page friction or cost. Present in setup and mentioned at closure, but not enacted in development.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Comforting unease" is named once mid-story ("comforting unease that had settled over her was a familiar feeling") and the tone does blend tension with Lena's practiced competence. However, the tone remains static—no modulation during the vendor exchange or standoff that would deepen the "comforting" layer against rising threat. Atmosphere is consistent but does not charge the final image or shift with pressure. Functional presence without escalation or closure participation.</comment>
