<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Lyra remains entirely abstract—a "cloud-shadow poet" label without embodied emotion, internal contradiction, or visible cost at closure. Her "tremor of certainty" is asserted repeatedly but never dramatized through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The surrender to the muse and subsequent transformation are told rather than shown through specific action or foreclosed paths. No meaningful change or renunciation is earned; she simply experiences beauty and leaves unchanged.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>No identifiable closure unit—no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with on-page cost. Lyra enters, observes, creates poetry, and departs; nothing narrows options or reweights meaning. The "boundaries dissolve" moment is claimed in narration but not dramatized through causal linkage or visible consequence. Drive lens remains ambiguous throughout (accumulative texture without escalation or causal through-line), and the ending merely restates the opening premise without alteration or cost. Orientation is present early, preventing further penalty, but the absence of closure caps the score.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The cobalt atrium, frozen lake, and humming quartz colonnade are described vividly but remain static backdrops; they do not constrain choice or charge the closure image. Spatial choreography is coherent (Lyra's position at the lake's edge, the colonnade as sentinel), and sensory details are selective. However, the environment never pressures a decision or supplies a resource that alters outcome, keeping the score in the mid-band despite vivid description.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>No dominant stake is dramatized or tested on the page. Lyra's desire to "stride through boundaries" is declared but never opposed, complicated, or made costly. The piece presents a single unvarying mood—contemplative observation—with no reversal, tightening, or deepening that narrows options. Agency is absent; Lyra passively receives inspiration and leaves. No meaningful escalation under any lens; coincidence and convenience drive the experience without earned cost or sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Theme ("boundaries dissolve through art") is stated overtly rather than emerging from concrete events: "the power of art to transcend the limitations of the mundane," "the transformative power of art." The final image offers no non-literal answer or reweighting; it simply reiterates the opening claim. Subtext is absent—everything is narrated directly without implication or earned insight. No specific experience generates wisdom; the piece asserts thematic resonance without dramatizing it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Single-POV stance is stable, but the narrative voice is generic and interchangeable—"aesthetically driven soul," "otherworldly allure," "lantern-moth hush"—constructed from elevated poetic clichés rather than a character-particular perceptual signature. Register remains consistent but lacks specificity or embodied texture. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance is uniformly remote, never modulating with pressure. The voice reads as a committee consensus of poetic tropes rather than Lyra's singular idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Pervasive paraphrase loops and synonym churn across adjacent lines: "boundaries she had once thought sacred" / "stride through boundaries once thought sacred" / "boundaries that had once seemed so rigid"; "tremor of certainty" appears three times with identical phrasing. Template cadence dominates—"the air was heavy," "the world around her," "with a sense of"—without variation. Figurative language stacks without payoff: "lantern-moth hush," "canvas of white silk," "river breaking its banks." These artifacts dull momentum and obscure the closure beat, triggering the patterned-artifact penalty pack. Information density is low; many sentences restate prior content without advancing knowledge or pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>The premise—artist finds inspiration in mystical setting and is transformed—is a widely used template executed without fresh inflection. No specific, non-obvious synthesis emerges; "cloud-shadow poet," "lantern-moth hush," and "humming quartz colonnade" are ornamental tokens rather than grounded choices that constrain action. Emotional arc and plot could transfer unchanged to any mystical setting with different names. No bold risk-taking or transformation of familiar material; the piece hedges in the safety middle of poetic abstraction.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>Lyra observes and paraphrases whispers but makes no choice that alters tactics or narrows options. Her decisions—stepping closer, allowing words to flow, turning to leave—are passive acceptances of mood rather than active turns. She is present throughout but functions as a vessel for description rather than an agent whose choices create stakes or cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The humming quartz colonnade is described in multiple beats (opening, middle pulse, final testament) and returns at the end, but it never changes meaning or constrains action. It remains a static backdrop pulsing with "gentle energy" without altering Lyra's tactics or choices. Setup and payoff are present; middle development is ornamental rather than causal. The element is replaceable—any mystical landmark could serve the same function.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"A tremor of certainty" appears three times but only as a label for Lyra's state; it does not shape on-page stakes, narrow options, or create visible cost. The concept is thematic decoration rather than a driver of tactics or decisions. It echoes through narration without altering what Lyra does or forecloses.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.6</grade><comment>"Aesthetically driven" is mentioned once ("her aesthetically driven soul") as a static descriptor. It does not constrain or enable any on-page action with cost; Lyra's choices are uniform and unopposed regardless of this trait. Label-only presence without dramatized tradeoff or friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Paraphrase" appears in two beats: Lyra paraphrases the whispers of the quartz, and later her paraphrasing becomes incantation. The action is signaled early and shapes the middle turn (words as incantation), but it does not drive the closure or create visible cost. Removing "paraphrase" and replacing it with "echo" or "weave" would leave structure intact. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Dissolving boundaries" is mentioned multiple times and appears in the ending, but the mechanics—how boundaries dissolve—remain vague. The method is asserted rather than demonstrated through specific action. It functions as thematic claim rather than a means that shapes attempts or alters tactics. Present in closure but ornamental rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The cobalt atrium by the frozen lake is established early and present throughout. Lyra stands at the lake's edge with toes curled, and the atrium frames the scene, but neither location pressures a choice or supplies a resource that affects outcome. Spatial choreography is coherent, and the setting charges the final image with "soft, otherworldly light," providing a lyric reprise. Two gates met (setup, payoff); middle development is descriptive rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>0.9</grade><comment>"After the ban lifts" is mentioned once in the opening clause and never referenced again. Time does not tighten decisions, create urgency, or shape tactics. The timeframe is inert context that could be removed without altering the narrative. No clock or temporal pressure; functionally absent from stakes and closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"To stride through boundaries once thought sacred" is declared as motivation in two beats and appears in the final paragraph, but it is never dramatized through conflicted choice or visible cost. Lyra experiences no friction between this desire and any competing value or obstacle. The motivation is told rather than tested; no on-page tradeoff or sacrifice demonstrates its pull or price. Present and thematic but not embodied in action under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Lantern-moth hush" appears twice (middle and near end) and labels the tonal register, which remains consistently hushed and reverent throughout. Tone does not modulate with pressure—there is no pressure—but it is coherent and charges the final image as a "haunting reminder." The element provides atmospheric continuity and returns with slight reweighting. Functional lyric use without causal involvement; one gate (setup) is weak, but closure participation lifts the score into the mid-band.</comment>
