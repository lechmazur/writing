<comment>Elian is defined primarily by abstract labels—"synesthetically blessed," "prism-song bell ringer"—without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. Her motivation "to certify wonder as essential" is declared and restated but never dramatized through a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. The sculptor remains a prop without pressure or distinct presence. Interior life consists of philosophical summaries rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<comment>No legible closure unit occurs: the "sculpted hush" is "unfettered" off-page via convenience (the chisel strike), and Elian's smile afterward asserts success without on-page cost, choice, or stance crystallization. The orientation window (~120 words) fails to anchor who Elian is in concrete terms, where precisely she stands in the cavern, or what immediate problem drives her; the Orientation Test penalty applies (−0.4). Causality is abstract: singing causes shimmer, chisel strike causes "burst," but no because/therefore linkage alters options or knowledge. The piece reads as a single descriptive tableau rather than a sequence with motivated linkage or accumulative deepening.</comment>

<comment>The ice cavern is vividly described (crystalline structures, luminescent fungi, aurora colors) but remains postcard scenery; no environmental feature constrains a choice or charges the final image. The amber music sheet is mentioned twice but never handled in a way that alters tactics. Spatial choreography is vague: Elian's position, the sculptor's distance, and the marble's location never cohere into a legible stage.</comment>

<comment>The dominant stake—"to certify wonder as essential"—is declared but never tested by a live opposition or choice that narrows options. No meaningful tightening or escalation occurs; the sequence is: Elian sings → cavern shimmers → chisel strikes → success asserted. The sculptor's chisel strike is a coincidental event that resolves the goal without Elian's agency driving the turn. No visible price is paid; the ending asserts peace and purpose without forfeiting a live path.</comment>

<comment>Theme is stated overtly ("certify wonder as essential," "deeper truths of existence") rather than emerging from concrete particulars. The final paragraph moralizes: "Elian knew that she would carry this sense of awe with her, inspiring others…" and "a haunting reminder of the transcendent power of art." The sculpted hush operates as a symbolic label without accruing specific meaning through action. Thematic echo penalty applies (−0.6) for prompt-like language in the closing lines.</comment>

<grade>4.3</grade>
<comment>Narrative distance is unstable: "synesthetically blessed individual" and "prism-song bell ringer" read as external labels rather than Elian's self-perception. Register drifts into elevated abstraction ("the perfect, serene silence that underlay all creation," "oscillating repose") that does not sound like lived thought under pressure. The prose lacks perceptual signature; Elian's "kaleidoscope of colors and textures" is asserted but never rendered through specific image or micro-choice. No dialogue appears. The voice reads generic rather than character-particular.</comment>

<grade>3.8</grade>
<comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "sculpted hush" is restated across five paragraphs without added pressure; "wonder as essential" is claimed in three separate formulations. Template cadence dominates the final third: "Elian smiled, knowing…," "The amber music sheet…remained…," "As Elian left…," "In the stillness…," "And so…," "The memory…"—seven consecutive beats begin with subject-verb scaffolding without syntactic variation. Filter-verb stacks cluster in high-pressure beats ("seemed to hold," "sought to certify," "aimed to unfetter"). Figurative language is dense but mixed: "unfetter the sculpted hush" and "release it from the confines of the marble" contradict (hush is not confined in marble; the marble itself is the site). Patterned-artifact penalty pack applies: paraphrase loops, template cadence runs, filter-verb stacks (−1.4 in Q7; −1.7 escalation because artifacts touch the closure beat). Final-third artifact disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<comment>The premise—artist seeks to manifest abstract concept through performance at symbolic moment—is a template without fresh inflection. "Sculpted hush," "certify wonder," and "oscillating repose" are stacked prompt elements that do not synthesize into a non-obvious whole. The transformation test fails: swap names and setting, and the emotional arc (artist performs, feels fulfilled) remains unchanged. No bold risk or lived specificity elevates the familiar frame.</comment>
