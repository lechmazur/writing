<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The tutor remains a passive vehicle for atmospheric reflection rather than a character making choices under pressure. Interiority consists of generic epiphany labels ("overwhelming sense of hope," "hopeful melancholy") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal values. The exile and lost students are told backdrop; no on-page decision alters his situation or forecloses a path with visible cost. The final "journey" is asserted motion without dramatized stakes or consequence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>No closure unit—the piece ends with the tutor walking into darkness and a promise of future discovery, not an on-page decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with felt cost. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive but the "eclipsed covenant" and "magnetic nexus" remain unexplained abstractions that never constrain a choice. The narrative is a single reflective stroll without reversal, tightening, or causal linkage; beats loop ("he sat," "he rose," "he walked") without narrowing options or changing knowledge. The inferred lens is unclear—neither causal progression nor accumulative pattern coheres to a closure effect.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The "magnetic nexus" and "polished basalt worry stone dent" are named repeatedly but function as atmospheric set-dressing rather than constraining choice or supplying resources. Sensory details (wildflowers, crickets, stars) are generic postcards that do not filter through the tutor's professional or emotional priorities. Spatial choreography is minimal but coherent (bench to walking away). The setting never alters a tactic or charges the final image, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to discover beauty in the difficult"—is declared but never tested on the page; no reversal or tightening forces a trade-off. The tutor's "method" of translating silence is described in abstract summary without a concrete application that narrows options or imposes cost. Exile is static backdrop, not active pressure. The walk away from the bench is motion without agency, consequence, or visible price. No escalation occurs under any lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme is stated rather than earned: "discover beauty in the difficult" and "hopeful melancholy" are repeated labels without specific dramatization. The final image (tutor vanishing into darkness, "whispered promise of beauty") offers mood, not a resonant answer to a question the story posed through action. Metaphors (magnetic nexus pulsing, stars shining brighter) are vague gestures that do not reweight prior material. The piece abstracts rather than grounds its thematic claims in concrete choices or cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited and diction matches an educated, reflective register. However, perceptual signature is generic—"sweet scent of blooming wildflowers," "stars began to twinkle"—rather than character-particular. The prose relies on filter verbs ("felt," "seemed," "knew") that dull immediacy without voice justification. Modesty is maintained but the narration withholds no knowledge; there is simply no knowledge to withhold, only atmospheric assertion. Syntactic variety is present but rhythm does not modulate with pressure because no pressure exists.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Multiple paraphrase loops and template-cadence runs: "he had always been thoughtfully precise… but the isolation had given him a new perspective" restates across adjacent lines; "the world was full of mysteries" appears twice verbatim. Stock metaphors ("darkness," "beacon of hope," "journey continued") and therapy-speak ("hopeful melancholy," "sense of peace settle over him") pervade. Figurative language in most sentences without pattern or payoff: "magnetic nexus pulsed with otherworldly energy," "thoughts… intertwining with the very fabric of the universe." Scaffold includes "The silence was almost palpable, a living entity" immediately after describing silence as a method. Apply −1.2 for loops, cadence, and mixed register; additional −0.3 for stock metaphors in peak (final) beats totals −1.5, landing ~4.9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Core premise—exiled tutor reflects on beauty amid hardship—is a familiar contemplative template executed without fresh synthesis. The "magnetic nexus" and "eclipsed covenant" are unexplained fantasy tokens that do not transform the emotional arc; remove them and the story is unchanged. No turn or choice feels inevitable in hindsight because none occurs. The piece hedges into safe abstraction rather than risking specific, grounded stakes. Derivative Premise Guardrail applies: −0.8 for template reliance without transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Exiled chess tutor is present throughout but makes no on-page decision that alters tactics or options. He sits, recalls, rises, walks—observation and motion without choice. Setup is immediate, but no middle choice or closure participation beyond being the reflective lens. Cap at 2.8 for missing closure participation; further reduce for ornamental presence: −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Polished basalt worry stone dent appears in the opening beat (traced by fingers) and returns as a mental image in paragraph 11 ("still etched in his mind"). Two beats qualify, but neither involves handling that changes tactics or cost. The reprise is a passive memory, not a reweighted meaning at closure. Setup + lyric reprise allows ~5.5–6.3, but no causal pressure or closure linkage: cap at 4.6 for missing middle development, then reduce −1.5 for purely decorative mention.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>Eclipsed covenant is mentioned twice (paragraphs 2 and 18) as the cause of exile but never explained or shown constraining a present choice. It is backdrop label, not a concept that shapes stakes or alters options on the page. No setup work, no middle development, no closure use. Present but ornamental: 1.8.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>Thoughtfully precise is mentioned in paragraph 3 ("always been thoughtfully precise in his teachings") and paragraph 17 ("the thoughtfully precise mind that had always defined him"). Both are labels without on-page demonstration of the trait constraining or enabling action. No visible tradeoff or cost tied to precision. Lyric reprise without causal work: 2.5.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>2.0</grade><comment>Correlate appears three times: paragraph 3 ("determined to correlate with his past experiences"), paragraph 10 ("felt his mind begin to correlate the disparate elements"), and is implicit in the method. All uses are summary; no turn traces to the act of correlating as a dramatized event that changes options. Swappable with "reflect" or "connect." Present but replaceable: 2.0.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>By translating silence is mentioned in paragraph 4 as a method "he had developed" and alluded to in paragraphs 12 and 21 ("using the silence as his guide"). The method is never shown in operation; we do not see the translation process or its mechanics affecting a choice. Summary-only use: 1.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Magnetic nexus at twilight is named in the opening, mentioned as amplifying the tutor's process (paragraph 5), pulsing with energy (paragraph 14), and as a beacon in the final paragraph. The setting is present across beats but never pressures a choice or supplies a resource that alters outcome. Twilight is static mood, not a constraint. Setup + multiple mentions without causal work or closure participation cap at 3.4.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.2</grade><comment>Before the next phase of the moon appears in paragraphs 7 and 17 as a deadline for uncovering truth and continuing the journey. The timeframe is declared but never tightens a decision on the page; the tutor does not alter tactics because of the deadline. Vague and untracked: 2.2.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>To discover beauty in the difficult is stated as a mantra (paragraph 7), recalled (paragraph 9), and asserted in the final paragraphs. The desire is told, not dramatized through conflicting choices or visible friction between want and cost. No scene shows the tutor sacrificing or struggling to pursue this motivation. Label-only: 2.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Hopeful melancholy is named explicitly (paragraph 6, final paragraph) and the tone of yearning mixed with loss is sustained across the piece. However, the tone does not modulate with pressure (no pressure exists) and the final image ("hopeful melancholy," "beauty that was to come") restates rather than charges or deepens the mood. Static mood present throughout: 4.1.</comment>
