<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lyra remains a generic "intrepid pilot" executing her mission without meaningful internal conflict or contradictory impulses. The arrow tip generates a claimed "inexplicable connection" but this is asserted rather than earned through embodied choice or micro-decision. Her discovery proceeds smoothly without struggle, blind spots, or costly trade-offs that would reveal character under pressure. The final pride and accomplishment feel unearned given the absence of genuine resistance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The story establishes a causal frame (countdown → flight → discovery) but the central revelation arrives without obstacles or reversals that narrow options. Lyra simply flies to the pool and realizes the answer; no prior choice or constraint makes this discovery costly or transforms her situation. The closure offers a Decisive Change (mystery solved, new mission planned) but the cost is conceptual only—"never see the universe the same way"—without visible forfeiture or tactical price paid on the page. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) appear early enough to waive the penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The floating rock arches, orchard, and iridescent pool provide vivid visual anchors, and the inverted gravity creates atmospheric pressure. However, the environment functions primarily as backdrop rather than constraint; Lyra navigates smoothly without the arches or gravity inversion forcing difficult spatial choices. The arrow tip and pool appear but do not materially alter her path. Sensory detail is largely visual, missing tactile or kinesthetic grounding during the weightlessness that would charge the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering the source of resilience—is signaled early, but no meaningful opposition or tightening emerges. Lyra's flight is unimpeded; the gravity inversion and accelerated growth enhance rather than complicate her mission. The "whirling silence" and gathering of echoes are encountered without cost, sacrifice, or foreclosed option. The resolution is purely informational (she learns the answer) with no on-page price or tactical trade-off that would elevate escalation above functional.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The theme of resilience and hidden energy sources emerges through the orchard and echoes imagery, avoiding overt statement until the final explanatory passage. However, the ending shifts into explicit theme summary ("source of the orchard's resilience was not just...but the gathering of echoes itself") rather than letting the pool image carry resonance. The arrow tip is introduced with thematic potential but remains inert, vibrating "in harmony" without constraining choice or reweighting prior material. The conceptual cost is asserted ("never see...the same way") but not dramatized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping, and the narrative distance is consistent. However, the voice lacks distinct perceptual signature; diction is generic adventure-prose ("intrepid," "ethereal fingers," "sense of wonder") without Lyra-specific texture. Filter verbs ("noticed," "felt," "realized") cluster in key beats, dulling immediacy. The prose remains serviceable but does not modulate rhythm or lexicon under pressure, and no dialogue appears to test character-specific idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "Lyra felt" opens multiple sentences, "the orchard's" recurs mechanically, and adjacent paragraphs restate the same discovery without added pressure. Stock metaphors ("ethereal fingers," "solar winds," "trail of possibility") and scaffold phrasing ("making a mental note," "sense of wonder and awe") flatten information density. The final third stacks summary beats ("She knew that she had discovered something profound...") that could be cut without loss. These artifacts measurably dull the closure image, warranting deductions near −1.0 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The core premise—orchard pilot on a gravity-inverting planet discovering an energy source—combines familiar SF tropes (floating rocks, unique flora, mysterious phenomenon) without transforming them through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The discovery proceeds via convenient flight and revelation rather than synthesis of character flaw and world logic. The arrow tip hint at deeper history is dropped without payoff. Emotional beats (wonder, pride, accomplishment) follow predictable templates. The story reads as competent execution of a prompt checklist rather than a singular vision.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Lyra is present throughout and her piloting enables the discovery, but her choices are purely logistical (fly, examine, land, leave). She makes no decision that alters tactics or forecloses an option; the mission succeeds without friction. She observes and reacts but does not turn the plot through character-driven choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>The arrow tip appears once (noticed, removed, stowed) and is mentioned again as "vibrating in harmony" at the pool, but it does not enable or constrain any action. Its presence is ornamental; the story's logic and closure would function identically without it. No cost or tactical shift is tied to this object.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The gathering of echoes is the story's destination and shapes the dominant stake (finding the source). It appears in rumor early, then as the glowing pool at the climax, and the final realization explicitly names it as the answer. However, it does not constrain Lyra's choices or tactics; she simply arrives and observes. It provides thematic charge but lacks mechanical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The plant growth acceleration system is mentioned as a ship modification and "responds more strongly than usual" during inverted gravity, creating a visual trail Lyra follows. This enables one navigational beat (following accelerated growth to the clearing), but no cost or trade-off is associated. The attribute is functional but easily replaceable with any tracking method.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Discovery is the story's central action, signaled in the mission statement and fulfilled when Lyra reaches the pool and realizes the echoes are the resilience source. It drives the narrative goal and provides closure. However, the discovery is passive observation rather than a choice-laden act; Lyra does not sacrifice, risk, or alter tactics to achieve it. Present in all three gates but without strong causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>Navigating by water flow is mentioned twice as a reliable method, but the mechanics are never shown or used to constrain a choice. Lyra navigates "by water flow and instinct" to reach the clearing, but the method is asserted rather than dramatized. It could be omitted or replaced with "instinct" alone without altering the story.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The orchard planet and floating rock arches are established early and provide visual setting throughout. The arches frame Lyra's flight path, and the clearing surrounded by floating rocks is the closure location. However, the arches do not constrain navigation or force difficult spatial choices; they are scenery rather than obstacle. The setting is functional but does not pressure tactics or supply resources that alter outcome.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The hour-long gravity inversion is announced via countdown, activates mid-story, and ends before Lyra leaves. It provides atmospheric pressure and enhances the plant growth effect, but no on-page clock or ticking urgency forces Lyra to choose between options. The timeframe is present in setup and payoff but does not tighten decisions or tactics in the middle.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Finding the source of resilience is Lyra's stated mission, drives her flight, and is fulfilled at the pool. The motivation is clear and consistent, shaping the narrative arc. However, it is pursued without friction, competing desires, or visible cost; Lyra wants to discover, flies, and succeeds. The motivation is functional and causal but lacks dramatized conflict or trade-off between want and price.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Whirling silence" appears as a descriptor for the echoes at the pool and recurs in the denouement, creating a purposeful lyric callback. However, the tone itself does not modulate with pressure or coherently charge the narrative; the prose maintains a steady expository register throughout. The phrase is a thematic marker rather than an atmospheric lens that shapes perception under stress.</comment>
