<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The fractal weaver remains abstract throughout—no embodied emotion, no contradictory impulses, no micro-choices under pressure. Her task "to collect the weights of different burdens" is declared but never dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost. The final departure ("vanished into the morning mist") reads as ornamental rather than a choice that forecloses a path. Interior life is replaced by stock poetic phrasing ("boundary-lessly trapped," "whalebone reverie") that labels states without showing them.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: who the weaver is, why she carries the lamp, and what "collecting weights" means remain vague past the 120-word mark (−0.4). No causal linkage between her arrival, the weaving, and the departure; the sequence reads and-then rather than because/therefore. The ending offers no decisive change, visible cost, or stakes reconfiguration—she completes her work and leaves, with no on-page consequence or path foreclosed. The inferred lens (Accumulative/Textural) never coheres because no pattern is taught or paid off with felt cost at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The bronze grotto and starlight are signaled early and return at the end, providing spatial consistency. However, the setting remains postcard description—luminescent fungi, damp earth, morning mist—without constraining a single choice or altering tactics. The kerosene lamp burner is lit mid-scene but does not affect action; the loom and threads are described without showing how environment or tool shapes the weaving. Micro-setting potential (body, tool, object) is untapped.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to collect the weights of different burdens"—is declared but never tested on the page. No opposition, no reversal, no tightening choice that narrows options. The weaver enters, weaves without friction, and completes her task; coincidence does not even complicate. The resolution is summary ("her work complete") with no visible price or trade-off. Agency is absent; the protagonist observes and executes without decision or renunciation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme is asserted rather than earned: "the weights of different burdens were not just a measure of the world's complexity, but a reflection of their own inner landscapes" is thesis-statement moralizing in place of scene pressure (−0.6). The kerosene lamp burner and tapestry function as symbolic conveniences introduced to harvest thematic credit without prior causal work. The final image—grotto humming with "shingled hush"—recycles the opening motif without reweighting it through intervening particulars. No non-literal answer emerges from the character's arc.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>POV distance is stable (distant third), but the narrative voice is generic and interchangeable—"testament to her craft," "breathtaking beauty," "ethereal light" could describe any protagonist in any setting. No perceptual signature: the weaver's way of noticing is a catalog of adjectives rather than character-specific bias. The prose never modulates under pressure because there is no pressure. Diction drifts into elevated register ("boundary-lessly trapped," "whalebone reverie") that reads as authorial ornament rather than the weaver's idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "the weaver's understanding deepened, her perception of the world expanding" restates the same idea without added pressure. Template cadence runs throughout ("As the night wore on," "As the sun rose higher," "As the seasons passed") without taught pattern or payoff (−0.5). Stock metaphors ("ripples on a still pond," "blanket of white") and filter-verb stacks ("seemed to come alive," "seemed to hum," "seemed almost otherworldly") dull immediacy (−0.5). Figurative density in nearly every sentence ("fractal weaver," "shingled hush," "whalebone reverie") without coherent vehicle or payoff (−0.4). The final third is saturated with these artifacts, disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The premise—mystical artisan weaves metaphysical burdens into tapestry—is a recognizable template without transformation through specific lived detail or world logic (−0.8). "Fractal weaver," "shingled hush," "whalebone reverie" read as prompt-label insertions rather than organic elements. The emotional arc (contemplative arrival → serene completion → departure) is one-note and could apply to any craft-as-metaphor story. No bold risk, no fresh inflection, no non-obvious synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>The fractal weaver is present throughout but makes no choices that create turns. She enters, weaves, and departs; all actions are observational or procedural. No agency, no decision under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The kerosene lamp burner is carried in, lit mid-scene, and extinguished at the end—three mentions across beats. However, it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it provides ambient light without causal work. The final extinguishing does not reweight meaning or tie to closure stakes. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.0</grade><comment>"Shingled hush" appears twice as atmospheric description ("a shingled hush that layered over the landscape"; "the shingled hush would remain"). It does not shape stakes, constrain action, or change options. Ornamental label.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Boundary-lessly trapped" is mentioned once in paragraph five as a feeling. It does not constrain or enable any on-page action, create a trade-off, or return with cost. Label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>"To calcify the ephemeral nature of these burdens" appears once in paragraph ten as a stated intention. The weaver's work is described as capturing patterns, but no dramatized act of calcifying drives a turn or redefines options. Summary-only use.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.2</grade><comment>"By orienting properly" is mentioned once ("by orienting properly, aligning her thoughts and actions with the subtle rhythms of the universe") as a method. Its mechanics are not shown, it does not shape an attempt, and it does not return. Told-only.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The bronze grotto under starlight is signaled early, provides spatial continuity, and returns in the final image ("the bronze grotto, under the starlight, the shingled hush would remain"). However, it does not pressure a choice or supply a resource that affects outcome—it remains backdrop. Two gates (setup, payoff) allow eligibility to ~6.0, but lack of causal pressure or cost linkage caps the score in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.6</grade><comment>"After the first snowmelt" appears in the opening line to set season but does not tighten decisions or create a live clock. Time is vague ("as the night wore on," "as the seasons passed") and does not alter tactics. Ornamental timeframe.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"To collect the weights of different burdens" is stated as the weaver's task and mentioned in multiple paragraphs. However, it is never dramatized through conflicting wants, visible friction, or cost. The weaver completes her goal without opposition or trade-off. Told-only motivation without on-page friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Whalebone reverie" appears twice: once mid-story ("In this whalebone reverie, the weaver lost herself") and once near the end ("lost in the whalebone reverie that had so captivated the weaver"). The tone is static and dreamy throughout, without modulation under pressure. It provides atmospheric consistency but does not charge the final image or shift with escalation. Functional label without causal pressure.</comment>
