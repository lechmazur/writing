<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The janitor remains entirely passive and abstract throughout—no concrete goal, no choice under pressure, no visible cost. "Spiritually curious" exists as label-only; the character observes and sweeps but never faces a decision that alters stakes. Internal contradiction is absent; the protagonist floats through the station finding generic "solace" and "connection" without embodied tension. The ending claims transformation ("renewed sense of purpose") without any on-page forfeiture or micro-choice that earned it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive quickly, but no escalation or closure effect occurs. The piece moves through static description without a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing; the janitor begins reflective and ends reflective with no cost paid. The lens is ambiguous—accumulative phrasing ("tracing the path of falling stars") suggests textural mode, yet no pattern break or cadence shift reweights the stake. The final paragraph repeats the opening thesis ("flourishing stillness") rather than delivering a turn or reweighting prior material with visible pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The shooting star tracking station is named early but remains postcard-level: "dimly lit room," "various contraptions," generic "astronomical instruments." The yellow lantern glass sits on a desk and is relocated to "a place of prominence" with no constraint on action. No tool, environment feature, or micro-setting detail pressures a choice or charges the closure image; sensory detail is present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>No dominant stake is dramatized; the janitor's "task" is to clean and empathize, but neither goal faces opposition or cost. No reversal, tightening, or deepening occurs—the protagonist sweeps, reflects, and departs unchanged. The claim "to find strength in vulnerability" is told repeatedly but never tested through a forced trade-off or visible price. Escalation is absent under any lens; coincidence does not even appear because no events complicate the protagonist's drift.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The theme ("strength in vulnerability," "flourishing stillness," "primal elegance") is stated overtly in nearly every paragraph rather than emerging from concrete events. The yellow lantern glass is declared symbolic ("a beacon, a symbol of the light") instead of earning resonance through use. The final paragraph moralizes directly: "The janitor's story was one of primal elegance, a testament to the power of stillness and vulnerability." No non-literal image reweights prior material; the piece sermonizes in place of scene pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and no head-hopping occurs. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("flourishing stillness," "primal elegance," "celestial rhythms") that feels externally imposed rather than character-particular for a janitor. Perceptual signature is generic; the narrator notices "the beauty of the night sky," "the tranquility of the station" without idiosyncratic bias. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance remains static—no modulation under pressure because no pressure exists.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade the text: "flourishing stillness" appears in lines 5, 16, 20, and 24; "strength in vulnerability" in lines 8, 13, 22, and 26. Template cadence runs: "As the night wore on… As they returned… As the first light… As they departed…" (lines 8, 12, 19, 22). Figurative language is stacked without pattern-teaching: "cosmic janitor," "celestial ballet," "diamonds scattered across the velvet expanse," "primal elegance" cluster densely in high-concept beats. Sentence openings recycle "The janitor's…" across six paragraphs. Density penalty: figurative language in most sentences without payoff triggers −0.5; paraphrase loops add −0.6; template cadence adds −0.5.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The cosmic-janitor-finding-meaning frame is widely used in spiritual-essay templates; no transformation through specific world logic or non-obvious calculus occurs. The yellow lantern glass, shooting stars, and "overlooked era" remain generic rather than particular to this voice or setting. "Flourishing stillness" and "primal elegance" read as prompt labels inserted rather than earned through dramatized choice. The piece hedges into abstraction ("the grand scheme," "the universe," "the cosmos") rather than risking a bold, specific synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>The cosmic janitor is present throughout but makes no choice that creates a turn. The character sweeps, observes, and departs; all action is task-routine without agency under pressure. Introduced early (setup gate met), but no middle development choice and no closure participation beyond summary ("The janitor's work was done"). Ornamental protagonist: −1.0; no causal beat involvement: −0.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The yellow lantern glass appears at line 4 (setup met), is pondered at line 12, and relocated to "a place of prominence" at line 19 (closure participation minimal). No physical handling in distinct beats—only described twice within reflective passages. It is declared symbolic rather than earning resonance through use that constrains choice. Present in closure paragraph but passively; no causal pressure or felt cost tied to it. Two mentions: +0.4; closure cameo: +0.3; swappable with any warm-colored object: −0.6; ornamental: −0.7.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Flourishing stillness" is named in lines 5, 16, 20, and as thesis in line 26, but never shapes a stake or tactic on the page—only echoed as theme claim. No choice hinges on achieving or losing stillness; the janitor begins in stillness and ends in stillness with no on-page cost. Label-only: −0.3; no causal beat: −0.8; summary-only: −0.3; late-final cameo: −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Spiritually curious" is labeled in line 3 and again implied in line 14 ("spiritually curious nature led them to ponder") but never constrains an action with cost. The trait does not enable a risky choice or foreclose an option; it justifies generic pondering. Setup met, no development beat, ornamental at closure. Label-only: −0.3; no causal pressure: −0.8; swappable with "reflective" or "contemplative": −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Empathize" is named as a task in line 6 and recounted in line 17 ("able to empathize with the scientists on a deeper level"), but no turn traces to an act of empathy—only told. The janitor does not make a choice to empathize under pressure; the action exists as summary backdrop. Setup met, summary-only middle: −0.8; no closure participation: −0.7; easily swappable with "appreciate" or "understand": −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>"By tracing the path of falling stars" appears in lines 7 and 18 as method claim, but no mechanics are shown—how does the janitor trace? No beat dramatizes the method shaping an attempt or tactic. Present as thematic gloss only, not as active means. Summary-only: −0.8; no beat involvement: −0.8; introduced early but not developed: −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The shooting star tracking station is named in line 1 (setup met) and provides spatial anchor ("dimly lit room," "cluttered desk," "window") but does not pressure a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome. Postcard description without micro-setting constraint. Setup met; no middle development beat; closure participation minimal (janitor departs, station becomes symbol in summary). Ornamental: −1.0; swappable with any quiet workspace: −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.7</grade><comment>"Through the hush of an overlooked era" appears once in line 10, vague and untracked. No sense of urgency, deadline, or temporal constraint shapes tactics. Time of night progresses ("As the night wore on," "first light of dawn") but clock does not tighten decisions. Introduced mid-story: −0.3; ornamental: −1.0; no causal beat: −0.8; vague: −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>"To find strength in vulnerability" is stated overtly in lines 8, 13, 22, and 26 but never dramatized through a choice with friction or visible cost. Desire is told-only; no conflicting want or fear complicates pursuit. Setup met (line 8), recounted at closure, but no middle beat where the motivation forces a trade-off. Label-only: −0.3; no causal beat: −0.8; summary-only: −0.8; closure cameo as thesis statement: −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Primal elegance" is named in lines 10, 21, and 26; tone reads as uniform elevated lyricism throughout without modulation under pressure. The static mood ("quiet reverence," "tranquility," "stillness") does not shift with escalation because no escalation exists. Present early and at closure, but does not charge the final image with pressure—merely repeated as label. Ornamental: −0.7; no pressure modulation: −0.8; swappable with "serene beauty": −0.6.</comment>
