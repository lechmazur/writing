<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Jack's interiority relies heavily on abstract statements ("confidently uncertain," "the stillness was starting to suffocate him") rather than embodied contradiction. The phone-call beat shows professional instinct but no genuine internal conflict—his "wrestling with doubts" is told, not dramatized through simultaneous contradictory impulses. The final sequence declares transformation through a cascade of assertions ("spark of determination," "newfound resolve," "sense of possibility") without on-page micro-choices that reveal competing values or visible cost. Emotional progression reads as therapy-speak summary rather than credible irrationality under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed—who Jack is and where he sits emerges slowly across the opening, but the quarry/trailer relationship remains spatial vague throughout. The piece announces a causal design (phone call as catalyst, memories as pressure) but delivers pure summary: the amplifier conversation happens entirely off-page, the "public failure" is referenced but never dramatized or specified, and the ending cascade ("began to make notes," "walked out of the trailer") consists of declarations without a single concrete choice or visible cost. No decisive change occurs on the page; the closure is a list of emotional claims. Orientation Test penalty (−0.4) applied; also cap Q3 at 7.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The quarry office trailer is named early and returns in the final third, but it functions as backdrop rather than constraint—Jack could conduct this internal monologue anywhere. Sensory detail is sparse and generic ("dusty antiques," "faint smell of rock dust," "warm, golden light"). The speaker grille cloth scrap is handled twice (picked up, stored away) and charges the closure attempt, providing the story's strongest object-as-setting moment. The "echo valley" image in the final third feels ornamental, a phrase rather than a lived spatial experience that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reclaiming purpose after public failure—is signaled early but never tested on the page. The phone call offers a potential tightening (an amplifier appraisal that could force Jack to confront his failure) but the conversation's content is withheld and summarized, eliminating any live pressure. No reversal or narrowing occurs; the ending's "spark of determination" and decision to "make notes" are assertions without dramatized cost or a path foreclosed. Coincidence (the caller's timing) sets up the potential conflict, but the piece resolves it by declaration rather than scene work.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The after-the-applause concept and discovery-of-purpose motivation are present throughout, but they remain abstract—no particular image or action embodies them. The final paragraph stack of theme statements ("silence was no longer oppressive," "echo valley longing was still there," "reminder of the beauty that lay just beyond the horizon") functions as sermonizing rather than earned resonance. The speaker grille cloth could carry thematic weight, but its meaning is directly stated ("reminder of the rush") rather than allowed to resonate through implication. Thematic Echo penalty (−0.6) for the closing moralizing that replaces scene pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited, and diction remains consistent within Jack's professional-roadie register. The phone dialogue is paraphrased rather than dramatized, losing the chance for subtext or goal-driven exchange. Internal voice suffers from template cadence and recycled sentence stems: "He would find a way… He would wrestle… The quarry office trailer, once… was now…" The final third loops through parallel constructions ("The silence was no longer… but…" "no longer just… but…") that flatten rhythm. Filter verbs ("felt," "knew") appear frequently but remain voice-consistent; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Pervasive paraphrase loops and synonym churn dominate the final third: "stillness"/"silence," "purpose"/"sense of possibility," "past"/"memories" recur across adjacent sentences without adding pressure or detail. Template cadence runs throughout ("He would [verb]… He would [verb]…" and "The [noun] was no longer [X], but [Y]") without pattern-teaching or payoff. The closing dozen lines consist almost entirely of scaffold assertions ("with newfound resolve," "ready to face whatever came next") that restate emotional shifts rather than advancing them. Artifacts touch the closure beat. Penalty: −1.4 for spread and closure contamination; disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The ex-roadie-turned-appraiser premise and quarry setting offer specific grounding, but the emotional arc (professional failure → phone call → renewed hope) follows a familiar template without transformation. The speaker grille cloth is the story's most particular choice, a concrete object with lived history. The "echo valley longing" phrase and celestial-map metaphor in the closing feel ornamental rather than inevitable. No bold structural or perspectival risk; the transformation test fails—swap "antiques appraiser" for any solitary profession and "speaker grille cloth" for any craft memento, and the arc remains unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Jack is present throughout and his dual background (roadie/appraiser) is signaled early. He makes one micro-choice on the page (picking up the phone), but the amplifier conversation is summarized and the "notes" he begins to make at the end are declared, not shown. His occupation frames the setup and the ending's hope, but no on-page decision alters tactics or forecloses a path. Three-gate presence (setup, middle phone call, ending resolve) keeps the floor above 3.0, but lack of causal choice caps the score in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The speaker grille cloth appears in three beats: picked up early with tactile detail ("coarse fabric between his fingers"), present during the phone call as visual anchor, and "safely stored away" near the end with reweighted meaning ("more than just a memento"). The early and closing mentions form a purposeful reprise that shifts from comfort to catalyst. However, the object does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—it functions as reflective anchor rather than causal agent. Lyric-resonance allowance applies; the return reweights the dominant stake and contributes to closure, landing in the 5.5–6.3 range.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"After the applause" is named in the opening line and echoed thematically throughout (the memory of concerts, the loss of excitement, the "applause may have faded" near the end). However, it remains a thematic frame rather than a stake-shaping force—no on-page choice is constrained by the post-performance condition. The concept is functional but replaceable; swapping it for "after the injury" or "after the breakup" would require only minor edits. Present across setup and closure but ornamental in development.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Confidently uncertain" appears once as a label midway through ("He was confidently uncertain about his future") without shaping an on-page action or choice. The phrase describes Jack's state but does not enable or constrain a decision with visible cost. Late first appearance (past midpoint) and label-only use trigger cap at 4.6 and ornamental penalty (−0.3). No development or closure participation; functionally absent from the story's causal chain.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Wrest" appears once in the phrase "wrestle his future into shape," a metaphor in the final third that summarizes Jack's intent rather than dramatizing an action. No on-page turn traces to this verb; the story's structure (phone call → internal reflection → resolve) does not require "wresting" and could proceed with "shape," "reclaim," or "build" with no change. Late, summary-only use; cap at 4.6 for missing setup and development gates. Ornamental mention penalty (−0.3) and swappability penalty (−0.4) applied.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Insulating emotionally with facts" is stated explicitly midway ("As an appraiser, Jack had learned to insulate himself emotionally with facts") and demonstrated briefly when "his appraiser's instincts kicked in" during the phone call. The method is signaled in setup and appears in the middle beat, but its mechanics are told rather than shown—we do not see Jack deploying facts to manage emotion on the page. It does not shape the ending or constrain a choice with cost. Two-gate presence (setup, middle mention) but summary-only development and no closure participation; cap at mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The quarry office trailer is named in the opening and returns explicitly in the final third ("The quarry office trailer, once a symbol of his failure, was now a catalyst for change"). It provides spatial anchor and appears across all three gates (setup, middle as the location of the phone call, closure as metaphor). However, the setting does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—Jack's internal journey could occur in any isolated workspace. Present and functional but replaceable; the quarry's "echo valley" image is ornamental rather than causal. Swappability penalty (−0.5) limits the score despite three-gate presence.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"After failing publicly" is referenced in the opening ("The memory of his last public appraisal, which had ended in disaster") and shapes Jack's emotional state throughout. The timeframe is setup-only—it establishes context but does not tighten decisions or create a live clock that alters tactics in the present scene. The failure is never specified or dramatized, remaining backstory. Missing development and closure gates; the ending's resolve is not time-pressured. Functional context but no causal tightening; replaceable with "after the breakup" or similar past-event frame.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"To discover purpose after loss" is signaled in the opening ("the stillness was starting to suffocate him") and drives Jack's internal state across the story, culminating in the resolve to "discover a new purpose" stated explicitly in the final third. The motivation is told throughout rather than dramatized through conflicting choices with visible cost—Jack's "wrestling with doubts" during the phone call happens off-page, and the ending's "spark of determination" is asserted. Three-gate presence (setup, middle phone call as catalyst, ending resolve) but friction between want and cost is summarized, not shown. Told-only penalty (−0.5) applied.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"Echo valley longing" appears as a phrase in the final third ("The echo valley longing that had been haunting him") and modulates the wistful, reflective atmosphere throughout. Tone is coherent but largely static—the longing is maintained at a steady level without sharp modulation under pressure. The closing image attempts to charge the tone ("no longer a source of pain, but a reminder of the beauty"), but this shift is declared rather than embodied in a concrete final action or image. Setup and closure presence without middle development; tone present but does not tighten or crystallize under the phone-call pressure point.</comment>
