<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Luna's interiority is entirely reflective and abstract, never contradictory or embodied in scene pressure. The "quietly driven" trait is mentioned but never constrains a choice with visible cost—she simply sits, gazes, and ponders without friction. Her transformation from bold murals to contemplative work is summarized across paragraphs rather than dramatized through a micro-choice that forecloses a path. No secondary character applies pressure, and the ending grants peace without visible struggle or trade-off.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The piece is reflection-led accumulative/textural, signaling lens ambiguity past midpoint: no causal linkage tightens options, no situational pressure crystallizes stance. Orientation anchors arrive late (~paragraph 4 for cathedral, ~paragraph 5 for timeline). Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via "dawning hush" and the final smile, but cost is absent—Luna simply "began to understand" with no forfeiture, renunciation, or poise under pressure. The Orientation Test penalty (−0.3 to −0.5) applies and triggers the Q3=7.0 cap.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Amber pavilion, cathedral window, and postcards anchor setting across beats and return at closure. The etched glass constrains Luna's quest visually but never alters a tactic or bars an option. Sensory detail is vivid yet ornamental—autumn hues, fading light, melting snow—filtered through Luna's perspective but not integrated into choice. The cathedral window charges the final image conceptually, lifting the score despite static use.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding nocturnal blooming—is signaled early but never tested on the page. No reversal, tightening, or cost-laden choice occurs; Luna sits, gazes, and eventually "began to understand" without friction. The lens (accumulative/textural) allows deepening via pattern, but no cadence shift or density increase reweights the stake. Escalation is absent, and the ending grants satisfaction without visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme of hidden-world understanding emerges through postcards, etched glass, and night-blooming flowers, but the final paragraph moralizes overtly: "she had finally begun to understand the secrets" and "the world seemed to bloom alongside her." These summaries replace scene pressure. The "umbral tenderness" motif recurs but does not constrain choice or charge closure with cost. No earned insight arises from dramatized struggle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with a distinct lyric texture—"dawning hush," "umbral tenderness"—that modulates across paragraphs. However, perceptual signature is generic: Luna's way of noticing reads as authorial rather than character-specific. Psychic distance compresses into summary at closure ("she felt a deep sense of peace") without scene anchor. No dialogue to evaluate. Register drifts slightly elevated ("reckon," "infusing") but remains legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Severe paraphrase loops and synonym churn across adjacent paragraphs: "The postcards, once a source of inspiration, now seemed to hold a deeper significance" / "The postcards, now a treasured keepsake, remained scattered around her." Template cadence ("As Luna…," "As the…," "As she…") runs through multiple paragraphs. Filter-verb stacks ("began to discern," "began to take on," "began to see") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats. Figurative density ("wrapped around her," "seeping into her very being") without pattern payoff. Cumulative artifact penalty (−1.4) and final-third presence disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Core premise—artist finds inspiration in cathedral window and learns nature's secrets—is a widely used template without transformation. Luna's journey lacks specificity: the "intricate web of life" and "magic that unfolded under the cover of darkness" are abstract placeholders. No bold structural risk; the piece hedges into safe lyric generality. Proximity to stock epiphany arcs lowers the score.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Luna is present throughout but her choices are passive observation and reflection. No decision alters tactics or forecloses a path with cost. She sits, gazes, ponders, and eventually smiles—actions that could swap for any contemplative character. Missing middle development and closure participation caps at 3.4; ornamental use and swappability lower further.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Postcards appear in paragraph 1, return in paragraphs 15–16 ("pore over," "tracing the lines"), and remain present at closure as "treasured keepsake." They seed Luna's quest but never constrain a choice or force a trade-off. The reprise reweights meaning slightly (inspiration → keepsake), lifting into the 4s, but the element remains replaceable with any inspiring object.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Dawning hush" appears explicitly in paragraph 9 as a state accompanying Luna's epiphany, returns implicitly at closure ("the world seemed to bloom alongside her"), but does not shape stakes or tactics. It is theme-only: a label for stillness rather than a pressure that narrows options. Present setup, ornamental development, weak closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Quietly driven" is mentioned in paragraph 3 ("She was quietly driven, pouring all her energy") but never constrains or enables an action with cost. It is a label that could describe any dedicated character. Missing middle beat involvement and no causal pressure; ornamental and swappable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Reckon" appears twice: paragraph 6 ("trying to reckon the hidden patterns") and paragraph 21 ("finally begun to reckon the mysteries of the world"). It frames Luna's quest but is easily swappable with "understand," "discern," or "interpret." No major turn traces specifically to this verb; it is lexical rather than structural. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Etched cathedral glass is introduced paragraph 4, developed paragraphs 6–8 ("trying to reckon the hidden patterns," "hidden layers of etched glass," "narrative that spoke to her quest"), and returns at closure paragraph 22 ("now seemed to be a part of her very being"). It shapes Luna's method of understanding visually but does not alter a tactic or impose cost. Two-gate presence (setup, closure participation) and causal involvement in one beat lift into the 4s; missing middle development caps at 4.6, swappability lowers slightly.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.3</grade><comment>Amber pavilion is named paragraph 1, mentioned paragraphs 14 and 20 ("grew quieter," "sanctuary of quiet contemplation"), and frames closure paragraph 26. Autumn setting provides atmosphere but does not constrain choice or supply a resource that alters outcome. Postcard description dominates; the pavilion is a backdrop. Present across beats but ornamental and replaceable with any studio space.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.2</grade><comment>"Across the melting of winter's last snow" appears paragraph 5, recurs paragraphs 17 and 28 as temporal marker. Time progression is vague—no clock tightens decisions or alters tactics. The melting snow is lyric coloring, not a pressure. Swappable with any seasonal transition; no causal work or cost tied to the timeframe.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Understanding why flowers bloom at night is stated paragraph 3, developed paragraph 18 ("not just because of the moon's gentle light, but because of the intricate web of life"), and resolved paragraph 28 ("she had finally begun to understand the secrets of the flowers that bloomed at night"). The motivation frames the quest but is never conflicted or tested—Luna simply observes until insight arrives. No friction between want and cost; told rather than dramatized. Functional setup and closure participation lift into the 4s; missing dramatized middle conflict and no visible trade-off prevent higher score.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Umbral tenderness" appears paragraph 10, recurs paragraphs 19–20 ("murals radiating an umbral tenderness," "place of umbral tenderness"), and is implicit at closure in the "gentle light of the moon." Tone is coherent and modulates from vibrant (early) to contemplative (ending), supporting the arc. It charges the final image conceptually. All three gates met, one causal linkage (art transformation), and closure participation lift into mid-5s; however, the phrase reads as authorial label rather than embodied pressure, limiting elevation.</comment>
