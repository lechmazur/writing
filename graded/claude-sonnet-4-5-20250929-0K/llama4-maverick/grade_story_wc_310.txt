<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The decision maker remains abstract throughout—no embodied emotion, no internal contradiction, only label-only "quiet enthusiasm" repeated without behavioral cost. The climactic act (drinking the droplet) feels unmotivated by prior struggle; we never see what forecloses or what the character genuinely risks. "Quietly enthusiastic" appears as descriptor rather than constraint; no micro-choices reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. The final "peace" and "satisfaction" arrive without visible forfeiture or credible endurance cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land early enough. However, no causal escalation occurs—the decision maker pours liquid, it distills, they drink it, done. The "backwards prophecy" is declared fulfilled without on-page reversal or tightening that narrows options. The ending offers peaceful alignment rather than a decisive change with felt cost; "wavelength align with purpose" is told, not dramatized through a choice that forecloses a path. Closure form (RR/DC/CR) is absent; the piece summarizes fulfillment rather than enacting pressure and reweighting.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The ambered observatory deck and starlight appear multiple times and frame the action, providing spatial coherence. However, setting remains postcard description—stars "twinkle," deck is "ambered"—without constraining a single choice or altering tactics. No tool, body state, or environmental pressure shapes the distillation or the final act. The micro-setting (distillation apparatus) is present but inert; it does not complicate or enable outcome, so the 9-band gate remains closed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>A dominant stake ("decipher the prophecy") is signaled early, but no on-page escalation or tightening occurs. The decision maker faces no reversal, no cost calculus, no failed attempt—only smooth, declarative progress from coins to distillation to fulfillment. The final act (drinking the droplet) is not tested by a prior mistake or constraint; luck and convenience grant the essence without struggle. No price paid, no option foreclosed on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Theme ("alignment with cosmic purpose") is stated repeatedly rather than earned through image or specific event. The backwards prophecy and wavelength alignment remain abstract labels without concrete stakes. The final paragraph summarizes rather than offering a resonant, non-literal image. Recurrent motifs (coins, stars, static bursts) are mentioned but never constrain choice or reweight meaning at closure, so they earn no credit under the no-motif-checklist rule.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Third-person distant narration maintains stable tense and clean mechanics. Perceptual signature is generic—"sweet, pungent aroma," "soft, stellar doubt"—without character-specific filter. Diction drifts into poetic register ("velvet expanse," "tantalizingly out of grasp") that feels imposed rather than voice-motivated. No dialogue. Psychic distance remains static; no modulation under pressure. The prose reads as competent but interchangeable, lacking a distinct narrative texture tied to the focalizer's stakes.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Multiple paraphrase loops and synonym churn appear: "the universe had contracted" / "universe's contraction," "quietly enthusiastic" / "quietly enthusiastic nature," "secrets of the universe" recycled across paragraphs. Template cadence: "The decision maker [verb]… the decision maker [verb]…" runs across a dozen sentences. Stock metaphors ("diamonds against velvet," "thrill of excitement") and filter-verb stacks ("felt a thrill," "felt a sense," "seemed to twinkle") dull immediacy in peak beats. Applying cumulative artifact penalties (−0.6 paraphrase, −0.6 template cadence, −0.4 filter stacks) plus the lack of sentence-level propulsion yields this score.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Core premise (cosmic prophecy decoded via distillation and static analysis) reads as abstract sci-fi template without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. "Backwards prophecy," "wavelength align," "static bursts" remain prompt-label ornaments rather than specific dramatic levers. No fresh inflection or risk-taking; the arc follows a predictable fulfill-the-prophecy path with no tension between competing goods. Derivative Premise Guardrail (−1.0) applies; the piece does not transform its template through character stakes or world specificity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The "cast lots decision maker" is named but never casts lots on the page; the title functions as label only. Decisions (pour liquid, drink droplet) are present but not contested or reversed—observation and smooth execution dominate. No key turn traces to a choice under pressure, so the element remains ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The collection of foreign coins appears in the opening third, is handled during the static-burst analysis, and is mentioned at closure ("once a mere curiosity, had become a key"). Two beats of involvement (initial examination, distillation prep) and lyric reprise at the end qualify it for mid-band. However, the coins do not constrain a choice or impose visible cost; their role is summarized rather than dramatized, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>The "backwards prophecy" is declared early and mentioned at closure ("the backwards prophecy had been set in motion"), but it never shapes on-page tactics or narrows options. It functions as thematic backdrop rather than a mechanic that alters decisions. Summary-only and no causal pressure caps it in the low band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Quietly enthusiastic" is labeled twice (opening, near end) but never constrains or enables a choice with visible cost. No behavioral trade-off, no moment where enthusiasm creates friction or opportunity. Label-only use without dramatized pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Distill" appears in the first third (setup of apparatus), drives the middle beat (boiling and essence release), and is referenced at closure ("last of the liquid was distilled"). All three gates present. However, the action is smooth and convenient—no failed attempt, no adaptive tactic—so causal pressure remains low. Eligible for mid-band but lacks the escalation and cost linkage for ≥7.0.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>"Understanding static bursts" is mentioned in the first third as the decision maker's method, but its mechanics never shape an attempt or complicate a choice. It is told rather than shown in action; no beat dramatizes how static analysis alters options or imposes cost. Summary-only integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The "ambered observatory deck" frames the opening and closing paragraphs (lyric reprise) and anchors spatial stability. However, it supplies no resources, imposes no constraint, and does not pressure a single choice. Postcard description without tactical involvement; present but ornamental, capping below 5.0.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"After the universe contracts" is declared in paragraph two but never tightens decisions or creates a live clock. Time remains vague and untracked; no deadline or temporal cost alters tactics. The timeframe functions as worldbuilding label without narrative pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"To wavelength align with purpose" is stated as the decision maker's goal and recurs at closure ("wavelength had been aligned with purpose"). However, desire is never dramatized through conflicting wants or visible friction. The motivation is told and then declared fulfilled without on-page cost or trade-off, capping it in the low-functional band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Stellar doubt" appears twice (mid-story and near end: "soft, stellar doubt," "sense of stellar doubt") as a mood label. Tone remains static—contemplative and peaceful throughout—with no modulation under pressure or charge at the final image. Present but not integrated into the story's emotional arc or closure reweighting.</comment>
