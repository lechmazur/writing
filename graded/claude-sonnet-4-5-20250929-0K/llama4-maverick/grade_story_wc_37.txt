<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The memory keeper remains a concept-vehicle rather than a character with contradictory impulses or embodied stakes. Her "duty" is asserted but never tested by a choice that forecloses another path; she wanders, hums, and smiles without internal friction or visible cost. The ending declares hope and impact ("her work was having an impact") rather than dramatizing a renunciation or alteration earned by prior causality. Therapy-speak intrudes ("took her duty seriously," "renewed determination") where embodied perception would anchor stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive late: who she is emerges around word 60, the greenhouse's function remains vague throughout, and "mirror world" operates as a label without taught rules. The piece attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration via the mica window vision and the closing assertion of healing, but no decisive cost or foreclosed option appears on the page—she continues her work unchanged, the realm "begins to heal" off-stage, and the final gesture (vanishing into darkness) reprises the opening posture without reweighting stakes. The inferred lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds loosely, but closure lacks the cadence shift or visible price required for RR.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The alchemical orchard greenhouse is described with vivid sensory detail (luminescent fungi, shimmering leaves, golden light) but remains a backdrop; none of its particulars constrain a choice or alter tactics. The mica window pulses and refracts light across multiple beats, approaching functional integration, but its mechanics are ornamental—it does not limit access, impose cost, or shape the memory keeper's decision to continue. Spatial choreography is clear, yet the setting reads as a catalog rather than a crucible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—rekindling the dying realm—is declared early but never tested by a reversal or tightening that narrows options. The memory keeper encounters the mica window, hums, receives visions, and walks away with "renewed determination"; no turn forces a trade-off, no complication from the realm itself resists her method, and the closing assertion that "the realm began to flourish" occurs off-stage without agency or visible price. Pressure is static throughout; the protagonist's actions do not escalate or deepen under the chosen lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The thematic question—whether connection and memory can revive a dying realm—emerges clearly from the premise and recurs through "woven dawns," "knitting communities," and "forgotten songs." However, the final image ("beacon of hope," "brighter future") states the theme rather than reweighting prior material through a non-literal answer. The mica window's vision offers a glimpse of "threads that bound the realm," but this insight arrives without dramatized cost or a choice that confronts ambiguity. The piece remains earnest and sincere, yet the closure leans into declaration over resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains stable third-person limited distance and a lyric register throughout. Perceptual signature is thin—the memory keeper notices "peculiar plants" and "soft glow" but her way of seeing does not feel character-particular. Diction occasionally drifts into prompt-echo phrasing ("woven dawns," "knitting communities") that reads like concept-labeling rather than internalized vocabulary. No head-hopping occurs, and the voice modulates appropriately from dim introspection to golden hope, yet the prose lacks the rhythmic control or selective bias that would distinguish this focalizer under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "The memory keeper felt… and she reached out," "The humming grew… and the memory keeper's voice wove," "She knew that… but she felt…" across adjacent sentences. Stock metaphors ("spark that once drove its magic," "beacon of hope") and filter-verb stacks ("felt drawn," "felt the energy," "felt herself being drawn") dull immediacy in peak beats. The final third repeats "continued her work," "continued to thrive," "continued efforts" without adding pressure. Information density is low; many sentences restate mood without advancing situation. Artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering the −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The core premise—a memory keeper using forgotten songs to revive a dying realm—draws on familiar fantasy templates (magic through art, solitary wanderer, liminal greenhouse) without a fresh angle or transformation through specificity. The mica window and mirror world could be swapped for any mystical portal and dying land without altering the emotional arc. The ending's assertion of hope and flourishing feels inevitable from the opening rather than earned through a non-obvious synthesis. The piece commits to its earnest tone, yet no bold risk heightens stakes or challenges the template's comfort.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The scattered memory keeper appears in setup and anchors the POV throughout. She wanders, touches the mica window, hums, receives visions, and continues her journey—but none of these are choices that narrow options or create a visible trade-off. Her role is observational and declarative; she embodies the premise but does not make a decision that alters tactics or forecloses a path. Swappable with "wandering healer" or "relic gatherer" with minor edits. Late limiter (decision absence) and swappability cap the score.</comment>
