<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The hourglass turner remains abstract throughout—no embodied emotion, no contradictory impulses, no micro-choices under pressure. Interiority is replaced by ornamental description ("quietly inspired soul," "all-consuming passion") that never lands as lived experience. The final "smile" arrives without earned causality; no prior struggle or renunciation makes the gesture credible. Motivation is declared but never tested by a concrete on-page dilemma that forces a visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test: who, where, and when are present by the opening lines; no penalty applied. However, no meaningful closure unit exists—the turner "continues to work" in an open loop with no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing that forecloses a path or reweights stakes with felt cost. The ending recycles the opening's static tableau without alteration of options or knowledge. Drive lens remains ambiguous (accumulative texture is attempted but never tightens or deepens); applying −0.4 for lens drift and capping at 7.2, but the absence of legible closure drops the score further.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The amber warehouse, cliffs, and hourglasses are vividly named and anchored early, satisfying orientation. However, setting remains postcard description—no spatial constraint alters a choice, no proximity or access shapes tactics. The "canyon echo" jar is handled once without consequence. Sensory detail (aged wood, golden light) decorates rather than pressures, and the final image reuses the opening's static tableau without evolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to spin a prophecy into raw possibility"—is declared but never tested by an on-page dilemma that narrows options or imposes cost. No reversal or tightening occurs; the turner catalogs buttons in a repetitive loop without escalation, opposition, or trade-off. The ending grants the goal without agency, renunciation, or visible price. Coincidence does not complicate; nothing opposes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Shared wisdom" and "prophecy into raw possibility" are asserted repeatedly in abstract meta-commentary rather than emerging from concrete particulars. The final paragraph moralizes directly: "the act of creation was ongoing, a never-ending dance between the past, present, and future"—thematic echo that replaces scene pressure (−0.6). No character choice or image offers a non-literal answer; the piece tells theme rather than embodying it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person narration is stable with no head-hopping. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("palpable, unearthed silence," "alchemy of shared wisdom") that feels authorial rather than POV-filtered. Perceptual signature is generic—no character-specific bias in what the turner notices. Filter verbs ("seemed to vibrate," "began to make sense") stack without purpose, dulling immediacy. No dialogue on the page to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Severe paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "The task was not just... but to..." / "The turner's motivation was not merely... but to..." / "not a fixed destiny, but a raw possibility." Synonym churn recycles "unravel" / "unscramble" / "tangled skein" across adjacent paragraphs. Stock metaphors ("tapestry," "beacon," "crucible") appear in most sentences of the final third without pattern-teaching. Applying −1.4 for pervasive artifacts; final-third concentration disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Core premise (mystical archivist decoding the past) follows a widely used template without transformation. The hourglass turner, canyon echo, and lost buttons are listed rather than synthesized into a specific, non-obvious story logic. No bold risk; the piece hedges into abstraction and avoids concrete stakes. Emotional arc is interchangeable—could swap names and setting without impact. Derivative Premise Guardrail: −1.0 adjustment applied.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>The hourglass turner is named early (setup gate met) but makes no on-page choice that alters tactics or options. Observation without decision throughout; the character is present in the final image but causally passive. Missing development and closure participation gates; cap at 2.8. Ornamental use and swappability further lower the score.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The canyon echo jar appears early (setup gate) and is lifted once, releasing a hum. It is mentioned in the ending but does not return with reweighted meaning or causal pressure—merely a static reprise. Missing development gate (no middle choice constrained by it); closure participation is ornamental cameo. Two-gate eligibility allows ~6.0 max, but weak beat involvement and swappability lower the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Shared wisdom" is declared repeatedly as theme but never shapes an on-page choice or tactic. It appears early (setup) and in the ending (closure mention) but remains abstract assertion rather than dramatized pressure. Two gates met (setup, closure mention) allow eligibility to ~6.0, but ornamental use, label-only treatment, and no middle development lower the score significantly.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>"Quietly inspired" is label-only; the trait never constrains or enables an action with visible cost. Mentioned early (setup) and repeated at the end, but no on-page choice demonstrates how this attribute shapes behavior under pressure. Two gates (setup, closure mention) allow ~6.0 eligibility, but label-only use and no development or causal pressure drop the score sharply.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Unscramble" is named early and repeated in the ending ("unscrambling the narrative threads"), but no major turn traces to this action. The turner's work is summarized rather than dramatized; no beat shows unscrambling altering options or tactics. Two gates met (setup, closure mention); weak beat involvement and swappability (could replace with "decode" or "interpret" without structural change) lower the score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Cataloging lost buttons is introduced early (setup) and mentioned as the turner's method across several beats, with a final reference ("the last button was cataloged"). However, the mechanics are never shown—no on-page scene dramatizes the cataloging process or how it constrains a choice. Two gates met (setup, closure mention); summary-only use and missing middle development lower the score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The amber warehouse beneath cliffs is anchored in the opening line (setup) and appears in the final image ("warm, golden light of the amber warehouse"). However, it supplies no resource or constraint that alters a choice—postcard description only. Two gates met (setup, closure mention); ornamental use and no middle development prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"As the truth unravels" is introduced early (setup) and repeated in the ending. However, no live clock tightens decisions; time passage is vague and untracked. The timeframe is thematic assertion rather than tactical pressure. Two gates met (setup, closure mention); ornamental use and no development lower the score.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"To spin a prophecy into raw possibility" is stated early (setup) as the turner's motivation and repeated at closure. However, desire is never dramatized through conflicted choice or trade-off; it remains told-only assertion. Two gates met (setup, closure mention); lack of friction between wants and costs and no middle development lower the score.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Unearthed silence" is introduced early (setup) and appears in the final image ("power of unearthed silence"). Tone remains static—mystical/reverent throughout—without modulation under pressure or a pattern break. Two gates met (setup, closure mention); single static mood and no development prevent higher scoring.</comment>
