<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The advisor remains an abstract archetype throughout—"quietly charismatic," "uncanny ability"—without contradictory impulses or embodied choices under pressure. The old man's signing is received passively; no micro-decisions reveal hierarchy of values. Motivation is declared ("translate silence into music") but never dramatized through conflicting wants or visible costs that foreclose options. Interiority consists of stock phrasing ("map of emotions," "deep understanding") rather than character-particular perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: we learn "whispering advisor" and "luminous harbor" but no concrete anchor for who this person is, why they're here, or what immediate problem they face until well past the opening third. The dominant stake—translating silence into music—is asserted but never tested by a causal turn; the "symphony" simply unfolds without obstacle or cost. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the final image of the camera and the vanished advisor, but no on-page choice or forfeiture makes a before/after legible; the advisor arrives, performs, and leaves with no dramatized price. The orientation delay triggers −0.4 in Q2 and caps Q3 at 7.0 per the Orientation Test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The harbor setting is painted in broad strokes ("luminous," "moonlight," "gentle lapping of waves") but never constrains a choice or supplies a resource that alters tactics. The vintage camera appears as a static symbol rather than a tool or micro-setting element that charges the closure. Spatial choreography is vague: we know there's a stall and a crowd, but no concrete distances or sensory hierarchy filters through the advisor's professional or personal priorities. The orientation cap from Q2 is waived here because the setting detail, while generic, does not create additional confusion once the scene is established.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The declared stake—"translate silence into music"—never faces on-page resistance or a choice that narrows options. The advisor "maps silence," "weaves the silence into a melody," and the crowd gathers, but no reversal, tightening, or cost alters tactics. The old man's cooperation is immediate; no obstacle tests commitment. The resolution is not earned by protagonist agency but by atmospheric description of a "symphony of silence" that simply happens. No visible price is paid, no path foreclosed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Theme is announced rather than earned: "even when no one remembers you, the music remains" and "even in forgetfulness, there is beauty" are direct statements in place of concrete particulars. The vintage camera "with no film" and the sign language could generate resonance, but they remain ornamental rather than constraining choices or accumulating pressure. The final image—advisor vanishing, old man smiling—offers no non-literal answer that reweights prior material; it restates the theme without complication or cost. Recurrence of "silence," "whispers," "luminous" is token rather than charged.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Distance is consistent but generic: "quietly charismatic figure," "their eyes scanning," "a look of understanding passing between them" could describe any protagonist. Perceptual signature is absent—no character-specific way of noticing. The prose carries some rhythmic control ("luminous harbor by moonlight, where the gentle lapping of waves...") but diction drifts into elevated abstractions ("orchestrate," "symphony of sound," "fabric of the moment") that sit uneasily with the lack of concrete sensory anchoring. Dialogue is absent, so those bullets do not apply.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "translate silence into music" / "give voice to the unheard" / "symphony of silence" / "music of the moment"; "luminous harbor by moonlight" recurs without evolution. Template cadence: multiple paragraphs open with "The advisor" or "As the [X]." Stock metaphors: "map of emotions," "bridge between worlds," "fabric of the moment." Filter verbs stack in high-pressure beats: "seemed to," "began to," "became clear." These artifacts dull the closure image and trigger cumulative penalty: paraphrase loops −0.4, template cadence −0.5, stock metaphor strings −0.4, total reduction ~−1.3 in Q7, and artifacts touch the closure beat so the disallow-9+ rule applies globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Core premise—advisor translates unspoken into music via sign language—is fresh on its surface but never explores cost, conflict, or consequence that would make it indispensable. The advisor's gift operates without friction; the old man cooperates; the crowd is receptive. Emotional specificity is absent: "joyful sorrow," "melancholic and uplifting" are labels. The ending—advisor vanishes, magic lingers—is a stock closure for visitor-artist narratives. No bold risk or synthesis makes this feel inevitable rather than assembled from prompt elements.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The whispering advisor is present throughout and frames the action, but makes no on-page decision that narrows options or alters tactics. Observation and passive reception dominate; the "conducting" is described, not dramatized as choice under pressure. Setup present, development is label-only, closure participation is a cameo (vanishing into the crowd). Cap for missing middle development at 3.4; decorative mention and label-only trait each −0.3; swappable with "mysterious musician" −0.4. Base 3.4 − 1.0 = 2.4.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The vintage camera with no film appears in the opening beat (advisor's gaze lingers, "symbol of memories captured and lost") and returns in the final paragraph ("seemed to capture the essence of the moment"). Setup and closure participation are present, but middle development is absent—it is never handled, constrains no choice, supplies no resource. The "no film" detail is noted but never affects tactics or generates cost. Lyric reprise without mid-scene use; cap 6.3, but swappability (any memento could serve the same symbolic function) −0.8, ornamental use −0.5. Base ~5.0 − 1.3 = 3.7, but missing middle cap 3.4 applies. Final 3.1 after rounding artifacts.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Sign language is signaled early (old man signs a story), used as a bridge in the middle ("using the sign language as a bridge between the worlds of sound and quiet"), and present at closure ("their hands moving in time with the signing"). All three gates met; causal role in one major beat (weaving silence into melody). However, the mechanics are vague—how does sign language enable the translation?—and the element could be replaced with any visual/gestural art form. Setup +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.7, swappability −0.6, summary-only in key beat −0.4. Base ~5.1 − 1.0 = 4.1, round to 4.1, but weak specificity nudges to 4.3 after band adjustment.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Quietly charismatic" is applied twice as a label ("quietly charismatic figure," "quietly charismatic presence") but never constrains or enables an on-page action with cost. The trait does not shape how the advisor attracts the crowd, negotiates with the old man, or makes choices under pressure. Setup mention present, no middle or closure participation. Cap for missing middle 3.4; label-only −0.6; ornamental −0.4. Base 3.4 − 1.0 = 2.4, round 2.4, nudge to 2.6 for the late reprise that at least attempts thematic echo.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Disrupt" is present: "The advisor's presence seemed to disrupt the tranquility of the harbor... a gentle stirring, as if the advisor was tuning the atmosphere to a different frequency." Setup clear, development describes the disruption's effect (drawing attention, changing the harbor's "luminosity"), closure alludes to lasting change ("forever tuned to the frequency of their music"). All three gates, but no major turn traces causally to the disruption itself—it is atmospheric description rather than an action that forecloses options. Setup +0.5, closure linkage +0.7, swappable with "transform" or "enchant" −0.6, summary-only key involvement −0.5. Base ~4.6 − 1.1 = 3.5, round 3.5, nudge to 3.9 for closure echo.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Mapping silence" is named in the middle third ("by mapping silence, listening to the unspoken rhythms") and echoed at closure ("conducted this symphony of silence"), but the method's mechanics are never shown—what does "mapping" entail as a distinct tactic? It does not shape attempts or constrain choices; it is a poetic label. Setup weak (arrives mid-text), development is tell-only, closure is cameo. Late first appearance −0.4, summary-only −0.6, swappable with "translating" or "channeling" −0.5. Base ~3.5 − 1.5 = 2.0, round 2.0, but closure echo nudges to 3.2 under lyric-resonance allowance.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The luminous harbor by moonlight is named in the opening line and recurs throughout, providing consistent atmosphere. Setup strong, closure present ("luminous harbor by moonlight remained"). However, the setting never pressures a choice or supplies a resource—it is postcard description ("gentle lapping of waves," "moonlight itself was being orchestrated") without micro-setting function. Setup +0.6, closure linkage (thematic reprise) +0.7, ornamental use −0.8, swappable with any picturesque night locale −0.6. Base ~5.0 − 1.4 = 3.6, round 3.6, but consistent anchoring and closure echo lift to 4.7 under accumulative allowance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.2</grade><comment>"When no one remembers you" is named mid-text ("For in this moment, when no one remembers you, the whispers of the past are all that remain") and echoed at closure ("even when no one remembers you, the music remains"). The timeframe is thematic rather than a live clock—it does not tighten decisions, impose a deadline, or alter tactics. Setup absent (arrives late), development is thematic invocation, closure is echo. Late first appearance (well past 40%) caps at 4.6; thematic-only use without causal pressure −0.8; ornamental −0.5. Base 4.6 − 1.3 = 3.3, but missing setup and late arrival push toward 2.2 after caps.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"To translate silence into music" is stated early ("they sought to translate silence into music") and drives the advisor's actions throughout (mapping silence, weaving melody, conducting the symphony). Setup clear, development is the extended middle action, closure present (gratitude for the translation, music remains). All three gates met; motivation is central. However, it is never dramatized through conflicting wants or visible costs—the advisor encounters no resistance, makes no sacrifice. Setup +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.9, told-only without friction −1.0, no on-page cost −0.6. Base ~6.0 − 1.6 = 4.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Joyful sorrow" is named once mid-text ("a reflection of the joyful sorrow that filled the advisor's heart") and echoed in the ending's "melancholic and uplifting" music and the old man's "mix of joy and sorrow." Setup weak (single mention as label), development is the tonal coloring of the music sequence, closure present in the blended emotional effect. The tone does modulate slightly (expectant hush, poignant harmony), but relies on stock phrases rather than embodied contradiction. Setup label-only −0.3, closure linkage (charged final image of smiling old man with memory) +0.9, static mood phrasing −0.4, swappable with "bittersweet" −0.3. Base ~5.5 − 1.0 = 4.5, round 4.5, but closure charge nudges to 5.2 under tonal coherence credit.</comment>
