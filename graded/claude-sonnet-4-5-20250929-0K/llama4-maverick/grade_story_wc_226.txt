<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The artist remains entirely abstract—no name, no micro-choices under pressure, no embodied emotion beyond vague "urgency" and "turmoil." Interiority consists of thematic questions posed in essay-like summary rather than lived contradiction. The "realization" and "sense of peace" at the end are declared, not earned through on-page causality. Voice is generic and interchangeable, with no perceptual signature or character-specific bias filtering the world.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Orientation remains vague throughout: no anchors for who (nameless artist), where (canyon layout unclear), or when (ritual timeframe never specified). The piece drifts through summary narration without a single dramatized scene—no beats, only abstract declarations. Closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration ("forged hush," readiness for ritual) but the cost is asserted rather than shown; no visible choice or foreclosed path appears on the page. The drive lens is ambiguous—neither causal linkage nor accumulative pattern is taught—resulting in a −0.4 penalty and cap at 7.2 per the lens-ambiguity rule.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The canyon, towers, spire, and mist are described repeatedly but remain postcard imagery without spatial coherence or constraint on choice. No anchors for distance, layout, or accessibility; the spire "seems to draw closer" by narrative fiat rather than movement or perception. The setting never pressures a decision or supplies a resource. Sensory detail cycles through vision and vague "swirling" without POV filter or purpose.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Stakes are declared ("uncover a truth," "ritual looming") but never tested in scene. No on-page reversal, tightening, or choice narrows options; the artist recites poetry and receives a vision without agency or cost. The "price of forgiveness" is posed as a rhetorical question, not dramatized. Coincidence (mist parts, spire reveals symbols) resolves the quest without protagonist action. No escalation or visible trade-off under any lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Theme is stated overtly and repeatedly: "price of forgiveness," "refract a single truth into many," "power of art to reveal." The final paragraphs summarize the theme five times instead of letting an image resonate. No earned insight from specific experience; the artist's "glimpse of the divine" is asserted convenience. Thematic echo ("the price of forgiveness...") in the final lines triggers the −0.6 penalty for prompt-like moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Narrative distance is unstable and certainty exceeds what the focalizer can know ("echoes would remain," "would continue to be heard"). Register oscillates between elevated ("aerie," "enigmatic") and abstraction ("turmoil," "complexity"). No dialogue to assess. The prose lacks perceptual signature; observations are generic tour-guide descriptions. Purposeful elision is absent; vagueness replaces concrete anchoring.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops dominate: "echoes" appears eight times, "mist" fourteen times, "truth" nine times, often in adjacent sentences restating the same claim. Template cadence runs pervade ("The mist would...," "The artist's..."). Stock metaphors ("river," "veil," "monument") and therapy-speak ("forged hush," "emotional aftereffect") clutter peak beats. Filter-verb stacks ("seemed to," "would") dull immediacy. These artifacts trigger −1.4 in Q7 and disallow 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>The premise (artist seeks truth before ritual via impromptu poetry) is generic template without transformation. The canyon setting, bone towers, and pale spire are fantasy-stock without fresh angle or lived detail. The artist's "defiance" and "mischievous glint" are labels contradicted by passive reception of a vision. The resolution—receiving a revelation through convenience—avoids risk. Swappable names and setting would leave the arc unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The "defiant artist" is named in the opening but makes no on-page choices; she recites poetry and receives a vision. "Defiant" is contradicted by passive acceptance. No decision alters tactics or forecloses a path. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The pale spire appears in three beats: initial observation, closer appearance mid-story, and symbols revealed at the vision. It is never handled or used; the artist observes it. It shifts meaning (enigmatic → revelatory) but through narrative fiat rather than protagonist action. Functional but static.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>The "price of forgiveness" is posed as a rhetorical question in two paragraphs, then declared "understood" at the end without dramatization. It does not shape on-page stakes or alter tactics. Theme claim only, no causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Innocently mischievous glint" appears once in paragraph two as a label without visible tradeoff or enabling action. No micro-choice tied to this trait. Ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Refract" appears six times across the piece: voice refracting air, seeking to refract truth, words refracting out into the world. It is never shown in concrete action—no prism, lens, or embodied technique. Major turn (vision of symbols) is not causally tied to refracting; the mist parts by coincidence. Present as metaphor without mechanical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Impromptu poetry sessions" are mentioned in paragraph six and recur as "her poetry became more fervent" and "echoes of her poetry." Mechanics are never shown—no words spoken, no improvisation dramatized. The method is summarized, not performed. Functional label without causal weight.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The "towers of bone in a canyon of endless echoes" frame the opening and closing but never constrain movement, supply resources, or alter tactics. The canyon is static backdrop. No micro-setting detail (body, tool) participates. Postcard description without pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Before the ritual" anchors the premise but no clock tightens decisions. The ritual "loomed on the horizon" yet never approaches in scene time. When it arrives ("when the ritual came"), readiness is declared off-page. No urgency alters moves. Vague timeframe without tactical cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"To refract a single truth into many" is stated as motive in paragraph eight and repeated thematically. No on-page choice shows conflict between this desire and cost. The artist succeeds by receiving a vision without trade-off. Told-only desire without friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>2.2</grade><comment>"Forged hush" appears once late (paragraph 22) as an asserted state rather than modulated tone. The prose maintains uniform elevation and abstraction throughout; no cadence shift under pressure. Static mood label without progression.</comment>
