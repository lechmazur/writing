<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The archivist remains a label rather than a character who makes choices under pressure. Her "gently thorough" nature is asserted repeatedly but never tests her through conflicting impulses or forecloses options with visible cost. The locket couple exists only as told backstory; no on-page relationship pressure forces the protagonist's stance. Motivation is declared ("preserve the weight of small moments") but never dramatized through a micro-choice that reveals competing values.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>No closure unit lands on the page. The piece cycles through documentation → photo contemplation → walking away without a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing that reweights prior material with felt cost. The final third shifts to summary narration ("Years later...") that tells outcomes rather than delivering an on-page ending. Orientation is delayed: "walnut-ink archivist" and "regenerated covenant" appear without spatial or causal grounding in the opening ~120 words, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4) and capping Q3 at 7.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The jetty is vividly rendered with blooming flowers and twilight glow, but it functions as postcard description rather than constraint or resource. The archivist's documentation task and the locket photo receive concrete handling across multiple beats, qualifying as micro-setting. However, neither the jetty's spatial features nor the photo's physical properties alter her tactics or charge the closure image, keeping the score mid-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("preserve the weight of small moments") is declared but never tested by a competing pressure that narrows options. The archivist sits, gazes, walks away—no reversal or tightening forecloses a path. The summary leap to "years later" replaces on-page escalation with told outcomes. Coincidence does not resolve because nothing is resolved; the piece ends in static contemplation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Theme is overtly stated in the final third ("the power of small moments," "enduring power of love") rather than emerging from concrete particulars. The regenerated covenant and locket photo seed a potentially resonant pattern, but the ending summarizes its legacy instead of delivering a non-literal image that reweights prior material. "Haunted euphoria" is named twice without embodied contradiction or cost that would earn the affect.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, and the narrative voice carries a consistent lyric register. However, distance control wavers: the narrator asserts the archivist's future impact ("her work would be rediscovered") with unearned certainty and shifts into summary omniscience in the final third. Perceptual signature is generic; diction ("sweet scent," "ethereal glow") lacks character-specific bias. No dialogue appears.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "preserve the weight of small moments" appears in six distinct sentences, often rephrased without added pressure. Template cadence runs ("She + past-tense verb" opener across seven paragraphs) flatten rhythm. Stock phrases ("pure joy," "sense of connection," "poignant reminder") replace specific perception. The summary tail ("Years later... As the years passed...") recycles the same conceptual content across multiple paragraphs, triggering −1.2 for loops and template cadence that touch the closure zone.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The core premise—archivist preserves a love story through documentation—follows a recognizable template (guardian of memory + poignant artifact) without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The "regenerated covenant" concept is intriguing but remains abstract; "proximate causes" is named without mechanics. Twilight jetty and walnut ink offer textural color but do not synthesize into a fresh angle. Derivative Premise Guardrail applies: −0.8 adjustment within Q8.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>The walnut-ink archivist is present throughout and her occupation frames the documentation task, meeting the setup gate. However, she makes no on-page decision that alters tactics or narrows options; her actions (sitting, gazing, walking) are observational. The character appears in the summary ending but without causal agency. Ornamental use and swappability (any preservationist role would function identically) cap the score. Late closure participation is told rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The locket photo is introduced early (~paragraph 4), handled physically ("held," "placed in her bag"), and returns in the summary ending as a "relic." It shapes two distinct beats (initial contemplation, securing it away) but does not constrain a choice or reweight meaning at closure—it is described as inspirational in summary rather than charged through on-page pressure. Meets setup and development gates; weak closure participation. Swappability moderate (any artifact of the couple would serve).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>The "regenerated covenant" is named in paragraph 8 and the summary ending but remains abstract: its discovery and history are told in backstory without on-page tactics shaped by its mechanics. It does not constrain a choice or alter the archivist's options during the documented scene. Introduced late (past 40% mark), ornamental, and swappable with any discovered promise or bond. Caps at 4.6 for late introduction; ornamental use and summary-only treatment lower further.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Gently thorough" is named once (paragraph 2) and asserted in the summary ending but never enables or constrains an on-page action with visible cost. The archivist's documentation is described as meticulous, but no tradeoff (speed vs. accuracy, breadth vs. depth) dramatizes the trait under pressure. Label-only mention; no middle beat involvement. Late closure cameo in summary does not count as causal participation.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>"Steep" (as in "steeped herself in the nostalgia," paragraph 6) is used once as a verb describing immersion in feeling, not as an action that drives a turn. The moment does not redefine options or narrow tactics; it is a static contemplative beat. Easily swappable (any reflective verb—"immersed," "lost herself"—would function identically). Single ornamental mention; no development or closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>"Through proximate causes" is named once (paragraph 9) as the method by which the archivist traces the covenant's history, but the mechanics are never shown or signaled: no chain of evidence, no causal steps demonstrated. Summary-only use; the phrase appears in backstory exposition without shaping on-page attempts or choices. No setup in action, no development, no closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The "blooming jetty at twilight" is anchored early (paragraph 1) and described across multiple beats with vivid sensory detail (flowers, waves, fading light, wooden planks). The archivist walks the jetty in the final documented scene. However, the setting does not pressure choices or supply resources that alter outcome—it remains atmospheric backdrop. Meets setup gate; weak development (spatial movement is transit, not constraint); closure participation is summary-only ("the jetty continued to bloom").</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"When context changes" is named in paragraphs 3 and 23 as the trigger for the archivist's documentation work and frames the summary ending's leap ("Years later, when context changes again"). However, no on-page tightening or live clock shapes the current scene's decisions—the timeframe is abstract and does not alter tactics. Setup is vague; no middle development; closure participation is told in summary. Ornamental framing device.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"To preserve the weight of small moments" is declared in paragraph 3 and repeated across six paragraphs, framing the archivist's task. It is told as motivation but never dramatized through a friction where this desire conflicts with cost (time, resource, personal attachment). No on-page choice tests the motivation; the archivist's actions (document, secure photo, leave) proceed without visible trade-off. Label-only; summary-only legacy in the ending.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Haunted euphoria" is named twice (paragraphs 8, 15) as a felt state but not embodied through contradictory sensory detail or action. The tone across the piece is contemplative and melancholic with lyric passages; the "euphoria" component is asserted rather than charged. Twilight blooming and nostalgia support "haunted," but no tonal modulation under pressure demonstrates the paradox. Told-only affect; static mood; weak closure charge.</comment>
