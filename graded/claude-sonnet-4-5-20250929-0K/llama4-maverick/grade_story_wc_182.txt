<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is stated ("prove herself as a leading expert") but never tested on the page through contradictory impulses or difficult choices. The time traveler remains a cipher with no interiority, existing only to facilitate plot. The final transformation—"no longer content to simply uncover knowledge"—is asserted rather than earned through concrete struggle. "Carefully resourceful" appears as a label without constraining any choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The orientation test fails: who, where, and when remain vague past 120 words ("labyrinthine bookstore sprawled across the mountain" offers no concrete anchor). The closure unit is a summary cascade ("the journey had changed her...she had found her true calling") that tells transformation without dramatizing cost. The inferred lens is causal, but key turns (finding the diary, opening the hidden door) occur through convenience rather than earned because/therefore linkage. Applied −0.4 for orientation debt and −0.6 for asserted closure without on-page cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The bookstore is described in generic terms ("musty depths," "narrow aisles," "twisting shelves") without spatial coherence or particular sensory detail. No object, tool, or environmental constraint shapes a choice. The "unheard symphony" and "intricate carvings" remain ornamental. The Orientation Test penalty in Q2 caps Q3 at 7.0; execution debt lowers the score further.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake (finding the library) is declared but never tested with a visible tradeoff. The shadowy pursuers create declared tension ("closed in") yet resolve without consequence. The renegotiation beat is summarized in a single sentence without depicting terms, cost, or the time traveler's hesitation. No meaningful tightening or choice forecloses a path with on-page cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The final paragraph delivers overt theme statements: "she had found something far more valuable than mere knowledge," "a seeker of knowledge, and a guardian of the unlearned lessons." The "unheard symphony" motif is invoked three times without shifting meaning or constraining choice. Thematic moralizing in the final paragraph ("some secrets were meant to remain hidden") replaces scene pressure, triggering −0.6 in Q5.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The narration maintains stable third-person distance, but diction drifts into generic abstraction ("the very fabric of reality resonating," "a new world of possibilities"). No distinct perceptual signature emerges; Elara's way of noticing remains indistinguishable from standard omniscient summary. Minimal dialogue appears; the time traveler's introduction and hesitance are summarized rather than voiced. Register remains consistent but lacks specificity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "she had finally found the library" / "she had found something far more valuable" / "she had found her true calling." Template cadence runs throughout ("Elara was...," "Elara knew...," "Elara realized..."). The final third stacks synonym redundancies ("secrets and mysteries," "wonder and awe," "knowledge, her curiosity, and her carefully resourceful nature"). Applied −1.2 for patterned artifacts including loops in the closure paragraph.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The premise (magical bookstore hiding secret library, aided by time traveler) is a familiar template executed without transformation. The "library of unlearned lessons" and "unheard symphony" remain abstract labels. Turns arise from convenience (diary "nestled between pages," door "adorned with intricate carvings") rather than specific world logic or character ingenuity. No fresh inflection or risk-taking heightens stakes.</comment>
