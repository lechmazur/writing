<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The painter protagonist shows concrete motivation—obsession with the brooch—and the final choice (creating art) is embodied on the page. However, interiority relies heavily on abstraction ("wryly earnest sense of purpose," "haggard awe") rather than character-particular contradiction. The exchange beat with the stranger is summarized ("we negotiated") rather than dramatized, undercutting pressure at a pivot. Internal conflict is told more than shown in simultaneous action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening. The piece follows a causal lens: brooch discovery → marking investigation → stranger exchange → art creation. Closure lands as Decisive Change (the finished piece titled "Convergence" offers resolution), but cost is largely conceptual—"weight of the convergence bearing down"—and the final image ("otherworldly light") drifts toward mysticism rather than embodied consequence. One meaningful tightening occurs (stranger's revelation connects brooch to convergence), but the climactic exchange is summarized, weakening causal grip at the hinge.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The tidal island setting provides atmospheric grounding ("crumbling buildings," "overgrown streets"), and rain trails offer a purposeful tracking method. However, the environment rarely constrains choice—the painter wanders freely, and spatial choreography during the stranger encounter is vague ("doorstep," "lair" without concrete detail). The brooch as micro-object charges the final image, lifting the score slightly, but the island itself remains postcard backdrop rather than tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding the brooch and convergence—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the stranger's knowledge reframes the brooch as a catalyst for the water wars, narrowing the painter's understanding. However, the stranger appears conveniently at the end of the chase without prior setup, and the exchange itself is summarized rather than dramatized, dulling pressure at the peak. The resolution (creating art) feels thematically apt but the cost is abstract ("weight… bearing down") rather than a visible forfeiture.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme (trauma processing, meaning from ruin) emerges through the painter's quest, and the brooch serves as a recurring motif. Yet the final paragraph over-explains: "a sense of closure, a sense that I had finally threshed meaning from experience" is thematic echo that replaces earned resonance. The convergence-as-catalyst revelation is told by the stranger rather than discovered through dramatized action. The ending image (brooch glowing "with an otherworldly light") gestures toward mystery but leans into mysticism over earned thematic weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>First-person POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present—painter's attention to patterns, light, texture—but diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("wryly earnest," "haggard awe") that feels imposed rather than voice-native. The stranger's dialogue is absent (exchange summarized), so no character distinction test applies. Psychic distance is consistent, and filter verbs are sparse. Minor uplift for purposeful compression in the rain-trail sequence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear with varied syntax and no major loops. Information density is adequate, and the read-aloud rhythm varies naturally. However, several phrases recycle stock constructions: "mere shadow of its former self," "wild goose chase," "the weight… bearing down." The phrase "haggard awe" appears twice identically, once as a beat descriptor and once in dialogue summary. Figurative language in the final beat ("otherworldly light") tilts toward generic mysticism. No major artifact blocks closure, but cumulative minor template reliance keeps the score mid-band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The post-apocalyptic artist premise and "convergence" phenomenon are familiar genre furniture. The rain-trail tracking method offers a small fresh inflection, and the brooch-as-balance-token adds specificity. However, the emotional arc—trauma survivor finds meaning through art—follows a well-worn template without transformative particulars. The convergence itself remains abstract (no lived detail of what the phenomenon actually does beyond "bend and warp"), and the stranger's exposition dumps lore rather than dramatizing discovery. Transformation test fails: swap "convergence" for another apocalypse trigger and the arc holds unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The insomniac painter drives the search (finding brooch, following trails, seeking stranger, creating art). Setup is immediate, and the final art-making is on-page. However, the key exchange beat is summarized ("we negotiated"), so the protagonist's tactical choices there are invisible. Insomnia itself is mentioned but never constrains a choice or shapes perception under stress. Mid-band for presence across beats but weak causal grip at the pivot.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The amber brooch appears in discovery, examination, exchange, and final artwork—four beats. It seeds the quest, is handled on-page ("turned it over in my hand"), and returns charged in the closure image ("seemed to glow"). The stranger's "haggard awe" when examining it adds a second perspective. However, its properties (intricate patterns) are static description; we never see how those patterns link to the wall markings in dramatized action. Strong setup and closure linkage, but swappable with any artifact; irreplaceability is weak.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The "unearthed convergence" frames backstory (catalyst for water wars) and is named in the title of the final artwork. However, it remains abstract—"very fabric of reality… bend and warp," "anomalies and artifacts"—with no on-page mechanics that constrain the painter's choices or tactics. The stranger explains it in exposition rather than the protagonist encountering its effects. Present as theme claim, but does not shape on-page pressure or alter options. Functional backstory only.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Wryly earnest" appears once as a label ("I began to feel a wryly earnest sense of purpose") without dramatization. No action on-page demonstrates the trait—no dialogue, no choice colored by ironic sincerity or self-aware contradiction. The phrase reads as imposed descriptor rather than embodied character texture. Ornamental mention only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The exchange (art for information) is signaled, negotiated (though off-page), and directly produces the revelation that reframes the brooch. It appears in the second half and drives one major turn. However, the exchange itself is summarized ("we negotiated the terms," "soon I found myself delving deeper"), so the tactical friction and cost during the deal are invisible. Functional hinge but not irreplaceable—any information source could serve. Mid-band for causal role in one beat with minimal dramatization.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Rain trails are introduced ("by following rain trails"), used to track the convergence path, and lead to wall markings. Setup and middle development are present. However, the mechanics are vague—how does rainwater reveal the markings? why does it matter that it's rain rather than any other search method?—and the method does not constrain a choice or create friction. The trails disappear after leading to the stranger; no payoff in closure. Functional once, but replaceable with "I searched" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The tidal island is named immediately, provides atmospheric grounding (gloom, ruins), and the water wars backstory ties to the setting's history. However, the island never pressures a choice—the painter moves freely, and no tidal constraint (access windows, flooding) affects tactics or stakes. The setting functions as backdrop and mood rather than tactical element. Present across the piece but postcard-descriptive; does not alter options or charge closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"After the water wars" anchors the timeframe in the opening and provides backstory context (devastation, trauma). The past wars motivate the painter's search for meaning. However, the timeframe is static—no live clock, no urgency tied to when the search occurs, no tidal schedule or decay timeline that tightens decisions. The wars are historical backdrop, not a pressure that shapes present tactics. Functional context only, easily replaceable with any post-catastrophe frame.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"To thresh meaning from experience" is stated explicitly in the opening (art as solace) and repeated verbatim near the end ("I had finally threshed meaning from experience"). The desire drives the search and culminates in creating the artwork. However, the final resolution is told rather than shown—we see the finished piece but not the struggle or cost of creation, and "a sense of closure" is asserted. The motivation is present across all three gates but leans on summary at closure. Solid setup and development, weaker dramatization of fulfillment.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Haggard awe" appears twice: once as the painter's feeling and once describing the stranger's reaction to the brooch. The tone—exhausted wonder—is coherent with the ruined setting and trauma backstory. However, it is label-applied rather than embodied through syntax, rhythm, or sensory detail that degrades under stress. The final image ("otherworldly light") gestures toward awe but the prose rhythm remains steady rather than modulating to charge the moment. Tone is asserted more than enacted; present but static.</comment>
