<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elian's motivation ("to store wonder in the cellar of reason") remains abstract throughout; the interiority relies heavily on summary reflection ("his mind expanding," "sense of curiosity") rather than embodied contradictions under pressure. The locksmith's actions—studying, observing, reassembling—are externalized without micro-choices that reveal competing impulses. The ending offers satisfaction but no visible cost or path foreclosed; he simply leaves with wonder "stored safely," which reads as completion without sacrifice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the device reactivated, Elian leaves with stored wonder), but the cost remains conceptual and unfelt—no option is foreclosed, no relationship altered, no trade-off dramatized. The piece follows an Accumulative lens (months pass, understanding grows), yet the final image ("stored safely in the cellar of reason") repeats the opening premise without reweighting it through on-page pressure. Escalation exists as time passing and comprehension deepening, but the decisive tightening is weak.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The marble cavern, luminescent crystals, and clockwork device are vividly described and recur across beats. The crystals function as a study tool ("reflection angles") and later as "approving friends," but this remains atmospheric rather than constraining a choice. The spatial choreography (tunnels, approach, working, departure) is clear. However, the setting does not pressure Elian's tactics or alter his options; it serves as backdrop for solitary work rather than crucible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding the device and "harvest of echoes"—is signaled early, but no live opposition or trade-off emerges. Elian's work is painstaking yet uncontested; time passes ("days turned into weeks"), but no reversal or complication narrows his options. The ending grants success without sacrifice: the device whirrs to life, he smiles, and departs enriched. Agency is present (he studies, reassembles), but no cost forecloses a path or tests commitment under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme ("storing wonder in the cellar of reason") is stated early and repeated at closure without transformation. The "harvest of echoes" concept operates as atmospheric label rather than dramatized friction. The ending image (ticking clockwork, glowing crystals, Elian's departure) offers a resonant mood but does not reweigh the premise—wonder is gathered, stored, and carried forward as initially desired, with no counter-pressure or irony. The piece invites reflection on curiosity and understanding but resolves into affirmation without complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable; Elian's perceptual signature ("peripherally focused gaze") is mentioned twice but not dramatized in his way of noticing. Diction is elevated and consistent, with some stock phrasing ("soft, approving light," "deep sense of connection"). No dialogue. The narrative distance remains steady, though interiority leans toward summary ("his mind already turning over," "felt a thrill of excitement"). Filter verbs ("seemed to glow," "felt a sense") appear frequently but remain voice-motivated and legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies adequately, but several paraphrase loops appear: "studying the device, observing" / "wonder of it all" / "secrets...secrets...secrets" across adjacent paragraphs. Template cadence emerges in the middle third with repeated "As he [verb]" and "Elian's [noun]" sentence stems. The metaphor "cellar of reason" recurs without evolving. Clarity is maintained, but information density is low—multiple sentences restate Elian's fascination and the crystals' glow without advancing pressure. No figurative muddle in peak beats, but momentum sags under reflection weight.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The locksmith-in-cavern premise and "harvest of echoes" concept feel ornamental rather than transformed; removing "echoes" and replacing it with generic "energy" would leave the plot unchanged. The "peripherally focused" trait and "reflection angles" method are mentioned but not integrated into tactics. Emotional arc (curiosity → understanding → satisfaction) follows a template path without friction or surprise. The clockwork device, marble cavern, and luminescent crystals are vivid but occupy familiar fantasy-craft territory without a fresh inflection.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elian is present throughout and his work drives the plot, but "reflective" manifests as abstract contemplation ("thoughts turned to," "mind expanding") rather than on-page decision points. He observes, studies, reassembles—actions that advance the task but do not involve competing options or visible trade-offs. His final departure is satisfaction, not a choice that alters tactics or forecloses a path. The character is functional but replaceable with any curious craftsperson.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The broken timer mechanism is introduced early (paragraph 3), is the object of Elian's months-long work, and is reactivated at closure ("final, satisfying click"). It appears in at least three beats (discovery, study, reassembly) and the ending would lose its payoff without it. However, its specific properties (why a timer, what it measures) remain vague; any broken device would function similarly. The element shapes the middle and ending but lacks irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Harvest of echoes" is named twice (paragraphs 5 and 14) as a concept Elian hopes to understand, but it never constrains a choice or alters tactics on the page. The "residual energy of past events" remains atmospheric; Elian becomes "attuned to the subtle rhythms" through observation, not friction. The concept could be removed and the plot (locksmith repairs device in cavern) would remain intact. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Peripherally focused" is mentioned twice (paragraphs 4 and 18: "peripherally focused gaze") but functions as a descriptor, not a constraint. The trait does not enable a specific tactic or impose a visible cost. Elian's method involves direct study of crystals and device, not peripheral vision. Swappable with "keen-eyed" or "detail-oriented" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Reverse-engineer" is named in paragraph 7 as Elian's method and contextualizes his months of study. The action spans the middle section (observing, understanding, reassembling) and leads to the device's reactivation. However, the mechanics are summarized rather than dramatized, and the beats could be described as "repair" or "restore" without altering the arc. Present across beats and necessary to the ending, but not irreplaceable in its exact form.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Studying reflection angles at different times" is stated in paragraph 7 as Elian's unorthodox method and motivates his observation of crystals' light (paragraph 8). It is mentioned but not shown in distinct beats—no scene depicts Elian adjusting position, marking angles, or using this data to solve a puzzle. The method is present in setup and implied in the middle, but absent from the ending and replaceable with generic "careful study."</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The marble cavern with luminescent crystals is vividly described, anchors all action, and recurs across beats (arrival, work, departure). The crystals provide light and later seem to "glow with an soft, approving light," but this is atmospheric rather than a resource that alters tactics. The setting does not impose a constraint (e.g., fading light, dangerous echoes) or shape the ending's charge. Present throughout and essential to tone, but postcard-level integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Across the lull of a wounded season" appears in the title region and paragraph 8; the season "slowly began to heal" near the end (paragraph 15). The timeframe is poetic but does not tighten decisions—Elian works "hours, even days...weeks...months" without a deadline or seasonal constraint affecting his tactics. Time passes to show effort, not to impose cost or urgency. Present in framing but vague and untracked.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"To store wonder in the cellar of reason, for later" is stated in paragraph 11 and repeated at closure (paragraph 19). The motivation is named but not dramatized through conflicting choices—Elian's desire to understand and catalog wonder is unified, not tested by a competing want or fear. No on-page friction between storing and experiencing, or between reason and wonder. The motivation is told and frames the arc, but lacks embodied cost.</comment>
