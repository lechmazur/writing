<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The archivist remains abstract throughout—no contradictory impulses, no embodied emotion under pressure, only contemplative observation. Her "task" to "sculpt identity" is declared but never tested by a choice with visible cost; she stands, descends, touches, conjectures, and smiles without friction. The collective-memory flood is told as summary ("images and emotions… not her own") rather than dramatized through specific, conflicting details that force a micro-choice. No credible endurance or renunciation forecloses a path on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who and where by the opening, but when remains vague ("after the fog became solid" functions as mood, not clock). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the archivist observes, the storm clears, she descends, memories flood, she conjectures, then departs. No decisive change or tightening narrows options; the ending ("she knew that she would carry the collective memory with her always") summarizes a stance already present at the start, with no visible cost or foreclosed path. Closure is asserted, not enacted.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory and crystal forecourt are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (wet stone, ozone, refracted lightning). However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it serves as atmospheric backdrop. The shadow-length method is mentioned but never shown in granular action that pressures a decision. Spatial choreography (descent, central monument) is clear but purely transit.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving collective memory—is signaled early but remains abstract and uncontested. No on-page reversal or tightening narrows options; the archivist encounters no obstacle, doubt, or competing pressure. The storm clears conveniently, memories flow without friction, and she departs peacefully. Agency is observation, not decision with cost. No escalation under any lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The theme of collective memory shaping identity emerges through image and mood but is stated outright in multiple lines ("she knew that she was not just an archivist, but a guardian of the collective memory"). The final paragraph summarizes theme rather than offering a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext is minimal; the piece tells its meaning rather than enacting it through specific contradiction or cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited remains stable with a distinct, elevated register ("preemptively nostalgic," "deepening hush"). POV modesty holds; the narrator infers only what the archivist perceives. However, the perceptual signature is generic contemplative rather than character-particular, and syntactic patterns repeat ("She had always," "As she," "The summer-quill archivist"). No dialogue to test. Distance is consistent but texture is not sufficiently idiosyncratic under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Clarity and grammar are clean, but paraphrase loops appear across adjacent paragraphs: the archivist's task is restated three times without new pressure ("to sculpt her identity," "her own identity begin to take shape," "shaping the future"). Template cadence in the final third ("She descended… She closed… She examined… She stood…") flattens momentum. Elevated diction ("forecourt," "mantle," "sublime") is consistent but not purposefully varied. No figurative muddle, but density and propulsion lag in the back half.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The fantasy-archivist premise and memory-monument setting are evocative but feel ornamental; the "summer-quill" and "stormlit observatory" read as poetic labels rather than specific systems that alter choice. The emotional arc—calm observation to calm knowing—is generic; swap names and the arc remains unchanged. No bold risk or fresh synthesis charges the ending; the piece retreats to safe abstraction.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The summer-quill archivist is present throughout and frames the narrative, but her actions are observational (gazing, descending, touching) rather than decision-driven. She does not make a choice that alters tactics or forecloses an option with cost. Present in setup, middle, and ending, but functionally replaceable with "archivist" or "keeper." Ornamental specificity without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The crystal whispering forecourt appears in setup (paragraph 5), is reached and touched in the middle (paragraph 10–12), and fades in the ending (paragraph 26–27). It is handled on the page and returns with reweighted meaning ("faintest whisper of its presence"). However, it does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters the outcome; it functions as stage rather than lever. Two beats, closure linkage, but no causal pressure or irreplaceability—swappable with any memory-receiving object.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Collective memory is named repeatedly and frames the thematic premise, but it does not shape on-page stakes or tactics. The memory flood (paragraph 12) is summarized rather than dramatized with competing details that force a micro-choice. The concept appears in setup, middle, and ending but remains abstract; removing it would require only small rewrites. Functional presence without causal work or visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>"Preemptively nostalgic" appears once in paragraph 2 as a label for a feeling. It does not constrain or enable an action with cost; it is ornamental mood. No setup signal (introduced in second paragraph), no middle development, no closure participation. Present but purely decorative.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Conjecture" is named in paragraph 7, enacted in paragraph 13, and alluded to in the ending. However, the act of conjecturing does not create a turn or redefine options; the archivist conjectures and then "a picture began to emerge" without friction or cost. Swappable with "interpret," "discern," or "understand." Functional role in one beat, but no causal pressure or irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Shadow-length examination is mentioned in paragraph 6 and enacted briefly in paragraph 15 ("She examined the shadow lengths, measuring them"). The method is signaled early and appears in the middle, but its mechanics do not matter—no constraint on the outcome, no visible trade-off or difficulty. The picture emerges without resistance. Functional but replaceable with any archival method.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory frames the opening (paragraphs 1–3), reappears in the final paragraph (28), and supplies vivid atmosphere. However, it does not pressure a choice or alter tactics; the clouds and storm clear conveniently without imposing cost. Early signal, closure reprise, but no causal constraint. Lyric resonance without dramatic necessity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"After fog becomes solid" appears in paragraph 3 as a mood marker, not a ticking clock. Time is untracked; the archivist spends "countless hours" examining monuments (backstory) but no live deadline tightens decisions in the present scene. The storm clears at her convenience. No setup clock, no middle pressure, ornamental closure mention ("the night").</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The motivation to sculpt identity is declared in paragraph 4, restated in paragraph 17, and affirmed in the ending. However, it is never dramatized through conflicting wants or costs. The archivist desires to shape her identity and does so without friction; no trade-off, no foreclosed path. Functional presence across three beats but told rather than enacted with visible pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Deepening hush" is named in paragraphs 11 and 20, and the tone of reverent stillness holds throughout. The mood modulates slightly (storm → clearing → stillness) and charges the final departure image. However, the tone does not shift under pressure; it remains uniform contemplation. Coherent and purposeful, with closure linkage, but no dynamic range or tonal contradiction that heightens stakes.</comment>
