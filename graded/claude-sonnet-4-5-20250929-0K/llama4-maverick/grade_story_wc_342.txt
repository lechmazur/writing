<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The face-blind portrait artist is established early with fractally precise skill, but their motivation ("to mirror the sky inside walls") remains abstract and doesn't generate meaningful internal conflict or on-page choice friction. The character acts with consistent reverence and absorption, yet no contradictory impulses appear in scene—they work, discover, interpret, and depart in smooth sequence without visible cost to the final departure. The closing act of gathering belongings and leaving reads as contemplative transit rather than a choice that forecloses a live path with felt price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece anchors who/where/when cleanly by the second paragraph. Escalation operates through density layering—artist at work, book safe discovery, coin interpretation, pre-demolition awareness—culminating in the artist departing with the secret and a charged final image. However, the closure unit (artist departing, carrying essence and secrets) offers only mild Resonant Reconfiguration; the cost is conceptual ("what had been lost, and what had been gained") but not legible in a specific on-page forfeiture or altered tactic. The because/therefore linkage is present but gentle; the demolition clock ticks but doesn't force a dramatized trade-off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The tree trunk library is vivid and specific: hollowed by a scholar's guild, musty silence, dappled light through branches, book-lined shelves with the hidden safe. The pre-demolition stillness and the rumbling machines outside create temporal pressure. The coin's faint indentations function as micro-setting, guiding brushstrokes and charging the portrait with intricate beauty. The setting constrains the artist's window of opportunity and charges the final image (indigo sky mirrored within walls), meeting the 9+ gate requirement that environment shapes choice or final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: completing the portrait (and capturing the infinite within finite bounds) before demolition. The artist's absorption and the ticking clock create situational pressure, and the coin discovery introduces a cryptic pattern that guides the work. However, escalation is atmospheric rather than choice-driven; the artist remains absorbed throughout, and the departure is contemplative rather than a forced tightening. No visible price is paid on the page—gathering belongings and leaving lacks the felt cost or renunciation that would elevate the ending. The demolition crew waits, but the protagonist's agency in response is passive endurance rather than a trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme (limits of capturing the infinite, impermanence vs. beauty) emerges through the coin's cryptic message, the portrait's fractally precise rendering, and the pre-demolition context. The sky-mirrored-in-walls motivation and the final indigo image offer resonance without overt moralizing. Yet the ending paragraph edges toward summary ("what had been lost, and what had been gained") and the artist's internal arc is more contemplative absorption than transformation. The portrait "seemed to glow with an otherworldly light" verges on telling the effect rather than earning it through particulars, and the thematic question about limits is posed more than dramatized in a choice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, with clean focalization on the artist. Perceptual signature is present in the artist's trained eye detecting faint indentations and their reverence for craft. Diction is elevated and consistent, though some phrases ("otherworldly light," "poignant reminder") drift toward generic lyricism under peak moments. No dialogue appears; interior access is maintained without head-hopping. Psychic distance is controlled, but the final paragraphs lean on summary constructions ("as if the artist had succeeded," "a testament to the power") that dilute immediacy when scene pressure would benefit from tighter embodiment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose is clear and grammatically clean, with vivid sensory anchors (musty silence, dappled shadows, worn coin). However, the piece exhibits template cadence in repeated "as they worked," "as the…" constructions, and paraphrase loops: the artist's absorption and the pre-demolition stillness are restated multiple times without added pressure. The final three paragraphs recycle "the artist," "the stillness," and "the essence" in similar syntactic frames, creating a drumbeat rhythm that dulls propulsion. Filter verbs ("seemed," "as if") cluster in the closure beat, reducing immediacy when the final image needs sharpest focus. Density is moderate; many sentences do one job rather than layering character, action, and atmosphere.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The face-blind portrait artist and the tree trunk library offer fresh specificity, and the coin-guided portrait is a purposeful synthesis. However, the emotional arc (absorbed artist departs with secrets and essence) follows a contemplative template without a non-obvious turn. The motivation "to mirror the sky inside walls" is poetic but remains abstract; the piece does not transform the premise through lived friction or moral calculus. The ending's "otherworldly light" and "testament to human creativity" edge toward familiar affirmationist closure without the earned cost or renunciation that would make the synthesis feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Face blind portrait artist is introduced early and recurs across beats (working on portrait, discovering safe, interpreting coin, departing). However, the face-blindness trait itself does not constrain or enable any on-page choice; the artist's "fractally precise renderings" and coin-reading ability operate independently of face blindness. The character's choices are gentle (opening safe, interpreting indentations, gathering belongings) rather than causal turns, and the trait remains ornamental to the character's function.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Secret book safe appears by mid-story when the artist's fingers brush it, is opened to reveal papers and the coin, and is gathered into the artist's bag at the end. Two beats (discovery/opening, final collection) with purposeful reprise. The safe provides the coin that guides the portrait, creating causal linkage. However, the safe itself does not constrain choice or return with reweighted meaning; it is a container for the coin rather than an active element. Caps at ~6.0 for two-beat presence without closure transformation.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Discovering limits is signaled through the coin's cryptic message about "the limits of human understanding and the futility of seeking to capture the infinite within finite bounds." The concept reappears in the artist's final reflection on "the limits that had been discovered." It shapes the thematic stakes and is invoked at closure, but does not alter on-page tactics or force a choice between competing options. The artist continues working absorbed; discovery of limits is contemplated rather than dramatized in a trade-off. Three-gate presence (setup via coin message, thematic pressure, closure invocation) lifts above mid-band, but lack of tactical constraint limits score.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Fractally precise is introduced early ("known for their fractally precise renderings") and returns in the final paragraph ("fractally precise portrait"). The trait is described twice but does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with visible cost. The precision guides the brushwork generally, but no moment shows a trade-off or price unique to fractal precision (e.g., time cost, perceptual exhaustion, inability to capture something beyond detail). The attribute remains a label rather than a causal lever. Late closure cameo without middle development caps at 4.6.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Craft (creating the portrait) is the artist's dominant on-page action, present from early beats through the final step-back survey. The portrait is the vehicle for the coin's guidance and the mirror-the-sky motivation; it is the artifact that "seemed to glow" at closure. Two major beats (working with coin guidance, completing and surveying) and closure linkage. However, the act of crafting is smooth rather than fraught; no major turn traces to a craft decision with visible cost. The action is essential to the story but does not redefine options or force a pivot.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Through faint indentations on a centuries-old coin is introduced when the artist opens the safe and detects the coin's "subtle topography" with trained eyes. The indentations guide brushstrokes and imbue the portrait with "subtle, intricate beauty," appearing across two beats (discovery/interpretation, guidance during work). The method is signaled and its mechanics matter to the portrait's execution. However, the coin-reading does not shape a failed attempt or force a tactical choice; it is a gentle, successful aid. Two-gate presence (setup, development) without causal pressure or closure turn limits score to mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Tree trunk library hollowed by a scholar's guild is anchored early with vivid detail (musty silence, dappled light, book-lined shelves). The setting houses the book safe, provides the pre-demolition stillness that frames the story's timeframe, and supplies the indigo sky that is mirrored in the portrait. The library's impending demolition creates situational pressure, and the final image ("sky…mirrored within the walls") charges closure. Three gates (setup, safe discovery, closure image) with closure linkage, but the setting does not force a tactical choice mid-story—demolition is ambient threat rather than active constraint on the artist's moves.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>At the hush just before a condemned building is demolished is invoked early ("pre-demolition stillness") and recurs ("the clock ticked down," "last seconds ticked away," "demolition crew waited outside"). The timeframe is tracked across beats and the machines rumble at the end, creating ambient urgency. However, the artist works at their own pace without a visible tightening caused by the clock; no moment shows the artist altering tactics or sacrificing quality due to time pressure. The demolition is backdrop rather than active constraint, and the artist departs without dramatized rush or cost tied to the deadline.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>To mirror the sky inside walls is stated early ("Their motivation, to mirror the sky inside walls") and echoed in the closure image (indigo sky "mirrored within the walls"). The motivation frames the artist's work and reappears at the end. However, it is told rather than dramatized in choice friction; no moment shows the artist struggling between mirroring the sky and another want, or paying a visible cost to achieve this goal. The motivation is thematic rather than tactical, and the ending declares success ("seemed to glow") without showing what was given up to attain it. Two-gate presence (early statement, final image) without middle conflict caps below 5.0.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Heightened stillness is established early ("musty silence," "quiet reverence") and modulates across beats: "hush of the pre-demolition stillness deepened," "stillness of the moment heightened," "stillness lingered." The tone coheres through the artist's absorbed work and shifts slightly when the demolition crew's machines rumble, creating contrast. The final image uses stillness to charge the ending ("The stillness lingered, a poignant reminder"). Tone is consistent and modulates with pressure, and it charges the final beat, meeting three gates and elevating toward the 7.0 threshold. However, "poignant reminder" edges toward telling the effect rather than embodying it, capping just below 7.0.</comment>
