<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The skipper remains in observation mode throughout—noticing sea glass, letters, cairns—without making a meaningful choice under pressure. His interiority leans toward abstraction ("luminescent ache," "deep and abiding sorrow") rather than embodied contradiction. The decision to stack stones and "protect" the lighthouse is told as resolve formed, not dramatized through conflicting impulses with visible cost. No relationship crucible tests him; he acts alone in contemplation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive late (skipper's identity and role remain vague until "supply skipper" tag; spatial layout of lantern room unclear). The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens with the cairn-building as a meditative deepening, but no on-page decisive change occurs—the skipper's "resolve" is declared, not earned through a choice that forecloses an option. The Cost Proof Test fails: the final image (sea glass glowing, lighthouse watching) offers atmospheric resonance but no legible price paid or path closed on the page. Orientation Test penalty −0.4; Lens holds but closure lacks cost, preventing higher bands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The lantern room, sea glass, and cairn receive vivid sensory treatment ("soft blue, like the first hint of dawn," "rocky shore," "dusty prisms"). However, the haunted lantern room does not constrain a choice—it's a backdrop for reflection. The sea glass warms in the pocket but does not alter tactics. Spatial choreography is loose (descent from tower, arrival at shore, boat push-off lack clear distances). Micro-setting (the body, the stones) charges the ritual moment but does not drive a decision. Solid atmospheric work without tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—to protect the lighthouse from darkness—is declared late and abstractly. The lamp flickering out is setup, but no escalation or tightening follows; the skipper performs a calming ritual and sails away unchanged. No reversal, no trade-off, no visible cost; the cairn-building soothes rather than complicates. Coincidence (finding the letter, the sea glass) seeds curiosity but does not test the skipper's commitment. Under an accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is required; here we see mood accumulation without a choice that narrows options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Theme of safety, protection, and luminescent longing emerges organically from the lighthouse, sea glass, and cairn motifs. The final image (sea glass as "tiny blue ember," lighthouse as sentinel) offers resonant particulars. However, the piece never dramatizes the "ache" through conflict or cost—it remains a stated feeling. The anonymous letters gesture toward dread but vanish without thematic payoff. No earned insight or non-literal answer to the central question; instead, a mood piece with symbolic furniture that does not reweight prior material through action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited; perceptual signature ("warmly observant") is consistent but yields only noticing, not bias that alters interpretation. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated ("reticent," "luminescent ache"), though some phrases edge toward elevated lyricism ("deep and abiding sorrow") that risks register drift from a supply skipper's idiom. No dialogue on the page. Psychic distance remains stable. The narrative texture is distinct but does not modulate under pressure—calm throughout—so no stress test of voice occurs.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Rhythm is measured and lyric; sentence openings vary. However, scaffold loops appear: "The skipper felt..." recurs; "luminescent ache" is repeated verbatim across paragraphs without added meaning. Paraphrase near the end: the final two paragraphs restate the skipper's connection to the lighthouse and sea glass with synonym churn ("sense of safety," "wrapped in the warm, observant gaze," "mysteries that lay just beneath the surface"). Template-cadence check: "As he..." opens three successive beats in the final third. Apply −0.6 for loops and stems. Information density is moderate; many lines serve atmosphere over plot. No clarity breaks, but momentum sags under repetitive phrasing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The lighthouse-keeper/protector premise is familiar; the cairn-as-message and sea glass talisman are evocative but not transformed through specific choice or world logic. The anonymous letter chain is introduced and abandoned without payoff. Emotional texture (longing, protective resolve) is earnest but generic—could apply to any guardian figure. No bold structural risk; the meditative tone stays within safe lyric territory. The piece reads as atmospheric execution of template elements rather than a synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The reticent supply skipper is on the page throughout but makes no choice that turns the plot. He observes, collects, stacks stones, and sails away. His reticence is label-only; he does not speak or withhold speech under pressure. Present and functional but replaceable with any contemplative caretaker.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The sea glass appears in the lantern room (first beat), is pocketed (second beat), warms in the pocket (third beat), and glows in the final image. It shifts from found object to talisman, charging the closure image with metaphoric weight. However, it does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic—purely symbolic. Early signal, three touches, closure linkage, but no causal pressure. Lyric reprise with thematic reweighting earns mid-5s; lack of cost caps it below 6.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The anonymous letter chain is mentioned in one paragraph as island lore ("whispers that the letters were the work of the lighthouse itself") but does not shape the skipper's stakes or choices. Introduced late (second third), never revisited, no closure linkage. Ornamental curiosity without plot work.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Warmly observant" is demonstrated through noticing (sea glass smoothness, stone stacking) but never constrains or enables an action with cost. The trait functions as consistent filter but does not create a tradeoff or tactical advantage. Present across beats, no closure pressure, swappable with "attentive" or "gentle."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Protect" is declared as resolve in the penultimate section but not dramatized. The skipper's actions (stacking stones, sailing) do not enact protection in a way that forecloses an option or tests his commitment. The verb appears late, is told rather than shown, and could be replaced with "honor" or "remember" without altering the plot. Functional mention, no causal weight.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Stone-stacking as messages is introduced, demonstrated in the cairn-building beat (middle), and implicitly present in the final image's "message in a bottle" echo. The method shapes one beat (meditative ritual) and carries thematic resonance. However, the skipper does not send or receive a message through stones—he performs the gesture privately. Two-gate (middle, closure echo), thematic link, but no causal pressure or cost. Caps at ~6.0 per lyric-resonance allowance.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The haunted lantern room is named and described (dusty prisms, flickered-out lamp) but does not constrain a choice. The skipper leaves it without consequence. The rocky shore and boat are staging, not pressure. Setting is vivid but passive. Present in setup and as atmosphere, no middle or closure constraint. Functional but replaceable with any coastal tower.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The lamp flickered out "hours before," framing the present moment. However, time does not tighten decisions—the skipper has leisure to reflect, stack stones, and sail. No urgency or deadline alters tactics. The timeframe is signaled but inert, swappable with "at dusk" or "in evening" without plot impact.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"To bottle the feeling of safety" is stated mid-story as a desire and echoed in the resolve to protect the lighthouse. The motivation is told, not dramatized through conflicting wants or costs. The cairn-building arguably enacts the impulse to preserve/transmit safety, offering one beat of expression. However, no friction arises—no obstacle tests the desire. Two touches (middle statement, final resolve), thematic presence, but no on-page cost or conflict. Caps at mid-5s per gate-lite and low dramatization.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Luminescent ache" is named repeatedly and embodied through imagery (sea glass glow, tower's sorrowful presence, "slow gentle dawn" spreading through his chest). Tone is coherent and modulates subtly from unsettling silence to meditative peace to quiet resolve. The phrase charges the final image (sea glass as ember, ache spreading). However, verbatim repetition without variation in three paragraphs weakens its impact. Strong atmospheric integration and closure linkage; repetition and lack of tonal pressure test lower the score slightly.</comment>
