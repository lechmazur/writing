<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is heavily filtered through abstract meditation and symbolic interpretation rather than embodied contradiction. Her socially perceptive trait is mentioned but never constrains an on-page choice with visible cost. The final resolution—"a sense of peace settle over her"—reads as asserted comfort rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene. Therapy-speak phrases ("the unlearning," "emergent hush," "lilac unease") substitute for concrete emotional embodiment at key beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Orientation arrives slowly: who (chalk artist), where (grotto), and what she's doing (mandala) are clear early, but the present dramatic question remains vague throughout. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, yet no meaningful tightening or pattern break reweights the stake with cost; the artist simply works until she feels resolution. The tile flake message "listen deeply" arrives but doesn't alter her tactics or narrow options. Closure reads as a mood shift ("sense of peace") rather than a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with legible cost on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The grotto setting supplies vivid sensory anchors—mist, damp stone, whispering walls—and the sand mandala functions as a recurring micro-setting element. However, the environment never constrains a choice or supplies a resource that alters outcome; it remains atmospheric backdrop. The tile flake is handled twice (picked up, examined; held at closure) but doesn't pressure a decision. Spatial choreography is clear, and the lilac light at closure offers a charged image, lifting the score into mid-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to discover meaning in the mess"—is signaled early but remains abstract and never narrows to a concrete on-page test. No reversal or tightening forecloses a live option; the artist simply continues working until she "felt a sense of resolution." The tile flake's arrival could complicate, but she integrates it without friction. Agency is present in the form of "interject[ing] a subtle change," but no visible price is paid and no path is foreclosed. Under the Accumulative lens, one decisive intensification is required; none lands with felt cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme—meaning emerging from chaos—is legible through the mandala's patterns, and "the unlearning" provides a conceptual frame. However, the ending offers a stated moral ("discovered meaning in the mess") rather than a resonant, non-literal answer through image. Prompt-language phrases ("emergent hush," "lilac unease") recur without accumulating pressure or reweighting prior material. The tile flake's "listen deeply" message is absorbed without friction, and the final paragraph summarizes theme rather than dramatizing it. The story gestures toward complexity but resolves into comfort without earned cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Psychic distance remains consistent, though the narrator's perceptual signature leans toward elevated, therapy-inflected diction ("socially perceptive soul," "lilac unease," "emergent hush") that feels imposed rather than organically arising from the artist's working consciousness. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed") are frequent but voice-motivated. Diction stays within a consistent register, and the prose has textural specificity in sensory detail. No dialogue present to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and sensory detail is vivid. However, pervasive paraphrase loops and thematic restatements dull momentum: "The sand mandala was a reflection of her own inner world" appears twice verbatim, and "emergent hush" is recycled without functional variation. Template cadence appears in multiple paragraph openings ("As she worked," "As the design reached," "As she gazed"). Stock metaphors—"tendrils of fog curling around the edges"—and elevated abstractions ("coalescing into a gentle hum") accumulate without concrete payoff. The closure beat is not obscured, but artifacts pervade the second half, triggering accumulated deductions.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The premise—artist seeks meaning through mandala in a whispering grotto—follows a familiar spiritual-journey template without transformation. Elevated abstractions ("emergent hush," "lilac unease") read as prompt-label ornaments rather than lived particulars. The tile flake's "listen deeply" message is a stock epiphany cue. No bold structural or perspectival risk heightens stakes; the arc moves predictably from turmoil to peace. Sensory specificity in the grotto setting offers some freshness, but the emotional and thematic arc could transfer unchanged to any meditative practice in any liminal space.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The whimsical chalk artist is present throughout and her work on the mandala frames the action, but her choices do not create key turns. She observes, works, and integrates the tile flake without friction or visible cost. Her "interject[ing] a subtle change" is mentioned but not dramatized as a decision that alters tactics. The final smile and sense of peace are asserted outcomes rather than consequences of her agency. Present in setup, middle, and closure, but her role is largely observational within an internal journey.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The tile flake appears in two beats: picked up and examined mid-story, then "still clutched in her hand" at closure as a "tangible reminder." The message "listen deeply" is noted but does not constrain or enable a subsequent choice. The flake's presence charges the final image slightly, but its meaning does not reweight prior material; it arrives as a symbolic cue rather than a causal agent. Setup and closure participation are present; middle development is minimal. Swappable with another symbolic object.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Emergent hush" is repeated as a thematic label but never shapes stakes or tactics on the page. It describes an internal state the artist perceives but does not constrain her actions or alter her approach to the mandala. The phrase recurs across beats as atmosphere rather than causal pressure. Present in setup, middle, and closure, but only as abstract descriptor. Echoed as theme without changing options; mid-band at best per the rubric.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Socially perceptive" is mentioned once in the opening paragraph ("a socially perceptive soul, attuned to the subtleties of the atmosphere and the people within it") but never constrains or enables an on-page action. No other character is present for her to perceive, and the trait does not shape her interpretation of the grotto or mandala. Label-only mention with no dramatized cost or visible tradeoff. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Interject" appears once: "she reached out to interject a subtle change into the pattern, guiding the emerging design." The action is mentioned but not dramatized with causal consequence; the narrative does not show what change she makes or how it alters the mandala's outcome. A second brief mention near the end ("interject one final change") similarly lacks specificity. The action signals agency but is easily swappable with "adjust" or "refine" without structural impact. Functional but replaceable; one beat involvement.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The sand mandala is signaled early ("her latest sand mandala") and remains present across multiple beats as the artist works, observes patterns, and "interject[s] a subtle change." Its mechanics—swirling sands revealing hidden truth—are described but not causally tested; no choice depends on mandala technique versus another medium. It frames the narrative and charges the final resolution when "the mandala reached its final form." Present in setup, middle, and closure; shapes the attempt but its unique properties do not constrain tactics. Crosses the two-gate threshold with some causal presence.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The whispering grotto supplies vivid atmospheric detail—mist, damp stone, whispering walls—and is present from opening to close. The gallery above drops the tile flake, creating one beat of environmental interaction. However, the setting does not pressure choices or supply resources that affect outcome; it remains backdrop. The mist "seeping into the grotto" and "receding" at closure modulates atmosphere without constraining the artist's actions. Setup, middle cameo (tile drop), and closure presence; one functional beat. Shapes mood but not tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"The unlearning" is named in the setup ("She was in the midst of the unlearning") and mentioned at closure ("As the unlearning continued"), framing the timeframe conceptually. It does not tighten decisions or tactics on the page; the artist's process unfolds without visible deadline or phased progression tied to "unlearning" stages. Time feels vague and untracked; no live clock alters moves. Present as abstract frame in setup and closure, minimal middle development. Logically consistent but does not shape urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"To discover meaning in the mess" is signaled early as her "deep desire" and returns at closure when she "had finally discovered meaning in the mess." The motivation frames her actions—working on the mandala, examining the tile flake—but is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices. No friction between this want and a competing cost appears on the page; the artist simply pursues and achieves resolution. Setup, middle rationale, and closure payoff present; one key beat shaped by the desire. Functional but lacks visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"Lilac unease" is introduced mid-story ("a sense of lilac unease settle over her, a feeling that was both calming and unnerving") and recurs near the end twice more. The unusual pairing of color and emotion is memorable but remains static; the tone does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image decisively. The closing "lilac light" and lingering "lilac unease" offer atmospheric bookends without reweighting the stake. Present in middle and closure; coherent but does not escalate or transform. Functional accent, mid-low band.</comment>
