<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Eira's motivation—"to find the sacred in the simple"—is declared but never tested by a concrete choice with visible cost. Her "trembling hand" and "spirit soar" rely on generic bodily clichés and therapy-speak ("renewed sense of purpose," "deeper understanding") rather than embodied contradiction. The ending grants her hope without dramatizing what she forfeits or risks, flattening agency into passive reception of inspiration. Internal conflict is summarized, not acted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first paragraph, meeting the test. However, no causal turn narrows Eira's options: she wanders, finds the garden, touches the keystone, feels energized, and walks away with renewed purpose—a sequence of "and then" beats without a meaningful tightening or cost. The closure unit (her renewed sense of direction) lacks visible or felt cost on the page; nothing is forfeited, no path foreclosed. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (lingering luminance, garden imagery), but no density shift or cadence break reweights the stake at the end. Under the Cost proof test, I cannot point to a sentence where cost is legible at the ending beat, triggering a deduction in the −0.6 range.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The icebound spire is vividly rendered with "intricate carvings," "frosty corridors," and "twisted, ethereal design," but remains largely postcard description. The garden and keystone are present in the closure image, yet neither constrains a choice—Eira simply touches the keystone and receives inspiration. Spatial choreography is clear (spire → corridors → hidden garden → folly), and the "lingering luminance" recurs, but the environment does not pressure her tactics or alter her options. The keystone charges the final image but does so passively, missing the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reigniting Eira's stagnant creativity—is signaled early, but no on-page reversal or tightening narrows her options. She touches the keystone and feels a "surge of energy," then walks away with hope; no trade-off, no foreclosed path, no visible price. Agency reads as passive reception rather than decision, renunciation, or endurance with cost. The unstrapping of the bindings is described as requiring "great care and precision," but this potential complication vanishes without dramatized difficulty or consequence. Under the selected Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen through density or pattern, but the garden sequence feels static.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Theme—creativity versus automation, the sacred in the simple—is declared repeatedly ("the sacred was not something grand or majestic, but rather something simple, yet profound") rather than emerging from dramatized particulars. The keystone and garden function as convenient symbols rather than constraining forces. The ending offers no non-literal answer; instead, Eira's realization is stated directly: "she had found what she was searching for." The final paragraph moralizes ("a testament to the power of creativity and imagination") instead of trusting image and action. Thematic Echo penalty applies: Eira articulates the thesis in prompt-like language ("to find the sacred in the simple"), and the final paragraph restates the theme as moral summary, triggering −0.6 in Q5.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("accommodating impossibilities with its twisted, ethereal design," "the lingering luminance that permeated the structure") that feels authorial rather than character-bound. Perceptual signature is weak—Eira's way of noticing reads generic rather than mage-specific or underachiever-specific. The oxymoron "brilliant dimness" appears twice but feels like imposed prompt language rather than organic voice. Free indirect style is clean, but internal voice lacks the texture and contradiction needed for higher bands.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "Eira knew that she had found what she was searching for," then "Eira knew that she would return," then "Eira was eager to continue." Synonym churn cycles through "renewed sense of purpose," "deeper understanding," "new sense of direction." The phrase "lingering luminance" appears four times, "brilliant dimness" twice, without functional variation. Stock metaphors ("spirit soar," "icy walls," "beacon of hope") cluster in closure beats. Filter-verb stacks ("felt an inexplicable connection," "felt a surge," "felt her spirit soar," "felt a sense of hope") dull immediacy across high-pressure moments. Applying the patterned-artifact penalty pack: paraphrase loops, template cadence, synonym churn, and filter-verb stacks in peak beats total −1.4 in Q7; artifacts touch the closure beat, adding −0.3. Total deduction: −1.7, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</quote><comment>The core premise—underachieving mage seeks inspiration in mystical tower—follows a stock template (hero's journey, creative renewal through magical encounter) without transformation. Eira's arc (wander → discover → touch talisman → gain hope) is a widely used structure. The "icebound spire" and "garden folly keystone" offer surface detail but lack the specific, non-obvious synthesis that elevates familiar material. The oxymoron "brilliant dimness" gestures at originality but remains ornamental. Emotional specificity is thin; Eira's fear of "succumbing to the same fate" and her "renewed sense of purpose" read generic. Transformation test: the plot and emotional arc work unchanged with different names and places.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Eira is present throughout and focalizes all beats, but her "underachieving" trait is label-only—never shown through failed spells, peer comparison, or self-sabotage. She wanders, touches the keystone, and feels hope; no choice alters tactics or forecloses a path. The attribute appears in setup (first paragraph) and recurs thematically, but lacks middle development through a constrained decision. Missing middle development caps at 3.4; label-only use and swappability (replace with "struggling artist" with minor edits) apply −0.6 total. Functional but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The garden folly keystone is introduced at midpoint, described as "glowing with an soft, otherworldly light," and touched in the climax. Eira must "unstrap the bindings" to access its power, then feels a surge upon contact. It returns in the final paragraph ("carrying the memory of the keystone's gentle glow"). Three touches across beats: discovery, unstrapping/touching, memory. Causal pressure is weak—the keystone solves Eira's creative block without prior cost tied to it. Setup occurs after the 40% mark, capping at 4.6. However, beat involvement (three touches) and closure linkage (memory carried forward) add +1.3 total, lifting to ~5.9. Swappability (any magical artifact could serve the same function) and late arrival apply −0.4 total. Rounds to 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Lingering luminance" is introduced early ("lingering luminance that permeated the structure") and recurs four times. It is the keystone's glow and charges the garden's beauty, but never constrains a choice or alters Eira's tactics—it remains atmospheric. The concept appears in setup, middle (garden scene), and closure (memory of glow), meeting all three gates. All-three-gates eligibility allows ≥6.1, but causal pressure is absent and the element is ornamental. Early signal +0.5, beat involvement (two distinct beats) +0.9, closure linkage +0.9 total +2.3. Ornamental use −0.8, swappability −0.6 total −1.4. Starting from 3.0: +2.3 −1.4 = 3.9, rounds to 4.1 after adjusting for three-gate presence.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Accommodates impossibilities" is mentioned once in the second paragraph ("its twisted, ethereal design that defied the laws of physics") but never enables or constrains an on-page action. Eira does not exploit the spire's impossible geometry to navigate, hide, or access the garden. The attribute is purely descriptive. Setup present, but missing middle development and closure participation; missing closure caps at 2.8. No beat involvement, no causal pressure, no cost connection. Decorative mention −0.3. Remains at 2.8 (cap dominates).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Unstrap" appears once: "To access the true power of the keystone, Eira knew she had to unstrap the bindings that held it in place." The action is mentioned but not dramatized—no description of the bindings, the effort required, or the risk of failure. It does not create a reversal; Eira completes it off-page ("With the bindings removed..."). Setup and middle development present (the action is the precondition for the surge), and it shapes the ending (keystone activated). Three gates met, eligible ≥6.1. But summary-only use and lack of dramatization weaken integration. Early signal +0.5, beat involvement (one beat) +0.4, causal pressure (enables the surge) +0.8 total +1.7. Summary-only −0.6, swappability (any barrier-removal action could serve) −0.5 total −1.1. Starting from 3.0: +1.7 −1.1 = 3.6. Three gates present, so raise to lower 5s: 5.3.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Mist walking" is mentioned once in the middle ("Eira employed the ancient art of mist walking, a method that allowed her to navigate the intricate web of energies") but its mechanics are not shown and it does not shape her attempt to release the keystone. The method is asserted, not demonstrated. Setup absent (first mention at midpoint), middle development weak (mentioned but not enacted), closure absent. Missing setup caps at 4.6, but missing closure participation caps at 2.8 (lower cap wins). Ornamental mention −0.3, label-only −0.3 total −0.6. Remains near 2.1.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The icebound spire is introduced in the opening sentence and houses all action. Its "frosty corridors" and "hidden garden" structure Eira's exploration, and the "lingering luminance" ties to the keystone. The spire does not actively constrain choices—Eira wanders freely without environmental obstacles—but it provides the resource (garden, keystone) that drives the ending. Setup strong, middle development (corridors lead to garden), and closure (she will return to the spire). Three gates met, eligible ≥6.1. Early signal +0.6, beat involvement (three: corridors, garden, departure) +1.4, causal pressure (houses the keystone) +0.7, closure linkage +0.9 total +3.6. Postcard description without tactical constraint −0.7. Starting from 3.0: +3.6 −0.7 = 5.9, rounds to 6.2 after three-gate lift.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"When creativity gets automated" appears once in the fourth paragraph as worldbuilding context ("as it had in the world below") but does not tighten Eira's decisions or create a live clock. The timeframe is thematic backdrop, not a pressure mechanism. Setup present (mentioned early), but missing middle development (no scene where automation affects her choices) and closure participation (the ending does not reference it). Missing middle caps at 3.4. Thematic mention without tactical impact −0.5. Remains at 3.4 (cap dominates).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"To find the sacred in the simple" is Eira's stated motivation (paragraph 6) and recurs at the realization beat ("the sacred was not something grand or majestic, but rather something simple, yet profound"). The desire is told, not dramatized through conflicting choices—Eira does not face a trade-off between simplicity and grandeur, nor does she pay a cost to honor this value. Setup strong, middle absent (no choice tests this want), closure present (realization). Missing middle caps at 3.4. Early signal +0.5, closure linkage (realization) +1.0 total +1.5. Told-only friction −0.6, thematic claim without scene pressure −0.4 total −1.0. Starting from 3.0: +1.5 −1.0 = 3.5. Lyric-resonance allowance (early seed → final reprise that reweights the stake) lifts to 5.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Brilliant dimness" is an oxymoron introduced at the keystone's activation ("began to glow with an intense, brilliant dimness") and recurs in the penultimate paragraph ("In the brilliant dimness of the spire"). The tone is meant to evoke paradox—light that humbles rather than dazzles—but it remains static across beats, neither modulating with pressure nor charging the final image with new meaning. Setup at midpoint, present in closure, but missing early establishment. Late first appearance (second half) −0.4. Closure linkage +1.0, ornamental use (does not shape action) −0.6. Starting from 3.0: +1.0 −1.0 = 3.0, but two-gate presence (middle + closure) and closure linkage lift to 4.7.</comment>
