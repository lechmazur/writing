<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The mapper remains a cipher throughout, defined by abstract labels ("vigilant," "determined") rather than contradictory impulses or embodied choices under pressure. Interior life consists of generic resolve and reflection loops ("she knew that," "she felt a sense of") without micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The final action—raising hands to the moon—arrives without visible cost or renunciation; the revolution declared "begun" lacks on-page consequence that forecloses a path. Motivation is told as abstract patience-sculpting but never dramatized through a choice where impatience and patience clash in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (moon tracking, viaduct energy, waiting posture) but no decisive density shift or cadence break reweights the stake at closure. The "raising hands" moment and viaduct surge are declarative rather than causal; the "revolution had begun" is asserted without on-page consequence or visible cost. Orientation anchors (basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, mapper) arrive early, waiving that penalty. However, the piece loops its setup—walking, observing, feeling determination—without a meaningful tightening or turn that narrows options or changes knowledge, leaving closure as conceptual assertion rather than felt reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, and magnetic viaduct are named and visually sketched (metal curves, raindrops, silver glow) but remain postcard backdrops. The viaduct "hums" and "surges" atmospherically without constraining a choice or supplying a tactical resource. Sensory detail is present (cold air, snow crunch, wind whipping) but generic and filtered through summary emotion rather than goal-directed perception. No tool, body state, or environmental feature alters the mapper's options at the closure beat, keeping the setting functional but ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—launching a "patient revolution"—is declared early but never tested on the page. No antagonist, obstacle, or internal trade-off materializes; the mapper walks, observes, and "raises hands" without friction or visible price. The viaduct's energy rising and moon tracking are ambient rather than escalatory; coincidence (full moon, frozen lake cycle) enables the climax without protagonist agency. The final assertion that "nothing would ever be same" lacks dramatized consequence or a choice that narrows live options, leaving pressure static across the arc.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Theme of patience versus impatience is stated directly ("sculpt patience from impatience") rather than emerging from concrete choices. The "patient revolution" and "unyoke" language feel prompt-derived and abstract; no particular action or micro-choice embodies the tension. The moon and viaduct recur but function as atmospheric symbols without shifting meaning at closure. The final image—hands raised, viaduct glowing, revolution "begun"—offers a declaration rather than a non-literal reweighting of prior material, resulting in thematic assertion over resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping, and narrator certainty matches the mapper's knowledge frame. However, diction is generic and interchangeable ("sense of purpose," "deep-seated motivation," "thrill of excitement") without character-particular perception or rhythmic signature. Reflection dominates via summary emotion and abstract resolve rather than concrete sensory anchors or micro-choices that tilt present stance. Psychic distance is consistently distant; no modulation occurs under pressure, flattening the voice across calm setup and declared climax alike.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "sense of purpose" recurs three times, "knew that" opens multiple lines, and synonym churn cycles through "determination," "resolve," "pride and purpose" without added detail. Template cadence dominates with "The mapper [verb/felt/knew]" stems across the majority of paragraphs. Stock metaphors appear (moon as "burning silver orb," ice "stretching out like a vast, frozen sea") and figurative language stacks without propulsion ("restrained wildness stirring," "electric with anticipation"). Minimal sentence-level variety or information density; most lines restate emotional state rather than advancing situation. These artifacts touch the closure beat (final paragraphs repeat "knew," "sense of," "felt"), triggering the Q7 artifact penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Core premise—mystical mapper launches revolution via moon tracking—follows a familiar hero-on-threshold template without fresh synthesis. The "patient revolution," "unyoke," and viaduct-as-energy-conduit read as prompt elements assembled rather than transformed through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. Turns (moon reaches apex, hands raised, viaduct surges) arrive by atmospheric coincidence rather than earned character logic. No bold structural or perspectival risk; the arc is linear setup-to-declaration with no surprising inflection that reweights prior material in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The "vigilant horizon mapper" appears throughout but makes no key decision that alters tactics. She walks, observes, feels resolve, and raises hands—observation and declaration rather than choice under pressure. Present in setup, middle, and ending (all three gates), but purely reactive and ornamental to the unfolding atmospheric event.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The "magnetic viaduct" is described in multiple beats (glistening with rain, humming, surging at climax) but remains a static atmospheric object. It does not constrain a choice or supply a resource the mapper uses; its "energy" responds to the moon and her presence without her handling or manipulating it. Present across all three gates but functionally ornamental, swappable with any mystical landmark.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Patient revolution" is named and thematically echoed ("unyoke," "old order," "new era") but exists only as abstract goal, not stakes that shape on-page choices. No tactic or trade-off dramatizes patience versus impatience; the revolution is declared begun without visible consequence or cost. Present as theme claim, absent as causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.2</grade><comment>"Softly purposeful" appears as a movement descriptor in the opening and again mid-story ("softly purposeful movements") but never constrains or enables an action with cost. No visible trade-off between softness and force; the trait is label-only ornamentation without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Unyoke" is mentioned twice as metaphor for the revolution's goal ("unyoke themselves from the old order") but never enacted on the page. No character performs an unyoking action; the verb remains thematic vocabulary without dramatized consequence. Easily swappable with "liberate" or "free."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Tracking moon paths" is stated as the mapper's method and she is shown observing the moon across multiple beats. However, the mechanics of tracking (charting, deciphering patterns) are summarized in past-tense reflection rather than dramatized; no on-page attempt fails or succeeds. Present in setup and ending but not causally active in shaping tactics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The "basalt sanctuary by a frozen lake" anchors location throughout and the frozen lake signals the cycle's start (timeframe linkage). However, neither basalt walls nor ice surface constrains a choice or alters tactics; the mapper walks to the edge but does not cross or test the ice. Present across all three gates with mild causal coloring (cycle trigger) but postcard function overall.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"After the lake freezes over" is established as the cycle marker and referenced in the opening third. The full moon overhead signals the moment, but no ticking clock or deadline tightens decisions; the timeframe enables atmosphere rather than constraining tactics. Present in setup and closure participation (moon at apex triggers the climax) but without urgency or visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"To sculpt patience from impatience" is stated explicitly as the mapper's motivation but never dramatized through a choice where impatience and patience collide. The mapper feels determination and resolve in summary; no on-page friction or trade-off embodies the tension. Told-only desire without conflicted micro-choices.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Restrained wildness" appears once as a feeling in the climax paragraph and the prose maintains a formal, distant tone throughout with atmospheric intensity ("electric with anticipation," viaduct surging). Tone is coherent but static—no modulation between restraint and wildness that charges the final image or shifts with pressure. Present and consistent but not dynamically engaged with the closure beat.</comment>
