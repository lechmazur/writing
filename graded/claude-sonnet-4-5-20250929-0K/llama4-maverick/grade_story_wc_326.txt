<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Akira's motivation ("death certificate error survivor," seeking to understand a digital ghost) is declared but never tested by contradictory impulses or embodied pressure. The interiority relies on abstract phrasing—"sense of midnight solace," "inexplicable urge"—rather than specific, character-particular perception. The final act (letting the shard slip) reads as symbolic gesture without visible cost that forecloses a path; no prior choice makes this renunciation inevitable. Emotional progression is linear and lacks the messiness of genuine decision under stress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The piece anchors who and where early (Akira, opal observatory) but the temporal frame ("after the radio static clears") arrives mid-story without prior setup, violating the early-signal principle. The dominant stake—understanding the digital ghost—accumulates through ink-pattern study and reflection but lacks a decisive on-page change: the ghost "coalesces" and Akira feels peace, yet no choice narrows options or imposes visible cost. The closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (letting the shard fall), but the cost is implied rather than dramatized, and the lens (Accumulative/Textural) wavers with late Causal gestures (ink study, defragmentation) that do not link through because/therefore. The piece teaches a reflective, lyric mode but does not pay it off with a charged final image that reweights prior stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The opal observatory and snow provide atmospheric grounding, and the porcelain shard recurs with shifting symbolic weight. However, the setting does not constrain choice—Akira's actions (pouring ink, studying patterns) could occur anywhere. The snow "seemed to grow deeper" and then stops without affecting tactics or the ending. Sensory detail is present but filtered through stock poetic diction ("eerie beauty," "serene landscape") rather than Akira's professional or personal lens.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (understanding the digital ghost) is signaled early but never tightened by a reversal or complication that forces a trade-off. Akira's actions—clutching the shard, pouring ink, studying patterns—proceed without resistance or cost until the ghost "coalesces" and she releases the shard. No on-page price is paid; the resolution is granted by the narrative rather than earned through agency. The piece lacks a moment where options narrow or knowledge changes under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Theme (solace in understanding failure, transience of life) is stated rather than earned through specific events. The phrase "fetching wisdom from failure" appears mid-story as an assertion, and the final image (shard falling like snowflakes) offers a poetic echo but does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure. The digital ghost functions as metaphor more than dramatized stake, and the ink-pattern method is too abstract to ground the thematic question. The ending tilts toward serene resolution without moral ambiguity or earned complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited on Akira, and psychic distance is consistent. However, the narrative voice leans on elevated, abstract diction ("midnight solace," "otherworldly light," "essence of the digital ghost") that does not feel rooted in Akira's particular way of noticing. Sentences open with similar rhythmic patterns ("As the snowflakes," "As she stood," "As the ink swirled," "As the night wore on," "As the first light"), creating a lulling cadence that flattens urgency. Dialogue is absent, so voice distinction is not tested.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The prose exhibits paraphrase loops and synonym churn: "sense of midnight solace" / "midnight solace that soothed Akira's soul" / "midnight solace that lay just beyond"; "mysteries that lay beyond the veil" / "mysteries that lay beyond the veil" (final paragraph); "growing understanding" / "newfound understanding" / "deeper understanding." Template cadence with "As [noun] [verb]" openers across multiple paragraphs (−0.4). Stock metaphors ("fragments falling like snowflakes," "echo of a life cut short") and elevated register ("coalescing into a being of light and shadow") that blur concrete action. Information density is low; many sentences restate mood without advancing situation. Clarity is maintained, preventing steeper penalties, but momentum drags.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The premise—survivor deciphering a digital ghost through ink patterns—combines elements but does not transform them into a fresh synthesis. The emotional arc (seeking understanding → finding peace) follows a predictable template without non-obvious turns. The ink-divination method and opal observatory setting are specific but ornamental; they could be replaced with other mystical means and locations without structural change. The final image (shard falling like snowflakes) echoes the opening snow motif but does not charge it with new meaning earned through conflict.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Akira ("death certificate error survivor") is the POV throughout, but the survival backstory is mentioned once and does not constrain or enable any on-page choice. Present in setup, absent in middle development, cameo in closure (releasing the shard) without causal force. Swappable with "ghost researcher" or similar role.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The porcelain shard is introduced early (clutched in hand, glowing), recurs mid-story ("seemed to glow with an intense light"), and is released at the end ("let the porcelain shard slip from her fingers"). Three touches across setup, middle, and closure, but its function is symbolic—no choice depends on it. The release feels like poetic gesture rather than a trade-off with cost. Reaches two-of-three gates (setup, payoff) with weak middle development; lyric reprise reweights slightly but lacks causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The digital ghost shapes the central quest (Akira seeks to understand it) and "takes shape" near the end, qualifying as functional. However, its mechanics are vague ("lingering presence in the digital realm," "fragmented code," "essence") and it does not constrain tactics—Akira's method (ink patterns) is stated but not shown to depend on the ghost's digital nature. Present in setup and closure, weak middle. Swappable with "spirit" or "phantom" without altering story logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Counts heartbeats constantly" is mentioned twice ("Her own heartbeats were a constant reminder," "Akira's heartbeats counted on") as thematic color but never constrains an action or imposes cost. No middle development. The trait could be removed without changing any beat. Label-only use trends low.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Defragment the digital ghost's essence" is stated once mid-story as an urge ("Akira felt an inexplicable urge to defragment") but is not dramatized as a distinct action with visible mechanics or consequence. The ink-pattern study may be the method, but "defragment" itself does not recur or drive a turn. Late first appearance (second third), no closure participation. Swappable with "decipher" or "decode."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Ephemeral patterns in spilled ink" is introduced mid-story when Akira pours ink and studies the patterns, and it recurs ("poured over the ink patterns") before the ghost coalesces. Two beats with weak causal linkage—patterns "revealed" connections and "glimpses of a forgotten truth" but the mechanics are abstract. Present in middle and closure (indirectly: the study leads to understanding), but the method itself is not charged or specified enough to feel irreplaceable. Missing early setup.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The opal observatory under snow is introduced in the opening and recurs throughout (window view, communications equipment, final dawn light). Three beats across setup, middle (radio static clears), and closure (bathed in dawn light). However, the setting does not constrain choice or alter tactics—Akira's actions could occur in any quiet refuge. The snow stops at the end without affecting the outcome. Atmospheric but functionally replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"After the radio static clears" is stated once mid-story ("The radio static... had finally cleared, and Akira felt a sense of liberation") but is not set up early or tied to a tightening choice. The timeframe does not impose urgency or shape tactics; night progresses to dawn without time pressure. Late appearance (second third), weak closure linkage. The clearing itself does not drive the resolution.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"To fetch wisdom from failure" is stated once mid-story ("her journey was not about uncovering the truth... but about fetching wisdom from the failure") as an assertion rather than a choice tested under friction. The motivation is present but told, not dramatized through conflicting wants or costs. Present in setup (seeking understanding) and middle (realization), weak closure participation (the wisdom is claimed but not shown to foreclose a path). No visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Midnight solace" recurs throughout ("sense of midnight solace," "midnight solace that soothed Akira's soul," "midnight solace that lay just beyond") and frames the emotional tone from opening to close. However, the tone is static—no modulation under pressure, no contrast that charges the final image. The repetition is thematic but does not deepen with cost. Present in setup, middle, and closure, but functions as label rather than lived pressure. Mid-band for consistency without escalation.</comment>
