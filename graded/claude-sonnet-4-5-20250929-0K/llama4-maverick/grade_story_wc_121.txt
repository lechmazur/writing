<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The protagonist remains an abstract archetype throughout—"gravity defier" functions as a label rather than a character with contradictory impulses or embodied emotion. Interiority consists of stock quest-narrative declarations ("determined to unravel its mysteries") without micro-choices under pressure. The journey through the labyrinth and encounter with "echoes of herself" are summarized rather than dramatized with visible cost, and no meaningful change or renunciation emerges from prior causality. Motivation is declared but never tested through conflicting wants.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) are delayed beyond 120 words and remain vague—"gravity defier" is a title without grounding, the viaduct's function is unclear, and the temporal frame "between the drop and the ripple" reads as metaphor without scene-level clarity. The piece attempts an accumulative/textural lens but delivers summary rather than pressure: "She confronted these echoes, integrating their experiences" tells transformation without showing a single dramatized encounter. Closure claims victory and transformation but no decisive choice, renunciation, or cost appears on the page—the world is simply "remade" by assertion in the final paragraphs. The inferred lens never coheres into clean causality or accumulative intensification.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The viaduct's glow and mist establish atmosphere but remain decorative—no choice hinges on the setting's physical properties. "Labyrinthine corridors of her own mind" suggests interiority rather than spatial choreography, and the procedural generation remains abstract without concrete constraints. Sensory detail is generic (wet earth, ozone, puddles) and not filtered through the protagonist's priorities. The setting does not constrain a choice or charge the final image, capping the score despite vivid adjectives.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"conquer the labyrinth of self"—is declared early but never tested through a choice that narrows options or exacts visible cost. The protagonist "overcomes" obstacles via "mastery of procedural generation" (told, not shown), and each reversal is resolved within its own sentence without escalation or trade-off. The ending announces victory and world transformation without a single dramatized decision or price. Coincidence does not resolve because agency never appears; the piece substitutes summary for pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Theme—conquering the labyrinth of self, fractured timelines unified—is stated rather than emergent from particulars. The ancient tablet's "secrets" and "otherworldly energy" remain abstract; no concrete image or action reweights prior material. The final paragraph delivers overt thematic summary: "she had conquered the labyrinth of self." Prompt labels ("darkening brightness," "periodically eternal existence") appear as unearned motifs without causal pressure or irony.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Third-person distant narration maintains stable POV but offers no perceptual signature or character-specific idiom—diction is uniformly elevated and generic ("ethereal glow," "foreboding atmosphere"). No dialogue appears to test voice distinction. The prose defaults to corporate-abstract register ("procedural generation," "integrating their experiences") that reads as prompt response rather than lived perspective. Free indirect style is absent; every sentence externalizes without interiority. Psychic distance remains static and remote throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade the text: "The viaduct's glow seemed to intensify" / "The viaduct's glow was fading now" / "The viaduct's glow was gone" mechanically tracks one image without propulsion. Synonym churn appears in adjacent lines: "misty veil… shrouded" / "heavy with scent" / "ethereal glow." Template cadence dominates with runs of identical stems: "She took… She closed… She stood… She smiled." Stock metaphors cluster without fresh specificity: "living things," "inner light," "otherworldly energy." Summary replaces scene in every pivotal beat, flattening momentum. Line-level artifacts touch the closure paragraph, disqualifying 9+ and applying the −1.7 deduction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The premise—internal journey as labyrinth, fractured timelines, self-integration—follows a standard hero's-journey template without transformation. Every element (glowing viaduct, ancient runes, echoes of self) reads as generic fantasy/metaphysical furniture assembled from prompt requirements. No turn feels inevitable in hindsight; the protagonist's "mastery of procedural generation" and final victory are asserted without groundwork. The story could swap names and setting without altering its emotional or structural arc, failing the transformation test.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Character appears in every paragraph but makes no on-page choice that alters tactics or narrows options—actions are summarized ("She confronted these echoes") without dramatization. Present throughout but ornamental to causality.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The tablet appears in paragraph 4, is mentioned as "guiding her" in paragraph 18, and is "silent now, its secrets revealed" in paragraph 24—three touches across setup, middle, and closure. However, it is never handled or used in a dramatized beat; all involvement is summary-only. Swappable with any mystical artifact.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>Fractured timelines are mentioned in paragraphs 5, 11, 17, and 23 but remain thematic decoration—no on-page choice hinges on their mechanics. The concept does not shape tactics or alter options; it functions as label-only exposition.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>"Periodically eternal existence" is mentioned in paragraph 3 as a feeling and returns as "a source of strength" in paragraph 21, but the attribute never constrains or enables a specific action with visible cost. Label-only use without mechanical integration.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Retrace the paths she had taken in previous iterations" (paragraph 6) frames the journey's method, and paragraph 11 states "she encountered echoes of herself," but no beat dramatizes the retracing action—it is summarized. Functional setup, swappable execution, no causal pressure at closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>Procedural generation appears in paragraph 8 ("began to generate a new path through the labyrinth using procedural generation") and paragraph 16 ("her mastery of procedural generation"). The method is named but its mechanics never matter—no choice shows how it works or fails. Summary-only, ornamental mention.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The glowing viaduct anchors paragraphs 1, 9, 19, 25, appearing at setup, middle, and closure. Its glow "intensifies" and "fades" to track progression, and the protagonist stands on it in the opening and closing frames. However, it never constrains a choice or supplies a resource—it remains atmospheric backdrop. Lyric reprise without causal pressure caps the score near the functional band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.4</grade><comment>"Between the drop and the ripple" (paragraph 10) is metaphorical rather than a tracked temporal constraint. No on-page clock tightens decisions or alters tactics; time remains vague and untethered throughout.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"To conquer the labyrinth of self" is stated in paragraph 7, repeated in paragraph 15, and declared achieved in paragraph 29. The desire frames the quest but is never dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost—told-only throughout, no friction between motivation and price.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Darkening brightness" appears in paragraphs 14, 22, 27, and 28, modulating from "tone of the world was shifting, darkening brightness" to the protagonist as "a figure of darkening brightness." The oxymoron creates a consistent atmospheric effect and returns at closure to charge the final image, but the tonal shift is asserted rather than embodied in rhythm or diction. Functional setup and closure reprise without deep integration into sentence-level pressure.</comment>
