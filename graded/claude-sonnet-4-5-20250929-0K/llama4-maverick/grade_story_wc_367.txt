<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The herald lacks genuine internal conflict or contradictory impulses; she performs ritualistic actions with unwavering certainty and "shadowed elation" throughout. Motivation remains abstract—"steer the dawn" through "ancient traditions"—without concrete stakes or visible cost that would foreclose a path. The character reads as a vessel for atmospheric description rather than an agent facing pressure; her laughter and purpose remain constant from first to last paragraph. No meaningful change, renunciation, or earned endurance appears on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: who she is, where precisely she stands, and what concrete problem the ritual solves remain vague past the 120-word mark, triggering the −0.3 to −0.5 penalty. The piece offers no causal linkage or motivated pressure—she ascends, adjusts the lantern, and the dawn arrives as declared, with coincidence (stars twinkling "in rhythm") replacing agency. No decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with visible cost occurs; the final paragraph loops back to "the cycle would continue" without reweighting prior material. The drive lens remains ambiguous (accumulative decoration vs. situational ritual), and closure does not land with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The emerald lighthouse and glass lantern anchor spatial and sensory detail throughout, and the setting's verticality (winding stairs, top platform) structures the ascent. However, the environment never constrains a choice or complicates tactics; it functions as a postcard backdrop for the ritual rather than a pressure source. The "total internal reflection" mechanic is named but not shown altering options or access. Sensory catalog (beam, shadows, stars, warm golden light) remains static across beats without POV-driven selection or stakes-driven evolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"steer the dawn"—is signaled early but remains abstract; no tightening, deepening, or reversal occurs because the ritual proceeds without opposition or cost. The herald's actions are uncontested, and the dawn arrives on schedule with no forfeited option or trade-off. Coincidence ("stars above twinkled in rhythm") decorates rather than complicates. No escalation under any lens: causal because/therefore is absent, accumulative density does not increase, and situational pressure never crystallizes a stance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme—ancient tradition vs. fleeting digital modernity—is asserted ("world after the last print newspaper") but never tested on the page; the contrast remains decorative rather than generative of conflict. The "Otherworldly routine" and "shadowed elation" are stated labels without specific embodiment or friction. The final image ("emerald lighthouse stood watch") offers no non-literal answer or reweighting; it loops to the opening without conceptual cost. Pseudo-profundity ("magic that lay just beyond the edge of the everyday world") substitutes for earned resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping, and the narrative voice sustains a consistent lyric-elevated register. However, diction drifts toward ornamental abstractions ("otherworldly energy," "coalescing into a new reality") that obscure concrete perception. Filter verbs ("felt," "knew," "believed") stack without urgency in several beats. The herald's perceptual signature is generic rather than character-specific; her way of noticing (stars, shadows, light) could belong to any ritual performer. Purposeful compression is not taught, so the lack of causal specificity reads as vagueness rather than lyric design.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "steer the dawn" and variants appear in seven paragraphs, often restating the same content without new detail. Template cadence dominates the final third with parallel "The [noun]" openers and "would [verb]" constructions. Stock metaphors ("beam slicing through," "shard of light," "fabric of the universe") cluster without fresh inflection. Sentence structures repeat: "As [clause], [main clause]" appears six times. Filter-verb stacks ("felt," "knew," "believed") dull immediacy in peak beats. The cumulative artifact load (loops, stems, metaphor cliché) triggers −0.8 to −1.2 and disallows 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The core premise—mystical lighthouse keeper steering dawn—closely matches template "magic ritual" plots without transformation through specific lived friction or non-obvious moral calculus. The "storm herald" title, glass lantern, and "total internal reflection" gesture toward specificity but remain ornamental; swapping them for candle and mirror would leave the emotional arc unchanged. No fresh inflection or risk-taking appears; the cycle structure and lyric tone follow familiar paths. The derivative premise and lack of transformation trigger −0.7 to −1.0 within Q8.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The laughing storm herald is present throughout and performs the ritual actions, but her choices do not create turns—she ascends, adjusts the lantern, and succeeds without opposition. Her laughter appears in two beats (opening approach, penultimate paragraph echo) but does not alter tactics or cost. She observes and enacts rather than deciding under pressure. Late penalty does not apply (present from the start), but ornamental use and lack of causal pressure cap the score low.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The glass lantern appears in the opening, ascent, adjustment beats, and final paragraphs—four touches across distinct beats. It is "carefully trimmed," "angled," and "dimmed," showing evolving state. However, it does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic under stress; the wick adjustment is declared to "bend the light" and "shape the dawn" without specific consequence or visible cost. Closure participation is ornamental (it "remained a symbol") rather than causally active. Present in setup, middle, and ending, but swappable with any ritual tool.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Otherworldly routine" is named three times and equated with "ancient traditions," but it never shapes on-page tactics or narrows options. The concept remains thematic decoration rather than a pressure source. No friction between routine and circumstance appears; the ritual proceeds uncontested. It echoes as a label without altering the herald's choices or the dawn's arrival.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Accidentally prophetic" appears once in paragraph 6 as a belief-label ("she believed her actions were") without constraining or enabling an on-page action. No trade-off, visible cost, or tactical consequence follows. It is told rather than dramatized and could be removed without affecting any beat.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Steer" and its variants ("steering," "steered") appear seven times across setup, middle, and closure, signaling the dominant action. However, no major turn traces to this action because the herald steers without opposition or complication. The dawn arrives as intended; nothing redefines options or forecloses a path. The action is central by repetition but static by effect—easily swappable with "guide" or "summon" with no structural change.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Total internal reflection" is named once in paragraph 9 as the method ("the secret...lay in the ancient art of") and once in paragraph 19 ("Through total internal reflection, the herald had harnessed"). It appears after the 40% mark and is never demonstrated or shown to matter; the mechanics do not shape attempts or alter tactics. Summary-only, late, and ornamental use cap the score below 3.0.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The emerald lighthouse under stars frames the opening, provides spatial structure (winding stairs, top platform), and anchors the closing image. It is present in setup, middle ascent, and final watch. The setting supplies a vertical stage and sensory particulars (beam, shadows, starlight) but does not pressure choices or supply resources that affect outcome. It shapes the ritual's location but not the herald's options or cost. Two-gate presence (setup, closure) with consistent causal involvement in the ascent earns mid-band, but lack of constraint or closure reweighting limits further rise.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"After the last print newspaper" appears once in paragraph 4 as background context; it does not tighten decisions, alter tactics, or create a live clock. The timeframe is told rather than shown to matter. No urgency or temporal constraint follows from this detail; the ritual's timing is governed by the stars and dawn, not the post-print condition.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"To shape a new dawn using ancient shadows" is signaled in paragraphs 5, 9, 13, 19, and 25, anchoring the dominant desire across setup, middle, and closure. However, the desire is asserted rather than dramatized in conflicted choices; the herald pursues it without friction, cost, or want-versus-fear tension. The motivation drives the ritual's occurrence but not its turns or trade-offs. Present in all three gates but told-only and unopposed.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Shadowed elation" is named once in paragraph 15 and echoed in "joyful...dark and luminous" and "laughter" in opening, middle, and closing beats. The tone remains static—mystical, celebratory—without modulation under pressure. No escalation or tonal shift charges the final image; the mood loops rather than evolves. Present and consistent but does not deepen or reweight stakes.</comment>
