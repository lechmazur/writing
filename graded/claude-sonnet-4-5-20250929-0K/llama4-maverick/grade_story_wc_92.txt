<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The sentinel is defined entirely by labels ("vigilant," "calmly inventive") rather than contradictory impulses dramatized in scene. Her motivations are declared ("spark a silent revolution") but never tested against a competing need or cost that would reveal character under pressure. The activation of the cradle and subsequent walk through the fort happen without visible hesitation, mistake, or forfeiture. Interiority consists of generic observations ("her mind began to wander") and summary rather than embodied, character-particular perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation is unclear past 120 words: who the sentinel is, what "cradle of sparks" concretely entails, and why a blackout matters remain vague throughout (−0.4). The closure—activating the artifact and spreading a message—occurs without on-page cost; the revolution succeeds in summary with no visible forfeiture, resistance, or price paid. The inferred lens wobbles between attempted Causal (blackout → action) and Accumulative (light imagery), but neither coheres because no meaningful tightening or trade-off occurs. The figure's message ("The time for silence is over") is received and acted upon instantly, flattening any potential turn.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The fort is anchored by twilight and blackout, and the sundial's shadow pattern provides one moment of spatial constraint that matters to the decoding beat. However, most setting detail is abstract ("luminous fort," "ancient structures," "ethereal light") without tactile specificity or POV filter. The blackout as timeframe pressure is declared but not felt; no fumbling, mis-steps, or resource limits emerge from the darkness. The cradle's glow is described but does not alter tactics or complicate movement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—guarding and then activating the cradle—is signaled early but never tested by a competing pressure or cost. The figure's arrival and message are accepted without suspicion, internal debate, or tactical adjustment. The "silent revolution" succeeds in summary across multiple paragraphs without on-page resistance, setback, or visible price. No reversal or deepening occurs; the sentinel's initial goal (guard the cradle) smoothly converts to a larger goal (spread the revolution) with no friction, and coincidence (the blackout as catalyst) enables rather than complicates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The theme of revolution and creative freedom is stated repeatedly ("silent revolution," "freedom and creativity," "challenge the status quo") rather than enacted through conflicting choices or images that reweight prior material. The bronze quill holder is introduced as a "tangible connection to whispers" but never returns with altered meaning or cost. The ending moralizes: "The darkness had been vanquished, and a new era had begun" without ambiguity or a non-literal final image. Motifs (light, sparks, whispers) are ornamental, not pressure-bearing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice defaults to distant, abstract diction ("ethereal light," "otherworldly glow," "rhythmic accompaniment") that does not reflect a character-particular perceptual signature. Psychic distance floats; the sentinel's interiority is sometimes close ("her mind began to wander") and sometimes narrated from outside ("she knew that she was not alone"). No dialogue appears, so subtext and character distinction cannot be assessed. Filter verbs and passive constructions ("was revealed to be," "it seemed") dull immediacy in peak beats without voice-motivated purpose.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops: "The darkness had been vanquished, and a new era had begun" echoes "The luminous fort at twilight was being reborn" and multiple restatements of revolution gaining momentum (−0.6). Template cadence dominates: "As she stood… As she watched… As the sentinel looked…" across adjacent paragraphs (−0.5). Stock metaphors cluster without earned resonance: "spreading like wildfire," "beacon of hope," "inky darkness." Sentence rhythm is uniform; nearly every complex action uses past-perfect or participle openers. Figurative language appears in most lines without variation or payoff, violating the overwriting density check (−0.4).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The premise—a blackout sparking a covert revolution via an ancient artifact—follows a familiar template (chosen-one guardian, mysterious gift, coded message, enlightenment object) without transformation through specific lived detail or moral calculus (−1.0 derivative premise adjustment). The sundial code and bronze quill are mentioned but remain generic MacGuffins. The revolution unfolds without friction, setback, or a non-obvious choice that would distinguish this telling. Emotional beats (pride, belonging, determination) are labeled rather than particularized.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The sentinel is named in the opening and appears throughout, but her choices (deciphering the message, activating the cradle) are frictionless acceptances rather than decisions that narrow options or impose cost. Setup and closure gates are met, but middle development is summary rather than on-page choice under pressure. Swappable with any guardian role.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>The bronze quill holder is introduced mid-story as a "gift from a mysterious stranger" and noted as "a key to unlocking the revolution" in hindsight, but it never appears in a second distinct beat or returns with reweighted meaning at closure. No middle development; no closure participation. Ornamental mention only.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The cradle of sparks is introduced early, guarded in the setup, decoded via message, activated at the turn, and glows through the ending. It shapes the central action (activation) and provides the revolution's symbolic center. However, its mechanics are vague, and activation occurs without cost or tactical friction. Present across beats but replaceable with any mystical artifact.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Calmly inventive" is a label applied twice ("calmly inventive mind quickly grasped the code," "ever watchful and calmly inventive") but never constrains or enables a choice with visible cost. No tradeoff between calm and urgency, or inventiveness versus caution, appears on the page. Label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>"Intrigue" is referenced once ("attempting to intrigue her with a complex message") but the method is decoding rather than intrigue as action. The sentinel does not intrigue anyone; she receives and decodes. The term is ornamental and does not drive a turn. Easily swappable with "communicate" or "signal."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The sundial method is introduced, described, and used to decode the message in one sustained beat. It shapes that middle action but does not return or alter later tactics. Setup and development gates met; no closure participation. Functional but not indispensable; the message could be conveyed by other means.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The luminous fort at twilight is anchored early and returned to in the final paragraphs. The blackout creates declared stakes but does not pressure movement or choices on the page. No micro-setting constraints (fumbling, resource limits) emerge. Postcard backdrop rather than tactical environment.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The blackout is introduced in the opening and persists until the cradle is activated. It declares urgency but does not tighten decisions or impose a live clock; the sentinel and accomplice move "through the fort" without time pressure or mishap. Setup and loose development present; closure participation is thematic (light returns) rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The motivation to spark a silent revolution is stated early, reiterated mid-story, and achieved in summary at the end. It is never conflicted or tested against a competing want or cost. The sentinel's commitment is told rather than dramatized through friction. Setup and closure gates met via summary; no on-page choice where revolution competes with safety or loyalty.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>"Winking hush" appears once as a phrase ("With a winking hush, she slipped into the shadows") but does not modulate across beats or charge the final image. The tone is earnest and declarative throughout, without ironic undertone or quiet subtext. Label-only; not woven into voice or closure.</comment>
