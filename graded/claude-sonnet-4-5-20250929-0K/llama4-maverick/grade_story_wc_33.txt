<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The mailman remains a cipher throughout; his "respectfully rebellious" trait is asserted but never dramatizes contradictory impulses in action. Motivation ("find where broken promises heal") is abstract and declared rather than embodied through micro-choices under pressure. The shadowy recipient offers no relationship crucible, and the protagonist's internal experience remains generic—no embodied emotion or character-particular perception that would distinguish this voice from placeholder prose. No meaningful change or renunciation with visible cost occurs on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: who, where, and when remain vague past 120 words (−0.4). The lens reads as attempted Causal but linkage is weak; the mailman's "linking absences" method is mentioned but never shown constraining a choice or altering tactics. The ending delivers the package without on-page cost or a decision that forecloses a path—he simply hands it over and feels "satisfaction," a summary emotion rather than a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration. No persistent constraint shapes the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The "cobalt arcade at twilight" recurs at opening and close but functions as postcard description rather than a spatial constraint that alters tactics. The thunderstorm bottle is handled twice (turn, hand over) but remains decorative—it does not guide choice or charge the closure image with environmental pressure. Spatial choreography (alleyway, border, drone positions) is legible but generic; no tool, body state, or micro-setting element narrows options at the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>One dominant stake (deliver package across border) is signaled early. Escalation is shallow: the drone pauses, the mailman crosses, no tightening or trade-off occurs. The handover lacks tension—no reversal, no visible price paid (stamina, social credit, tool loss) that alters later tactics. Coincidence (drone distraction) solves the border crossing rather than protagonist agency. No felt cost charges the final image.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Theme ("broken promises heal") is stated three times but never emerges from specific events or images. The ending moralizes overtly: "he had played a small part in unleashing a different kind of tempest—one of hope and redemption" is direct thesis rather than earned resonance (−0.7 in Q5 for final-paragraph sermonizing). The thunderstorm bottle is symbolic convenience introduced to harvest thematic points rather than constrain choice. No non-literal answer to a central question arises from particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable, but voice is generic and abstract—diction like "foster a sense of security," "narrative of redemption," "brittle hush" reads as elevated register disconnected from a mailman's plausible lexicon. Perceptual signature is absent; the narrator notices in tourist-catalog mode rather than through character-specific bias. Filter verbs ("seemed to grow," "seemed to reach") stack without voice motivation. No dialogue to assess. Template cadence and stock phrasing ("the weight of his task," "beacon of hope") flatten rhythm.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops across adjacent paragraphs: "foster a sense of security" and "foster a sense of connection" recycle stems without added pressure (−0.2). Stock metaphors ("beacon of hope," "way forward") and abstraction ("otherworldly energy," "larger narrative of redemption") pervade with no concrete anchoring. Runs of identical sentence openings ("The mailman," "As he") create template cadence (−0.5). Line-level artifacts touch the closure beat ("the cobalt arcade…seemed a little brighter"), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Core premise (mailman crosses drone border to deliver mysterious package) is a stock setup without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus (−0.8 derivative penalty). The "thunderstorm in a bottle" is quirky ornament rather than necessity. Turns arise from convenient timing (drone distraction) rather than character-driven synthesis. Emotional arc (vague longing for redemption → satisfied delivery) could transfer unchanged to a different setting with cosmetic edits, failing the transformation test.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Mailman present throughout but his choices are observation and compliance rather than key turns; the decision to cross is triggered by external coincidence (drone distraction) not internal conflict. No causal pressure from his agency reshapes tactics. Late appearance of motivation (second paragraph) and label-only trait ("respectfully rebellious") without friction. Swappable with "courier" or "messenger."</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Bottle appears in three beats (discovery, transit, handover) but remains decorative. It is described ("turned," "raged," "crescendo") without constraining choice or altering tactics. No reweighted meaning at closure—storm inside continues unchanged. Setup present, middle mention ornamental, closure cameo (not causally active). Cap 4.6 for late intro (past first third) and swappability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Border shapes the central obstacle and is present across beats (planning, crossing, handover). Drone surveillance creates one choice point (wait for distraction) but the concept does not evolve or force trade-offs. Early signal, middle involvement (one beat), closure participation (alleyway "in disputed territory"). Two-of-three gates met; causal pressure is modest (+0.4).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>"Respectfully rebellious" appears once as label in paragraph two, never dramatized through on-page action with cost. No visible tradeoff or constraint. Ornamental mention only. Missing middle and closure gates; cap 2.8 for no closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Foster" mentioned twice ("foster a sense of security," "foster a sense of connection") but the action itself is not shown—no on-page mechanics of how he builds that security or connection. Summary-only use (−0.3). Swappable with "create" or "maintain." Missing dramatized development; cap 3.4 for no middle beat involvement.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>"Linking absences" method is mentioned once in paragraph eight but its mechanics never matter—we do not see a pattern of non-deliveries or how it alters surveillance. Summary-only claim without causal work (−0.3). Missing setup, middle, and closure; cap 2.8 for no closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Arcade frames opening and closing with vivid color ("cobalt," "neon lights") but does not constrain choice or supply resources. Postcard description; the mailman's moves happen in streets and alleyways, not the arcade. Early signal, closure reprise, but no middle involvement; cap 4.6 for missing middle gate and ornamental use (−0.6).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Day's lone mail drop" mentioned once at opening, never tracked or referenced again. Time remains vague; no clock tightens decisions. Missing middle and closure gates; cap 2.8 for no closure participation. Ornamental phrase (−0.5).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Motivation stated in paragraph eleven ("find where broken promises heal") but never dramatized through conflicted choice or friction between want and cost. Told-only; no on-page struggle. Late first appearance (past 40%) caps at 4.6; summary use and swappability (generic redemption desire) lower further (−0.8 cumulative).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Brittle hush" appears twice (mid-story, near end) as atmospheric label but does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image. Static mood descriptor. Early signal (first third), closure mention, but no middle pressure work. Two-of-three gates allow ~6.0 ceiling; ornamental use and label-only treatment (−0.6) and no causal linkage lower to mid-4s.</comment>
