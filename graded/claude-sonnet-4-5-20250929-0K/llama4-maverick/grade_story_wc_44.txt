<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lyra remains abstract throughout—her "quietly deliberate" nature is told repeatedly but never constrains an on-page choice with visible cost. Interior life consists of generic scholar motivations ("insatiable curiosity," "sense of wonder") without contradictory impulses or embodied emotion. The final paragraph asserts excitement and purpose, but no micro-choice reveals a hierarchy of values under pressure. No meaningful change or credible endurance with felt cost appears on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The piece lacks a coherent closure unit with visible cost. Lyra moves from confusion to understanding entirely off-page ("Lyra finally understood"), then the story continues for many paragraphs of static summary without a decisive change, renunciation, or reconfiguration that alters options. The dominant lens is ambiguous—neither causal linkage nor accumulative density produces a legible before/after. Orientation is delayed until paragraph 4 with anchors scattered across early exposition. The Orientation Test penalty (−0.4) applies, triggering the Q3 cap at 7.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The nocturnal observatory and floating isle are named early but remain postcard descriptions that never constrain a choice or supply a resource affecting outcome. The wind and stars appear in static flourishes without altering tactics. Spatial choreography is minimal—Lyra moves to a workbench once, then all action dissolves into summary. The setting does not charge the final image, capping the category below 7.0 per the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"where shadows go at noon"—is declared but never tested on-page with a concrete reversal or tightening that narrows options. Lyra's research is summarized across vague "days" with no escalation, no live obstacle, and no visible price paid. The climactic "understanding" occurs off-stage in a single sentence, then deflates into static reflection. No agency choice forecloses a path with felt cost. Pressure remains flat throughout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Theme is asserted through repeated abstract labels—"sealed awakenings," "closing loops," "underlying order"—without emerging from concrete events or images. The clockwork key is called a "metaphor" rather than earning symbolic weight through specific action. The final paragraph delivers overt thematic summary ("mysteries that lay ahead") instead of a resonant image. No fresh inflection reweights prior material; the ending states a question rather than offering a non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The prose carries no perceptual signature—Lyra's way of noticing is generic across all beats ("eyes adjusted," "mind making connections"). Diction drifts into Wikipedia register ("insatiable curiosity," "sands of time," "vast expanse of the unknown") without character filter. Repeated template stems ("As the...," "The...was...," "Lyra's...") flatten rhythm. No purposeful compression or voice modulation under pressure. Filter verbs stack without motivating the distance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Pervasive paraphrase loops and synonym churn: paragraphs restate the same content across adjacent lines ("clockwork automaton key...a tool...a metaphor...a symbol...a constant reminder"). Template cadence runs dominate—nine consecutive paragraphs open with "Lyra" or "The" + noun + "was/had." Stock metaphors ("sands of time," "canvas," "diamonds in the sky") appear without fresh angle. Information density is low—most sentences summarize rather than advance. Applying the patterned-artifact penalty pack: baseline −1.2 for loops and stems touching multiple beats, escalated to −1.7 because artifacts appear in the final third. This disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The core premise—scholar researching ancient mysteries on a floating isle—is a widely used template without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. "Shadows at noon" is a striking image but remains ornamental; the story never explores its logic or cost. Turns are summary-only rather than earned in scene. The piece hedges toward median safety with no bold structural or perspectival risk. Derivative Premise Guardrail applies: −0.8 for template reliance without transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Lyra is present throughout and frames the story, but her choices never create key turns—all major beats are summarized rather than dramatized. Setup and closure gates are met (she appears first and last), but middle development consists of told research with no on-page decision that alters tactics. Ornamental use without action pressure. Late summary-only involvement and swappability (could be any scholar) limit the score. Starting at 3.0 default, +0.3 early signal, +0.4 one functional beat (workbench arrival), −0.5 ornamental summary, −0.8 swappability = 2.4.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The clockwork automaton key appears early (setup gate met) and returns in the final paragraph (closure gate met), but middle development is absent—it lies beside Lyra without being handled or used in distinct beats. The final mention is ornamental ("secure in her pocket") rather than causally active or reweighted. Two gates met allow eligibility up to ~6.0, but no causal pressure, no cost connection, and static description across all mentions keep the score low. Starting at 3.0, +0.3 early signal, +0.7 closure linkage (weak—cameo only), −0.5 ornamental, −0.4 swappability = 3.1, but the lyric reprise (first → last) without mid-use can reach ~6.0 per the allowance; here the reprise does not reweight the stake with undeniable cost, so 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.3</grade><comment>"Sealed awakenings" is named early and recurs, meeting setup and closure gates, but it never shapes stakes or tactics on the page—it remains a thematic label rather than a constraint or mechanic. Middle development is absent; the concept does not enable or narrow any choice. Starting at 3.0, +0.3 early signal, +0.4 one beat (introduction), −0.5 ornamental, −0.3 label-only theme claim, +0.4 closure mention (weak) = 3.3.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Quietly deliberate" is told three times but never constrains or enables an on-page action with visible cost—it remains a label without tradeoff. Setup gate met, but no middle development or closure participation. Starting at 3.0, +0.3 early signal, −0.3 label-only, −0.2 late payoff attempt (final third mention without cost) = 2.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>"Relearn" appears once in paragraph 8 as a declared task but is never dramatized—all actual research is summarized. No major turn traces to this action; it could be swapped for "study" or "decipher" with no structural impact. Setup gate is weak (second third introduction), middle development and closure participation are absent. Starting at 3.0, no positive signals strong enough to lift, −0.4 summary-only, −0.5 swappability, but floor holds at 3.0 for functional mention.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"By closing loops" is explained in paragraph 9 and mentioned again in paragraph 15, meeting setup but no middle development or closure participation—the method does not shape any attempt on the page. It remains conceptual without mechanics. Starting at 3.0, +0.3 early signal (weak—second third), −0.4 summary-only, −0.3 no middle use = 2.6.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The nocturnal observatory and floating isle are named early (setup gate met) and appear in the final third (closure gate weak—"edge of Zephyr's Reach"), but they never pressure choices or supply resources affecting outcome. Postcard description without tactical use. Starting at 3.0, +0.3 early signal, +0.4 one beat (initial descent), −0.5 ornamental, +0.3 closure mention (weak—scenic backdrop) = 3.5.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"After spoons bend reality" appears once in paragraph 10 as backstory context but does not tighten decisions or tactics—time remains vague throughout ("days passed," "night wore on"). The event is summary-only and does not create a live clock. Missing all three gates: late introduction (beyond first third), no middle development, no closure participation. Starting at 3.0, −0.6 late arrival, −0.8 summary-only, −0.4 swappability, floor near 1.8 for mention.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"To find where shadows go at noon" is signaled early (paragraph 12, setup gate met) and returns in the final third (closure gate met), but the desire is never dramatized in a conflicted choice—Lyra's work is frictionless summary. Middle development is absent; no cost or want-versus-fear tension appears on the page. Starting at 3.0, +0.3 early signal, +0.4 one beat (declaration), +0.7 closure linkage (weak—thought rather than action), −0.5 told-only, −0.6 no friction = 4.3.</comment>
