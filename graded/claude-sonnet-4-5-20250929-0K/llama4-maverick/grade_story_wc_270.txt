<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Akira's telepathic plant connection is mentioned repeatedly but never constrains a choice with visible cost; it remains ornamental. The protagonist's interior is delivered through abstract declarations ("fierce determination to evolve tradition with intent") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The final moment—unsealing the embryo and feeling destiny unfold—reads as wish-fulfillment without earned causality or foreclosed paths. Emotional progression is flat; triumph arrives without ambiguity or genuine struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The story lacks orientation anchors: who Akira is insurgent against, what reconstruction efforts mean, and why this artifact matters remain vague past 120 words, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). The closure—retrieving and unsealing the embryo—occurs without causal linkage to prior choices; the kite decoding and retrieval feel like sequential steps rather than because/therefore escalation. No visible cost accompanies the unsealing; the ending grants warmth, peace, and approval without sacrifice or forfeiture. The inferred lens (causal) is contradicted by the accumulative/descriptive drift in execution.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The volcanic hot springs provide atmospheric description (sulfur, steam, bubbling) but do not constrain Akira's actions or tactics. The kite and glowing orb are handled on the page, and the setting recurs in the final image, offering modest integration. Spatial choreography is vague—how the orb was in the spring, why the kite was there—but the sensory layer (primordial aroma, quivering leaves) anchors mood throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding the embryo—is signaled early but never tightens options or forces a trade-off. Akira encounters no opposition, miscalculation, or cost; each step (spotting the kite, decoding, retrieving the orb, unsealing) unfolds as smooth discovery. The plants' agitation and her telepathic surge are atmosphere, not pressure that narrows choices. No reversal or deepening occurs; the resolution is granted without protagonist sacrifice or error.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Theme is declared rather than dramatized: "evolve tradition with intent" and "implanted destiny" appear as labels without on-page friction. The embryo's golden light and the plants' chorus deliver symbolic convenience—triumph without complexity or cost. The final image offers affirmation ("not alone on this journey") instead of a resonant reconfiguration that reweights prior material. No moral ambiguity or earned insight; the piece resolves into a tidy affirmation of Akira's role.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present in the plant telepathy and descriptions filtered through Akira's insurgent lens. However, diction drifts into abstract elevation ("primordial aroma," "susurrus," "coherent narrative," "lotus blooming") that feels authorial rather than character-particular. The prose maintains a consistent distance and rhythm, but lacks the textured specificity that would distinguish Akira's voice under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "secrets she needed to uncover lay hidden here, waiting to be unearthed" echoes across beats. Template cadence appears in repeated "As she [verb]" openers and stacked filter verbs ("seemed to lean," "seemed to shimmer," "seemed to grow"). Figurative density in every sentence ("tendrils of consciousness," "lotus blooming," "ancient power") without pattern-teaching or payoff creates ornamental texture. The final third compounds these artifacts, triggering the global 9+ disallowance and reducing information density. Clarity remains intact, preventing deeper penalty routing to Q2.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The premise—telepathic grandmother seeks mystical artifact during reconstruction—assembles elements without fresh synthesis. The plant telepathy is mentioned but never creates tactical friction or moral cost. Turns are procedural (find kite, decode script, retrieve orb) rather than character-driven reversals. The ending affirms rather than complicates; no risk-taking heightens stakes. The piece reads as a fulfillment of prompt elements rather than an inevitable narrative with non-obvious integration.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Akira is present throughout but makes no decisions that alter tactics or foreclose options. Her "insurgent" label and "feisty" descriptor do not shape choices under pressure. The retrieval and unsealing proceed without opposition or cost tied to her character traits. Present in setup, middle, and ending, but her role is observer-executor rather than agent whose choices create turns.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The embryo in amber is set up as the goal, retrieved mid-story, and unsealed at closure with description of its glow and warmth. It appears in three beats (goal, retrieval, unsealing) and charges the final image. However, it does not constrain earlier choices or carry visible cost; the unsealing grants affirmation without sacrifice. The object drives the quest but lacks specificity that would make it irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Implanted destiny" is named on the page and appears in Akira's final reflection, but does not shape on-page tactics or create friction. The concept is told rather than dramatized through conflicting choices. It functions as thematic label, not a constraint that alters options or imposes cost. Present at closure but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The plant telepathy is mentioned in multiple beats (quivering leaves, whispers, surge, triumphant chorus) and described as helping decode the script. However, it never constrains a choice or imposes a visible cost. The trait is ornamental atmosphere; removing it would require only minor edits to the mood layer. Present throughout but does not enable or limit action with stakes.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Unseal" appears twice: unsealing the kite's message and unsealing the orb. The second instance is the closure action and releases the embryo's warmth. The action is present in setup (as goal) and payoff, shaping the ending image. However, the unsealing itself is smooth—no resistance, cost, or transformation beyond receiving warmth. It drives the ending but could be swapped for "open" or "activate" with minimal edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The kite with cryptic script is introduced mid-story, decoded in one beat, and enables the retrieval. The method is present in middle and contributes to the ending by unlocking the secret. However, the decoding itself is abstracted ("symbols aligning into a coherent narrative") without shown mechanics or cost. The kite is functional but its specific method—script on a tail—lacks irreplaceable integration; any cryptic clue could substitute.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The volcanic hot springs frame the entire story and provide the orb's hiding place, appearing in setup, middle, and closure. The setting offers sensory texture (sulfur, steam) and symbolic resonance (earth's ancient power). However, the springs do not constrain Akira's movement or choices; the orb's retrieval from the water is convenient rather than pressured. The setting is atmospheric but does not alter tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.6</grade><comment>"During the reconstruction" is mentioned in the opening and closing lines but does not tighten decisions or create a clock. The timeframe is backdrop, not a constraint that alters Akira's tactics or imposes urgency. No on-page pressure arises from the reconstruction context; the element is ornamental framing.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"To evolve tradition with intent" is stated as Akira's motivation and recurs in her final reflection. The desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicting choices or costs. No on-page friction shows tradition resisting evolution or intent requiring sacrifice. The motivation is thematic label, not a force that shapes tactics or the ending's stakes.</comment>
