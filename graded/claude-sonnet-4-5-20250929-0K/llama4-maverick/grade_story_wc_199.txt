<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The seed sorter remains fundamentally passive throughout, observing and feeling rather than making choices that alter her situation. Interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("mossy delight," "thrill," "wonder") without embodied contradiction or specific sensory grounding. The transformation is declared ("she would never be the same again") rather than earned through on-page renunciation or visible cost. No meaningful internal conflict or competing impulses act simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with lyric ambitions, but the piece never teaches a coherent pattern by the 25% mark; it drifts between vague prophecy-decoding and monument-building without clear escalation. Orientation anchors (who she is beyond "seed sorter," where the arbor exists in relation to anything) remain abstract past 120 words. The ending declares transformation and prophecy unlocked, but no on-page decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing occurs with visible cost—the speck glows, she smiles, she walks away. Cost proof test fails: I cannot point to a sentence where a choice forecloses a path or reweights prior material with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The arbor is described with vivid sensory detail (shimmering bark, otherworldly softness, misty clouds), but remains a static backdrop that does not constrain any choice or alter tactics. Spatial choreography is vague—she works "in" the arbor but her position, the layout of trees, and her physical interactions remain abstract. The moonstone speck and monuments are mentioned but never integrated into the environment as tools or obstacles. Setting does not charge the final image; it simply persists as atmosphere.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—decoding the message in falling leaves—is declared but never tested with a concrete obstacle, trade-off, or reversal. The seed sorter encounters no failure, resistance, or cost; she simply works, realizes, and succeeds off-page. The "prophecy of great change" is summarized rather than dramatized, and no on-page tightening forces a choice that narrows options. Pressure remains flat from beginning to end; escalation is absent under any lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Theme of transformation and forgotten knowledge is asserted repeatedly ("emerges transformed always," "hush where past meets prophecy") but never anchored in concrete particulars or specific experience. The ending offers no non-literal answer or resonant image; it states the lesson outright: "she had found a new sense of purpose" and "a deeper understanding of the magic." Thematic Echo penalty applies: the final paragraph articulates the thesis in prompt-like language rather than allowing scene pressure to generate meaning. No subtext or ambiguity remains; the piece telegraphs its own meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains a consistent lyric-fantasy register, but diction frequently drifts into abstraction ("eerie beauty," "otherworldly softness," "mossy delight") without character-specific perceptual signature. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance remains stable but lacks urgency modulation; the narrator's way of noticing does not shift under pressure because no pressure materializes. Reflection is continuous but does not anchor in present stimuli with micro-choices that alter tactics. POV remains clean with no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "the arbor was a place of eerie beauty" / "a mystical, otherworldly place"; "she would never be the same again" / "forever changed by the experience." Template cadence runs through multiple sentences: "As she [verb], the [noun] [verb]" appears six times. Stock metaphors cluster without fresh inflection: "whispered secret," "air of mystery," "fragile, fleeting thing." Figurative language appears in most sentences of key beats without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering density and coherence penalties. Information density is low; many sentences restate atmosphere without advancing situation or choice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The premise—magical arbor where past meets prophecy, protagonist decodes mystical messages—follows a well-worn fantasy template without transformation through specific world logic, occupational detail, or non-obvious moral calculus. The emotional arc (wonder → transformation) could transfer unchanged to any mystical-discovery story. No fresh inflection or turn grows from prior particulars; the prophecy and transformation are generic endpoints rather than earned outcomes. The piece hedges toward the safety middle, choosing median lyric-fantasy options without bold structural or perspectival risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The seed sorter observes, feels, and builds monuments, but makes no choices that create key turns or alter tactics. She is present throughout but passive; her decisions (reaching out to prod the speck, building a monument) do not narrow options or generate consequences. Late label: "orderly seed sorter" remains a title rather than a trait that constrains behavior. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The moonstone cabochon dust speck appears in three beats: she prods it (mid-story), builds a monument to it (late), and its glow fades at the end. However, its properties do not constrain her actions or enable tactics under pressure; it simply glows brighter, then fades. No cost is tied to the speck; it resolves no problem it helped create. Functional but replaceable with any glowing object.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Regional folklore is mentioned once ("According to regional folklore, the arbor was a nexus of ancient power") but never shapes stakes or alters on-page tactics. It remains thematic backdrop rather than a mechanic that changes options. The protagonist does not consult, resist, or leverage folklore; it exists only as atmosphere. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Emerges transformed always" is declared twice but never constrains or enables an on-page action with cost. The transformation is summary-only; no visible trade-off, forfeiture, or choice demonstrates the attribute in scene. Label-only trait, no dramatized pressure. Mentioned rather than integrated.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Prod" appears once when she prods the speck, causing it to glow brighter—a functional turn that changes the speck's state. However, the action does not redefine options or create a downstream consequence that shapes the ending. It enables one beat but remains swappable (she could have touched, tapped, or gazed at it with minor edits). Shapes one moment but does not drive closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Building tiny monuments to forgotten things" is signaled early ("she spent every spare moment building tiny monuments") and she builds one to the speck mid-story, but the method does not shape attempts or generate friction. The monuments exist as character flavor rather than a tactic that alters outcomes. Mechanics are not dramatized; we do not see how they function or cost her. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The ashen skyborne arbor is described throughout but never pressures choices or supplies resources that affect outcome. It drifts through clouds, contains shimmering trees, but remains postcard description. Spatial layout does not constrain movement; no object or environmental feature alters tactics. Present as atmosphere, not as active setting.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"The hush where past meets prophecy" is mentioned twice as thematic label but never tightens decisions or creates a live clock. Time remains vague and untracked; no urgency or deadline shapes tactics. The timeframe exists as concept rather than constraint. Ornamental use.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"To decode the message in falling leaves" is stated as her task and she works toward it throughout, but the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices. No friction appears between want and cost; she simply succeeds off-page. Desire is present but not tested. Functional but lacks pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Mossy delight" appears once as a label; the tone throughout reads as earnest lyric wonder without modulation under pressure. No tonal shift charges the final image; the mood remains static and declarative. Coherent but single-note, does not deepen or reweight at closure. Present as atmosphere, not as craft.</comment>
