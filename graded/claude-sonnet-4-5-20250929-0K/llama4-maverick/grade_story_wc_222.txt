<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Moonwhisper remains a cipher throughout—motivation is declared ("chivalrous," "sacredly playful") but never tested by contradictory impulses or visible cost. The mission succeeds without struggle or error; no flaws complicate the swap, no micro-choices reveal hierarchy of values. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("steeled themselves," "sense of pride") rather than embodied perception under pressure. The final "cautious abandon" is asserted but not dramatized in conflicting on-page choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as causal-aspirational but delivers summary transit: Moonwhisper moves through the spire, swaps pieces, and the sky corrects—all told in past-progressive gloss without a single reversal or complication. The chess-swap itself is summarized ("carefully selecting those that held the secrets") rather than dramatized with friction or cost. Closure is a Decisive Change (sky restored) but the cost is absent on the page; success arrives unearned, and no prior constraint or price shapes the final image. Orientation anchors are present early, preventing deeper penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The icebound spire is visually evocative (crystalline structure, ice tunnels, star-essence board) but functions as postcard backdrop—no environmental detail constrains a choice or alters tactics. The pocket sundial lid is described twice but never handled or used as a tool under pressure. Spatial choreography is clear but static; the setting does not resist, complicate, or charge the closure moment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake (restore celestial balance) is signaled early but never tested—Moonwhisper encounters no opposition, makes no trade-offs, and the swap succeeds on first attempt. No on-page reversal or tightening narrows options; "treacherous ice tunnels" are traversed without incident. Agency is present in the decision to proceed, but the resolution is frictionless and the cost invisible, failing escalation under any lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Theme (wonder, playful engagement with mystery) is present but arrives through assertion rather than earned realization. The pocket sundial and chess pieces gesture toward celestial harmony, yet neither motif constrains choice or reweights meaning at closure. The final paragraph moralizes ("truly become an apprentice of wonder") instead of letting the image resonate, and "sacredly playful" is claimed without on-page friction between reverence and risk.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and distance control is consistent. Diction occasionally inflates ("cautious abandon," "sacredly playful") without grounding in concrete perception, and several beats recycle stems ("As they…" opens five sentences). Perceptual signature is generic rather than character-specific; Moonwhisper's noticing does not reflect apprentice training or thief tactics. No dialogue appears, so subtext and voice distinction tests do not apply.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Prose is clean and grammatical but suffers from paraphrase loops and template cadence: "As they gazed… Moonwhisper's thoughts turned…" / "As they ventured… the air grew…" / "As the last piece… a shiver ran…" / "As they made… the icebound crystals…" Pattern persists across seven beats without variation, triggering −0.6 for template-stem runs. Figurative language is frequent but generic (swirling mists, golden light, endless canvas) and the climactic swap is told rather than shown. Information density is low; many sentences restate without advancing pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Core premise (fix cosmic balance by swapping mystic chess pieces) follows a stock quest template without transformation. "Chivalrous thief" and "apprentice of wonder" are labels applied but not made specific through dialect, flaw, or worldview; the character could be swapped into any chosen-one framework. The celestial chess mechanic is introduced and resolved in summary without exploring its logic or cost, and the phrase "sacredly playful" reads as prompt echo rather than earned idiom.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Moonwhisper is present throughout but makes no on-page choice that creates a turn—the decision to proceed is declared in paragraph twelve, and the swap executes without complication. "Chivalrous thief" is a label; no theft or moral calculus appears. The character observes, travels, and succeeds, but does not alter tactics or forfeit an option with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The pocket sundial lid appears twice: first as description (paragraph ten) and again in paragraph twenty-seven as a symbolic glow. It is never handled, consulted, or used to solve a problem. The lid does not constrain a choice or change meaning at closure; its "inner light" in the penultimate beat is ornamental rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Apprentice of wonder" is claimed three times (paragraphs three, twenty-six, twenty-seven) but does not shape stakes or tactics on the page. The concept functions as thematic dressing rather than a constraint or enabler; no scene tests what "wonder" costs or how apprenticeship limits ability. It is told, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Sacredly playful" appears twice (paragraphs four and twenty-nine) as an abstract attribute without on-page action showing the tension between reverence and risk. No beat demonstrates playfulness constraining or enabling a choice, and no cost is tied to the trait. It remains label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Amend" (paragraph six) frames the mission and the swap does restore the sky, creating a causal link to closure. However, the action itself is summarized rather than dramatized—no step-by-step mechanics, no error, no trade-off. The verb shapes the macro-arc but does not redefine options within scenes; with minor edits, "repair" or "correct" would serve identically.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The method (swapping hand-carved chess pieces with secrets) is signaled in paragraph eight and enacted in paragraphs sixteen–eighteen, shaping two beats. Yet the swap is summarized ("carefully selecting those that held the secrets") without showing which pieces, what secrets, or what choice governed selection. The mechanics do not constrain Moonwhisper's attempt or charge the closure; the pieces function as a magic button rather than a process with friction.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The icebound spire is introduced in paragraph one and remains present through the final paragraph, anchoring spatial continuity across the arc. Visual details (crystalline structure, ice tunnels, crystal chamber, singing crystals) create atmosphere but do not alter tactics—no environmental obstacle complicates the mission, and the spire's properties (ozone, otherworldly energy) are described rather than leveraged. The setting participates in two beats (entry and exit) and reappears at closure, meeting two gates and earning mid-band placement, but it does not constrain choice or supply a resource that shifts outcome.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"When the sky is wrong" (paragraph seven) establishes urgency and recurs as the problem Moonwhisper solves, but no ticking clock or time pressure appears on the page. The timeframe is conceptual rather than tactical; Moonwhisper proceeds without haste, and the narrative does not track elapsed time or a deadline. Present in setup and closure but absent from middle development.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Embrace the unknown with open arms" (paragraph twelve) is stated once as summary rather than dramatized through conflicting desires. Moonwhisper's mission is clear and the path unobstructed; no scene shows the friction between curiosity and caution, or between embracing mystery and needing control. The motivation is told, not tested.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Cautious abandon" appears in paragraphs fourteen and twenty-eight, framing the arc, but the tone itself is static—sentences maintain the same elevated, declarative rhythm throughout, with no modulation under pressure. The oxymoron is asserted rather than embodied in diction or syntax that shifts between restraint and freedom. Present at setup and closure but not charged by the intervening beats.</comment>
