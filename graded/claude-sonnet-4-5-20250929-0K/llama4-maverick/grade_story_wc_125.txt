<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The poet remains observationally passive throughout; her "ethically playful grin" and stone-patterning are described but never constrain a choice or create visible friction. Internal life consists entirely of abstract contemplation ("texture of time," "swirling complexities") without embodied contradiction or micro-decisions under pressure. The rope token is handled once and never again, and the final departure carries no felt cost—she simply walks away unchanged. No trajectory from opening to closure; the character observes and muses without agency.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Drive lens appears Accumulative/Textural, but no meaningful tightening or cadence shift occurs; the poet arranges stones, reflects on humanity's choices, feels wonder, and leaves—each beat restates mood without narrowing options or raising cost. Orientation is delayed (who she is, why this night, what changed) and the "energy beings" arrive as vague backdrop with no causal work. Closure reads as summary ("she would continue to pattern") rather than a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing; no visible price is paid and no prior material is reweighted. The Orientation Test penalty applies (−0.4) and closure cost is absent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The terra-cotta grotto under starlight is described vividly and consistently, with tactile detail (rough stone, rust-red rocks, flickering light). However, setting remains postcard: it does not constrain a choice, supply a needed resource, or evolve causally with events. The stones she patterns could be anywhere; spatial choreography is coherent but inert. The environment does not charge the final image or alter tactics, capping the score in mid-band despite the sensory specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("impossible choices" facing humanity) is declared but never tested on the page through the poet's agency. She patterns stones and reflects, but no reversal narrows her options, no tightening forces a trade-off, and no visible price is paid. Escalation is absent; the night "wears on" and she "steps back" with "deep understanding" awarded off-page. The energy beings complicate nothing; coincidence does not even appear. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen via pattern break or cadence shift—none occurs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Impossible choices," "texture of time," and the rope as symbol are stated repeatedly in near-identical phrasing rather than emerging from action. The final paragraph moralizes ("the art of living was a never-ending pattern") and summarizes theme instead of trusting the image. Subtext is replaced by direct declaration ("forcing humanity to confront the impossible choices"). The core concept integrates as ornament rather than dramatized pressure, and the ending explains rather than resonates.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is present (the poet notices texture, undulations, vibrations) and register is consistent, but diction repeats syntactic templates: "The poet's X was…," "As she Y…," "With Z…" across a dozen lines. No dialogue. Psychic distance is stable third-limited, but the voice lacks sentence-level variety and the closing paragraphs loop ("uncovering layers, revealing truths, discovering the texture of time") three times. Purposeful compression is not taught; repetition reads as scaffold rather than pattern.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops dominate: "uncovering layers, revealing truths, discovering the texture of time" appears verbatim in paragraphs 9, 27, and 28; "impossible choices" in 11, 15, and 22; "patterns" and "texture of time" churn through synonyms without advancing pressure. Template cadence ("As she X, she Y") spans lines 7–9, 12, 19–20, 24. Figurative language ("passionate subtlety," "complex weave," "canvas waiting to be filled") is generic and stacked without earned payoff. Filter verbs ("seemed to," "felt the") cluster in high-frequency without voice motivation. Apply −1.4 cumulative for loops, template runs, and stock metaphor strings.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Core premise (solitary artist contemplates cosmic change in a mystical location) and execution (patterning stones, epiphany at dawn, walking away renewed) follow a well-worn template without transformation. "Energy beings" and "impossible choices" are prompt labels rather than lived specifics. The rope, grotto, and stone-patterning could be swapped for other tokens with no structural change. No risk-taking or non-obvious synthesis; emotional specificity is absent. The piece hedges into abstraction ("texture of time," "passionate subtlety") rather than committing to concrete stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>The drifting roadside poet is named early and appears in every beat, but her choices are limited to arranging stones and walking away—neither alters tactics or forecloses options. She observes, reflects, and departs unchanged. No decision under pressure; observation dominates. Present throughout but ornamental to causality.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The frayed coil of rope appears once (paragraph 4: "her hand closed around") and is invoked symbolically in paragraph 22 ("once a simple token, had become a symbol"). Two mentions, but no handling in distinct beats, no evolving use, and no causal work. It does not constrain a choice or charge the closure image beyond metaphor. Swappable with any other token. Functional but replaceable, capped by minimal development.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Impossible choices" is stated in paragraphs 11, 15, and 24 as thematic label but never dramatized through on-page dilemma or trade-off. The poet does not face a choice, nor does the concept narrow her options. It echoes as backdrop without shaping stakes or tactics. Present as theme claim, absent as plot pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>"Ethically playful" appears once (paragraph 7: "With an ethically playful grin") as a descriptor attached to stone-patterning. No on-page action demonstrates ethical dimension or playfulness; no cost or tradeoff tied to this trait. Label-only, no causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Pattern" (verb and noun) recurs in paragraphs 7, 12, 16, 20, 21, 27, 28—setup, middle development, and closure all invoke it. The poet patterns stones, the patterns "grow more intricate," and she vows to continue patterning. However, patterning does not drive a turn or foreclose an option; it is the activity, not the lever. Swappable with "sketch," "arrange," or "compose" with minor edits. Functional across beats but lacks irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Uncovering layers" is stated as method in paragraph 9 ("she uncovered layers of meaning"), invoked in 14 ("each new layer uncovered"), and repeated in the final paragraphs (27, 28). The mechanics are asserted, not shown—no distinct beats dramatize discovery through excavation. Summary-only use; the method is told rather than enacted with visible steps or cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The terra-cotta grotto under starlight is anchored early (paragraph 1), described with sensory detail throughout, and invoked in the closing image (paragraph 28: "the grotto was left alone"). It provides the spatial frame for all action and the stones she patterns are grotto elements. However, it does not constrain a choice, supply a needed resource, or evolve causally—postcard use. Present in setup, middle, and payoff; causal pressure absent. Fits the two-gate allowance for ~6.0 but lacks the tactical constraint needed for higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.2</grade><comment>"After the energy beings arrive" is mentioned in paragraph 6 and invoked in paragraph 15 as timeframe backdrop, but the beings exert no pressure, impose no deadline, and do not tighten decisions. Time passes ("as the night wore on," "first light of dawn") without urgency. The timeframe is present but inert; it does not alter tactics or stakes.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"To discover the texture of time" is stated as motivation in paragraph 10, repeated in paragraphs 14, 18, 23, 24, 27, 28. Told extensively but never dramatized through friction, cost, or conflicting want. The poet pursues this desire without obstacle or trade-off; no choice tests her commitment. Summary-only use, no on-page conflict tied to this motivation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Passionate subtlety" is invoked in paragraphs 19 and 26 as a descriptor of feeling. Tone remains contemplative and elevated throughout, with no modulation under pressure (there is no pressure). The phrase appears late (second half) and does not shape a key turn. Coherent mood but static; one functional mention in the ending contributes to the final affect but without causal charge. Lyric reprise lifts it slightly above ornamental.</comment>
