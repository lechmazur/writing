<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The bellhop's interiority is largely abstract and label-heavy ("unpardonable silence," "frostbitten hope") rather than embodied through contradiction or micro-choices. The figure who tightens the piano bench bolt appears without backstory or motive, never establishing a relationship crucible. The reflective mode dominates (~60% of text) but rarely anchors in concrete present stimuli that alter immediate tactics; most reflection summarizes the bellhop's burden rather than dramatizing a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. The final "sense of peace" reads as an asserted epiphany rather than one earned through on-page struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test: who, where, and when are present by the opening paragraph (waive penalty). Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (stillness, silence, recurring "frostbitten hope"), but the piece never tightens or reweights the dominant stake through a pattern break or cadence shift with legible cost. The ending asserts "a sense of peace" and "the right decision" without a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing visible on the page—no before/after is dramatized, only declared. The Cost Proof Test fails: no sentence in the closure unit makes cost legible; the bellhop's "strength" is told, not shown through forfeiture or crystallized poise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The cobalt fortress, snow, and dusty spiral staircase are vividly sketched and recur throughout, lending atmospheric coherence. However, they remain largely ornamental: no environmental feature constrains a choice or alters the bellhop's tactics. The piano bench bolt is handled once by the figure but does not reappear or charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean (staircase, bottom, shadows), but the micro-setting does not pressure the protagonist's stance or participate in closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("to understand the cost of safety") is signaled early but remains abstract and un-tested on the page. No on-page reversal or tightening narrows options: the bellhop stands watch, sees a figure tighten a bolt, then returns to contemplation without a choice that forecloses a path. The figure's appearance could serve as pressure but dissolves without consequence. Escalation under the inferred Accumulative lens requires density increase or pattern break; instead, the text loops similar reflections ("silence," "cost," "strength") without reweighting stakes or crystallizing a final stance with visible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The theme of silence as both burden and strength emerges from recurring images (fortress, snow, discoloration, "frostbitten hope"), and the piece resists overt moralizing in most paragraphs. However, the final third slides into thematic summary: "they came to see that it was not just a price paid, but a choice made" and "their silence a reminder of the strength that lay within" are direct thesis statements rather than resonant images. The closing lines ("testament to their resolve," "tale of resilience") read as meta-commentary that replaces scene pressure with authorial voice, triggering the Thematic Echo penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited on the bellhop throughout, with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is thin: the bellhop's interiority consists largely of abstract rumination rather than character-specific noticing shaped by occupation or backstory. Diction is elevated and consistent but occasionally drifts into stock phrasing ("seraphically mundane," "heavy blanket that suffocated the air") without clear voice motivation. The figure's appearance and action (tightening the bolt) are narrated without dialogue, maintaining distance control. No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "silence" recurs in near-synonymous constructions across a dozen lines without added pressure; "cost of safety" and "frostbitten hope" are repeated formulaically. Template cadence runs appear in the final third: "They thought about… And they wondered… The bellhop's gaze fell… As the hours ticked by…" four consecutive paragraph openings follow similar stems. Stock metaphors ("heavy blanket that suffocated," "spark of connection," "monument to the power of silence") cluster without fresh embodiment. Filter-verb stacks ("felt the weight," "wondered about," "saw the discoloration") dull immediacy in high-reflection beats. Applying the Text Artifact Screen: baseline −1.0 for loops/stems, −0.4 for stock strings, total −1.4 in Q7; the artifacts touch the closure beat, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The premise—silent monastic bellhop contemplating the price of vows—reads as a familiar template (monastic renunciation, fortress/watch symbolism) without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The piano bench bolt and "nerve regeneration" gestures feel ornamental rather than integrated into character motive or world logic. No bold structural or perspectival choices heighten stakes; the piece follows a meditative-stasis arc common to literary exercises. "Frostbitten hope" as a coined phrase offers a fresh tonal label but does not anchor a memorable turn or specific synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The silent-choir bellhop is present throughout and focalizes all beats. Setup: immediate. Development: the bellhop watches the figure tighten the bolt but makes no choice that alters tactics. Payoff: the bellhop "remained at their post" without a decision that reweights closure. The character observes and reflects but does not create a key turn through agency. Swappability: moderate; the role could be "monk" or "guard" with minor edits. No visible cost tied to the bellhop's identity. Band guidance: functional, one mention across beats, no causal pressure at closure. 3.0 baseline + 0.3 early + 0.4 one beat + 0.1 closure mention (passive) = 3.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Setup: the piano bench bolt appears in the middle section when the figure tightens it. Development: the action is described once; the bolt does not constrain or enable a later choice. Payoff: absent—the bolt does not reappear or shape the final image. Gate check: setup late (~50%), development single mention, no closure participation; missing closure cap = 2.8. Swappability high (could be "door hinge" or "window latch"). Ornamental use: the task is called "mundane" and disconnected from the bellhop's stake. 3.0 baseline − 0.3 late first appearance − 0.3 ornamental = 2.4.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Setup: "unpardonable silence" is named in the opening third and recurs thematically. Development: the concept is invoked repeatedly in reflection but does not constrain an on-page choice or alter tactics. Payoff: the final paragraphs declare that silence is "no longer oppressive" and "a reminder of their strength," but this is told rather than demonstrated through a decision with cost. Gate check: setup present, development label-only, closure participation thematic echo only. Swappability moderate (could be "sacred vow" or "enforced muteness"). 3.0 baseline + 0.5 early + 0.4 one beat (theme) + 0.3 closure mention (told) = 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>Setup: "seraphically mundane" appears in the opening sentence. Development: the attribute is never operationalized—no action is enabled or constrained by being both serene and ordinary. Payoff: absent; the trait does not reappear or charge the final image. Gate check: setup present, development absent (label-only), closure absent; missing development cap = 3.4. Ornamental label without tradeoff. 3.0 baseline + 0.3 early − 0.5 ornamental − 0.7 label-only = 2.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setup: "remain at their post" is stated in the opening third and restated at closure. Development: the action is the bellhop's primary stance but does not involve a choice that alters tactics—remaining is static endurance without visible cost or forfeited alternative dramatized on the page. Payoff: the final line repeats "remained at their post, a silent guardian," but no turn traces to this action. Gate check: all three present. Swappability moderate (could be "keep vigil" or "stand watch"). Causal pressure weak; no options narrowed. 3.0 baseline + 0.5 early + 0.9 two beats + 0.7 closure linkage + 0.7 specificity (action is named exactly) = 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>Setup: "the slightest discoloration on the step" appears in the opening third. Development: the bellhop's gaze falls on it once and it is described as a guide others have taken, but the discoloration does not constrain a choice or shape an attempt. Payoff: it reappears in a brief reprise ("their guide") but does not charge the final image or alter the bellhop's stance. Gate check: setup present, development single mention (ornamental), closure lyric reprise only; lyric allowance 5.5–6.3 range. Swappability high. 3.0 baseline + 0.5 early + 0.4 one beat + 0.3 closure mention (ornamental) − 0.5 ornamental = 2.7.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Setup: "cobalt fortress under snow" is named in the opening sentence. Development: the fortress recurs as atmospheric backdrop but does not pressure a choice—no access, proximity, or resource constraint alters the bellhop's tactics. Payoff: the final paragraph declares it "a testament to their resolve," a thematic claim rather than a causal constraint. Gate check: setup present, development descriptive only, closure thematic mention; missing causal development cap ~4.6. Postcard description without micro-setting pressure. 3.0 baseline + 0.5 early + 0.4 one beat + 0.3 closure mention − 0.3 ornamental = 3.9; round up slightly for atmospheric coherence across beats = 4.9.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Setup: "nerve regeneration" is mentioned in the opening third and at closure. Development: the timeframe is described as "slow" but does not tighten decisions or impose a live clock—no deadline or visible progression alters the bellhop's tactics. Payoff: the ending notes "with each passing day, the bellhop felt a sense of renewal," but this is asserted recovery without cost or tactic shift. Gate check: setup present, development vague (no tracking), closure mention thematic only. Time does not constrain. 3.0 baseline + 0.5 early + 0.4 one beat + 0.3 closure mention − 0.6 vague/untracked = 3.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Setup: "to understand the cost of safety" is stated in the opening third. Development: the bellhop reflects on this question repeatedly but never dramatizes a choice where safety and cost pull in opposite directions with visible friction. Payoff: the final paragraphs tell us "they came to see that it was not just a price paid, but a choice made," an asserted insight rather than a decision with felt trade-off. Gate check: setup present, development reflection-only (told), closure participation thematic summary. Swappability moderate. Told-only friction. 3.0 baseline + 0.5 early + 0.9 two beats (theme) + 0.7 closure linkage − 0.8 told-only − 0.5 swappable = 3.8; round up slightly for centrality = 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Setup: "frostbitten hope" appears in the opening third. Development: the tone is coherent—stillness, snow, silence, and muted yearning—but does not modulate with pressure; the piece maintains a static meditative register throughout. Payoff: "frostbitten hope" recurs in the final third and charges the closing mood, though the final image ("silent guardian") dilutes it with martial stoicism. Gate check: all three present. Tone is coherent but static; no cadence shift under stress. 3.0 baseline + 0.5 early + 0.9 two beats + 0.7 closure linkage + 0.3 coherence − 0.1 static (no modulation) = 5.3.</comment>
