<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The scavenger remains abstract throughout—"chronologically confused," "worn by time"—without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. Interiority consists of therapeutic self-diagnosis ("negotiate with their own ghost," "eroded ambitions") rather than dramatized pressure. The final camera-click reads as a symbolic gesture without visible cost that forecloses a path. Motivation is declared but never tested by competing wants or stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed and vague: "kinetic lagoon above the clouds" offers no spatial anchors by ~120 words, and the scavenger's immediate goal remains unclear until midpoint (−0.4). No causal chain links the carousel's halt to the scavenger's collection task; the piece summarizes a completed action ("had begun their peculiar task") rather than dramatizing a tightening choice. The camera-click at the end is a symbolic resolution without on-page cost or change in options. The drive lens appears Accumulative, but no density increase or pattern break reweights the stake—only repetition of "fragments" and "stillness."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The lagoon is vivid in palette ("blues and whites mirrored") but remains a postcard without spatial constraints—no distance, access, or physicality that shapes the scavenger's path. The camera wheel clicks and whirrs but never constrains a choice. Sensory detail is visual-only and static; "fractured stillness" is asserted repeatedly without modulation. The final photograph charges the closure image slightly, lifting the score into mid-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"reconcile the eroded ambitions"—is declared but never dramatized as a choice with competing options. No reversal or tightening occurs; the scavenger walks, collects, and clicks without obstacle or cost. The carousel's halt is backstory, not present pressure. Agency is observation, not decision; the act of photographing is symbolic closure without visible tradeoff or consequence that narrows future options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Eroded ambitions" and "negotiate with one's own ghost" are stated as theme rather than emerging from specific events. The camera wheel returns at the end with symbolic charge ("newfound significance"), lifting the score slightly. However, the final lines over-articulate meaning: "a testament to the power of stillness," "the enduring power of human connection"—thesis statements that replace earned resonance. The piece invites reflection but through assertion, not image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Narrative distance is stable, but the voice is generic literary register without perceptual signature—"palpable mist," "testament to," "enduring power" recur as stock elevated diction. No distinct rhythm or syntax reflects the scavenger's mind under pressure. Psychic distance remains uniform; the prose does not modulate with emotional intensity. Filter verbs ("seemed to pulse," "seemed to seep") dull immediacy without voice motivation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "fragments of overheard stories, whispers of what could have been, and snippets of conversations" restates one idea across three phrases; "negotiate with their own ghost, to reconcile the eroded ambitions" recurs verbatim multiple times. Template cadence: "They had once been... They heard tales of... They stood there..." runs across five paragraphs. Stock metaphors: "fire that had burned brightly," "embers were all that remained," "shroud." These artifacts touch the closure beat ("In that moment, they were negotiating..."), triggering −1.7 baseline and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact cap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The premise—solitary scavenger in surreal landscape collecting story fragments—follows a well-worn template (post-apocalyptic loner, symbolic quest for meaning). "Kinetic lagoon above the clouds" and "disposable camera wheel" offer surface novelty but function as ornament; the emotional arc (regret → symbolic closure) could transfer unchanged to any setting. No transformation of trope through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The piece plays safe in the median, avoiding risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Present throughout but choices are observational—walking, scanning, clutching—without altering tactics. The camera-click at the end is symbolic, not a decision that forecloses a path with cost. Swappable with "wanderer" or "seeker" with minimal edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Appears in three beats: clutched mid-story, described as "tangible connection," then raised and clicked at closure. The click charges the final image slightly, but the wheel's mechanics never constrain a choice or enable a tactic under pressure. Functional but somewhat replaceable with another relic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Mentioned twice ("eroded ambitions that had brought them," "reconciling the eroded ambitions") as thematic label without shaping on-page choices or tactics. Does not narrow options or alter stakes; ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Chronologically confused" appears once in paragraph two as descriptor without constraining action or enabling tradeoff. No visible cost or tactic linked to this trait; label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Regret hung in the air" is asserted mid-story but not dramatized as a choice or reversal. It does not create a turn or redefine options; easily swappable with "nostalgia" or "longing" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Signaled early ("collecting fragments of overheard stories") and recurs in middle development ("gathered more snippets"), but the mechanics never matter—no overheard story changes the scavenger's path. Summary-only: "They heard tales of love and loss" without dramatized overhearing. Present in closure ("weave the stories together") but passive. Functional, mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Described vividly but does not pressure choices or supply resources. The lagoon is backdrop; spatial choreography is absent (no distances, obstacles, or access constraints). Static postcard description without causal role.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"After the carousel halts" frames the opening but does not tighten tactics or create urgency. No live clock; the halt is backstory condition, not present pressure. Mentioned again at closure as thematic echo without cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Stated twice ("negotiate with their own ghost") as motivation but never dramatized as conflicted choice. No friction between want and cost on the page; told-only. The camera-click is symbolic enactment without visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Fractured stillness" appears in opening and closing lines, framing the piece and charging the final image. Tone is coherent but static—no modulation with pressure. The reprise reweights the dominant stake slightly, lifting into mid-band under the lyric-resonance allowance.</comment>
