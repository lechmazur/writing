<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The veiled dreamer remains an abstract cipher throughout—no contradictory impulses, no embodied emotion under pressure, only reverential questing. Interiority consists of generic labels ("intensity that bordered on reverence," "newfound understanding") rather than character-particular thought. The final "forever changed" declaration is unearned; no visible cost forecloses a path, and no micro-choice reveals a hierarchy of values. The watch and journal are handled, but the dreamer's agency never crystallizes into a decision that narrows options.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (veiled dreamer, glowing library, mist-shrouded city) arrive early. The piece gestures toward accumulative design—dreamer seeks library, finds book/watch, documents patterns, steps through doorway—but no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; each beat is additive rather than transformative. The closure ("library of unspoken words was not a destination, but a state of being") asserts a Conceptual Repricing without legible cost: the dreamer smiles, carries secrets, and continues the cycle with no visible price paid or path foreclosed. Under an accumulative lens, the final image should reweight prior material; here it merely restates the premise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Mist, glowing shelves, worn leather, and the watch's intricate mechanisms provide vivid sensory anchors. The doorway that appears when mist parts is a purposeful late reveal tied to the dreamer's documentation work. However, the library functions as scenic backdrop rather than constraint: no spatial detail alters a tactic, no tool limits a choice. The watch is handled twice but never shapes an on-page decision under pressure, missing the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—to find the library of unspoken words—is signaled early but never tested. The dreamer walks, opens a book, catches a slip of paper, writes in a journal, and steps through a doorway; no reversal narrows options, no trade-off imposes cost. The watch's "propagation delays" and the "unfolding cipher" are mentioned but not dramatized as obstacles or choices. Pressure remains static from opening to close, with the revelation granted rather than earned through agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The theme—unspoken words as a state of being rather than a destination—emerges clearly and the mist/veil/cipher motifs recur. Yet the final realization is asserted ("the dreamer knew") rather than earned through concrete struggle; the epiphany arrives without visible sacrifice or counter-reading. The watch and journal are present but do not constrain choice or charge the closure image with irony or cost. No non-literal answer reweights prior material; the ending restates the premise in slightly elevated language.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited distance is stable, and the perceptual signature—reverence, intensity, cautious exuberance—remains consistent. Diction is elevated and deliberate ("ethereal glow," "thrum of knowledge," "siren call of the unfolding cipher"), creating a lyric texture. However, under peak beats (opening the book, stepping through the doorway), the prose does not tighten or compress; it maintains the same ornamental register throughout, flattening momentum. No elision or purposeful compression serves closure; the voice is uniform rather than modulating under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Clarity is high and grammar clean, but density is low: many sentences restate the quest without advancing it ("determined to uncover its secrets," "felt themselves becoming a conduit," "carry the secrets...forever changed"). Template cadence appears in the final third: "The dreamer's [noun]...as they [verb]" recurs across six sentences, creating a drumbeat rhythm. Figurative language is frequent but generic ("mist swirled," "whispers hung like mistletoe," "siren call") and does not accumulate pressure. Paraphrase loops in the closing paragraphs ("forever changed" appears twice, "secrets of the library" three times) dull the final image. Deductions: template cadence −0.6, paraphrase loops −0.4, low density −0.3, totaling within the −0.8 to −1.5 range for multiple issues.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The core premise—a mystical library of unspoken thoughts—is a familiar template (magical archive, hidden knowledge, transformative quest). The veil, mist, glowing shelves, and confidence man's watch are atmospheric but do not synthesize into a non-obvious angle; the dreamer's journey from seeking to "realizing it was always within" follows a well-worn arc. No turn feels inevitable in hindsight; the doorway appears when needed, the epiphany arrives on cue. Specificity is present in sensory detail but the emotional and causal architecture remains generic. Derivative premise guardrail: −0.8 for a widely used template without transformation through lived cost or moral calculus.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The veiled dreamer is present throughout and frames every beat (setup, development, closure all met). However, the character observes, walks, and writes without making a key turn through choice; the doorway appears, and the dreamer steps through without visible cost or trade-off. The character's presence is consistent but replaceable—any questing figure could perform the same moves. Causal pressure is minimal; the dreamer's agency does not narrow options. Band: functional but replaceable, no closure linkage through decision. Positives: early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4. Frictions: swappable −0.6, ornamental at closure −0.7. Net ~3.6, round down to 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The watch appears twice: caught on a slip of paper, then mentioned as "still ticking away" at the end (setup and closure gates met). Its "intricate mechanisms" and "cyclically reversed" reflection are described, and it is used "to measure the propagation delays," but the mechanics never constrain a choice or alter tactics. The watch is thematic ornament rather than a causal tool. Positives: early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure mention +0.3. Frictions: ornamental use −0.8, no cost tied to it −0.4. Net ~3.9, round to 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The unfolding cipher appears on the book cover, is mentioned as guiding the dreamer's documentation, and returns in the final lines as "the unfolding cipher that had led them to this moment" (all three gates met). The concept shapes the dominant stake—seeking the library—but does not constrain options or impose cost on the page. The cipher's mechanics (what unfolds, why it matters) remain abstract. Positives: early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.7. Frictions: thematic claim only −0.8, no visible cost −0.5. Net ~4.4, round to 4.3.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>The watch's face is described as "cyclically reversed, mirroring a truth that lay just beyond the veil of reality" (setup met). The attribute does not constrain an on-page action, enable a choice, or impose cost; it is label-only description. No middle development or closure participation. Positives: early mention +0.3. Frictions: late first appearance (second beat) −0.3, ornamental −0.8, no causal work −0.6, missing closure gate (cap 2.8 per the gate model). Net capped at 2.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The action "document" drives the middle sequence: the dreamer transcribes cryptic messages into a journal, and "as the dreamer wrote, the words seemed to take on a life of their own" (setup and development gates met). The final entries are "transcribed...with a sense of cautious exuberance" before the doorway appears, linking documentation to the closure revelation (payoff gate met). However, the act of writing does not impose visible cost or narrow options; the doorway appears as reward rather than consequence of what was documented. Positives: early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.9, specificity +0.4. Frictions: no visible cost −0.5, could be swapped with "decipher" or "study" −0.5. Net ~5.3 + lyric reprise bump +0.5 = 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Through propagation delays" appears once: "using the watch as a tool to measure the propagation delays between the whispers of the library." The method is mentioned but never shown; the mechanics do not shape an attempt, constrain a choice, or return. Only setup gate is met (barely, as a label). Frictions: ornamental −0.8, summary-only −0.6, missing closure gate (cap 2.8). Net ~2.6.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The glowing library is present from the opening ("mist-shrouded city," "glowing library," "shelves stacked high") through the middle (books, tome, pages) and the ending ("glowing library seemed to fade away"). The setting provides resources (the book, the slip of paper with the watch) and the doorway that appears is spatially anchored within the library (setup, development, payoff all met). However, the environment does not pressure a choice or supply a constraint that alters tactics; it is immersive backdrop. Positives: early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, closure presence +0.9, specificity +0.5. Frictions: postcard description without choice pressure −0.8, swappable with any mystical archive −0.6. Net ~6.2.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>"Between two fateful letters, one received and one yet to be sent" appears in a single sentence mid-story as abstract frame; it does not tighten decisions, track elapsed time, or constrain tactics. The timeframe is ornamental metaphor rather than a live clock. Only thematic mention, no gates met. Frictions: ornamental −0.8, no causal work −0.7, missing all gates (cap 2.8 per the gate model, but actually ~1.9 from baseline). Net 1.9.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to find the library of unspoken words" is stated early ("the dreamer was on a quest, driven by a motivation that had been burning within them") and frames all beats through the ending revelation (setup and closure met). The desire propels movement but is never tested by friction or trade-off; the dreamer walks, reads, writes, and steps through the doorway without visible cost between wanting and achieving. Positives: early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.8. Frictions: told rather than dramatized through conflicted choice −0.8, no visible cost −0.6. Net ~5.6, round to 5.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Cautious exuberance" appears twice explicitly ("words...flowing...with a cautious exuberance," "transcribing the final entries...with a sense of cautious exuberance") and colors the reverent intensity throughout (setup, development, closure all met). The tone is coherent but static; it does not modulate under pressure or charge the final image with irony or cost—the dreamer smiles at the end, exuberance affirmed without caution's price. Positives: early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.5. Frictions: single static mood without turn −0.6, label rather than embodied tonal shift −0.5. Net ~4.4 + lyric coherence +0.3 = 4.7.</comment>
