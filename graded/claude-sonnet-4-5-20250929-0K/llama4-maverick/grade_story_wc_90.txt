<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Aurora remains static throughout, with no contradictory impulses or genuine internal conflict. Her pacifism and resolve are declared but never tested by competing desires or meaningful choice under pressure. The "shadow work" is told rather than dramatized through micro-choices that reveal character. Interiority relies on abstract labels ("deep sense of resolve," "ghostly resolve") rather than embodied, character-particular perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>No legible closure unit appears on the page. The "locked dimension" simply "creaks open" after stitching is complete, with no visible cost, forfeiture, or reconfigured stakes—the protagonist floats into happiness without dramatized consequence. Causality is opaque: stitching photographs somehow unlocks dimensions via unspecified mechanics. The Orientation Test is marginal (who/where anchor by ~150 words) but the piece never establishes what "shadow work" means in action or how tears on photos function as a method, leaving the drive lens ambiguous through closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The recycled spaceship is described but never constrains a choice or alters tactics; Aurora floats through it without friction. The storage bay and photographs are static backdrops. Spatial choreography is vague (where exactly is she stitching, what is the bay's layout?). The Kwan Yin's Tear object recurs and changes state with her mood, providing the strongest setting-adjacent detail that charges the final image, lifting the score slightly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to push open a locked dimension"—is declared but never tested, narrowed, or escalated. No reversal or tightening occurs; Aurora simply completes stitching and the dimension opens without resistance, trade-off, or visible cost. Coincidence resolves (photographs "shimmer" at the right moment). No agency-driven choice forecloses a path or incurs a felt price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Shadow work" is invoked as a theme label without dramatization; the piece never shows repressed thoughts creating friction or cost. The Kwan Yin's Tear recurs but as a mood ring, not a constraint. The final paragraph moralizes directly: "a testament to the enduring power of shadow work"—a thematic echo that replaces earned resonance. No concrete particulars ground the abstraction of "transformative power of love."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, but diction drifts into elevated abstraction ("indomitable will of the human spirit," "boundless potential") inconsistent with immediate scene pressure. Perceptual signature is generic; Aurora notices shimmer and photographs without idiosyncratic filtering. Psychic distance remains constant without modulation. The prose has mild texture but relies on stock phrases ("ghostly vessel," "otherworldly light").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops across adjacent paragraphs: "guardian of the ship's history" / "guardian of the threshold"; "the past come alive" / "memories of the past would continue to illuminate." Template cadence runs: "She was…," "As she…," "The air was…" Figurative language is dense without pattern-teaching: "fabric of reality," "catalyst for transformation," "beacon of peace." Stock metaphors pervade peak beats ("heart swelled," "stars…twinkle in anticipation"). Register drifts into abstract philosophizing ("transformative power," "indomitable will") alien to the scene's immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The premise—lone pacifist on ghost ship uses photo-stitching to unlock dimensions—combines familiar elements (post-human ark, mystical object, shadow work) without synthesis. "Shadow work" and "locked dimension" remain prompt labels without fresh specification. The stitching-as-magic-key and mood-responsive necklace read ornamental rather than transformed through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. No risk-taking heightens stakes; the piece hedges toward safe mysticism.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Aurora's pacifism is declared but never tested by a choice that would trade violence for outcome or force her to endure cost. She observes, stitches, and succeeds without friction.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Kwan Yin's Tear appears in three beats (opening float, mid-story pulse, final float) and its state tracks Aurora's mood. However, it does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic; it is a passive mood indicator. It recurs in the final image but only ornamentally.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>"Shadow work" is mentioned four times but never dramatized. The story does not show repressed thoughts, internal conflict, or psychological cost on the page—only the label. It does not shape stakes or alter tactics.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The gravitational-lightness trait is described twice (opening and ending) but does not constrain or enable action. Aurora's happiness makes the tear float; no trade-off, cost, or tactical consequence follows. The trait is ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Stitching spans multiple beats (setup in bay, mid-story action, final stitch) and is present at the ending ("finished the final stitch" triggers the dimension opening). However, the action is interchangeable—any ritual would serve the same plot function with minor edits. It does not impose a specific cost or constraint.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>The "faint shimmer of long-dried tears on faded photographs" is mentioned twice (setup and ending reprise) but its mechanics are never explained or dramatized. It does not shape Aurora's method or attempts; she simply stitches generically. The shimmer is cosmetic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The recycled spaceship is established early and recurs (corridors, storage bay, drifting ship) but never pressures a choice. It is postcard description. The ship's "fragile ecosystem" is mentioned but does not alter tactics or stakes. The bay provides a location for stitching but any room would serve.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.4</grade><comment>"After the last human is born" is stated once as backstory color. It does not tighten decisions, create urgency, or track causally. No clock or temporal pressure appears on the page.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The desire "to push open a locked dimension" is declared early and recurs, but is never dramatized through conflicted choice or cost. Aurora pursues it without friction, obstacle, or trade-off. The goal is resolved off-stage (the dimension "creaks open") rather than through protagonist struggle.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Ghostly resolve" is signaled early and maintained through word choice ("ghostly vessel," "faint shimmer") and Aurora's steady demeanor. Tone is consistent but static; it does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image with new meaning. The ending recycles the same mood without intensification.</comment>
