<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The scholar's motivation to decode patterns is stated but never tested by a meaningful choice under pressure. Internal contradiction is absent; the character observes and is acted upon (summoned) rather than driving turns through micro-choices. The flicker of unease and quiet resolve are labeled emotions without embodied specificity or competing impulses. The final walk with the crystal reads as compliance, not a renunciation or stance that forecloses a path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors are present early (library, dawn, scholar). The piece defaults to causal mode but the scholar's agency is passive: summoned to testify, led away. The walk into the city constitutes a spatial transition, but no on-page reversal narrows options or changes knowledge through protagonist choice. The ending offers a vague promise ("pattern of growth was beginning to reveal itself") rather than a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with legible cost. Cost proof test fails: no sentence makes the price of testimony concrete on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setting detail is vivid and atmospheric (aged parchment, grimy windows, stone floor). The library frames the opening mood effectively, and the transition to the city is signaled. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or charge the final image; the crystal's fall is noted but does not alter tactics. The shift from library to city streets is described without spatial pressure on the scholar's decision, falling short of the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (decode the pattern) is declared but never tested on the page. The summons to testify arrives as external compulsion, not protagonist-driven escalation. No reversal or tightening narrows options; the scholar rises, retrieves the crystal, and walks without visible tradeoff or foreclosed path. The ending gestures at possibility rather than delivering a turn with cost. Agency remains observational throughout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The pattern of growth and suspended hush operate as thematic labels rather than emerging from concrete action. The crystal recurs but its "sonically reflective" property is asserted, not dramatized in a way that reweights prior material. The final image (city awakening, symphony of new beginnings) offers generic optimism without a resonant answer to the central question. No epiphany is earned through struggle; the scholar's "weathered innocence" is told, not shown through particular choice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>POV distance is stable and third-limited throughout. Diction is elevated and consistent but leans toward abstract elevation ("suspended hush," "sonically reflective") without grounding in the scholar's concrete perceptual signature. The visitor's dialogue is brief and functional. Filter verbs ("seemed," "felt") cluster in reflective beats without harming clarity. No head-hopping, but the voice reads as externally imposed rather than character-particular under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and paragraph breaks create visual cadence. However, paraphrase loops appear: "the silence was oppressive, a suspended hush" repeats the same idea; "their task was to decode the pattern" is restated multiple times without new pressure. Stock phrases include "red-rimmed from lack of sleep," "eerie glow," "quiet resolve." The crystal's "sonically reflective surface" is repeated across three beats without evolving function, a template cadence trigger. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and template stems; the final third bears these artifacts, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high bands at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The scholar-in-library and reluctant-summons beats are familiar genre templates executed without transformation. The crystal, "pattern of growth," and "after the last dictionary" are intriguing details, but they remain ornamental—present without altering the emotional or causal arc. The ending's "symphony of new beginnings" is generic optimism. No bold risk or specific synthesis distinguishes this from median submissions in the same mode.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The reticent scholar is present throughout and makes two actions (retrieves the crystal, walks with the visitor), but neither alters tactics or narrows options. The character observes and is summoned rather than driving turns. Present in setup, middle, and ending, but decisions do not create stakes shifts. Swappable with any compliant protagonist; specificity is low.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The crystal appears in three beats: removed from chandelier (backstory), slips and falls, retrieved and clutched while walking. Setup and closure participation are present, but the object does not constrain a choice or reweight meaning at the end—it is held as the scholar walks. "Sonically reflective" is asserted twice without on-page demonstration. Functional but largely static; no cost tied to its use.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The suspended hush is described atmospherically in the opening and said to recede in the ending, but it does not shape an on-page choice or tactic. Present in setup and referenced at closure, but no middle development. Acts as tone rather than stake-altering concept. Swappable with "oppressive silence" or similar; low irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Sonically reflective is mentioned twice as a label for the crystal ("seemed to amplify the silence," "seemed to echo the turmoil") but never constrains or enables an action. No cost, no middle beat involvement, and no closure function beyond being held. Ornamental descriptor; late first appearance (midpoint) and summary-only use trigger caps at 4.6 and 3.8 respectively; take the lower.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Testify is the inciting summons and the stated reason for the walk into the city; it frames the ending's public exposure versus isolated research. Present in setup (summoned), drives the middle turn (scholar rises), and appears in the closing lines ("resolve to testify"). Three-gate pass. However, the act itself is not dramatized on the page—only the journey toward it—so causal pressure is moderate and cost indirect. Solid integration but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>Through fractured sequences is mentioned once in narration ("they worked through fractured sequences") as a description of the scholar's method but does not shape any on-page attempt or closure. No setup signal, no middle constraint, no payoff. Ornamental method label; introduced late (second paragraph) without mechanics. Cap at 4.6 for late introduction and 3.4 for missing middle; take lower; further reduced for ornamental use.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The shadowed library at dawn anchors the opening beats and provides atmosphere; the transition to the city at dawn completes the timeframe. The library does not constrain a tactical choice, but it frames isolation versus public testimony. Present in setup, shapes the departure (middle turn), and contrasts with the city at closure. Two-of-three gates met; causal role is moderate; specificity is high (chandelier, stone floor, grimy windows). Mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>After the last dictionary is printed appears once as backstory flavor ("a time after the last dictionary was printed") but does not tighten any decision or tactic on the page. No setup, no middle pressure, no closure participation. Swappable with any post-literate or decline frame. Ornamental worldbuilding; cap at 2.8 for missing closure and further reduced for late, single mention.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>To decode the pattern of growth is stated as the scholar's task in the opening and referenced at closure ("the pattern of growth was beginning to reveal itself"). Present in setup and ending; mentioned in the middle as ongoing work. However, the desire is never dramatized in a conflicted choice—the scholar is summoned away without on-page struggle between the decoding work and testimony. Two-gate pass (setup, payoff) allows eligibility to ~6.0, but friction from lack of middle conflict lowers the score.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Weathered innocence is named once late ("The scholar's weathered innocence seemed to stir") and does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image. Tone in the opening is atmospheric and contemplative; tone at closure shifts to hopeful ("symphony of new beginnings") without coherent bridge. Single static register in the library, abrupt optimism in the street. Missing middle development and late label; cap at 3.4 and 4.6 respectively; ornamental mention adds friction. Mid-low band.</comment>
