<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Ember's motivation is established early (curiosity, preference for listening over noise), but her decision-making remains largely passive—she "finds herself pondering," "feels a sudden urge," and notices patterns without genuine internal conflict or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The shift from siren testing to bell-tending unfolds through observation rather than high-stakes choice with visible cost. The final satisfaction reads as awarded rather than earned through struggle, and interiority leans toward summary ("credibly curious," "felt at peace") instead of embodied contradiction under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/role shift) as its closure form. Orientation anchors arrive late—who (Ember), what (storm siren tester), and where (sanctuary above clouds) coalesce only after ~180 words of atmospheric preamble, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). The core turn (switching focus from sirens to bell) lacks a concrete precipitating cause; Ember "hesitates" and "waits for something" without dramatized friction, weakening the causal through-line even under an accumulative lens. Cost is implied (sirens "no longer the focus") but never made visceral or visible on the page at the closure beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The windblown sanctuary is anchored through sensory details (crisp air, breeze whisper, wind patterns) and the cathedral setting provides spatial grounding. However, the setting remains largely atmospheric rather than constraining choice—wind and architecture inform Ember's experiments with the bell but do not pressure a key decision or narrow options. The bell itself (object-as-micro-setting) does constrain one choice (repairing the crack with glue, waiting for it to dry), lifting the score above mid-band, though the environment otherwise supports mood more than stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding the sanctuary's microclimate—is signaled early and sustained, but escalation remains gentle and observational rather than driven by protagonist agency under pressure. The switch from sirens to bell represents a reorientation rather than a high-cost choice; no live option is foreclosed, and the "new role" feels granted rather than fought for. The solstice hush moment ("threshold, a zero hour") gestures toward escalation but delivers hesitation without a decision that narrows tactics or raises felt cost, keeping the piece in the functional-but-limited band under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme (listening, the beauty of sound over warning, subtle rhythms) emerges through image and action rather than overt statement, and the bell's resonance functions as a recurring motif that shifts meaning from repair to conductor-role. However, the final paragraph moralizes explicitly ("a reminder that even in the most turbulent of times, there is beauty to be found in the quiet moments, and that listening is a powerful way to connect"), replacing earned resonance with a stated lesson (−0.5 for final-paragraph thematic summary). The ending's conceptual repricing is diluted by this direct articulation, preventing higher-band entry.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited throughout, with consistent narrative distance and no head-hopping. Voice carries a contemplative, slightly elevated register ("credibly curious," "benediction," "solstice hush") that fits the lyric mode, though some diction edges toward the generic-literary rather than character-particular. Perceptual signature is present (Ember's focus on sound and wind) but could be more idiosyncratic. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not applied. Psychic distance is controlled, and the prose-as-character test holds adequately for this focalizer.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops appear in adjacent lines: "sanctuary's unique microclimate" / "subtle variations in the wind and temperature" / "tracking microclimate variations" recur without added pressure (−0.4). Template cadence runs through repeated "As she…" and "Ember would…" stems across multiple sentences (−0.5). Stock metaphors ("symphony of sound," "dance between wind, sound, and silence") and elevated diction ("benediction," "solstice hush") cluster in the final third without voice-motivated grounding (−0.3). Cumulative artifact debt (−1.2) and proximity to closure trigger the global 9+ disqualification. Information density is moderate; some sentences advance atmosphere more than story.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The premise—storm siren tester shifts to bell-tender—offers a modest fresh angle, but the emotional arc (curiosity → satisfaction → peace) and the microclimate-tracking frame follow familiar contemplative-discovery templates without a non-obvious synthesis. The bell-repair detail (glue drying) provides specificity, yet the transformation test reveals the core arc could transfer to other settings (lighthouse keeper, weather observer) with minor edits. The solstice hush and windblown sanctuary evoke mood but remain closer to genre atmosphere than a bold, irreplaceable vision. No significant risk-taking in structure or perspective.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Ember (humble storm siren tester) is present throughout and her role frames the premise, but her key "decisions" are passive observations and drifts rather than choices that create turns. The switch from sirens to bell is described as "a sudden urge" without agency-driven causality. She appears in the closure (tending the bell, feeling at peace) but does not make a choice there that alters tactics or forecloses a path. Setup and closure participation are met, but middle development lacks a constraining choice (two gates functional, middle weak). Swappable with "humble weather observer" or similar role.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The cathedral bell rope appears in three distinct beats: initial hesitation/threshold moment, experimentation with ringing patterns, and sustained use in the closure sequence as Ember's conductor-role tool. The rope's swaying prompts her hesitation (setup), she rings the bell in patterns (middle development), and it remains central to her final identity as guardian of the wind (closure participation). All three gates met. However, the rope itself is not uniquely irreplaceable—any bell-activation mechanism (pull-chain, striker) would serve the same function. Causal pressure is present but moderate; cost tied to the bell's sound (glue repair) more than the rope specifically.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Zero hour is mentioned once as "a threshold, a zero hour that marked the beginning of a new cycle" during Ember's hesitation at the bell rope. It labels a moment but does not shape stakes or tactics—no countdown, no narrowing window, no decision forced by temporal pressure. The phrase functions as atmospheric metaphor rather than a mechanic that alters options. Missing middle development and closure participation; setup is label-only. Easily removed without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Credibly curious is stated in paragraph three ("Ember…was also credibly curious, often finding herself pondering") and drives her ongoing microclimate tracking and bell experiments. The trait enables her exploration but does not constrain a choice or impose visible cost—curiosity is rewarded (she finds patterns, gains reverence) without friction or tradeoff. Setup present, middle functional (she experiments because curious), but no closure beat where curiosity forecloses an option or costs something tangible. Label-mention deduction (−0.3). Swappable with "deeply curious" or "persistently inquisitive."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Switch appears as "Ember felt a sudden urge to switch her focus from the sirens to the bell" and defines the story's central reorientation. Setup occurs at the threshold moment, middle development shows her experimenting with bell patterns, and closure reflects the completed switch (she now tends the bell, sirens are secondary). All three gates met. However, the switch is told rather than dramatized as a choice with immediate cost, and the phrasing is generic enough that "shift," "turn," or "redirect" would serve identically (−0.5 swappability). Causal role present but the action itself lacks specificity that makes it irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Tracking microclimate variations is introduced early ("Ember employed a method of tracking microclimate variations, using a network of sensors") and sustained through the story (she continues tracking, notices wind patterns via bell sound). Setup and middle development present; the method informs her understanding and shapes her daily routine. Closure participation is weak—she "continued to track" but the ending emphasizes the bell's resonance and her peace rather than a tracking-derived decision. Two gates met, but the mechanics never constrain a choice or impose cost. The sensors/observation network are mentioned but not handled on the page (−0.4 summary-only).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The windblown sanctuary above the clouds is named in the opening and provides atmospheric anchoring throughout (crisp air, breeze, wind patterns, cathedral at the heart). Setup clear. The wind's behavior informs Ember's bell experiments (middle development), and the final image includes "the gentle rustle of the wind" and "the bell tolled softly, its sound carrying on the breeze." All three gates met. However, the sanctuary pressures mood more than choice—Ember's key moves (repairing the bell, ringing it) would function in any quiet, wind-affected location. The setting enriches tone but does not uniquely constrain tactics or supply resources that alter outcome.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>After the glue dries appears once: "Ember found that the glue she had used to repair a small crack in the bell's surface had dried, and the tone was now clear and rich." This marks a before/after state change (bell tone improved) that enables the closure role (tending a clear-toned bell). Setup is implicit (she must have applied glue earlier, off-page); the drying itself is narrated in summary. The timeframe does not tighten decisions or create urgency—no waiting tension, no clock pressure. One functional beat (tone reveals after drying), but missing setup dramatization and closure participation. Cap 4.6 for late/off-page setup; summary-only (−0.3). The phrase serves as a minor milestone rather than a temporal constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>To favor listening over noise is stated explicitly ("Her motivation was to favor listening over noise") and demonstrated through Ember's preference for wind hum over siren wail, her bell experiments, and her final conductor-role. Setup and middle development present; closure reflects the realized motivation (she listens to subtle rhythms, tends the bell). All three gates met. However, the desire is told more than dramatized in friction—no scene where listening costs her something immediate (safety, efficiency, social standing). The motivation enables action but does not conflict with a competing want or fear in a single high-pressure choice (−0.6 for lack of visible tradeoff). Swappable with "prioritize quiet observation" or similar phrasings.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Solstice hush appears twice: "an expectant hush fell over the sanctuary, a solstice hush that seemed to hold its breath" (threshold moment) and "As the solstice hush fell over the sanctuary once more, Ember smiled" (closure). The tone is contemplative, quiet, and reverent throughout, modulating gently with Ember's shifts from routine to threshold to satisfaction. Setup and closure participation present via the recurring phrase; middle development maintains the hush through wind-silence and bell resonance. The tone charges the final image by returning with reweighted meaning (initial breath-holding → final peace). However, "solstice hush" itself is somewhat ornamental—the same tonal effect could be achieved with "winter stillness" or "sacred quiet" (−0.4 swappability). Strong lyric reprise lifts the score into mid-6s despite replaceability.</comment>
