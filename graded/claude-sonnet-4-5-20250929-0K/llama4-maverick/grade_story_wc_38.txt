<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Aria's core motivation—encrypting vulnerability as strength—is declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. Her dance is described but never constrains a choice or creates friction. Interiority relies heavily on abstract phrasing ("calm defiance," "mysterious familiarity") rather than embodied perception under pressure. The journal-writing and dice-handling are gestural without revealing a hierarchy of values or visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The story lacks a coherent on-page closure effect with legible cost. Aria "feels liberation" and steps into light, but no prior option is foreclosed and no visible price is paid; the ending declares transformation without dramatizing the decisive change. Orientation is delayed—who, where, and when coalesce slowly across the first third without productive disorientation—triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). The drive lens is ambiguous: accumulative patterning is attempted (dice, spider, journal) but no causal tightening or decisive reweighting occurs at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The sunken laboratory is anchored with sensory detail (saltwater, decay, rusting equipment) and the spider's web offers a purposeful image. However, the setting does not constrain choice or supply resources that alter Aria's tactics; she moves freely without spatial friction. The micro-setting elements (dice, journal) are handled but do not pressure her decisions in a way that charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—escape through code-breaking—is signaled but never tested on the page. No reversal narrows options or forces a trade-off; Aria's progress is summarized rather than dramatized through a meaningful tightening. The spider's web is offered as a timeframe but does not impose urgency or alter her tactics. Closure arrives via declaration ("felt liberation") without an earned turn driven by protagonist agency or visible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The theme of transforming vulnerability into strength is stated explicitly rather than emerging from concrete action. Recurring images (dice, web, journal) are present but do not reweight meaning at the end; they remain ornamental. The final paragraph offers a thematic summary ("power of calm defiance") that replaces scene pressure with moralizing, triggering the Thematic Echo penalty (−0.6).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV is stable and the perceptual signature leans toward lyrical abstraction ("mysterious familiarity," "unseen audience"). However, diction often drifts into elevated register ("manifestation of her calm defiance," "catalyst for her growth") that reads as authorial rather than character-particular. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance remains consistent but the voice lacks embodied specificity under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn proliferate: "encode/encoding/coded" cycles across adjacent lines without added pressure; "calm defiance" and "mysterious familiarity" recur as unearned tags. Template cadence runs appear ("She felt... she felt... she knew..."). Figurative language ("intricate patterns," "complex and beautiful structure") is generic and does not advance momentum. The final third stacks these artifacts, disallowing 9+ globally and applying cumulative line-debt penalties (−1.2).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The core premise—trapped protagonist deciphering codes to escape—closely matches common writing templates without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus (−0.8). The dice, spider, and journal are present but interchangeable; removing any would not break story logic. No bold risk-taking or fresh inflection distinguishes the execution; emotional beats follow predictable arcs without surprise or earned inevitability.</comment>
