<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The archivist remains functionally generic throughout—no contradictory impulses, no embodied stakes beyond professional duty. Her "reactively visionary" trait is asserted but never dramatizes a visible cost or constraint that shapes a choice under pressure. The community members exist only as summary collective; no individual relationship forces a trade-off. The ending declares pride and satisfaction without earning either through on-page struggle or renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive cleanly in the opening lines. However, the story operates almost entirely in summary mode: years of collecting are told, installations "take shape" off-page, and the community's healing is recounted rather than dramatized. No decisive on-page reversal occurs; the valve purchase and installation sequence lack causal pressure. The ending offers declarative satisfaction ("she had done more than simply compile fragments") rather than a felt cost or reconfigured image, failing the closure test under any lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The ivory harbor after rain provides vivid opening sensory detail (mist, ocean-spray, weathered stones) and the Maritime Relics shop grounds the middle beat. The valve's brass surface and intricate etchings offer texture. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—installations appear via summary, and the revitalized harbor at the end is described rather than shown shaping the protagonist's final stance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—compiling fragments to help the community heal—is signaled early but never tested by on-page opposition or a live trade-off. The archivist encounters no resistance, resource scarcity, or competing priorities; the shopkeeper's "flicker of understanding" evaporates into cooperation. The community gathers and shares stories without friction. No reversal narrows options, and the resolution ("the community had been heartened") is summary declaration rather than earned cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The theme of remembrance and communal healing emerges clearly from the premise and is reinforced by recurring images (the valve, the installations, the harbor's transformation). However, every thematic beat is stated rather than embodied: "the power of remembrance" and "resilience of the human spirit" are declared multiple times in the final third. The valve's symbolic function is explained ("now a symbol of the community's rebirth") rather than charged through a non-literal final image. The ending moralizes rather than resonates.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. The prose maintains a consistent elevated register ("reactively visionary," "mosaic of experiences," "beacon of hope") that reads as narrated summary rather than the archivist's lived perception. Psychic distance never modulates with pressure because no pressure materializes on the page. The shopkeeper's brief dialogue ("Welcome") is functional but does not advance subtext or reveal character. Diction remains abstract and declarative throughout, fitting summary mode but lacking perceptual signature.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Multiple paraphrase loops and template cadence runs appear throughout: "The archivist knew that she had to hearten... She devised a plan... Working through staggered intervals, she set up..." recycles the same stem structure across sequential beats. Synonym churn ("fragments," "pieces," "disparate elements," "mosaic") restates the collection metaphor without advancing it. The final six paragraphs loop declarations of success and symbolic meaning ("testament," "beacon," "symbol") with minimal new information. Stock metaphors ("beacon of hope," "rich tapestry," "resilience of the human spirit") dominate closure beats. These artifacts flatten momentum and obscure any potential final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The premise—post-exile archivist using collected relics to heal a community—gestures toward freshness but executes as a generic recovery narrative. The valve and installations function as interchangeable symbols rather than irreplaceable story engines; the shopkeeper, community, and healing arc could slot into dozens of similar plots. No risk-taking in structure or perspective; the story proceeds in chronological summary from problem to tidy resolution. The exile itself remains an abstract historical event with no specific texture or consequence that shapes present choices.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>The ocean-spray archivist is named early and present throughout, but her choices (purchasing the valve, setting up installations) occur in summary and face no opposition or cost. She observes the community's response rather than making a turn-generating decision. Her professional role is ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The herald's trumpet valve appears in three beats: discovery in the shop (with tactile detail: brass, intricate patterns), placement in an installation (summary), and symbolic mention at closure. It sparks "a sense of recognition" and later "seemed to resonate," but these are told effects rather than dramatized choices. The valve enables no tactics and the final reprise is declarative ("remained, a symbol") rather than reweighted through action.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Navigated absences" is named once early ("she began to feel a sense of absence, a void that needed to be navigated") and echoed thematically in references to voids and loss, but the concept does not constrain a choice or shape tactics on the page. The archivist's method of addressing absences—creating installations—is summary work. The concept remains thematic claim rather than lived pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>"Reactively visionary" is labeled once ("The archivist was reactively visionary, often uncovering connections between seemingly disparate elements") but never enacted. No scene shows her reacting to stimulus with visionary connection-making, and the trait imposes no trade-off or visible cost. It is ornamental character description.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Hearten" appears once as a goal ("she had to hearten the community") and is fulfilled in summary ("The community had been heartened"). The action does not drive a turn or face resistance; the installations succeed off-page and the community's response is recounted. The action is easily swappable with similar verbs (inspire, encourage) without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>"Staggered intervals" is mentioned once in a single sentence ("Working through staggered intervals, she set up a sequence of displays") but the mechanics are not shown, the pacing does not affect outcome, and the method could be replaced with "over several days" or "gradually" without change. It is ornamental process detail.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The ivory harbor after rain is vividly anchored in the opening (weathered stones, mist, ocean-spray) and returns in the final third (revitalized, golden light). The setting frames the emotional arc and the valve's discovery occurs within it. However, the harbor does not constrain a choice or provide a resource that alters tactics; it remains atmospheric backdrop rather than active pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the exile ends" is established in the opening paragraph and provides historical context, but no live clock shapes decisions. Years pass in summary ("Years later..."; "In the years to come...") without time pressure altering tactics. The exile's end is backdrop rather than active temporal constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The motivation to compile fragments into meaning is clearly stated early ("felt an overwhelming urge to compile the disparate elements into a coherent narrative") and drives the archivist's professional actions. However, the desire faces no friction, competing want, or on-page cost—she encounters cooperation and success throughout. The motivation is functional setup but lacks dramatized conflict.</comment>
