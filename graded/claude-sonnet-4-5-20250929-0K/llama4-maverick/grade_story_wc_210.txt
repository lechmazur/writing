<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The alchemist remains a cipher throughout—no embodied emotion, no contradictory impulses, no micro-choices under pressure. Interiority consists entirely of abstract contemplation ("their mind consumed by the task," "their vision began to take shape") without specific sensory anchors or internal conflict. The final act of beginning work is declared rather than dramatized, with no visible cost or foreclosed path. The character functions as a vehicle for theme rather than a person making choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Orientation is established (who, where) but the temporal anchor "after the last wish is granted" remains cryptic and unused. The piece operates in pure contemplation mode with no causal linkage—the alchemist sits, thinks, rises, and begins work in a linear sequence without reversal or tightening. The ending claims transformation ("the town began to transform") but shows none on the page; closure is asserted rather than demonstrated. No visible cost accompanies the decision to act.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The paper-lantern cove and amber bottle provide vivid visual anchors, and the description of lanterns growing brighter creates atmospheric specificity. However, setting remains purely decorative—the cove does not constrain any choice, and spatial details (crumbling buildings, overgrown streets) are catalogued rather than integrated into action. The bottle is observed but never handled across the 800-word span, missing the micro-setting opportunity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake (ghost town revival) is signaled early but never tested on the page. The story presents pure contemplation followed by a decision to act, with no obstacle, reversal, or competing pressure. "The task was daunting, but the alchemist was undaunted" explicitly negates conflict. The ending offers summary ("the town began to flourish") rather than a single dramatized cost or tightening moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme of revival and reimagining emerges clearly, but the piece states rather than dramatizes it: "rejects false comfort," "breathe new life," "revival and rebirth." The amber bottle appears positioned for symbolic weight but remains inert—neither opened nor transformed in meaning. The final paragraph delivers explicit thematic summary ("a new civilization was taking shape") rather than a resonant image that answers the central question through particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. However, the narrative voice is generic and elevated, lacking perceptual signature—"fierce intensity," "quiet reverence," "unwavering dedication" could describe any protagonist. Diction remains uniform across emotional states with no modulation under pressure. No dialogue is present to evaluate. The prose reads as neutral narration rather than filtered through a specific consciousness.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Significant paraphrase loops pervade: "contemplation…pondered," "vision began to take shape…narrative unfolding," "took a deep breath…began to work" immediately followed by "set to work." Template cadence runs cluster in the opening and closing thirds: "The alchemist's [noun] [verb]" appears six times. Filter-verb stacks flatten immediacy: "seemed to shift," "seemed to be watching," "seemed to grow brighter." Stock metaphors ("born from the ashes," "canvas waiting to be filled") reduce freshness. Information density is low—many sentences restate contemplation without advancing knowledge or pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The ghost-town-revival premise and solitary-mystic-contemplates-restoration frame are familiar templates executed without transformation. The amber bottle with no opening is introduced as mysterious but never utilized—it remains ornamental rather than a fresh integration. "After the last wish is granted" offers potential originality but is never developed or paid off. The emotional arc (contemplate, then act) is generic and could apply to any solitary protagonist facing any large task.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>The deserted alchemist is present throughout and named in the setup, but makes no on-page decision that alters tactics or forecloses options. Contemplation dominates; the choice to "begin to work" in the final third is declared without cost or consequence shown. No middle development constrains their approach. Swappable with "solitary architect" or "lone engineer" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The amber bottle appears in the setup with vivid physical detail and is mentioned four times, but it is only observed—never handled, opened, or used to constrain a choice. It "seemed to be watching" and "remained at the heart" as passive symbol. No closure participation; the final image shifts to the town's transformation without revisiting the bottle. Missing middle development and payoff gates cap score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Ghost town revival is the explicit dominant stake, signaled early and sustained as the alchemist's goal. However, it remains abstract contemplation—no on-page attempt, no tactics shaped by the concept's constraints (e.g., resource scarcity, structural decay), and no reversal. The ending asserts "the town began to flourish" without showing a single concrete revival action. Present in setup and closure summary but not developed through middle beats.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Rejects false comfort" is stated directly in paragraph six but never dramatized. The alchemist "had abandoned the sentimental notions" in summary; no on-page moment shows them refusing comfort or paying a cost for that rejection. Label-only trait without visible tradeoff. Missing all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Conceive" anchors the story's action throughout—the alchemist conceives a plan across the entire span. It shapes the setup and middle beats (the act of mental construction through working memory) and transitions to physical execution at closure. However, the conception itself generates no reversal or competing option; it proceeds smoothly without obstacles. Functional causal role but no cost or friction tied to this specific action.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Through working memory" is named twice in the middle section: "relying on their working memory to hold the countless details" and later "the power of their working memory." It signals the method but the mechanics do not matter—no moment shows memory failing, overwhelming the alchemist, or forcing a choice between competing details. Summary-only use without pressure. Missing closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Paper-lantern cove is named in the opening line and provides atmospheric anchoring (lanterns grow brighter mid-story, creating a responsive environment). The setting is present in setup and closure ("In the paper-lantern cove, a new civilization...") but does not constrain a single choice—it remains backdrop. The two-gate reprise (first line to final paragraph) offers lyric resonance but no causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"After the last wish is granted" appears once in the penultimate paragraph as a cryptic declaration: "It was after the last wish is granted that true creation begins." No setup, no development, no on-page moment where this timeframe tightens decisions. The phrase reads as thematic flourish rather than temporal constraint. Missing all three gates and introduced in the final third.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"To reimagine an entire civilization" is the explicit motivation stated in paragraph five and sustained as the alchemist's goal through closure. It shapes the dominant stake across beats and drives the final decision to act. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized in friction—no competing want, no on-page moment where the scale of ambition creates doubt or trade-off. Present in setup, middle summary, and closure but lacks embodied conflict.</comment>
