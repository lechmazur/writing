<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lena's interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("gravitationally playful nature," "quirky sense of humor") rather than embodied contradiction. Her motivation to "turn bitterness into a cosmic joke" is told repeatedly but never shown through a micro-choice that costs her something on the page. The herbalist remains a wispy cipher without distinct pressure. No meaningful internal conflict acts simultaneously in scene; the protagonist observes and receives rather than deciding under friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive but "the missing return changed" remains opaque past midpoint, never clarified or paid off at closure—orientation debt applies (−0.4). The ending offers no decisive change, renunciation, or conceptual repricing with visible cost; Lena walks away with "frostbitten hope" and a flint arrowhead, but no path is foreclosed and no live option narrows on the page. The piece gestures toward accumulative texture but never teaches a coherent pattern or delivers a resonant reconfiguration. Closure is absent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The underground garden supplies vivid sensory anchors (damp earth, blooming flowers, moss-covered stone) and the cordless phone becomes a focal object. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics; Lena moves through it as a tourist. Spatial choreography is clear, but the setting remains postcard description rather than pressure. The cap at 8.3 (orientation debt applied in Q2) and the lack of choice-constraint keep the score mid-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("unravel the mystery, restore balance") is declared but never tested by a concrete on-page dilemma that narrows options. Lena listens, feels energy, and walks away; no reversal or tightening forces a trade-off with visible cost. The static on the phone "grows louder" and "fainter" without causal linkage to her decisions. Escalation is asserted ("grim determination rising") rather than dramatized through agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme is stated overtly ("turn bitterness into a cosmic joke," "harmony untamed") rather than emerging from particulars. The flint arrowhead and phone return but without reweighting prior material or offering a non-literal answer to the central question. The final paragraph moralizes ("she was no longer alone") and summarizes theme rather than charging an image with cost. Cap at 7.2 (Q4 ≤6.9) prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and the prose carries a consistent elevated register ("wispy figure," "frostbitten hope"). However, diction drifts into abstraction under pressure ("gravitationally playful energy," "harmony untamed") where concrete perceptual signature would sharpen voice. Dialogue is minimal and functional. Psychic distance remains steady but the narrative texture does not modulate with emotional intensity. Cap at 7.8 (orientation debt applied in Q2) limits band entry.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Heavy phrase recycling ("frostbitten hope" appears three times; "harmony untamed" and "gravitationally playful" recur without development) and paraphrase loops ("strange occurrences"/"strange energies"/"strange and wondrous"). Template cadence in the middle third: "The herbalist led… The device crackled… As Lena picked up…" runs across multiple beats without variation (−0.5). Abstract noun stacks ("a sense of unease," "a sense of trepidation," "a sense of determination") dull immediacy. Artifacts touch the ending ("frostbitten hope rising within her"), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The premise (undercover cryptid researcher, mysterious garden, static-laden phone confessions) assembles genre furniture without fresh synthesis. "Gravitationally playful," "frostbitten hope," and "turn bitterness into a cosmic joke" are evocative labels but never dramatized through specific, irreplaceable detail. The ending resets to hopeful resolve without earned transformation, a stock move. No bold structural or perspectival risk; the piece reads as median genre exercise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Lena is present throughout but makes no key decision that alters tactics or stakes. She receives the arrowhead, listens to the phone, and walks away with resolve—observation without agency. Her role as "undercover cryptid researcher" is setup only; the undercover status never complicates a choice.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The flint arrowhead appears early (handed to Lena), is handled ("feeling an unexpected jolt"), reappears at the end ("clutched in her hand," "still resonating within her"), and its "gravitationally playful energy" is noted. However, it never constrains a choice or alters an action; it remains a talisman without causal work. Two touches across three beats, but swappable with any symbolic object.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Harmony untamed" is named repeatedly as a force Lena grasps conceptually, but it never shapes an on-page tactic or decision. It functions as thematic echo rather than stake-driver. No cost is tied to confronting or harnessing it within the scene.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>"Gravitationally playful" is a label applied to Lena's nature and the arrowhead's energy but never constrains or enables a visible action. No tradeoff or cost emerges from this trait on the page; it remains decorative descriptor.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Metamorphose" appears once in the middle third ("Lena felt herself begin to metamorphose, her perception shifting") as internal summary without visible before/after alteration in her choices or tactics. Easily swappable with "transform" or "shift"; no major turn traces to this action.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The cordless phone is introduced in the middle third, its mechanics explained (tuning into whispers), and Lena listens to the static-laden confessions for several beats. It shapes the method of revelation and recurs at the ending when the static fades. However, Lena does not use it to make a choice that alters outcome; it delivers exposition. Two-gate presence (middle, ending) with functional but passive role.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The herbalist's underground garden is established early, provides vivid setting anchors (tunnels, chambers, roots, moss-covered stone, clearing), and frames the entire scene. The secluded clearing houses the phone and the garden's "strange energies" pulse through the encounter. However, the setting never pressures a choice or supplies a resource that alters tactics. Three-gate presence with strong specificity but no causal constraint on closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.6</grade><comment>"After the missing return changed" appears once in the middle third, labeled a "catastrophic event," but remains undefined and does not tighten decisions or tactics. Time is untracked; no clock or deadline shapes Lena's moves. The timeframe is ornamental setup without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Lena's motivation "to turn bitterness into a cosmic joke" is stated early and repeated at closure, but never dramatized through a choice where humor or reframing costs her something or conflicts with another want. It functions as thematic claim rather than active desire under friction. Two-gate presence (setup, ending) with no middle development.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Frostbitten hope" is named three times (herbalist's gaze, Lena's emergence, final line) and modulates from external observation to internal feeling. The tone remains coherent but static; it does not shift with pressure or charge the final image beyond repetition. Functional reprise without causal linkage to closure effect.</comment>
