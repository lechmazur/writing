<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lyra remains an abstract keeper-of-knowledge archetype without contradictory impulses or embodied emotion. Her "brittle awakenings" and "reincarnation memory" are told labels that never constrain an on-page choice. The workbench polishing and sundial gazing cycle through repetitive stems without micro-decisions that reveal hierarchy of values. No visible cost forecloses a path; the final smile and "weight lifting" arrive as summary rather than earned change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors appear late: Lyra's role and the floating library location emerge gradually without immediate spatial grounding by ~120 words, triggering a −0.4 penalty and Q3 cap at 7.0. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural (pattern of preservation + brittle awakenings motif), but no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with visible cost lands on the page. The ending's "smile" and "weight lifting" are told summary, not a final image that reweights prior material. Closure form fails the required definition.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The tidal library above clouds, brass sundial, and stone circle are vividly described but remain postcard elements; none constrains a choice or charges the final image. The sundial's "atomically reflective surface" is mentioned but never enables or blocks an action. Spatial choreography is coherent (workbench, windows, library interior), yet the environment functions as backdrop rather than pressure. The Orientation Test penalty in Q2 caps this category at 7.0; absent that, vivid description would place it near 6.8, but without tactical constraint it cannot reach the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"translate isolation into independence"—is told in paragraph six but never tested by a choice that narrows options. No on-page reversal or tightening occurs; Lyra polishes the sundial across uniform paragraphs without escalation. The "brittle awakenings" concept is invoked repeatedly but does not drive a decision. The ending's "weight lifting" and smile are summary, not agency with visible cost. Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, one meaningful deepening or cadence shift that reweights the stake with cost is required; none appears.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Brittle awakenings" and "translate isolation into independence" are stated as theme rather than emerging from concrete events. The sundial's secrets remain locked at story's end, offering no resonant answer or conceptual repricing. Paragraphs 11, 15, and 18 repeat thematic claims ("coalesce into a new understanding," "weaving a new narrative") without anchoring in a specific choice or image. The final "promise in the fading light" is abstract assertion, not a non-literal answer grown from particulars. Heavy thematic echo across multiple paragraphs triggers cumulative penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Lyrical diction ("wisps of cloud," "gentle hum," "ethereal glow") is voice-consistent but becomes repetitive template cadence: "as if…," "seemed to…," "as she…" recur across 15+ sentences. Paragraphs 9, 11, 14, and 18 use nearly identical stems ("In the stillness… / In this quiet… / In the silence…"). Filter verbs ("seemed," "felt," "began to") stack in high-pressure closure beats, dulling immediacy. No dialogue appears. Perceptual signature remains generic—no character-specific noticing bias.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: paragraphs 5–6 restate "brittle awakenings = fragility of existence" without added pressure; paragraphs 11, 15, 18 cycle "translate isolation into independence" with synonym churn. Template cadence runs dominate: "The sundial… seemed to…" (paragraphs 4, 11, 21), "Lyra's [body part] [verb]…" (paragraphs 3, 10, 14). Stock metaphors cluster: "whispers of the past," "vast, unfolding narrative," "forging a new path." Filter-verb stacks in final third ("seemed," "felt," "began to") add −0.5 per artifact pack rule; total deduction −1.7 for artifacts touching closure. High-band entries and 9+ disallowed globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Core premise—floating library, reincarnation memory, ancient sundial—follows familiar fantasy-keeper template without transformation. "Brittle awakenings" is an abstract coinage rather than a lived concept. No specific, non-obvious synthesis: Lyra's arc (isolation → independence) is told, not dramatized through risk. The tidal library and stone circle function as atmospheric tokens; removing them would not alter the emotional trajectory. Derivative Premise Guardrail applies: −1.0 for untransformed keeper-of-knowledge template. Safety-middle choices (quiet workspace, contemplative stakes, no friction) avoid bold risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Contemporary of extinct great auks appears once in paragraph 2 as backstory flavor; no decision traces to this identity. Observation only, no causal work.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Brass sundial mentioned in paragraphs 3, 4, 10, 11, 13, 16, 21, 24—eight touches across multiple beats. Early signal +0.3. However, Lyra only polishes and gazes; it never constrains a choice or enables a tactic. Static description dominates; no evolving use. Late first functional touch (paragraph 16 "set aside") is trivial. Missing middle development and closure participation caps at 3.4; pushed to 4.2 by beat count.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Brittle awakenings invoked in paragraphs 5, 11, 18, 23—four mentions. Framed as theme in paragraph 5 +0.3. Never constrains an on-page choice; told-only. Missing middle development and closure participation. Swappable with "fragile epiphanies" or similar. Cap 3.4; ornamental use −0.5 → 2.9; rounding down to 3.1 after adjusting for early signal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>Atomically reflective mentioned once in paragraph 4 as description. No action constrained or enabled. Label-only. Late appearance (second third) −0.3. Missing all three gates. Cap 2.8; ornamental −0.5 → 2.3; swappable −0.4 → 1.9; round down to 1.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Coexist appears in paragraphs 9, 18. Paragraph 9: "allowed her to coexist with memories"; paragraph 18: "coexist with the past." Both are summary statements, not dramatized actions. No beat where coexistence narrows options or incurs cost. Missing middle development. Late first touch (beyond 40%) caps at 4.6.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Hum of ancient stone circle mentioned in paragraphs 8, 9, 12, 17, 23. Early signal +0.3. Paragraph 10: "as if coaxing secrets… by the hum" suggests method, but no mechanics shown. The hum does not shape an attempt or alter a tactic; it remains ambient backdrop. Missing middle causal pressure and closure participation. Swappable with "ambient magic" or similar. Cap 3.4; ornamental −0.5 → 2.9; four touches +0.4 → 3.3; early +0.3 → 3.6; round to 3.9 after considering multi-beat presence.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Tidal library above clouds named early (paragraph 1, 7). Present in most beats; supplies workspace and stone circle foundation. Paragraph 7: "sanctuary for those like Lyra"; paragraph 19: "translate isolation into independence… emerge anew." Setting frames the isolation-to-independence arc but does not constrain a specific choice or alter a tactic. Early +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage (paragraph 24 reprise) +0.7 → base ~5.7; no visible cost tied to setting → cap 6.9 for lack of tactical constraint; final 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>After the reincarnation memory signaled in paragraph 1. Time anchor present. The memory is mentioned (paragraph 2) but does not tighten a decision or shape tactics. Timeframe is vague ("As the day wore on," "days to come"); no live clock. Missing middle development and closure participation. Cap 3.4; vague tracking −0.5 → 2.9; round down to 2.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Translate isolation into independence stated in paragraph 6, repeated in paragraphs 18, 19. Early signal +0.3. Told as desire, not dramatized through conflicted choices. No on-page friction between want and cost; the "weight lifting" (paragraph 20) is summary, not visible tradeoff. Missing middle causal pressure. Swappable with "find purpose" or similar. Cap 3.8 for swappability; three touches +0.9 → 4.7; early +0.3 → 5.0; told-only −0.3 → 4.7; round to 4.9.</comment>
