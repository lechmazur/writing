<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara remains static throughout—her "gently meticulous nature" is label-only and never constrained by choice under pressure. No internal conflict or embodied emotion appears; she simply catalogs, samples, feels excitement, then departs satisfied. The prose asserts wonder and motivation without dramatizing contradictory impulses or a foreclosed path with visible cost. No micro-choices reveal a hierarchy of values.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>No decisive change, renunciation, or stance crystallization occurs on the page. Elara begins cataloging and ends having cataloged; "carrying a piece of that beauty" is summary assertion without visible cost or altered options. The orientation is vague—anchor details arrive late and remain abstract (frozen library "above the clouds"). Drive lens is unclear: the "sampling frequencies" and "hidden harmony" suggest accumulative texture, but no pattern tightens or breaks to reweight the stake with felt cost at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The frozen library and quartz hush establish atmosphere, and the magic lantern slide is handled twice (lifted, returned). However, setting remains postcard-vivid without constraining a choice or altering tactics—Elara's work proceeds unimpeded by cold, altitude, or archive logistics. Spatial choreography is coherent but static. The slide glows "as if" but does not force a trade-off or charge the final image with micro-setting pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserve the luminous vows—is declared but never tested by opposition or scarcity. No reversal, tightening, or deepening narrows options; Elara searches, discovers a pattern, feels satisfaction, and departs. Coincidence does not complicate; agency is observation without renunciation or foreclosed path. No visible price alters tactics, and escalation is absent under any lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The luminous vows motif recurs but remains abstract—"hope and devotion," "living breathing entity"—without grounding in specific ritual or trade-off. The final image asserts Elara as "guardian" and "weaver" without the particulars earning that thematic resonance. The piece gestures toward meaning at "the edge of oblivion" but never dramatizes the cost of preservation versus loss, reducing theme to stated atmosphere rather than emergent pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is generic catalog-prose throughout—"sentinels," "otherworldly light," "ethereal glow"—without character-specific idiom or rhythm shift under pressure. Register remains elevated and consistent but lacks the particularity or diction control that would distinguish Elara's interior texture from ornamental narration. No dialogue present to assess subtext or voice distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "quartz hush" repeated without reweighting (lines 1, 13, 17, 18); "edge of oblivion" (lines 8, 17); "luminous vows" echoed across 10+ lines without evolution. Template cadence: "As she [verb]" structures dominate opening beats. Stock metaphor strings—"sentinels," "fabric of life," "mist that clung"—dull immediacy. High density of filter verbs ("felt," "seemed," "knew") in peak moments flattens propulsion. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("carried with her a piece"), triggering the −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The premise—archivist in sky library discovering ancient vows—reads as a checklist assembly of fantasy catalog tropes without transformation. The magic lantern slide and "sampling frequencies" gesture toward specificity but remain ornamental; the emotional arc (wonder → satisfaction) follows a generic discovery template. No bold structural risk or non-obvious synthesis; the ending's "guardian" and "weaver" labels echo countless chosen-one codas without earned particularity or ironic reweighting.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout but makes no key choice—she catalogs, lifts an object, samples, and departs. Observation without decision. No causal turn traces to her agency; satisfaction is asserted, not earned through trade-off. Late mild development (sampling) but no closure participation that alters outcome. Setup present; missing meaningful development and payoff gates.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The slide is lifted (beat 1), glows "as if" mid-story (beat 2), and is returned (beat 3). Present across three touches but the glow is passive metaphor without tactical consequence. Returned with no reweighted meaning—the act of returning does not foreclose a path or charge the final image. Functional presence with setup, middle appearance, and closure cameo, but swappable with any symbolic archive object. Missing cost connection; the slide does not narrow options or impose price.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>The vows are named repeatedly but remain abstract theme: "promise of hope," "living breathing entity." No on-page ritual, constraint, or tactical choice shaped by vow-mechanics. Echoed as atmosphere rather than stake that changes options. Setup present (paragraph 4); no middle development where vow-logic alters a move; closure mentions "guardian of the luminous vows" as summary label without dramatized participation. Ornamental use.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>"Gently meticulous" appears once as label (paragraph 6) without constraining action or enabling a trade-off. No on-page moment where meticulousness costs time, causes oversight, or grants advantage under pressure. Mentioned, not embodied. Missing all three gates—no setup choice, no middle cost, no closure link. Ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Measure" through "sampling frequencies" is mentioned (paragraphs 5, 12) but the act itself is summarized: "frequencies she sampled revealed a pattern." No dramatized measurement scene; the method and result are told. Setup in paragraph 5; summary development in 12; no closure turn traced to the act of measuring. Functional but replaceable—"analyze" or "study" would fit with minor edits. Missing causal pressure and cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Sampling frequencies" is named twice (paragraphs 5, 12) as method but mechanics remain opaque—what is sampled, how, with what tool? The result (a pattern, hidden harmony) is asserted without showing the sampling process shaping an attempt or altering a tactic. Setup present; middle summary; no closure participation. Swappable with "by cross-referencing texts."</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The frozen library above clouds is established early (paragraph 1) and recurs in imagery (windows, mist, quartz hush). However, it supplies atmosphere without constraining Elara's work—no cold, altitude limits, or archive access problem alters her choices. Setup strong; no middle or closure participation where setting imposes cost or enables a tactic. Postcard description. Micro-setting (the slide, the storage box) is handled but does not shift outcome.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Illusions fade to memory" (title echo in paragraphs 7, 15) and "racing against time" (paragraph 7) are stated but no clock tightens decisions. Hours pass (paragraph 14) without urgency affecting Elara's pace or forcing a trade-off. Setup present as atmospheric claim; no middle beat where fading memory closes an option; closure mentions past→present without dramatized pressure. Time remains vague and untightened.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>"To conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion" is declared (paragraph 8, echoed 17) but never dramatized in conflicted choice. Elara wants to preserve; no friction between this want and a competing cost (fatigue, resource, ethical doubt) appears. Motivation is told, not tested. Setup present as stated drive; no middle cost; closure asserts success without visible sacrifice. Label-only.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"Quartz hush" recurs (paragraphs 1, 13, 17, 18) as atmosphere marker but tone remains static—reverent wonder throughout—with no modulation under pressure or charged shift at closure. The final "quartz hush a reminder" is echo without reweighting. Setup strong; middle repetition without evolution; closure cameo that does not charge the final image with cost. Coherent but unchanging.</comment>
