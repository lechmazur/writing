<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lyra's drive to understand the expedition reads consistently, but her interiority leans on abstract labels ("quietly driven," "sense of unease") rather than embodied contradiction. The whistle touch and pattern-reading show micro-choices, but the final walk into the unknown lacks visible cost or internal friction—she simply proceeds with determination. No second character on the page means relationship pressure is absent. The ending renunciation of the city feels declared rather than earned through a dramatized struggle that forecloses a live option.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Situational-Accumulative Hybrid: pressure from the watchers and the map discovery builds toward Lyra's exit. Closure is Charged Poise—she steps beyond the city's boundary with the watchers looming, options crystallized but cost felt rather than paid on the page. Orientation anchors arrive by the second paragraph (city, cartographer, expedition quest). One meaningful tightening occurs when the shell cracks and reveals the map, narrowing her path. Cost is implied through the oppressive tone and her defiance, but the final image does not make a before/after fully legible with a dramatized forfeiture; the walk forward reads as a setup for what comes next rather than a closure that reweights prior stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The turtle-shell city is vivid and specific (patterns etched into shells, oldest quarter's worn surfaces). The cracking shell mechanism constrains Lyra's discovery and advances plot. Spatial choreography is clean through narrow streets and the city's edge. The setting charges the final image—Lyra leaving the shells behind, watchers looming—making it indispensable to the closure's visual weight. Sensory detail is selective (sun beating down, dust settling) and filtered through Lyra's cartographer lens. The gate of environment shaping a choice is met when the shell's crack reveals the hidden compartment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: uncover the truth behind the lost expedition and confront the watchers. One meaningful tightening occurs when the shell cracks and the map/note are revealed, narrowing Lyra's options to a single path outward. The watchers' silent presence builds oppressive pressure, but Lyra's agency at closure is more stance crystallization than a choice that forecloses a live path with visible cost. The final step beyond the city reads as determination rather than a trade-off that alters tactics or exacts a felt price. No reversal tests her commitment; the map simply confirms what she already sought.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme of inquiry into forbidden knowledge and confronting the unknown emerges through particulars: the rusted gate, the lost expedition's code, the silent watchers. The cracking shell and map discovery ground the thematic question in concrete events. Lyra's journey outward offers a resonant image of stepping into dread without a stated moral. However, "quietly driven" and "sunwashed dread" hover near label-speak, and the ending's defiant whistle-blow feels gestural rather than a non-literal answer that reweights prior material. The watchers' silence remains evocative but thematically unresolved—more atmospheric than a conceptual cost legible on the page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single-POV consistency holds; focalization stays with Lyra throughout. Perceptual signature is present (cartographer's eye for patterns, shell-scarred landmarks) and vocabulary fits her role. No dialogue on the page. The whistle-blow at the end is a purposeful action beat. Psychic distance is stable, with interiority anchored to present stimuli (shell patterns, the crack, the map). Minor register drift: "oppressive and menacing," "sense of defiance rise up within her" lean toward stock phrasing under pressure rather than character-specific syntax. The prose stays clear and voice-motivated, but emotional peaks lack the rhythmic compression or distinct idiom that would elevate to 8+.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Clarity is high; no orientation or causality obscurity. Sentence rhythm varies, but runs of "Lyra felt" and "The [noun] [verb]" create template cadence in the middle third. Paraphrase loops appear: "sense of unease" / "oppressive and menacing"; "quietly driven" recurs without new pressure. "The watchers on the horizon seemed to loom larger" / "the watchers looming before her" / "the watchers watched" cycles without added charge. Figurative language is sparse and functional. Information density is moderate; some lines advance multiple jobs (shell crack + hidden compartment), but scaffolding like "She knew that she had to continue" tells rather than shows urgency. No major line-level artifacts touch closure, so the Non-closure Accumulation Cap limits deductions to −0.8 total.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The turtle-shell city and pattern-language cartography offer a specific synthesis that feels fresh. The lost expedition and silent watchers frame a classic quest with a distinct visual and conceptual angle. However, the emotional arc—driven protagonist ventures into forbidden territory—is familiar, and the story does not transform it through a non-obvious moral calculus or a turn that grows inevitably from character flaw. The shell-cracking discovery feels convenient (triggered by her deciphering, but the mechanism is unexplained) rather than earned through prior choices. Risk-taking in setting and method is notable, but the closure reads as a setup rather than a surprising reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lyra is present throughout and her cartographer role frames the map discovery. Setup is immediate, development occurs when she deciphers the shell patterns and triggers the crack, and she appears in the ending. However, her choices are largely reactive: she reads patterns, finds a map, and walks forward without a trade-off that alters tactics. The final step beyond the city is more stance crystallization than a decision with visible cost. Two beats (shell deciphering, final exit) show involvement, but agency does not narrow options or foreclose a path on the page.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The reed whistle appears in setup (around her neck, a gift) and in the ending (she blows a mournful tune). Two beats and a lyric reprise that reweights the ending image. However, the whistle's use does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic—it is a symbolic gesture of defiance without causal consequence. The watchers do not respond, and Lyra's path forward is unchanged. Present and purposefully placed, but swappable with another gesture (e.g., a shout, a final glance) without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The lost expedition is signaled early (first paragraph) and shapes Lyra's dominant stake throughout. The map and coded note at midpoint deepen the mystery and direct her path to the watchers. The expedition's fate ("terrible fate") is revealed through the code, tightening pressure and justifying the final walk into danger. Present in setup, development (map discovery), and closure context (the watchers who destroyed the expedition loom as Lyra approaches). The concept drives stakes and alters tactics—without it, Lyra has no reason to exit the city. Three gates met; causal pressure and closure linkage are strong.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Quietly driven" is mentioned twice as a label ("quietly driven, consumed by the need" in paragraph 7; "driven by her quietly driven nature" near the end). The trait is told rather than shown through a choice that costs. Lyra's determination is consistent, but no on-page moment dramatizes a conflict between quiet persistence and another impulse (e.g., fear, caution) with a visible trade-off. Setup is present, but development and closure do not turn on this specific attribute—she could be "boldly driven" or "stubbornly driven" with identical beats. Label-only use without constraint or cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The shell crack is the story's central hinge: Lyra deciphers patterns, triggers the crack, and the hidden compartment reveals the map and coded message. Setup is prepared (worn shell, intricate patterns), the action occurs at midpoint and redefines Lyra's options (she now has a map and knowledge of the expedition's fate), and the discovery drives the ending (she follows the map to the watchers). Two beats (triggering the crack, the map's revelation) and strong causal pressure. The crack is irreplaceable—without it, Lyra has no map and no reason to leave the city. Cost is structural: the crack exposes knowledge that compels her into danger.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Through pattern languages" is signaled early (paragraph 2, "every hidden courtyard and shell-scarred landmark"; paragraph 12, "ancient language to unlock the secrets") and Lyra uses it to decipher the shell and the coded note. Setup and development are present. However, the method's mechanics are vague—how pattern-reading differs from ordinary observation is not shown. The method enables the map discovery but does not constrain her approach or introduce a cost (e.g., time, risk of misinterpretation). Functional but replaceable with "ancient code-breaking" or "cartographic skill" without structural loss. Present in closure context (she has the map) but not active in the final image.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The turtle-shell city is described vividly in the opening and anchors every beat. The shells' patterns provide the puzzle Lyra deciphers, and the city's edge defines her threshold crossing. Setup is immediate, development occurs when the shell cracks and the urban quarter's worn state signals danger, and the ending shows Lyra leaving the shells behind. The setting shapes one key choice (she must leave the city to confront the watchers) and charges the final image (the shells dwindling into the distance). Specificity is high (spiral-shell cartographer, oldest quarter, narrow streets) and the turtle-city is irreplaceable for closure's visual weight. However, the turtles themselves do not constrain tactics—they are a backdrop rather than an active element that alters Lyra's approach.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"After the gate rusts shut" is mentioned in paragraph 4 as the moment the expedition vanished. The rusted gate frames the backstory and implies a closed barrier, but it does not tighten Lyra's present decisions or create a live clock. Setup is present (the gate's closure is the inciting condition), but development and closure do not turn on time pressure. Lyra's journey outward is not constrained by a deadline or the passage of time. The timeframe is a historical marker, not a tactical constraint. Functional as context but swappable with "after the expedition disappeared" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Lyra's desire to question the watchers is stated early ("the watchers on the horizon," "question the silent watchers") and drives every beat. The map discovery confirms the watchers' role in the expedition's fate, and the ending dramatizes her approach to them. Setup, development (map reveals their danger), and closure (she steps toward them) are all present. However, the motivation is told more than shown—Lyra's internal friction between curiosity and dread is asserted ("sense of dread," "sense of defiance") rather than embodied in a choice that costs. The whistle-blow at the end gestures toward confrontation, but the watchers' silence leaves the friction unresolved. Two beats and closure linkage, but the desire does not face a concrete on-page test that forces a trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Sunwashed dread" is coherent throughout: the sun beats down repeatedly, and oppressive menace accumulates as Lyra approaches the watchers. Setup establishes the tone (oldest quarter's unease, sun's heat), development intensifies it (crack spreading, dread washing over her), and the final image charges it (watchers' "haunting, sunwashed dread" in the last line). The tone modulates with pressure—calm observation in the opening, rising dread at the map discovery, crystallized menace at the ending. The specific pairing of brightness and dread is sustained and reweights the closure image. Three gates met; the tone is indispensable to the story's emotional texture and final charge.</comment>
