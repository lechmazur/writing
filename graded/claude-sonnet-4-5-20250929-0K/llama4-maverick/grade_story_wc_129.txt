<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Kael's desire to belong is stated repeatedly but never tested with meaningful internal contradiction or visible cost. The "boldly sympathetic nature" appears as exposition rather than dramatized choice under pressure. The transformation from isolation to connection arrives through community reception rather than Kael's own conflicted agency. Interiority relies on abstract declarations ("webs of kinship," "luminescent ache") instead of embodied, character-particular perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The story summarizes years of activity rather than dramatizing a single pressurized window. Orientation is present but the drive lens remains unclear—neither causal linkage nor accumulative density governs the final paragraphs, which offer retrospective summary instead of on-page closure. The arbor's acceptance by the community is told, not shown, and no felt cost accompanies the resolution. The Cost Proof Test fails: no exact sentence in the ending beat makes sacrifice or foreclosure legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard and glimmering obsidian arbor are vividly named and provide atmospheric specificity. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—it remains scenic backdrop. The street artist's tag is described but does not shape Kael's tactics or reweight the final image with pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—belonging—is signaled early but never tightened through on-page reversal or decision that forecloses an option. The tag search offers no meaningful obstacle or cost; it resolves immediately and easily. The arbor's community reception is summarized across years without visible price or tactical shift. No escalation or deepening under any identifiable lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme of connection and belonging emerges through repeated declaration rather than concrete image or conflicted choice. The final paragraphs offer overt moralizing ("a reminder of the importance of connection and belonging") instead of earned resonance. The glimmering arbor functions as transparent symbol rather than accumulating specific pressure. The street artist's tag does not recur or reweight prior material at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Single third-person POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present but generic—Kael notices beauty and connection without character-specific bias or idiom. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("luminescent ache," "webs of kinship") that feels authorial rather than filtered through Kael's mind under pressure. The final third shifts into retrospective summary, abandoning scene immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "webs of kinship" appears five times; "connection" and "belong" recur with near-identical phrasing across adjacent paragraphs. Template cadence dominates the final third with summary structures ("Years went by," "became a staple," "remained a testament"). Stock metaphors ("glimmering," "shimmering," "luminescent") appear in most sentences without variation. These artifacts touch the closure zone, triggering the −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact cap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The premise—artist seeks belonging through their craft—follows a widely used template without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The street artist's tag, crystalline orchard, and obsidian arbor are named with specificity but function as ornamental furniture rather than integrated elements that force fresh synthesis. No risk-taking or perspective that could not be swapped for generic equivalents with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Kael is present throughout but does not make a key on-page decision that alters tactics or forecloses an option. The search and the dedication are stated rather than dramatized as pressurized choices. Setup and development gates are present; closure participation is summary-only.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The arbor is mentioned in the opening, worked on after the tag discovery, and presented to the community—three beats. However, its properties never constrain choice or change under pressure; it remains static description. Closure linkage is retrospective summary rather than charged reprise. Swappable with any symbolic craft object.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Webs of kinship" is echoed as thematic language five times but never shapes an on-page decision or tactic. It functions as abstract claim rather than dramatized pressure. No cost tied to this concept is visible.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Boldly sympathetic" appears once as label exposition in paragraph three. No on-page action demonstrates this trait under pressure, and no tradeoff or cost flows from it. Missing development and closure gates.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Dedicate" is stated in the closure zone ("dedicate their life") and frames the arbor's creation. However, the act is told rather than shown in a beat with cost. Setup is weak, development is summary-only, and the payoff is declarative. One gate (payoff) is marginally present.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The shared search is proposed, conducted, and resolved in three paragraphs. Its mechanics do not shape attempts or impose constraint—Lyra simply points to the tag. Setup and development gates present; closure participation weak. Easily swappable with any discovery method.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard is named early, provides atmospheric detail during the search, and recurs in the ending image under moonrise. However, it does not pressure a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome. Lyric reprise reweights the stake weakly; specificity elevates slightly but remains postcard description.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Beyond the murmur of lost languages" appears once in paragraph four as poetic phrase without temporal constraint. Years pass in summary; no clock tightens decisions. Missing all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The desire "to graft oneself onto community" is stated early, drives the search and arbor creation, and is fulfilled at closure. However, no friction between want and cost is dramatized on the page—the community welcomes Kael without visible sacrifice or foreclosed path. Two gates present; causal pressure weak.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Luminescent ache" is named twice and used to describe Kael's creative process. The tone is consistent but static—it does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image, which shifts into summary retrospective. Setup and weak development present; closure participation absent.</comment>
