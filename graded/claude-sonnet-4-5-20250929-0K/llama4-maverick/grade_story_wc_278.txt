<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The tattooist remains opaque—her micro-choices are narrated but lack contradictory impulses acting in scene. The guilt that drives her is summarized repeatedly ("dissonance of old guilt," "her own guilt began to surface") without embodied cost or dramatized struggle. The attribute "translates baby cries" is label-only; no on-page moment shows this skill constraining a choice. Interior voice relies on stock metaphors ("weight of her guilt lift") and therapy-speak rather than character-particular perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early, but causality is weak: "haunted firmware" whispers recede when she wraps cord around her wrist with no mechanism or cost shown. The letters appear suddenly in paragraph eight without prior signal and connect to her guilt only by assertion. Time "folds in on itself" is announced but never dramatizes a before/after change in options or knowledge. The ending offers atmospheric closure ("meteor hush," "vanished into the dawn") without a legible decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing tied to prior causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The laboratory setup is vivid (sandalwood, myrrh, machinery hum, antique dresser), and the amber talisman recurs across beats. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics—objects are described but not used to pressure decisions. The "meteor hush" tone is asserted rather than built through sensory modulation. Spatial choreography is minimal; the tattooist works alone with no physical friction from the setting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—hushing guilt via her art—is signaled but never tested on the page. No reversal or tightening narrows options; the firmware whispers simply recede when she uses the cord without visible cost or trade-off. Clients report peace in summary, not scene. The letters' sorrow and the tattooist's guilt are told to converge ("she felt a kinship") without an on-page action that forecloses a path or crystallizes a stance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Theme (guilt, healing through art) is stated rather than earned: "by confronting it, she had begun to heal" is assertion, not dramatized consequence. The amber, cord, and meteor hush are introduced as symbols but never constrain choice or accumulate pressure toward a non-literal answer. The ending's "new beginnings" and "gentle cooing" deliver a tidy moral rather than resonant ambiguity. Diagnostic phrasing ("dissonance of old guilt," "inner turmoil") appears in the final third without embodied cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Voice is consistent and carries a lyric texture ("constellation of lost sounds," "susurrus that seemed to carry the weight of the stars"), but the narrator's perceptual signature is generic—elevated diction without character-specific bias. No dialogue appears to test register or subtext. Psychic distance is stable, though filter verbs ("she felt," "she knew") appear frequently without voice motivation. The prose reads as atmospheric consensus rather than a singular, biased perspective.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "her own guilt began to surface" / "dissonance of old guilt had been haunting her" / "her own guilt began to lose its hold" / "feeling the weight of her guilt lift" restates the same content across four separate beats without added pressure. Template cadence appears in adjacent lines: "She had acquired it recently" / "She had dubbed this phenomenon" / "She felt a kinship." Stock metaphors ("shimmers," "weight of the stars," "petals of a flower") cluster without fresh specificity. Information density is low; scaffolding sentences narrate process without advancing situation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The core premise—tattoos that absorb fears and desires—echoes familiar metaphysical-tattoo templates without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. "Haunted firmware" and "translates baby cries" are quirky labels grafted onto the frame without causal integration. The amber talisman, antique letters, and meteor hush read as prompt-fulfillment checklist rather than inevitable synthesis. Emotional arc (guilt → peace) is generic and could apply with different names and setting.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Present throughout but makes no causal decisions that alter tactics. She wraps the cord, reads letters, and works on—all passive or observational. No on-page turn traces to her agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Mentioned in three beats (talisman paragraph, "seemed to stir," glows at end) but never handled or used to constrain a choice. Static description; no mechanical role in escalation or closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>Introduced early (paragraph five) and returns at resolution, but the mechanics are vague—whispers recede without shown cause. Does not shape tactics or narrow options on the page.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>Label-only mention in paragraph twelve ("ability to translate baby cries") with no on-page demonstration. Final paragraph mentions baby cries but does not show translation or tie it to a choice or cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Cord appears in two beats: she reaches for it, wraps it around her wrist, and "felt a sense of stability return." Functional but swappable—any grounding object could serve the same role without altering story logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Letters appear in paragraph eight, are read, and the tattooist feels connection. The method (found in antique dresser) is present but does not shape multiple attempts or constrain closure. Summary-only involvement.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Laboratory setup is detailed and recurs across beats, but the setting never pressures a choice or alters outcome. Postcard-level description; no micro-setting constraint on tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.2</grade><comment>"Time began to fold in on itself" is announced in paragraph fourteen but does not dramatize a clock, deadline, or temporal constraint that alters moves. Ornamental temporal label without mechanical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Guilt is the stated motive, signaled early and recurring, but it is told rather than dramatized in conflicted choices. No on-page moment shows a trade-off between hushing guilt and another cost. Summary-driven.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Meteor hush" appears twice (paragraphs fourteen and twenty-eight) as a tonal label. The tone is asserted ("calming and unsettling," "gentle susurrus") but does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image through rhythm or sensory shift.</comment>
