<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elian's internal life is told rather than embodied—"felt an inexplicable connection," "felt a sense of calm," "felt a sense of clarity"—reducing interiority to label-only emotional reports. The protagonist's journey from tinkerer to navigator is asserted through summary ("he had created something truly remarkable") rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses or visible micro-choices under pressure. Motivation for creating the device arrives late and is explained rather than tested: "befriend uncertainty" is stated as realization, not earned through on-page struggle. No meaningful internal conflict; the compass rose guides his hands without resistance or cost, flattening agency into convenience.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first paragraph, meeting the baseline test. However, causality is thin: Elian finds the compass rose, walks to the greenhouse, improvises a device, and emerges with newfound clarity—each beat linked by "and then" rather than "because." The closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration ("uncertainly certain" as guide), but the cost is purely asserted ("weight of the compass rose still held in his hand") without a visible forfeiture, trade-off, or foreclosed path on the page. The device's function and the nature of Elian's transformation remain abstract, undermining closure legibility under any lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The subterranean setting, waterfall acoustics, and neglected greenhouse are rendered with sensory specificity ("scent of damp earth and mold," "swirling leaves," "glass panes cloudy with grime"). The greenhouse functions as a micro-setting where improvisation occurs, meeting the two-beat threshold and contributing to the ending's spatial frame. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome; it remains atmospheric backdrop rather than tactical pressure, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Elian seeking direction and clarity—is signaled early but never tightened or tested. No on-page reversal or escalation: the compass rose appears, guides his hands without friction, and the device completes successfully with no setback, sacrifice, or complication. The resolution ("felt a sense of clarity") is declared rather than earned through agency or cost. Coincidence (finding the heirloom) enables rather than complicates, and no price is paid for the transformation, violating the core escalation and cost requirements.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The theme of befriending uncertainty emerges through particulars (broken clocks, lost compass rose, improvised device) rather than direct statement, meeting baseline coherence. The final image ("uncertainly certain") attempts a non-literal answer but is undercut by explicit moralizing: "coincidence becomes pattern when viewed through the lens of time" and "to befriend uncertainty in planning" are stated rather than dramatized. The compass rose recurs across beats and shifts from lost heirloom to trusted companion, providing thematic texture, but the ending's resonance is diluted by on-the-nose articulation of the concept.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, with no head-hopping or filter-verb abuse. Diction remains consistent ("worn and weathered hands," "ethereal light," "uncharted territories") with slight elevation at closure that fits the reflective mode. However, the voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature—details are generic rather than character-specific (e.g., "the sound of the waterfall" recurs without Elian's particular way of noticing). No dialogue is present to test speech distinction. Psychic distance is consistent but lacks modulation under pressure, flattening emotional texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Paragraph rhythm varies purposefully, and sensory detail is vivid without purple excess. However, paraphrase loops appear frequently: "Elian felt a sense of calm" / "Elian felt a sense of clarity" / "Elian felt a sense of pride"; "the sound of the waterfall" recurs four times with near-identical phrasing. Template cadence: "As he picked it up," "As he worked," "As he made his way," "As the device whirred." Figurative language ("river" for path, "ashes of his past") is generic rather than character-particular. Information density is moderate; pivotal beats (device creation, closure) are summarized rather than shown, reducing propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The core premise—tinkerer finds magical compass rose, creates device, gains clarity—follows a familiar quest-for-meaning template without transformation. The subterranean setting and neglected greenhouse offer spatial specificity, but the emotional arc (lost → found clarity) and symbolic apparatus (compass rose, broken clocks, navigating life's paths) rely on stock metaphors. "Uncertainly certain" and "coincidence becomes pattern" are concept-labels rather than lived particulars. The device's nature and function remain abstract, missing the verifiable detail that would anchor freshness. No bold structural or perspectival risk elevates the execution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elian is present across all beats (setup, middle, ending), meeting the gate model's requirements. However, his choices are minimal: he picks up the compass rose, walks to the greenhouse, improvises with the compass rose "guiding his hands," and emerges with the completed device. The compass rose drives the improvisation, reducing Elian's agency to observation and execution without on-page decision-making that alters tactics or forecloses options. Functional presence without causal pressure or visible cost tied to his choices.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The compass rose appears early (setup), is used during device creation (middle), and is held at closure, meeting all three gates. It is handled across three distinct beats: discovery, improvisation, and final image. However, its function is largely passive—it "seemed to be guiding his hands" and "glowing at the heart of the device"—without specific mechanical or symbolic properties that constrain choice or enable tactics under pressure. The ending reprise ("weight of the compass rose, now a trusted companion") reweights meaning but the cost connection is asserted rather than dramatized. Solid integration with lyric resonance but lacks causal pressure or irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Beneath the ashes" appears only as thematic language: "uncover the secrets that lay beneath the ashes of his past." The concept is mentioned once, late (beyond midpoint), without shaping stakes, tactics, or on-page choices. It functions as metaphorical decoration rather than a constraint or resource that alters action. Missing setup and development gates; ornamental use without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Uncertainly certain" appears three times: as descriptor of Elian's study of the compass rose, in the phrase "uncertainly certain" applied to the path at closure, and as thematic echo. The trait is label-only without constraining or enabling a specific on-page action with visible cost. It functions as thematic assertion rather than dramatic pressure. Present in setup and ending (two gates) but missing middle development; no visible trade-off or cost tied to the attribute.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Improvise" is signaled and executed in the greenhouse sequence, where Elian "began to improvise, using the materials around him to create a new device." The action drives the middle beat and connects to closure (the completed device). However, the improvisation itself is summarized rather than shown in specific choices or constraints, and the device's function remains abstract. The action is present across beats but could be replaced with "construct" or "assemble" without structural loss. Meets setup and ending gates with moderate causal pressure but lacks irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Through the swirling leaves in a neglected greenhouse" is signaled early and provides the spatial method for improvisation. The leaves "swirled around him, releasing the scent of decay and rebirth," establishing atmosphere, and the greenhouse setting houses the device creation. However, the mechanics of how leaves contribute to the method are absent—they function as ambient detail rather than tactical resource. Present in setup and middle (two gates) but missing clear closure participation; the ending returns to the waterfall rather than the greenhouse. Functional setting without specific mechanical integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The subterranean waterfall is anchored early, recurs acoustically across beats ("sound of the waterfall echoed," "growing fainter," "grew louder once more," "receded into the background"), and frames the final spatial context. It meets setup and ending gates and is woven through middle beats. However, it does not pressure choices or supply resources that affect outcome—it functions as atmospheric constant rather than tactical constraint or micro-setting that alters options. Solid presence and purposeful recurrence without causal integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"When coincidence becomes pattern" appears only as thematic statement near closure: "It was as if he had finally begun to grasp the concept that coincidence becomes pattern when viewed through the lens of time." The timeframe does not track narrative clock or tighten decisions; instead, the piece unfolds in vague sequential time ("spent his days," "as he worked," "in that moment") without deadlines or temporal pressure. Missing setup and middle gates; the concept is told rather than dramatized through temporal tactics or pattern recognition that alters choices.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"To befriend uncertainty in planning" is stated explicitly late: "Elian realized that his motivation for creating the device had not been to impose order on a chaotic world, but to befriend uncertainty in planning." The motivation is told as realization rather than dramatized through conflicting desires or on-page friction between wants and costs. It appears in the ending but is absent from setup and middle development, missing two gates. The device creation proceeds smoothly without uncertainty creating tension or trade-offs, undermining the concept's causal role.</comment>
