<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lyra remains a function—cautiously hopeful celestial signal interpreter—rather than a person with embodied contradictions. Her motivation to "outwit cosmic tricksters" is declared but never dramatized through competing impulses or visible cost; she adjusts dials, feels shivers, and succeeds without genuine struggle. The "motley crew of students and enthusiasts" are stage furniture with no pressure applied. Internal experience is summarized ("felt a shiver," "surge of excitement") using stock phrases rather than shown through micro-choices that foreclose options.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within range, but no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs—Lyra sends a counter-signal and the problem simply dwindles with no on-page cost or trade-off. The "crisis averted" is told in summary: "reports of strange occurrences dwindling" lacks a concrete before/after image or felt price. The piece attempts a Decisive Change but closure is asserted rather than dramatized, and the inferred lens (causal) collapses into convenience plotting where the protagonist's single action solves everything off-page. No visible or felt cost at the ending beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The university radio station is named and the console glows, but spatial choreography remains vague—no constraints on movement or resources that alter Lyra's tactics. Astronomical charts are "spread out before her" and annotated, yet they function as set dressing rather than tools that pressure choice. The "cramped" station and "hiss of static" provide atmospheric texture, but the environment never narrows options or charges the final image. Sensory detail is present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>A dominant stake (stopping cosmic tricksters) is declared early, but pressure remains static—Lyra tunes dials, finds a pattern, sends a counter-signal, and succeeds without reversal, complication, or visible trade-off. No on-page cost: the resolution is summarized ("reports of strange occurrences dwindling") rather than dramatized. The piece reads as outline beats linked by "and then" rather than escalating pressure under a coherent lens. Agency is present but consequence is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme of cosmic balance and human ingenuity emerges faintly from events, but the final paragraphs dissolve into abstract moralizing: "using her gifts to outwit the cosmic tricksters and bring harmony to the universe, one subsonic frequency at a time" and "The world was full of mystery and wonder." These declarations replace scene pressure with thesis statements. No non-literal answer; the ending restates the premise rather than reweighting it. The astronomical charts shift significance off-page without concrete reprisal that charges closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping, and psychic distance remains consistent. However, diction flattens into generic motivational prose at key beats: "her spirit infused with a sense of wonder," "the celestial ballet, dancing to the rhythm of the universe." Perceptual signature is weak—Lyra's way of noticing could belong to any hopeful scientist. Sentence stems repeat: "Lyra felt," "Lyra realized," "Lyra knew" across adjacent paragraphs without variation. No dialogue to assess.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Pervasive paraphrase loops and synonym churn: "cautiously hopeful" recurs as label four times; "cosmic tricksters" eight times without variation. Template cadence dominates: "The [noun], [descriptor], [past tense verb]" opens multiple paragraphs. Stock metaphors proliferate: "stars twinkled like diamonds," "fabric of reality," "celestial ballet." The final third summarizes rather than dramatizes closure, and figurative language in peak beats ("ethereal grit," "resonant harmonics") reads ornamental. Artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering disqualification from 9+ and high-band caps per Q7 penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The premise (radio signals solve cosmic disturbances) follows a familiar template without transformation through specific world logic or moral calculus. "Cosmic tricksters" remain abstract antagonists; their motives and methods are never grounded. The counter-signal solution arrives without earned causality—no prior limitation that this exact action overcomes. Emotional arc (cautious hope validated) is predictable and lacks the specificity or risk-taking that would distinguish it. The piece hedges toward median safety.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lyra is present throughout and makes the key choice to send the counter-signal, satisfying setup, middle, and payoff gates. However, her decision lacks visible cost or friction—she adjusts dials and succeeds without forfeiting options or facing consequences. The role is functional but her choices do not meaningfully narrow later paths. Present in closure (final paragraphs restate her vigilance) but not causally transformed there.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Astronomical charts appear in the opening ("spread out before her," "annotated with cryptic symbols") and return in the penultimate paragraph ("now seemed to hold a new significance"), satisfying setup and payoff. However, middle development is absent—Lyra does not consult or revise them during the signal work. Their "new significance" is told rather than shown through reweighted use. Swappable with any research tool.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Power plays" is mentioned once in narration ("disrupt their power plays") but never dramatized through tactics or choice. The cosmic tricksters' influence is abstract; no on-page contest of wills or tactical adaptation occurs. The concept functions as a theme label rather than shaping stakes or altering options. Missing middle development and closure participation; present only as decoration.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Cautiously hopeful" is labeled four times but never constrains or enables action with cost. Lyra's caution does not prevent her from sending the signal, nor does her hope drive a risky trade-off. The trait describes mood rather than forcing choices. Present in setup and closure (final paragraph: "cautiously hopeful anticipation") but ornamental throughout. No visible friction or price tied to this attribute.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Interfere" is the verb for Lyra's counter-signal action midway through, satisfying middle development and shaping the turn toward resolution. Setup is implicit (her goal to disrupt), and the action appears in closure reflections ("played a key role in outwitting"). However, the interference itself is summarized in one beat without dramatized resistance or cost, making it functional but not indispensable—"counteract" or "block" would serve equivalently.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Subsonic frequencies are signaled early ("tuning into the subsonic frequencies") and used in the key action ("Through the subsonic frequencies, Lyra sent out a counter-signal"), satisfying setup and middle. Payoff is weak—the final paragraphs mention them once in retrospective summary. The mechanics matter (Lyra tunes to find the pattern) but the method is not uniquely essential; radio waves or harmonic signals would function similarly with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The university radio station is named in the opening, provides the console and controls Lyra uses, and is restated in the final third ("The university radio station remained a hub of activity"), satisfying all three gates. However, the setting supplies resources (dials, console) without constraining choice—no competing demands, limited broadcast window, or spatial pressure. The "cramped" descriptor is mentioned but not leveraged. Functional but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"As the community divides" appears only in the opening clause and once more as context ("the divided community"). No live clock or escalating division pressures Lyra's choices; the timeframe is static backdrop rather than a tightening constraint. Missing middle development and closure participation. The community's healing is mentioned in retrospect but not dramatized. Ornamental use.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The motivation "to outwit cosmic tricksters" is declared early and restated at closure ("using her gifts to outwit the cosmic tricksters"), satisfying setup and payoff. Middle development is present: Lyra's signal work pursues this goal. However, the desire is never dramatized through conflicting costs—no sacrifice or friction between this want and another need. The tricksters remain abstract, so outwitting them lacks felt stakes. Functional but told-only.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Ethereal grit" is named once midway ("had taken on an ethereal grit") but not sustained or modulated through turns. Early tone is earnest and hopeful; late tone drifts into inspirational abstraction ("stars twinkled like diamonds," "celestial ballet") without grit. The piece does not teach a coherent tonal pattern or charge the final image with this duality. Present as a label but not embodied across beats.</comment>
