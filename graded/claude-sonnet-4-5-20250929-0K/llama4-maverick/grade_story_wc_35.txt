<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's ability to taste memories is established but never constrains her choices in pivotal moments—she moves through the fortress, approaches the pavilion, and absorbs remorse without visible cost or trade-off shaping her decisions. The "emotionally contagious through touch" trait appears only as label in two beats (sand, coral) without altering tactics or forecloses options. Internal contradiction is absent; the character arc (resilient healer) reads as summary rather than dramatized struggle with on-page micro-choices under pressure. Backstory and reflection ("She believed…", "Elara's motivation was…") occupy ~25% without anchoring to present micro-choices that tilt stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive promptly (fortress, kitchens, chef). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers images (fortress, dunes, tidal pool, pavilion) and ends with Elara standing at the fortress heart after subsuming remorse—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: she has faced stored remorse and emerged). However, the cost is asserted ("weight of the pavilion's presence," "peace settle over her") rather than shown through a concrete forfeiture or tactical shift on the page. The closure image ("Elara…stood at its heart, a symbol of resilience") summarizes rather than charges prior material with visible price, weakening the RR's felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The desert fortress, dunes, tidal pool, and coral pavilion are vividly rendered with sensory detail (wet sandstone, ozone, cool sand, otherworldly glow). The tidal pool and pavilion constrain Elara's path spatially—she walks out, kneels, enters the pavilion—but do not alter a tactical choice at a pressure point. The micro-setting (sand transmitting memories via touch) is noted but does not force a trade-off. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout; the setting charges atmosphere but does not pivot a decision or the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("to sandpaper rough memories, to smooth out the jagged edges") is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through imagery (fortress → dunes → tidal pool → pavilion) but no on-page reversal or tightening forces Elara to narrow options or pay a visible price. She seeks the pavilion, touches it, subsumes the memories, and feels peace—a linear progression without a moment where agency forecloses a path or a choice backfires. The ending asserts resolution ("no longer be a source of pain") without demonstrating the cost of her subsuming act in altered tactics or lost capacity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme (healing through absorption of pain, the persistence of memory) emerges from the premise and imagery. The coral pavilion and tidal pool function as symbolic repositories but do not shift meaning beat-to-beat; they are introduced and used once without reprise or reweighting. The final image ("a symbol of resilience") states theme rather than offering a non-literal answer through action or charged detail. Subtext is present in the juxtaposition of desert and ocean motifs, but the ending's moralizing tone ("she had emerged stronger") replaces earned resonance with summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; perceptual signature (chef who tastes memories) is established but not exploited under pressure—no moment where memory-taste complicates a choice. Diction is consistent and slightly elevated ("inexplicable connection," "coalesce," "delicate architecture") without register breaks. Psychic distance narrows appropriately when Elara touches sand and coral. However, voice lacks character-specific rhythm; sentences often open with stock constructions ("As she worked," "As she walked," "As the memories subsided") creating template cadence that dulls momentum at key beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Clarity is high; grammar clean; no pronoun ambiguity. However, scaffold and loops pervade: "Elara's gift was both a blessing and a curse" / "remorse…lingered" / "memories…bitter" recur in paraphrase across paragraphs. Template cadence dominates transitions ("As she worked," "As she walked," "As she stood," "As she turned") appearing ≥5 times, flattening rhythm. Filter-verb stacks ("felt an inexplicable connection," "felt the weight," "felt a sense of peace") cluster in the final third without voice justification. Information density is moderate; pivotal beats (touching pavilion, subsuming memories) are told rather than shown through sensory particulars and immediate consequence. Deductions: template cadence −0.6, filter stacks −0.5, paraphrase loops −0.3; total band ~5.7, and artifacts in final third disallow 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Premise (chef who tastes memories seeks coral pavilion of stored remorse) combines elements in a fresh constellation, but execution leans on familiar healing-journey architecture without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The pavilion and tidal pool are vivid but do not drive a surprising turn; Elara's journey proceeds linearly from fortress to pavilion to resolution without earned complication. Voice and setting feel more assembled than inevitable; the ending's "symbol of resilience" summary replaces a memorable image with generic affirmation. No close derivative echoes, but the synthesis lacks the specificity that would make it irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Chef who can taste memories: Present throughout (setup ✓, middle ✓, closure ✓). However, the trait shapes description more than decision—Elara's choices (walk to dunes, kneel at pool, touch pavilion) do not hinge on her memory-tasting ability in a way that alters tactics or forecloses options. The ability is asserted as context but does not constrain or enable a key turn with visible cost. Functional but largely replaceable; another empathic trait could serve the same arc. Score: setup +0.5, two beats (kitchens, pavilion touch) +0.9, no causal pressure or cost linkage, swappability −0.6, ornamental −0.6 → base ~3.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Coral icebound pavilion beneath the dunes: Introduced mid-story (~35% mark), visited once at climax. Setup signal weak (mentioned in reflection before dramatized), developed in one extended beat (Elara approaches and touches), and present at closure as the site of memory subsumption. The pavilion enables the climactic act but does not constrain earlier choices or return with reweighted meaning; it is destination rather than recurring object. Score: late first appearance −0.3, one beat +0.4, closure linkage +0.7, no mid-development or causal constraint, swappability (another repository) −0.6 → ~4.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Stored remorse: Framed early as the pavilion's purpose, governs the dominant stake, and shapes the ending action (Elara subsumes the stored remorse). Present in setup (reflection on pavilion), developed implicitly (tidal pool as micro-repository, sand memories), and paid off at closure (touching pavilion releases stored remorse). However, the concept is told more than shown—remorse is asserted rather than dramatized through conflicting micro-choices or visible cost. Score: setup +0.5, two beats (reflection, pavilion touch) +0.9, closure linkage +0.8, no on-page constraint or visible cost tied to this concept −0.8, summary-only use −0.3 → ~4.6, capped at 4.6 for missing concrete middle constraint.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Emotionally contagious through touch: Mentioned twice (sand transmits memories, coral releases pavilion memories) but functions as passive reception rather than active constraint. No on-page cost or trade-off shown—Elara does not choose to touch or avoid touch under pressure; the trait enables plot (memory transfer) without narrowing options or forcing visible sacrifice. Ornamental label. Score: setup weak (first explicit mention ~50%), two beats (sand, coral) +0.9, no causal pressure, no cost, swappable (empathic vision, proximity sensing) −0.7, label-only −0.3, late appearance −0.3 → ~2.8, capped at 2.8 for missing closure participation as active force.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Subsume: The verb appears in the climactic beat ("Elara's goal was to subsume these memories") and describes the pavilion encounter. Present in middle reflection and enacted at closure, giving two-gate coverage. However, "subsume" is used as summary label for an off-page process—the text does not dramatize the mechanics or cost of subsuming (does Elara lose capacity? gain weight? change perception?). The action is central but told rather than shown through micro-turns. Score: setup (goal stated mid-story) +0.3, two beats (reflection, pavilion) +0.9, closure linkage +0.8, no visible cost or specificity on how subsuming constrains later state −0.8, summary-only −0.4 → ~5.3.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>Analyzing tidal pool formations: Mentioned once in one sentence ("By analyzing the tidal pool formations, Elara sought to understand the hidden patterns") without mechanics, prior setup, or consequence. The analysis does not shape an attempt, alter a tactic, or return at closure. Ornamental mention. Score: late first appearance (final third) −0.8, one mention (not a full beat), no setup or payoff, ornamental −0.8, summary-only −0.4 → ~2.1, capped at 2.8 for missing closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Desert fortress after rain: Anchors opening and closing sentences, framing the story with a physical and atmospheric constant (damp walls, ozone, wet earth). The fortress serves as spatial home base and thematic symbol (sturdy, enduring). However, the setting does not constrain a tactical choice—Elara leaves the fortress freely, walks the dunes, and returns without the fortress architecture altering options. Lyric reprise present (first line → final paragraph) that reweights by charging resilience theme. Score: setup +0.8, closure reprise +1.0, no middle constraint or causal pressure, micro-setting (body/tool) absent, postcard tone in middle −0.5 → ~5.8.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>At the close of an unspoken dream: Appears once as poetic timestamp ("At the close of an unspoken dream, Elara found herself standing at the edge") without prior setup, mechanical clarity, or consequence. The phrase does not establish urgency, track elapsed time, or alter decisions. Vague metaphor that could be removed without affecting plot. Score: late first appearance −0.6, ornamental −0.8, no causal work, swappable (twilight, nightfall) −0.6 → ~1.9, capped at 2.8 for missing closure and development gates.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>To sandpaper rough memories: Stated explicitly as motivation early ("Elara's motivation was to sandpaper rough memories"), governs the journey to the pavilion, and is fulfilled in the ending ("Elara had sandpapered the rough memories"). Present in setup, implicit in middle (tidal pool as pattern-seeking), and summarized at closure. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicting micro-choices or visible friction between want and cost. No on-page moment shows Elara hesitating, paying a price, or choosing this goal over another. Score: setup +0.6, two beats (reflection, closure summary) +0.9, closure linkage +0.7, told-only friction −0.8, no visible cost −0.5 → ~5.1.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Sturdy brittle: Descriptor applied once to Elara's tone at the pavilion ("her tone sturdy and brittle, like the fortress itself"). The phrase does not modulate with pressure or recur to charge earlier or later images; single static application. The fortress metaphor (sturdy, enduring) is present at opening and closing but "brittle" does not integrate into the emotional arc or sensory texture beyond this one line. Score: closure mention +0.3, metaphoric link to fortress +0.4, single static mood (no modulation) −0.6, ornamental late mention −0.5 → ~4.7, trends mid-low per band guidance.</comment>
