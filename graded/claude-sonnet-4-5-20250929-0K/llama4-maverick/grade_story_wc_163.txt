<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The astrologer remains opaque throughout—motivation is told ("to learn the rhythm of belonging") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. Interiority consists almost entirely of abstract states ("sense of quiet satisfaction," "luminous respite") with no specific sensory texture or character-particular thought pattern. The burnt feather is handled but never constrains a choice or reveals internal conflict; the character's "softly ingenious methods" are asserted, not dramatized. No meaningful change or renunciation occurs on the page; the astrologer simply "knew that they had achieved their goal" without visible cost or foreclosed path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: who/where/when anchors emerge piecemeal across the opening paragraphs without a stable frame by ~120 words, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). No on-page closure unit exists—the protagonist walks in, senses vague vibrations, then claims discovery without a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing. The stated goal ("to captivate the essence") never narrows options or faces a test; the story ends with assertion ("they knew that they had achieved their goal") rather than a visible cost or reweighted image. Drive lens is ambiguous (neither clear causal linkage nor pattern-taught accumulative structure), and no meaningful tightening occurs.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The underwater research facility is named but never grounded in spatial choreography—corridors, a central lab, and bioluminescent walls float without distance, access logic, or tactical constraint. Sensory detail (bioluminescence, hum, shadows) is generic and repetitive, unfiltered by the astrologer's professional or personal priorities. The burnt feather and facility do not pressure a single choice; setting functions as backdrop only. No object, environment feature, or body constraint shapes the ending image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("to learn the rhythm of belonging") is declared but never tested on the page; no opposition, constraint, or reversal narrows options. The astrologer's task unfolds as a sequence of passive sensing ("began to sense," "connection grew stronger") with no decision, renunciation, or trade-off. Pressure remains static throughout; the final paragraph asserts success without demonstrating cost, loss, or a foreclosed path. Coincidence does not complicate because nothing complicates at all.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Theme ("shadowseam wonder," "rhythm of belonging") is stated repeatedly in identical phrasing rather than emerging from image or event. The burnt feather and luminous respite are invoked as symbols but do not shift meaning between opening and close. The ending recounts the astrologer's satisfaction in summary ("knew that they had achieved their goal") rather than offering a resonant image or non-literal answer. Multiple instances of thematic echo ("the power of shadowseam wonder," "the magic that lay just beneath") in the final paragraphs replace scene pressure with overt moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>POV distance is stable (third limited), but the narrative voice is generic and unanchored to the astrologer's profession or personality—no perceptual signature distinguishes how this character notices the world. Diction drifts into elevated, abstract register ("shadowseam wonder," "luminous respite," "rhythm of belonging") with no concrete idiom or thought texture. Reflection dominates without present micro-choices; the astrologer's interiority consists of vague sensing and asserted satisfaction. Purposeful elision is absent; the withheld nature of "divination" and "captivate" never pays off on the page.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Extensive paraphrase loops and synonym churn appear throughout: "forgot place" / "forsaken place" / "forgotten place" recur across eight paragraphs; "luminous respite" is repeated verbatim seven times without reweighting; "shadowseam wonder" appears five times in identical phrasing. Template cadence dominates ("As the night wore on," "As the sun rose higher," "And as they disappeared") with repetitive sentence stems. Filter-verb stacks flatten immediacy ("began to sense," "seemed to weave," "knew that they would"). Information density is low; many sentences restate prior claims without advancing situation or stakes. Applying patterned-artifact penalty pack and loop penalties totaling approximately −1.7 in Q7, with additional −0.3 for pervasive filter verbs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>The core premise (landscape astrologer visiting underwater facility for divination) is stated but never developed into specific causality or world logic; the facility could be any "forgotten place" without structural change. The burnt feather, bioluminescence, and "shared exhale" are mentioned but interchangeable with any mystical tokens. No fresh angle, emotional specificity, or non-obvious synthesis emerges; the arc (seek → sense → succeed) follows a generic template. The ending restates the opening's abstractions ("luminous respite," "shadowseam wonder") without transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade>comment>The landscape astrologer appears throughout but makes no choices that create turns—observation and passive sensing dominate. Picks up the feather (one touch) but does not use it to alter tactics. Present in setup, middle, and ending (all three gates), but causally inert.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Burnt feather is picked up early and mentioned at the end, satisfying setup and closure gates. However, it is never handled in a middle beat, and its significance is asserted ("held the key," "imbued with new significance") rather than dramatized through changing use or cost. Two touches (pickup, final clutch) but no evolution or causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>Luminous respite is named in the opening and restated in the ending but never shapes an on-page choice or alters tactics—it functions as thematic echo only. Present at setup and closure but absent from middle development; no causal work.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>Softly ingenious is mentioned twice as a label ("softly ingenious methods," "softly ingenious nature") without constraining or enabling any action. No visible tradeoff or cost tied to this trait on the page.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Captivate is named as the astrologer's task early and restated at the end, but the action itself (how essence is distilled or captured) is never dramatized. Present in setup and closure; absent from middle beats. Could be replaced with "sense" or "understand" with no structural change.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>A shared exhale appears in one paragraph midway ("relied on a shared exhale") but its mechanics (shared with whom? how does it attune?) remain vague, and it does not shape any subsequent attempt or outcome. Single ornamental mention; no setup or closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Forgotten underwater city research facility is named early and remains the location throughout (setup, middle, closure). However, it supplies no resources, constraints, or tactical pressure—the underwater aspect is never leveraged, and corridors/lab are interchangeable with any ruin. Postcard description without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Until sunrise: time is tracked from "last remnants of sunlight" through "night wore on" to "first light of dawn" and "bright morning light," satisfying setup and closure. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or alter tactics—hours pass with no urgency or cost tied to the deadline. Present but vague; no live clock pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.3</grade><comment>To learn the rhythm of belonging is stated as motivation early and restated at the end, but it is never dramatized through conflicting wants or on-page choices. The astrologer pursues it without friction, obstacle, or trade-off. Told-only; no visible cost or competing desire.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Shadowseam wonder is named repeatedly in identical phrasing across setup, middle, and ending, establishing a static label rather than a modulated tone. The atmosphere (dark corridors, bioluminescence, quiet satisfaction) remains uniform without pressure-driven shifts. Present throughout but does not charge the final image with new emotional weight.</comment>
