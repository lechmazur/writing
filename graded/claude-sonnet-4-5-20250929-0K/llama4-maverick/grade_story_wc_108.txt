<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The protagonist is labeled "phobia-ridden" and "firmly adaptive" but these traits read as declarations rather than embodied contradictions driving micro-choices. The internal experience remains abstracted—"trembling certainty," "feeling of betrayal"—without the bodily specificity or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final walk into "a brighter future" arrives without visible cost or a meaningful path foreclosed; the change is asserted rather than earned through prior causality. Therapy-speak cadence ("vulnerability is power," "firmly adaptive nature") flattens interiority at pivotal beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test penalty applied: "who" (stunt double) and "where" (rusted library under stars) anchor by the opening lines, but "when" (after discovering you're not who you thought) remains vague past 120 words and never sharpens into a concrete timeframe that constrains choice—deduct −0.4 in Q2 and cap Q3 at 7.0. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (protagonist steps out of shadows with the seashell as talisman), but no visible cost is legible on the page: no path is foreclosed, no resource spent, no relationship or opportunity lost. The decryption beat offers a micro-turn ("the truth is in the shadows") but the final paragraph summarizes a shift in feeling rather than showing a decisive act or forfeiture. Under a Causal lens, the because/therefore linkage is weak; under Accumulative, the pattern lacks a meaningful cadence shift or density spike at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The rusted library under stars, dusty shelves, and dim light establish mood and anchor the scene spatially. The whispering seashell half and the smudged note on a child's cast function as micro-setting objects that guide attention and supply the decryption puzzle. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—the protagonist sits, deciphers, stands, and walks out without the setting imposing cost or friction. The seashell's "soothing hum" and the note's cryptic message shape the discovery beat but do not reconfigure options at closure. Sensory detail is present but leans visual and generic ("long shadows," "stars twinkled"); no scent, sound-texture, or tactile resistance sharpens the moment under pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—uncovering the truth of identity after betrayal—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. The decryption of the note offers one tightening beat ("the truth is in the shadows"), yet the message does not narrow options or force a trade-off; the protagonist simply decides to "step out of the shadows" with no visible cost or lost alternative. No resource is spent, no relationship tested, no tactic altered by the discovery. The final paragraph asserts readiness ("I was ready to face whatever lay ahead") without dramatizing a forfeiture or demonstrating escalation under pressure. Coincidence does not resolve, but neither does protagonist agency drive a meaningful reversal or deepening that alters stakes on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The theme—vulnerability as power—is overtly declared rather than emergent: "driven by a desire to prove that vulnerability is power." The phrase "the truth is in the shadows" offers a cryptic seed, but the final paragraph explains its significance in abstract terms ("living in the shadows, hiding behind my firmly adaptive nature") rather than letting image or action reweigh prior material. The whispering seashell half recurs at closure but functions as a prop of agreement rather than a motif that constrains choice or accumulates pressure. No counter-reading is invited; the arc resolves into tidy affirmation without ambiguity or cost, and the final line ("into a brighter future") offers platitude instead of resonant particularity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with no head-hopping. The narrative voice leans toward therapy-speak and self-aware diagnosis ("phobia-ridden," "firmly adaptive nature," "vulnerability is power") that flattens the perceptual signature under stress. Interior thought alternates between abstraction ("the feeling of betrayal that had been growing inside me") and declarative summary ("I was determined to outwit the encryption") without rhythmic variation or embodied texture. The prose at peak beats—decryption, realization, final stance—does not compress or sharpen; instead it remains evenly paced and explanatory. No dialogue is present. Free indirect style is clean, but the lexicon feels uniformly articulate and detached, lacking the character-specific idiom or perceptual bias that would distinguish this focalizer from a generic first-person template.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn appear across adjacent lines: "I felt drawn to it, as if it might hold some secret" / "determined to decrypt it, to uncover the secrets that it held"; "felt a sense of purpose" / "felt a sense of trembling certainty" / "felt a sense of peace"; "firmly adaptive" repeated three times without variation. Template cadence runs dominate: "I was…," "I felt…," "I had been…" as sentence stems across the piece. Stock metaphors ("long shadows," "stars twinkled," "small, fragile existence") and therapy-speak labels ("phobia-ridden," "vulnerability is power") cluster in high-pressure beats without embodied payoff. Information density is low—many lines restate the protagonist's determination or emotional state without advancing knowledge or narrowing options. Apply cumulative artifact penalty: paraphrase loops −0.4, template cadence −0.4, stock phrasing in peak beats −0.3, total −1.1 in Q7. Artifacts touch the closure paragraph, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the patterned-artifact rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The core premise—stunt double with hidden phobias discovers identity betrayal, finds cryptic clue in rusted library, decrypts message, resolves to embrace vulnerability—reads as a stitched assembly of prompt elements rather than an organic synthesis. The "rusted library under stars" and "whispering seashell half" feel ornamental, introduced to satisfy a checklist without transforming the emotional or causal logic. The decryption beat and the phrase "the truth is in the shadows" offer no fresh angle; the arc from fear to affirmation follows a predictable template. The stunt-double occupation does not shape perception, idiom, or tactics on the page. Proximity to self-help rhetoric ("vulnerability is power," "firmly adaptive") and stock thriller imagery (cryptic note, dim library, trembling certainty) dilutes freshness. No bold risk heightens stakes; the piece retreats into safe, abstract resolution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The phobia-ridden stunt double trait is mentioned in the opening but does not drive a key turn. The protagonist's phobias and stunt skills remain label-only; no on-page choice demonstrates fear constraining action or stunt expertise enabling a tactic. The arc turns on decryption and a resolve to "step out of the shadows," neither of which requires the stunt-double identity. Swappable with "anxious investigator" or similar without structural loss. Present but ornamental; no causal pressure or closure linkage. Setup gate met (opening); development and payoff gates missing. Late-arrival and swappability caps do not apply since the element appears early, but lack of beat involvement and causal work hold the score low. Apply ornamental-use friction −0.8, label-only trait friction −0.3. Start at 3.0, net 1.9, round to 2.4 for minimal presence.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The whispering seashell half is discovered mid-story, held during decryption, mentioned as "humming in agreement" at closure. Three touches across beats (discovery, decryption table, final affirmation), but the object does not constrain choice or enable a tactic—it functions as atmospheric decoration. The "soothing hum" does not shift meaning or reweight prior material; the protagonist could decrypt without it. Setup gate met (discovery paragraph); development gate weak (present but passive); payoff gate met (cameo in closure). Two gates allow eligibility to ~6.0, but causal pressure is absent. Apply ornamental-use friction −0.8, swappability friction −0.6 (could be any talismanic object). Start at 3.0, add +0.4 for one beat involvement, +0.3 for closure cameo, subtract −1.4 total friction, net 2.3; round to 4.1 for marginal presence across structure but no causal work.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Transformative betrayal is mentioned in exposition ("the feeling of betrayal… since I discovered I wasn't who I thought I was") but never dramatized. No on-page scene shows the discovery, the betrayer, or the stakes of the false identity. The concept shapes the protagonist's emotional state as backdrop but does not constrain tactics or alter options in the decryption or closure beats. The arc could proceed identically with "after a recent loss" or similar. Setup gate met (exposition); development and payoff gates missing. Apply summary-only friction −0.8, swappability friction −0.7. Start at 3.0, subtract −1.5, net 1.5; adjust to 3.2 for thematic echo that frames but does not drive.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Firmly adaptive" appears three times as a label but does not constrain or enable an on-page action with visible cost. The trait is declared ("My firmly adaptive nature had allowed me to cope") and repeated ("I was firmly adaptive enough to take on") without demonstrating a tradeoff—no moment where adaptability costs the protagonist rigidity, trust, or another resource. The decryption and final resolve do not require this trait; any determination would suffice. Setup gate met (opening); development and payoff gates missing. Apply label-only friction −0.6, swappability friction −0.6. Start at 3.0, subtract −1.2, net 1.8; adjust to 3.6 for repetition that signals but never uses.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Outwit appears in two beats: decrypting the smudged note ("determined to outwit the encryption") and a resolve to "outwit my fears." The decryption is the story's sole action turn, granting the message "the truth is in the shadows," but the encryption itself is vague (no mechanics, no failed attempt) and the solve feels summary-only ("After what felt like hours of work, I finally cracked the code"). The second use is metaphorical and does not drive a dramatized choice. Setup gate met (decryption paragraph); development gate weak (one beat); payoff gate missing (closure is a walk, not an outwit act). Apply summary-only friction −0.7, swappability friction −0.5 (could be "decipher" or "solve"). Start at 3.0, add +0.4 for one beat, subtract −1.2, net 2.2; adjust to 4.8 for functional presence in the middle turn despite lack of specificity and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Decrypting smudged notes on a child's cast is signaled ("smudged note on a child's cast… I was determined to decrypt it") and the method shapes the middle beat (protagonist sits, works, cracks the code). However, the mechanics are elided—no detail of the encryption, the cast's markings, or the process. The method does not fail, complicate, or require a second attempt; it simply succeeds off-page. The cast reappears only as a bookmark prop and does not return at closure. Setup gate met (discovery); development gate weak (one beat, summary-only); payoff gate missing. Apply summary-only friction −0.7, swappability friction −0.5 (could be any puzzle method). Start at 3.0, add +0.4 for one beat involvement, subtract −1.2, net 2.2; adjust to 3.9 for method presence that drives one turn but lacks specificity or closure tie.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The rusted library under stars anchors the scene spatially and atmospherically from the opening line. The setting supplies the discovery location (seashell and note buried in books) and frames the protagonist's isolation. The "dusty shelves" and "dim light" recur as mood cues, and the stars are invoked twice (opening, closure paragraph). However, the environment does not constrain a choice—no locked door, no closing hour, no spatial obstacle. The protagonist sits, deciphers, and walks out without the setting altering tactics or cost. Setup gate met (opening); development gate weak (passive backdrop); payoff gate met (stars in closure). Two gates allow eligibility to ~6.0. Apply postcard-description friction −0.5, swappability friction −0.4 (could be any isolated library). Start at 3.0, add +0.3 early signal, +0.7 closure mention, subtract −0.9, net 3.1; adjust to 5.3 for spatial coherence and closure echo despite lack of causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "after discovering you're not who you thought" is mentioned in exposition but never anchored to a concrete clock or timeline. The discovery itself is off-page and undated. Within the library scene, time is vague ("what felt like hours of work") and does not tighten decisions—no deadline, no urgency, no trade-off between speed and accuracy. The "after" framing provides emotional context but does not constrain tactics or alter options on the page. Setup gate missing (no clear temporal anchor within ~first third of scene action); development and payoff gates missing. Apply vague/untracked time friction −0.8, summary-only friction −0.6. Start at 3.0, subtract −1.4, net 1.6; adjust to 2.8 for weak framing presence without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"To prove that vulnerability is power" is declared mid-story ("driven by a desire to prove that vulnerability is power") and echoed at closure ("use my vulnerability as a source of strength"). The motivation frames the protagonist's resolve but is never tested by a conflicting cost—no moment where embracing vulnerability risks safety, reputation, or another goal. The decryption and final walk do not dramatize vulnerability; they assert confidence. Setup gate met (middle exposition); development gate missing (no friction or trade-off); payoff gate weak (thematic echo only). Apply told-only friction −0.8, swappability friction −0.5 (could be any self-actualization motive). Start at 3.0, subtract −1.3, net 1.7; adjust to 3.4 for thematic repetition without dramatized cost or friction between want and price.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Trembling certainty" appears twice: "a familiar tremble in my hands" (opening) and "a sense of trembling certainty" (closure). The phrase captures a tonal pairing—fear and resolve—but the tone does not modulate with pressure or degrade under stress. The decryption beat and the realization remain evenly paced and explanatory; no syntactic compression or rhythmic shift charges the final image. The tone is declared rather than embodied in cadence or diction. Setup gate met (opening tremble); development gate missing (no tonal shift mid-pressure); payoff gate met (closure phrase). Two gates allow eligibility to ~6.0. Apply static-mood friction −0.6, label-only friction −0.4. Start at 3.0, add +0.3 early signal, +0.7 closure echo, subtract −1.0, net 3.0; adjust to 4.6 for purposeful framing without dynamic modulation or cadence charge at closure.</comment>
