<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Aria's motivation is declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. Her interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("unyielding compassion," "gracefully alert") and therapy-speak ("scars can sing") without embodied emotion or micro-choices under pressure. The tree-grafting action occurs without visible internal conflict or cost, reading as competent execution rather than a choice that reveals character hierarchy. Backstory reflection dominates without anchoring to present-tense micro-decisions that alter her stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: "obsidian lagoon" appears early but remains spatially vague, and the radio call's scene location is unanchored until "volcanic beach" memories intrude (apply −0.4 for orientation drift). The lens reads Accumulative/Textural, but no meaningful tightening occurs—Aria grafts the tree without opposition, cost, or a choice that narrows options. Closure lacks visible cost: she "finished her work" and feels peace, but no path is foreclosed and no price paid on the page. The ending summarizes her resolve without a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon and volcanic beach are named but function as postcard backdrops without constraining choice or shaping tactics. Sensory detail ("kelp-drift peace," "sweet scent of wet earth") is atmospheric but does not pressure Aria's actions. The black sand pouch and coin are mentioned as talismans without altering access, proximity, or spatial logic. Spatial choreography is coherent but the environment never narrows her options or charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—healing the tree—is signaled but never escalates or tightens. Aria arrives, grafts the branch, and succeeds without opposition, resource constraint, or a trade-off. No reversal or deepening occurs; the radio call and tree damage could be swapped for any fire scene without structural impact. The ending declares "unyielding compassion" but no visible cost or foreclosed path emerges. Coincidence (gentle rain) aids the outcome rather than complicating it.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Theme is stated rather than earned: "scars can sing" appears as a phrase Aria remembers, then the final paragraphs moralize about healing and compassion without scene pressure. The coin and black sand are symbolic tokens that do not constrain choice or accumulate meaning. The ending's "hope" and "healing" are asserted in abstract summary rather than arising from concrete particulars. The piece telegraphs its thesis instead of letting action and image generate resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited, and no head-hopping occurs. However, diction drifts into elevated abstractions ("unyielding compassion," "gracefully alert," "sense of belonging") that feel authorial rather than character-specific under pressure. Perceptual signature is generic: Aria notices clouds, water, and trees in tourist-catalog fashion without professional or personal bias. No dialogue appears. Interior voice lacks rhythmic control; sentence stems repeat ("Aria felt," "Aria's thoughts") without purposeful variation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Template cadence pervades: "Aria's thoughts," "Aria felt," "Aria stood," and "As the night wore on" recur across multiple beats without variation. Paraphrase loops appear in the final third: "sense of peace," "sense of belonging," "sense of hope" restate the same emotional claim. Stock metaphors ("scars can sing," "kelp-drift peace") are unearned. The final four paragraphs loop summary-level reflection without advancing situation or choice. Figurative language is strained: "clouds migrate" and "kelp-drift peace" feel forced and obscure rather than clarify.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The premise—firefighter daughter of an arsonist—is template-familiar and not transformed through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The tree-grafting metaphor for healing emotional scars is straightforward allegory without fresh synthesis. Setting elements (obsidian lagoon, volcanic beach, black sand) are exotic tokens that do not alter tactics or stakes. The ending's "scars can sing" reads as a borrowed wisdom phrase rather than an earned, specific insight. No bold structural or perspectival risk elevates the familiar frame.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Aria's profession (firefighter) and backstory (arsonist's daughter) are mentioned but do not create key turns or constrain choices. She responds to a call and grafts a tree without her dual identity shaping the decision or generating visible cost. The element is present in setup and final reflection but ornamental to the action.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Black sand from the volcanic beach is mentioned in memory (setup) and felt "stirring in her pouch" near the end (reprise), but it is never handled, used, or reweighted with new meaning. Its "healing properties" are told, not dramatized. The element appears in two beats but remains static description without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Unyielding compassion" is labeled twice (mid-story and ending) as Aria's driver but never tested or dramatized through a choice that costs her something. It functions as thematic claim rather than on-page stake. The concept does not shape tactics or narrow options; it is echo, not action.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Gracefully alert" appears as a descriptive label in paragraph three and is not tied to any on-page action, constraint, or cost. The trait is mentioned once without visible tradeoff or enabling choice. It reads as ornamental character note.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Grafting the damaged tree is the central on-page action, signaled early and executed in the middle. It provides one functional beat: Aria uses her knowledge to attach a new branch. However, the graft occurs without opposition, resource constraint, or visible cost, and an alternative healing action (watering, mulching) could replace it with minor edits. The action shapes one beat but does not redefine options or drive the ending's emotional charge.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>The foreign coin drilled and strung on red thread is mentioned once as a gift from Aria's mother and "glinted in the fading light" without mechanics, use, or shaping of attempts. It appears in setup but is absent from development and closure. The element is present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon beneath the dunes is named in the opening and closing but functions as scenic backdrop. It does not pressure choices, supply resources, or alter tactics. Aria stands on the shore, then returns; spatial detail is consistent but the setting remains postcard description without causal work or closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>"During the migration of clouds" appears in the opening and middle ("migration of clouds had brought a gentle rain") but does not tighten decisions or create a live clock. Time is vague ("as the night wore on") without tracked urgency. The timeframe is atmospheric label, not constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The motivation "to prove that scars can sing" is remembered from a wise woman's words and repeated in Aria's thoughts, but it is never dramatized through a choice with friction or cost. It functions as told desire rather than a stake tested on the page. Setup and thematic echo are present; development and payoff are absent.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Kelp-drift peace" is named in the opening and echoed in the ending's "peacefulness of the atmosphere." The tone is static and does not modulate with pressure—Aria remains calm throughout, even during the emergency call. The tone is coherent but lacks the turn or charge that would reweight the final image. Present in setup and closure, absent from middle pressure.</comment>
