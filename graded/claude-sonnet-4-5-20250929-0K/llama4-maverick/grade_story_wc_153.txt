<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Aria remains an abstract cipher throughout; her "thoughts consumed by unsent letters" and seeking "the moment before deciding" are told, not embodied in contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The confrontation with the manifestation lacks interiority—no embodied emotion, no visible cost in her stance. The healing-in-moonlight attribute appears only as a label at opening and closing, never constraining a choice. Therapy-speak ("fierce tenderness," "sorrow and longing") replaces concrete perception at the story's emotional peak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The story presents atmospheric wandering rather than causality: Aria moves through the labyrinth, finds letters, approaches a clearing, raises the shard, speaks to an apparition that dissipates—each beat feels like "and then" rather than "because/therefore." No on-page choice narrows options or imposes cost; the manifestation's arrival and departure are externally triggered, not earned by Aria's agency. The "instant before deciding" is invoked in opening and closing but never dramatized as a stake with a legible before/after. Closure reads as thematic echo, not Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The mangrove labyrinth is richly textured—singing spirits, luminescent fungi, damp earth, twisted roots—but remains postcard description; no environmental feature constrains a choice or charges the closure image. The suspended windowpane arrives late, used once for the condensation effect, then mentioned in passing at the end. Spatial choreography is vague: "twisting waterways," "a clearing" with no distance, access, or tactical pressure. The setting supplies atmosphere but does not alter Aria's options.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to find the moment before deciding"—is declared but never tested on the page; no choice narrows options or forecloses a path. The apparition's appearance and dissipation occur without Aria's agency driving escalation; she "spoke to the apparition" in summary, and it "began to dissipate" with no causal link to her action. No reversal or tightening changes what Aria can or must do. The "weight lifting" is told, not shown as a cost that alters her stance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The theme of unspoken apologies and unsent communication is stated repeatedly—"unspoken words," "unsent letters," "the space where an apology waits unspoken"—but never earned through specific, non-obvious particulars. The final paragraph ("Aria's presence remained, a testament to the power of evocation") moralizes rather than offering a resonant image. The gargoyle shard and singing spirits recur but do not shift meaning; they remain decorative motifs rather than accumulating pressure that reweights the premise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Narrative distance is stable third-limited, but diction drifts into elevated register inconsistent with immediate perception: "primordial aroma," "coalesced," "threshold where the path ahead was still uncertain." Peak beats—"her words a mixture of sorrow and longing," "fierce and tender"—rely on abstract labels rather than embodied voice. No dialogue appears to test character distinction. The perceptual signature remains generic; Aria's way of noticing does not reveal character-specific bias or hierarchy of attention.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Severe paraphrase loops mar momentum: "unspoken words that lingered in the spaces between people" / "the space where an apology waits unspoken" / "unspoken apologies"; "sorrow and regret" / "regret and yearning"; "voices accompanied her steps" / "melodies lingered, a gentle accompaniment to her footsteps." Template cadence dominates: "Aria's [noun]," "The [noun] [verb]," "As she [verb]" across consecutive paragraphs. Stacked filter verbs—"began to appear," "seemed to evoke," "began to take shape," "began to dissipate"—dull immediacy in the climactic clearing scene. The final third is thick with loops, disqualifying 9+ and triggering caps.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The core premise—medium channels regret via unsent letters in a mangrove sanctuary—echoes familiar mystical-guide templates without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The gargoyle shard, condensation messages, and moonlight healing are mentioned but not integrated into a causal chain that feels inevitable in hindsight. The "fierce tenderness" tone and "moment before deciding" frame are invoked as labels rather than synthesized through action. Swapping names and setting would leave the emotional arc unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Aria is present throughout but makes no on-page decision that alters tactics or stakes. She "sought," "approached," "raised," "spoke"—actions that trigger external events rather than dramatizing choice under pressure. The "cryptic medium" role is label-only; her evocation ability is told, not shown constraining options. Late appearance of any choice; ornamental use across beats.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The gargoyle's rainspout shard is introduced early ("carried a small, delicate shard") and reappears when Aria raises it to trigger the window messages, then is "still clutched in her hand" at the end. Two touches across the story, but its function is passive prop—raising it causes the messages to appear via coincidence, not because its unique properties constrain Aria's tactics. No cost or tradeoff tied to its use. Swappable with any talismanic object.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Unsent letters are discovered early, frame Aria's motivation, drive her to the clearing, and the story closes with "the essence of the unsent letters" and "the space where an apology waits unspoken." The concept shapes the dominant stake and is present at closure. However, the letters themselves are never handled, read in full, or used to narrow a choice on the page—they remain thematic backdrop rather than active pressure. One causal beat (discovery frames quest) plus closure echo lifts it into mid-band, but lack of middle constraint and specificity prevent higher.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>Mentioned at opening ("skin had a peculiar attribute – it healed in moonlight") and closing ("Aria's skin, bathed in the gentle moonlight, began to heal"), but the trait never constrains or enables an on-page action. No injury is shown, no cost or tradeoff tied to moonlight dependence. Label-only ornament with lyric reprise that does not reweight the stake.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Evoke" appears in the opening ("known for her ability to evoke the essence") and when Aria's presence "seemed to evoke a presence" that coalesces into the manifestation. The action triggers the apparition's arrival, a key turn, but the evocation itself is passively described—no mechanics, no cost, no choice about how or whether to proceed. Present early and at a major beat, but swappable with "summon" or "call forth" without structural change. Mid-band for beat involvement without causal specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Condensation messages on the windowpane appear once in the middle when Aria raises the shard, revealing "snippets of conversations long forgotten," then the windowpane is mentioned again at the end when "the condensation cleared, revealing a reflection." Two beats, but the method's mechanics are opaque (why does moonlight on the shard cause messages?) and it does not constrain Aria's choices—messages appear, she scans them, they fade. Functional in one beat, present at closure as a prop, but replaceable and not causally active.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The mangrove labyrinth is introduced early, supplies atmosphere throughout (singing spirits, luminescent fungi guide her steps), and the clearing within it is the site of the climactic evocation. Setting is present across all three gates and frames the action. However, the labyrinth does not constrain Aria's movement or impose a cost—she navigates "twisting paths" without obstacle, and the spirits' singing accompanies but does not pressure her choices. Presence across beats and closure participation earn mid-band, but lack of tactical constraint prevents higher.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"The space where an apology waits unspoken" appears as the final phrase and echoes the opening theme of "unspoken words." The timeframe is more conceptual than temporal—it does not create urgency or tighten decisions. No clock or deadline pressures Aria's moves. Lyric reprise at closure, but ornamental rather than a constraint that alters tactics. Conceptual framing only, no dramatized pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"To find the moment before deciding" is stated early as Aria's goal and repeated near the end ("Aria found the instant before deciding"). The motivation frames the quest and is present at closure. However, it is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants—no on-page friction between this desire and a competing cost or fear. The motivation supplies thematic continuity but does not drive a choice under pressure. Functional framing with closure echo, but lack of dramatized conflict keeps it mid-low.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Fierce tenderness" is declared when Aria speaks to the apparition ("a voice that was both fierce and tender") and repeated at the end ("the fierce tenderness she had embodied"). The tone is asserted via label rather than modulated through rhythm, diction, or pressure. No tonal shift across the story's turns; the prose remains uniformly atmospheric and abstract. Present at a key beat and closure, but static and tell-reliant rather than charged through execution.</comment>
