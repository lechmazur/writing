<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Emilia remains a static vessel for historical detective work with no embodied emotion or internal contradiction. Her "emotionally rational approach" is told but never shown through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The triumphant smile at the end feels unearned—no visible cost forecloses a path, no renunciation occurs. Interiority consists of abstract summary ("fierce determination") rather than character-particular thought that degrades or shifts under the weight of discovery.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when adequately in the opening. The piece attempts a causal lens (search → find → decode → triumph) but the illuminated letter's discovery lacks motivated linkage—Emilia simply finds it in a hidden room with no prior setup of how she knew to look there or what obstacles she overcame. The closure offers a Decisive Change (truth recaptured, brought into light) but the cost is invisible on the page; the ivy "relaxing" is metaphorical decoration, not a felt price. No tightening narrows options or raises stakes between discovery and resolution.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The railway station is vividly described (ivy as skeletal fingers, crumbling walls, grimy windows) but remains postcard scenery. The hidden room's location is convenient rather than earned through spatial problem-solving. The ivy recurs but does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—it "presses in" then "relaxes" without causal force. Sensory detail is present (damp earth, decay) but filtered generically rather than through Emilia's professional historian's priorities. The station does not pressure the work or supply resources that affect the outcome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake (uncover truth behind a noble lie) is signaled early but never tested on the page. No reversal or tightening choice narrows options; Emilia's task proceeds without obstacle, misinterpretation, or cost. The "carefully crafted" lies are declared formidable but yield immediately to her "practiced intensity." Agency is observation, not decision—she pores over documents and the truth "slowly, gradually" emerges without a trade-off or forfeiture. The resolution is granted rather than earned by protagonist alteration or renunciation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The theme of noble lies vs. truth is stated overtly ("noble lies," "pit of lies," "rescue truth") rather than emerging from scene particulars. The illuminated letter shifts from relic to "key" but the thematic weight is asserted, not demonstrated through a non-literal image that reweights prior material. The final triumph is tidy and declarative ("small but significant victory") without ambiguity or conceptual cost. Subtext is absent; all meaning is narrated directly. The piece tells its thesis instead of earning resonance through embodied choice and consequence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Third-person narration maintains stable distance with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent but generic—register does not shift to reflect Emilia's professional historian lens or emotional intensity under pressure. Perceptual signature is absent; the rosebush petal, ivy, and dust motes are observed uniformly rather than filtered through character-specific bias. No dialogue appears. Sentence rhythm is uniform, lacking modulation at peak beats. The prose reads as competent committee voice rather than a singular perspective anchored in Emilia's idiom and priorities.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "disused railway station" echoed by "forsaken place," "hidden archive...collection of documents and relics," "truth behind...noble lies" repeated three times across paragraphs. Template cadence runs through the middle third ("She had spent...She had heard...Her search led...Her task...She would do this"). The ivy anthropomorphized identically in three beats (skeletal fingers, pressing in, relaxing) without fresh propulsion. Figurative density ("ghostly figure taking shape," "shaft of light," "symbol of triumph") stacks without coherence. Information density is low; many sentences restate the task rather than advance it. The −0.8 to −1.4 artifact penalty applies, with loops touching the closure image (ivy relaxing).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The premise (historian finds hidden archive to expose noble lie) is template-level familiar without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The station, ivy, and illuminated letter are stock gothic motifs deployed without fresh synthesis. The truth-vs-lies binary resolves tidily with no ambiguity or risk. Emilia's method (drawing parallels, comparing narratives) is told but not demonstrated on the page with specific, verifiable archival work. The ending image (clutching the letter, carrying truth into sunlight) is generic triumph. No bold structural or perspectival choice heightens stakes. Derivative premise penalty −0.8 applies.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Emilia is present throughout and her search frames the plot, satisfying setup and development gates. However, her "choices" are observational—she navigates, scans, pores over documents—without on-page decisions that alter tactics or foreclose options. The final act (stepping into sunlight with the letter) is a result granted rather than a turn she creates. Functional but replaceable; a different researcher could execute the same moves. Caps at 4.6 for weak causal pressure; deduct −0.3 for label-only trait ("emotionally rational"), −0.5 for summary-only key involvement (document analysis recounted, not shown), −0.6 for swappability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The illuminated letter appears in the second third (hidden room discovery), satisfying setup but missing early signal. It is described vividly (intricate designs, vibrant colors, medieval artisans) and declared "more than just a relic—a key" but this reweighting is asserted, not dramatized through evolving use across beats. It returns in the final image (clutched in hand) as a symbol but does not causally enable the closure or reweight prior material through changed meaning. Two touches (discovery, ending cameo) but no middle development where its properties constrain or enable a choice. Caps at 3.4 for missing middle gate; deduct −0.3 for ornamental closure cameo, −0.5 for swappability (any document could serve), raise +0.4 for two touches, +0.3 for specificity of description.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Noble lies are introduced early and frame the quest, satisfying setup. The concept recurs in reflection ("deliberate distortions," "carefully crafted," "pit of lies") but remains thematic echo rather than on-page pressure. The lies do not create obstacles, force trade-offs, or complicate Emilia's method—they simply yield. No middle beat where the concept constrains a choice or alters tactics. The closure references the concept (triumph over lies) but the stakes were never tested. Functional presence but does not shape options on the page. Caps at 4.6 for minimal causal work; deduct −0.5 for ornamental middle use, −0.3 for label-only theme claim.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Emotionally rational" is mentioned once in the opening paragraph as a biographical label without demonstration. No on-page action shows Emilia balancing emotion and reason, no choice or constraint arises from this trait, no cost is tied to it. The trait could be deleted with zero structural impact. Caps at 2.8 for missing closure participation; deduct −0.4 for label-only mention, −0.3 for appearing in setup only without follow-through.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Recapture" is signaled as Emilia's task in the middle third and frames her documentary work. The action shapes two beats (reconstructing events, bringing truth to light) and the ending references it directly ("recaptured the truth"). However, the recapture itself is summarized rather than dramatized—no specific parallel-drawing or decoding beat shows the work. The mechanics are told ("drawing parallels," "comparing narratives") without on-page execution. Two-gate presence (middle task, ending result) earns eligibility to ~6.0; deduct −0.4 for summary-only middle use, −0.3 for swappability (any archival verb would serve), +0.4 for closure linkage, +0.3 for early signal.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Drawing parallels" is mentioned once in paragraph twelve as a method Emilia will use but is never shown on the page. No beat demonstrates her comparing accounts, identifying common threads, or using this technique to constrain or enable progress. The method is setup-only (told intention) with no development or payoff. Caps at 4.6 for missing development and closure; deduct −0.8 for summary-only, −0.5 for swappability (any method could be named), −0.7 for resolving a problem it did not shape.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The railway station is introduced in the opening sentence and recurs throughout, satisfying setup, development, and payoff gates. The ivy is described across multiple beats (skeletal fingers, pressing in, relaxing at the end). However, the setting remains scenic rather than tactical—it does not constrain movement, supply resources, or alter Emilia's approach. The hidden room is convenient discovery, not a spatial puzzle. The ending ivy "relaxing" is metaphorical decoration without causal force. Three gates met earns eligibility ≥6.1; deduct −0.7 for postcard use without choice pressure, −0.5 for ornamental closure participation, −0.5 for swappability (any Gothic ruin would serve), +0.4 for three touches, +0.3 for early signal.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>The timeframe anchor ("as the last petal fell") appears in the opening sentence but never returns or exerts pressure. No ticking clock, no deadline, no passage of time that alters Emilia's tactics. The petal-fall could be deleted with zero impact on causality or closure. Setup-only with no development or payoff. Caps at 4.6 for missing gates; deduct −0.8 for ornamental opening detail, −0.7 for resolving without involvement, −1.0 for complete narrative irrelevance, −0.3 for swappability.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Rescue truth from a pit of lies" is stated overtly in paragraph fifteen and frames the quest from early on (rumors of hidden archive, studying manipulated narratives). The motivation shapes two beats (her career focus, her final triumph) and appears in the closure image ("truth back into the world"). However, the desire is never conflicted—no cost, no competing want, no friction. The motivation is told repeatedly but not tested through a choice where rescuing truth forecloses another path. Three gates met; deduct −0.4 for lack of friction or cost, −0.3 for overt telling without embodied pressure, +0.4 for closure linkage, +0.3 for early signal, +0.4 for two distinct beats.</comment>
