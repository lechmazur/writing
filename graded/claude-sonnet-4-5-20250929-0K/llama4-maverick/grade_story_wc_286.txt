<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Akira's interiority relies heavily on abstraction ("zen-minded," "phototropic to kindness") rather than embodied contradiction. The journey from observation to understanding follows a meditative arc, but the final choice to take the glass and leave feels unmotivated by prior pressure—no competing impulse or cost is dramatized. Emotions are labeled ("deep sense of peace") rather than shown through contradictory action. The passive, contemplative stance never encounters genuine resistance that would reveal character through micro-choices under stress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: "abandoned beekeeping oasis" and Akira's name arrive early, but her goal ("understanding why some places resist change") and the fractured-timelines conceit remain abstract until midpoint, creating conceptual fog. The story operates in Accumulative/Textural mode—gathering images and meditative beats—but no decisive tightening occurs; the revelation about kindness is asserted in summary ("she glimpsed the answer") rather than earned through on-page discovery or choice. The closure unit (taking the glass and leaving) lacks visible cost: Akira departs with understanding but nothing is foreclosed, no path closed with felt price. Applying Orientation Test penalty −0.4 and cost-proof penalty −0.6.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Vivid sensory work: "scent of old honey and wax," "sun beat down," "cracked ground," and the lantern glass's "delicate patterns" anchor the wasteland setting effectively. Spatial choreography is clear (Akira seated, glass on rock, distant smoke), and the oasis's former life as a beekeeping site provides textural specificity. However, the environment never constrains a choice—Akira's decision to leave is unaffected by the setting's physical or social pressures. The glass charges the final image but as a talisman of understanding, not as a micro-setting element that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding resistance to change—is signaled by mid-story but remains abstract and internal. No reversal or tightening narrows options: Akira ponders, thrums, aligns with timelines, and arrives at an answer without obstacle or trade-off. The smoke's dispersal and the thrum are atmospheric rather than causal levers. Agency is present (she chooses to take the glass and leave) but the choice costs nothing on the page—no foreclosed path, no visible price. Coincidence does not resolve, but neither does protagonist decision under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The theme—places resist change when infused with kindness—emerges from imagery (honey, wax, gentle curves) but is stated outright in late paragraphs: "some places resist change because they are infused with the kindness of those who once tended them." This articulation replaces dramatized discovery. The lantern glass recurs and gains symbolic weight, yet its meaning shift is told rather than shown through specific events. The ending offers a poignant image (glass as beacon) but the thematic answer is delivered as a maxim, not earned through ironic cost or non-literal resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, and Akira's perceptual signature (zen calm, attraction to gentle curves, thrum-like meditation) is consistent. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("phototropic to kindness," "temporal dislocation," "fractured timelines") that feels more conceptual than character-voiced. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance is steady but the reflective mode flattens urgency; filter verbs ("felt," "seemed") are frequent but voice-motivated. The prose rhythm supports contemplation, yet syntactic variety is limited—many paragraphs open with "As" or "The," creating mild template cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Clarity is generally strong, with vivid images and clean grammar. However, paraphrase loops appear: "faded lantern glass" recurs without functional variance, and multiple sentences restate Akira's meditative alignment ("felt an inexplicable connection," "felt a subtle alignment," "felt a sense of temporal dislocation"). Template cadence is present: "As she gazed," "As she pondered," "As the sun dipped," "As chimney smoke," "As the darkness deepened" across seven paragraphs. Stock metaphors ("like the unfolding of a lotus flower") and abstract phrasing ("sharp gentleness") reduce textural specificity. Applying −0.6 for paraphrase/template runs and −0.3 for filter-verb stacks in reflective beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The premise—a contemplative potter in a scorched beekeeping wasteland seeking to understand place-memory—blends familiar elements (ruins, meditation, artifact) without a fresh synthesis. "Phototropic to kindness" and "fractured timelines" are intriguing labels but remain abstract ornaments rather than engines of specific choice or irony. The emotional arc (arrival → meditation → insight → departure) follows a well-worn contemplative template. No bold risk or non-obvious turn emerges; the transformation (taking the glass as talisman) is surface-level rather than a hard-won recalibration of values or stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Akira is present throughout and makes one key choice (taking the glass and leaving), but her decisions are meditative rather than pressure-driven. She observes, ponders, thrums, and departs—no competing option or cost is dramatized. The "zen-minded potter" trait frames her perceptual style but does not constrain or enable a high-stakes turn. Present and functional, but easily replaceable with another contemplative archetype.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The lantern glass appears early (first third), is handled across multiple beats (gazing, resonating with thrum, tucked into bag), and returns in the final image as a "beacon of hope." Its "gentle curves" and sun patterns are linked to Akira's realization about kindness. However, the glass does not constrain a choice or create cost—it is a passive symbol rather than an active lever. Strong lyric reprise but lacks causal pressure. Setup + Payoff gates met; Development is weak.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Fractured timelines" is mentioned twice as a conceptual frame ("fractured timelines that had brought her to this desolate place," "felt a subtle alignment with the fractured timelines") but never dramatized. No on-page mechanics, no tactical constraint, no visible cost tied to temporal fracture. The concept remains thematic abstraction rather than story logic. Ornamental mention only.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Phototropic to kindness" is stated once in abstract terms ("She was phototropic to kindness, and the gentle curves of the glass seemed to embody that quality") but never enables or constrains an on-page action. The trait is a label without visible trade-off or cost. No beat involvement, no causal pressure, no closure linkage. Decorative only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Thrum" appears in three beats (Akira thrums a melody, the sound harmonizes with the environment, the thrum deepens to a heartbeat). The action creates atmosphere and is linked to her alignment with timelines, but no major turn traces to it—removing the thrum would not break the story's logic or closure. Functional across beats but swappable with another meditative action (chant, breath, hum). Setup + Development met; Payoff is ambient rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"By following the sun patterns etched into the glass" is mentioned once in mid-story as a method of alignment ("Akira felt a subtle alignment with the fractured timelines") but the mechanics are never shown or repeated. The method does not shape attempts or constrain tactics—it is a single assertion without dramatized use. Present but not developed or paid off.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The "abandoned beekeeping oasis in a scorched wasteland" is vividly established (dry earth, withered vegetation, scent of honey and wax, cracked ground) and frames every beat. The setting supplies the central mystery (why it resists change) and the glass artifact, shaping Akira's inquiry and final realization. However, it does not pressure her choices or alter tactics—she meditates freely without environmental constraint. Strong setup and thematic payoff, but lacks middle causal pressure. All three gates present; causal integration is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"As chimney smoke flattens" appears twice as a temporal and atmospheric marker ("chimney smoke from a distant, unseen source began to flatten across the horizon," "As the chimney smoke continued its lazy drift"). The timeframe does not tighten decisions or create urgency—Akira's meditation unfolds without a clock. The smoke is a lyric image, not a pressure device. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Akira's motivation "to understand why some places resist change" is stated explicitly by the second third and drives her inquiry. She ponders, observes, and arrives at an answer, giving the motivation clear presence. However, the desire is never conflicted—no cost or competing want complicates her pursuit. The understanding is delivered as insight rather than dramatized through a choice with friction. Setup + Development met; cost and conflict are absent, capping the score.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Sharp gentleness" is named once as a quality of Akira's movements and implied in the prose's meditative rhythm and the lantern glass's "gentle curves." The tone is coherent and consistent throughout but does not modulate with pressure—no escalation or tonal shift charges the final image. The single static mood (calm contemplation) prevents higher scoring. Present and stable but does not shape turns or deepen at closure.</comment>
