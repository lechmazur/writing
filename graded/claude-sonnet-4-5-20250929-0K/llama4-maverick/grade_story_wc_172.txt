<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The protagonist is characterized entirely by labels ("amoral philanthropist," "secretly sentimental") without dramatized contradiction or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. Her interiority relies on abstract declarations ("felt a pang of sentimentality," "deep sense of satisfaction") rather than embodied perception. The climactic action—releasing waters—happens through summary ("using the map drawn by the cracks") without showing the decision process, cost, or any genuine struggle. No on-page choices narrow options or foreclose paths with visible price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The story lacks a legible closure unit with on-page cost. The protagonist walks out, raises the egg, and "released the waters" via unexplained means; no prior causality earns this moment, and no felt consequence follows—she simply "vanished into the rain" satisfied. The orientation is delayed (who/where/when unclear until paragraph 8+), triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). The drive lens remains ambiguous throughout: is this causal (her plan), accumulative (landscape restoration), or thematic meditation? The ending offers thematic summary ("legacy," "echo of extinct birds") rather than a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with visible cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The salt flat receives vivid sensory detail ("cracked expanse," "dry earth crunched," "brittle, fractured sound") and the cracks function as a navigational map, marginally constraining her method. However, spatial choreography remains vague—her position, the water's source, and the mechanism of release are never grounded. The setting anchors atmosphere but does not force a tactical choice or charge the final image with specificity; the storm and landscape are backdrop rather than active pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring the land—is declared but never tested on the page. No opposition materializes; the "complex web of interests" is mentioned but never encountered. The protagonist walks to the center, raises her hands, and succeeds without obstacle, cost, or tightening. The drought and powerful interests are told-only context; no on-page reversal or escalating pressure narrows her options. Agency is absent: the climax is a summary gesture with no visible trade-off or foreclosed path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Theme is stated rather than enacted: "fractured grace," "echo of extinct birds," and "beauty and renewal" are declared in exposition and repeated in the final paragraphs without fresh particulars. The egg functions as a stock symbol of preservation, mentioned but never reweighted by action or cost. The ending summarizes legacy and hope rather than offering a resonant, non-literal answer rooted in scene work. The piece gestures toward environmental restoration and sentimentality but offers no concrete thematic friction or earned insight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, but psychic distance flattens under pressure: "she felt a pang of sentimentality," "she knew that her work was far from over" are generic emotional labels. Narrative diction is elevated and uniform ("the lifeblood that revitalized the parched earth") without modulating to reflect stress or interiority. No perceptual signature distinguishes how this character notices the world; the prose reads as neutral observer rather than a distinct mind. Voice remains generic literary register throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "the cracks in the earth had become a guide, a map to the hidden waters" / "using the map drawn by the cracks in the dried riverbeds" restates without adding detail (−0.4). Template cadence runs: "The philanthropist's eyes narrowed… / The philanthropist smiled… / The philanthropist stood…" (−0.5). Stock metaphors ("a balm to her soul," "lifeblood") and thesaurus churn ("desolate landscape" / "barren expanse" / "parched earth") dull immediacy. Figurative density in low-pressure beats ("fractured grace," "echo of extinct birds") obscures rather than sharpens (−0.4). Cumulative line-level debt totals approximately −1.3.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The core premise—amoral philanthropist restores drought-ravaged land—follows a template quest-fulfillment arc without transformation. The extinct bird's egg and "echo of extinct birds" are stock ecological symbols; "manufactured drought" and "powerful interests" are mentioned but generic. No specific lived detail, world logic, or non-obvious moral calculus distinguishes this from familiar restoration narratives. The protagonist succeeds without friction, offering no fresh inflection or earned surprise. Derivative premise without transformation triggers −0.8 in Q8.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The "amoral philanthropist" is a label without on-page demonstration; no choice reveals amorality in tension with her sentimental goal. She appears in the opening and ending but makes no decision that alters tactics or stakes. Missing middle development and closure participation caps the score at 2.8; label-only trait and ornamental use lower it further.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The egg appears in three beats (opening, center raising, final paragraph) but remains static—a held symbol without evolving use or reweighted meaning. It does not constrain a choice or enable tactics; she simply clutches it as an offering. Two-gate presence (setup, closure cameo) with no middle development caps at ~3.4; minimal causal pressure and swappability (any ecological symbol would serve) keep it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>The "manufactured drought" is exposition only, mentioned in paragraph 8 ("manufactured by the machinations of powerful interests") and never dramatized or used to shape on-page stakes. No tactics change because of it; the protagonist's plan is described but not pressured by the concept. Missing setup, development, and closure participation; told-only trends low.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.2</grade><comment>"Secretly sentimental" is declared in paragraph 5 but never enacted in a choice with cost. Her sentimentality is told ("she felt a pang") rather than shown through a tradeoff or constrained action. Label-only trait without on-page demonstration or visible price; missing all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The "release" of waters is the climactic action and shapes the ending image (waters flow, ecosystem restored). It appears in the title beat and closure, earning two-gate credit. However, the mechanics and cost are absent—no on-page struggle or foreclosed option accompanies the act. The specificity is low: "released the waters" could be replaced with "opened the dam" or "broke the barrier" with minor edits. Strong closure linkage but weak causal pressure and swappability limit the score to mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The "map drawn by cracks in dried riverbeds" is mentioned in paragraphs 13 and 23 as her navigation tool. Setup is present, but the method is never shown in use—no beat demonstrates her reading the cracks or adjusting course based on them. It resolves a problem (finding water) it did not help create. Two gates (setup, resolution) with no middle development and summary-only use; caps and swappability (any guide would serve) keep it functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The salt flat is present throughout, anchoring location and atmosphere. It provides the cracks that serve as her map, marginally shaping method. The dry earth and brittle sound are embodied in paragraph 18; the center is a spatial goal. Three gates (setup, middle embodiment, closure transformation) with modest causal pressure (cracks guide her) and closure participation (the flat becomes "thriving ecosystem") lift it to essential-across-beats range. Specificity (salt flat vs. desert or plain) and textural integration earn credit.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The "lull of distant thunder" is mentioned in paragraphs 15–16 and the storm breaks at paragraph 27, bracketing the action. However, time pressure is declared ("fleeting moment," "sense of urgency") rather than tracked or used to force a tactical choice. The lull does not constrain her pace or decisions on the page. Two gates (setup, closure storm) but no middle escalation; vague time without a live clock trends mid-low.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The motivation "to preserve the echo of extinct birds" is stated in paragraphs 3, 26, and 31. It frames the goal but is never dramatized in friction—no competing cost or trade-off tests her commitment. The egg symbolizes this desire but does not create on-page conflict. Setup and closure mention earn two gates, but told-only desire without embodied struggle or visible price limits the score to functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Fractured grace" appears as a phrase in paragraph 19 and is invoked again in the final line. The tone gestures toward poetic restraint ("small, secret smile," "gentle lapping") but does not modulate with pressure—the register remains uniformly elevated throughout. The phrase charges the final image but is not taught or developed through earlier beats. Lyric reprise without mid-scene use and modest tonal shift earn two gates and modest resonance, landing mid-band.</comment>
