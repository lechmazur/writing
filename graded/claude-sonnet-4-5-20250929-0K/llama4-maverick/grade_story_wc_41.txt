<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The prophet remains largely abstract—her "precognitive forgetfulness" is mentioned but never constrains a choice with visible cost, reading as a decorative label. Interiority consists mostly of abstract yearning ("tidal longing," "deep-seated yearning") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The final "resolution" is asserted ("she had found what she was searching for") rather than earned through dramatized struggle, and no path is foreclosed with legible cost. The character observes and arranges but does not decide anything that alters tactics or options.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed—who, where, and when coalesce slowly across the first third without deliberate disorientation taught as pattern, triggering the −0.3 penalty and Q3 cap at 7.0. The story follows an Accumulative lens (arranging driftwood, fog imagery, recurring "sound of growing older"), but no meaningful tightening or cadence shift occurs; the prophet simply completes her task and walks away. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the final peace/smile, but no visible or felt cost is legible on the page—what did she forfeit, endure, or lose to "locate" this intangible sound? The Cost proof test fails: I cannot point to a sentence where a price is paid or an option foreclosed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The fog sculpture garden supplies vivid sensory texture (mist, gravel crunch, statues) and the chalk/driftwood function as micro-setting objects handled across beats. The garden does not meaningfully constrain a choice or alter tactics—the prophet arranges driftwood without friction or resource scarcity. The final image ("fog closed in once more") recharges the opening mist motif with modest effect, enough to lift the score into mid-6s under the Accumulative lens, but the environment remains largely postcard backdrop. Spatial choreography is clear; no orientation debt beyond the Q2 penalty already applied.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to capture the sound of growing older"—is abstract and never tested by on-page opposition or a forced trade-off. The prophet arranges driftwood without error, cost, or resistance; the fog "holds its breath" cooperatively. No reversal or tightening narrows options; the act is meditative and uncontested. The resolution ("she had found what she was searching for") is declared rather than earned by agency, and no visible price is paid. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen through pattern or cadence shift, but the text loops its central claim without escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Theme (holding onto time, loss, memory) emerges from concrete images—videotapes, statues worn by weather, driftwood markers—rather than overt statement, which is a strength. However, the final paragraph drifts toward thematic summary ("The sound of growing older still lingered, a reminder of the journey") and the ending asserts resolution without dramatizing it. The chalk and driftwood recur with modest reweighting, but the "tidal longing" phrase itself becomes a label repeated without fresh development. The piece gestures toward Conceptual Repricing (the intangible sound as "living entity") but the conceptual cost remains abstract, not undeniable on the page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Voice is lyric and consistent ("eerie calm," "tendrils curling," "tidal longing"), with purposeful compression that matches the Accumulative design. However, several phrases trend toward stock lyricism ("ethereal fingers," "abiding peace") and the perceptual signature lacks sharp idiosyncrasy—many descriptors could apply to any contemplative observer. Psychic distance remains controlled; no filter-verb stacks mar peak beats. The voice supports the tone without standing out as a distinct texture that charges the closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn are pervasive: "locate…searching for…found what she was searching for" cycles three times; "sound of growing older" appears in five separate beats without evolving meaning. Template cadence runs appear ("The prophet's…" opens four consecutive paragraphs in the middle third). Stock metaphors ("ethereal fingers," "heartbeat that echoed") dull immediacy. These artifacts do not break causality but measurably flatten momentum and dull the closure image, triggering baseline −0.8 in Q7. Information density is low; many sentences restate the same longing without advancing situation or knowledge.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The core premise—mystical figure seeks intangible experience in atmospheric setting—follows a familiar template without a fresh inflection rooted in lived detail or world logic. The "precognitive forgetfulness" and "junkyard prophet" labels promise specificity but remain ornamental; the chalk and driftwood could swap for other ritual objects with minor edits. The fog sculpture garden is vivid but not transformed through unique choice or non-obvious moral calculus. The ending's assertion of finding-through-feeling is a stock move in contemplative pieces. No bold risk heightens stakes; the piece settles into the safety middle of lyric mood without a turn that redefines prior material.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The junkyard prophet is present throughout and her arranging action occupies multiple beats (setup, development, payoff gates all met). However, her choices do not create key turns—she arranges driftwood without error or opposition, and the resolution is asserted rather than earned by a decision that alters tactics. The "precognitive forgetfulness" briefly interrupts her but the chalk immediately restores purpose without cost. She observes and walks but does not make a choice that forecloses a path. Functional but replaceable with any contemplative figure; the "junkyard" and "prophet" labels do not alter her actions or speech in specific ways.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plain chalk appears in three beats: she holds it (first third), uses it implicitly while arranging (middle), and discards it as "worn down to a stub" (final third), meeting all three gates. Its "familiar sensation…brought back a glimmer of purpose" enables the arranging action. However, the chalk does not constrain a choice with visible cost—it functions smoothly as a talisman without friction, wear limiting her work, or a moment where its depletion forces a trade-off. The discard at the end is noted but does not reweight prior material or charge the closure image causally. Swappable with another ritual object (feather, stone) without major structural change.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Clinging to echoes" is signaled early ("heart clinging to the echoes of memories past") and reprised in the final third, meeting setup and payoff. It shapes the dominant stake thematically (capturing the sound of growing older as echo) but does not alter on-page tactics or force a choice. The concept is told and restated rather than dramatized through a moment where clinging costs her something or where she must choose between holding on and letting go. Present in the closure image but not causally active there; the prophet "carry[s] it with her" as assertion, not pressure. Lyric reprise without middle development caps the score in mid-4s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Precognitive forgetfulness" appears once: "made her forget what she was doing, but the familiar sensation of chalk…brought back a glimmer of purpose." This is a label-only mention without visible cost—the chalk immediately restores her purpose within the same sentence, erasing the constraint. The trait does not recur, does not shape a later beat, and does not appear in the closure. It could be removed with one-line edit and no structural loss. Ornamental; setup gate barely met, development and payoff gates missing.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Locate" is the verb driving the prophet's task ("her method was not just about locating something") and the resolution hinges on it ("she had located what she was searching for"). However, the act of locating is abstract—she does not find a physical object or person, and no turn traces causally to the verb itself. The arranging/walking actions could be reframed as "seeking," "capturing," or "tracing" with minor wording changes and the same outcome. Present in setup and payoff, but the verb does not redefine options or enable a specific tactic that another verb would not. Mid-band for thematic centrality without mechanical specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Arranging driftwood as directional markers is signaled early, occupies two substantial beats (the meditative placement and the completed pattern), and the pattern "seemed to point towards the statue," shaping her spatial relationship to the goal. The method is specific enough that swapping it (e.g., "drawing symbols in the fog") would require rewriting key beats. However, the mechanics do not constrain her—she completes the arrangement without error, material scarcity, or a moment where the method fails and she must adapt. The pattern is "erased" by fog at the end but this does not charge the closure causally; she walks away with the memory, not a consequence of the method's success or failure. All three gates met; causal involvement moderate.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The fog sculpture garden is anchored early, supplies vivid sensory texture (mist, gravel, statues), and recurs across beats. The fog "swirls," "clears momentarily," and "closes in," creating atmospheric rhythm. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics—the prophet moves freely, the fog cooperates, and the statues observe passively. The clearing to reveal the distant statue is coincidental rather than a pressure point. The final image ("fog sculpture garden…left to its misty slumber") reprises the setting but does not reweight it causally. Present across beats but functionally a backdrop; micro-setting (chalk, driftwood) does more causal work.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"The hush of old videotapes left unwatched" appears twice as an atmospheric phrase, once early and once near the end, but it does not function as a timeframe that tightens decisions. No clock, deadline, or temporal pressure shapes the prophet's choices—she works "slowly," "meditative[ly]," with no urgency or cost tied to elapsed time. The phrase is metaphorical mood rather than a live constraint. Setup gate barely met (first third mention); development and payoff gates missing. Swappable with any other ambient nostalgia image ("dust on photo albums," "unopened letters") without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"To capture the sound of growing older" is the prophet's stated goal, signaled early and reprised across multiple beats. The motivation is told and restated ("a sound she felt deeply," "the sound that haunted her") but not dramatized through a choice where capturing it costs her something tangible. The final "resolution" asserts she found it ("in that moment, the prophet felt it deeply") without friction or trade-off. The desire is present in setup and payoff, but the lack of mid-scene conflict between wanting this and needing/fearing something else keeps it abstract. Thematic centrality without on-page contest or felt cost caps the score below 6.5.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Tidal longing" is named once explicitly and implied through images of ebb/flow, "deep-seated yearning," and "heart swelling." The tone is coherent across turns and modulates subtly—opening oppressive hush, meditative middle, closing peace. The "tidal" metaphor charges the final image of fog closing in as a recurrent wave. However, the tone does not sharpen under pressure; instead it remains consistently contemplative without tonal friction or cost. The piece teaches the mood early and sustains it, meeting setup and payoff gates, with modest closure linkage. Strong coherence without decisive escalation or tonal irony places it in low-6s.</comment>
