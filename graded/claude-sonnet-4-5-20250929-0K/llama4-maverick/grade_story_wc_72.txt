<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The statue functions as an observer-narrator with minimal agency; its "telepathic abilities" allow passive reception but no meaningful internal conflict or contradictory impulses. The parrotfish provides exposition, but the statue makes no difficult choices—it simply "reaches out" and "realizes" through convenient revelation. The "incisively kind nature" is label-only, never tested by a trade-off or visible cost. No embodied emotion or struggle under pressure; the statue's transformation from stone observer to garden catalyst is asserted rather than earned through on-page choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early enough. The closure unit—statue achieves understanding and brings life to the garden—reads as a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the cost is entirely absent: no path is foreclosed, no visible price paid. The "cascading revelations" trigger understanding passively (the ampoule delivers insight without struggle), and the ending asserts transformation ("thriving ecosystem") without showing what changed or what the statue sacrificed. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, but the final image lacks felt weight or reweighting of prior material; it remains declarative summary.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The underwater garden setting is visually specific ("coral and anemones," "foxglove-stained glass ampoule") and anchors early. However, the environment remains decorative—no current, depth, visibility constraint, or physical property of water meaningfully alters a choice or tactic. The ampoule "drifts lazily" and is caught without resistance; spatial choreography (statue on pedestal, fish movements) is present but passive. The setting charges atmosphere but does not constrain action or shape the closure image with tactical weight.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding the garden's downfall—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or cost. The statue passively receives the parrotfish's tale, then the ampoule delivers "a sudden jolt of understanding" without effort or trade-off. No reversal, no narrowing of options, no felt escalation: the statue's telepathy solves every problem costlessly. The ending declares the garden "thriving" and the statue "a beacon," but we see no on-page tightening, no visible price, and no choice that forecloses an alternative path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>A coherent theme—resilience, adaptation, nuance over certainty—emerges from the garden's decay-to-life arc and the statue's role as catalyst. However, the final paragraphs over-articulate the theme in near-thesis statements: "a testament to the power of adaptability," "symbol of the power of nuance," "transformative power of cascading revelations." These meta-summaries replace earned resonance with explanation. The foxglove ampoule, though visually specific, is mentioned twice without accumulating meaning or constraining a later choice—ornamental recurrence, not thematic charge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV with telepathic access is stable, and the narrative distance remains consistent. However, the prose lacks perceptual signature: the statue's "way of noticing" is generic and interchangeable with any observer. Diction is often elevated and abstract ("incisively kind nature," "animate the lifeless tone") without grounding in the statue's embodied marble texture or underwater sensory constraints. No dialogue present. The voice reads as neutral narrator rather than a distinct consciousness shaped by stone-body limits and centuries of stillness.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and scaffold dominate: "the statue realized" / "the statue's thoughts were filled" / "the statue knew" appear in near-identical stems across a dozen lines. The final third is especially redundant, cycling "thriving ecosystem," "beacon of life," "testament to transformation" without adding new information. Template cadence: multiple "As it [verb]" and "The statue [verb]" runs flatten rhythm. Mixed metaphor: "animate the lifeless tone" conflates action with atmosphere incoherently. Clarity is serviceable, but density is low—many sentences restate prior content without advancing pressure. Apply −1.2 for pervasive loops and template stems; −0.3 for the mixed metaphor at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The core premise—sentient statue in underwater ruin uses telepathy to revive forgotten garden—is visually appealing but derivative of common fantasy templates (magical artifact reveals hidden history, wisdom-figure restores balance). The "cascading revelations" arrive via convenient ampoule rather than through character struggle or specific world logic. No fresh inflection: the emotional arc (decay → understanding → renewal) and the moral (nuance over certainty, resilience) follow predictable paths without surprise or particular lived detail. The ending's declaration of transformation could apply to countless restoration fantasies unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The living statue with telepathy is present throughout and frames the story, satisfying setup. It listens to the parrotfish (middle beat) and shares insights with other creatures (ending presence). However, the telepathy enables only passive reception and broadcast—no choice is constrained by this ability, no cost paid for its use. The statue's decisions (reaching for the ampoule, exploring the garden) are generic actions any observer could take; the telepathy is ornamental flavor rather than a driver of key turns. Swappable with "curious observer" or "empathic guardian" with minor edits. Score: setup +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure presence +0.3, minus swappability −0.8, minus passivity −0.7, minus lack of cost −0.5 = baseline ~3.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The foxglove-stained glass ampoule appears mid-story when a current carries it to the statue; the statue catches it and experiences "a sudden jolt of understanding." It reappears in the final third ("now empty, lay at the statue's feet"). Two touches across distinct beats satisfy minimal involvement, but the ampoule functions as a plot convenience—it delivers revelation without prior setup or cost. Its "foxglove-stained" specificity is visual decoration; the mechanics (why foxglove? why glass? why now?) are unexplored. The ending mention is static summary, not charged reprise. Setup absent (arrives mid-story) −0.4, two beats +0.9, closure presence +0.3, ornamental/swappable −0.8, resolves without priming −0.9 = ~4.1, capped at 4.6 for missing setup.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Cascading revelations is named explicitly and shapes the middle beat: the ampoule triggers "a cascade of revelations" that allow the statue to "thread together fragments" and piece together the garden's history. This realization shifts the statue's perception (seeing "beauty in decay") and motivates its subsequent exploration. The concept appears in setup (parrotfish shares vision), middle (ampoule revelation), and ending (statue continues to "reveal new insights"). However, the revelations are delivered passively rather than earned through character effort, and the specific structural weaknesses revealed are never detailed on the page—"small, structural weaknesses exploited over time" is told summary. The concept is present and functional but lacks the specificity and cost that would make it indispensable. Setup +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.4, causal pressure (weak) +0.3, minus passivity −0.6, minus abstraction −0.8, minus swappability −0.4 = ~4.3.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Incisively kind is named once ("its incisively kind nature allowing it to understand the parrotfish's longing") as a label without on-page demonstration. No scene shows the statue making a choice where kindness costs something or competes with another value. The statue's actions—comforting the fish, sharing insights—are generically benevolent; "incisively" (sharply perceptive) is not illustrated through specific observation or difficult discernment. The trait does not constrain or enable a turn. Label-only mention, no cost, no development, no closure tie. Present +0.2, mentioned once +0.4, label-only −1.0, no cost −0.8, late first mention (second third) −0.3 = ~2.8, capped at 2.8 for missing closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Thread appears explicitly: "the statue began to thread together the fragments of the garden's history, piecing together a narrative." This action defines the middle beat—understanding the garden's structural weaknesses and patterns—and the statue continues to "thread together fragments" at the end. Threading is causally linked to the statue's shift from passive observer to active catalyst. However, the action is abstract: we never see the statue physically or mentally assembling specific fragments; "threading" is a metaphor for general comprehension. The ending reuses the verb but adds no new texture. Setup (implied early in listening) +0.3, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.5, causal pressure +0.7, minus abstraction −0.6, minus swappability (could be "connect," "weave," "assemble") −0.5 = ~5.4.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Through structural weakness is revealed mid-story: "the garden's downfall had not been due to a single catastrophic event, but rather a series of small, structural weaknesses that had been exploited over time." This explanation provides the mechanism for the garden's decay and implicitly explains why the statue's nuanced, pattern-recognizing approach succeeds. However, the weaknesses are never specified—no crack, root-rot, or failing support is shown—and they do not shape the statue's tactics on the page. The method is told in one summary sentence and never tested or used. Setup absent, single mention in middle, no closure participation. Present +0.2, one beat +0.4, causal framing +0.3, minus abstraction −0.6, minus missing closure −0.7, minus summary-only −0.5, late introduction −0.3 = ~3.6, capped at 3.4 for missing middle development as an on-page constraint.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The forgotten underwater city garden is established in the opening line and remains the continuous setting throughout. It provides atmosphere (coral, anemones, filtered light, currents) and frames the statue's exploration and the parrotfish encounter. The garden's history—former glory, downfall, renewal—is the story's subject. However, the setting does not constrain choices: water physics (buoyancy, visibility, pressure) never limit the statue's reach or tactics; the "current" that carries the ampoule is convenient delivery rather than obstacle. The garden supplies the thematic stage but not tactical pressure. Setup +0.8, continuous presence (three+ beats) +1.4, closure linkage (garden's transformation is the ending) +1.0, minus no tactical constraint −1.2, minus postcard description −0.6, specificity +0.4 = ~5.8.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>After revealing the secret is referenced in one line: "After revealing the secret of the garden's downfall, the statue felt a sense of peace." This phrase suggests the story takes place post-revelation, but the entire middle shows the revelation happening on the page (ampoule triggers understanding). The timeframe is contradictory or mislabeled. The ending summarizes "as the days passed" and "as the years passed," but these time references are vague and do not tighten decisions—they expand scope without creating urgency. No clock pressures choices. Single mention, contradictory timing, no tactical effect. Present +0.2, confusion penalty −0.5, no middle development −0.6, no closure participation −0.7, vague −0.3 = ~2.3, capped at 2.8 for missing closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>To welcome nuance into a certainty is named explicitly: "After revealing the secret… the statue… had finally welcomed nuance into a certainty that had long been held." This line frames the statue's arc—from fixed understanding to layered perception—and connects to the theme. The parrotfish's "longing for a lost era" and the statue's shift to seeing "beauty in decay" dramatize this move from binary (ruin = bad) to complex (adaptation = life). However, the desire is never conflicted: the statue faces no cost or friction in accepting nuance, and we never see the prior "certainty" tested or defended. The motivation is told rather than shown through a choice with stakes. Setup (implicit in listening) +0.3, middle development (shift in perception) +0.4, closure mention +0.3, thematic alignment +0.5, minus no friction −0.8, minus told-only −0.6, minus no cost −0.5 = ~4.7.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Animate lifeless appears as a phrase: "animating the lifeless with its presence," "animate the lifeless tone," and the ending declares the statue brings life to the garden. The tone of decay-to-vitality is coherent and the living-statue paradox embodies the concept. However, "tone" here conflates two senses: the story's emotional register (somber-to-hopeful) and the action (statue animates garden). The prose maintains a steady, distant, expository register throughout—no modulation under pressure, no sentence-level rhythm shift at the closure. The "tone" is static mood rather than dynamic pressure. Present throughout +1.0, thematic linkage +0.5, minus conflation/confusion −0.6, minus static execution −0.8, minus no closure charge −0.5 = ~3.9.</comment>
