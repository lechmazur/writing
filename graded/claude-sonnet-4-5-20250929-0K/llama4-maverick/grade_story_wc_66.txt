<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Emilia's motivation to "teach dust to tell stories" is asserted but never tested by a meaningful choice under pressure. Her actions—twirling a dial, transcribing a melody—feel observational rather than volitional; no internal contradiction or cost shapes the progression. The presence behind her triggers a defensive gesture (reaching for the cloak) but evaporates without consequence, leaving no trace on her decisions. Interiority consists largely of declarative summary ("she knew," "her obsession") rather than embodied emotion acting in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early and remain stable. However, no meaningful escalation or closure cost is visible: Emilia succeeds in capturing the broadcast essence, the dust aligns, and she leaves satisfied—no path is foreclosed, no option narrows, no felt price paid. The inferred lens (Accumulative/Textural) would require a density increase or cadence shift that reweights the stake with cost; instead the piece cycles through ornamental atmospheric phrases and ends in static triumph. The broadcast's abrupt cessation and the dust's swirl gesture toward a change, but the final paragraphs summarize her satisfaction without demonstrating what she lost or risked to achieve it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The ember alcove, mist, shortwave radio dial, and dust motes are vividly rendered with consistent sensory detail. The radio dial's glow and the swirling dust anchor multiple beats and contribute atmospheric texture. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—Emilia's actions would play identically in any isolated workspace. The mist outside "swirls in anticipation" but remains scenic rather than pressuring her decisions, preventing entry into higher bands.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—unlocking dust's narrative capacity via the pirate broadcast—is signaled early but never faces a meaningful test or tightening. No reversal occurs; Emilia searches, finds, transcribes, and succeeds without complication or cost. The "presence behind her" and flickering lights hint at opposition but dissolve instantly, leaving pressure static. The resolution is coincidental (the broadcast airs; she captures it) rather than earned by protagonist agency, and no visible price narrows her options at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>A theme of storytelling preservation and magical dust emerges through recurring images (dust motes, the radio dial, mist), and the final image of the waiting dial offers mild resonance. However, the ending states rather than reweights: "her work would continue to nurture the magic" is direct thematic summary rather than a non-literal image that answers the central question. The piece leans toward atmosphere over earned insight, and the thistled calm is asserted rather than dramatized through conflict and cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited throughout, and the voice maintains a consistent lyric register with rhythmic control. Diction is elevated and atmospheric ("thistled calm," "narrative vortex," "secretly luminous face") but occasionally drifts into ornamental phrasing that feels authored rather than character-filtered. Emilia's perceptual signature is generic—she notices mist, dust, and radio glow in ways that could belong to any contemplative observer. No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade the text: "The mist outside the alcove swirled" / "the mist outside seemed to be swirling" / "The mist closed in"; "As she [verb]" / "As the [noun]" sentence stems repeat across multiple paragraphs. Stock metaphors ("sea of sheet music," "narrative vortex," "portal to a realm") and synonym churn ("elusive"/"enigmatic," "diligent"/"unwavering") dull momentum. Figurative density in non-peak beats (e.g., "thistled calm," "secretly luminous," "mist-shrouded atmosphere") accumulates without clear payoff, and several beats restate content without advancing pressure (e.g., the final four paragraphs recycle "mist," "alcove," "dust," "radio dial" in near-identical phrasing). Apply −1.2 for cumulative loop and scaffold artifacts under the Text Artifact Screen.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The premise—teaching dust to tell stories via pirate broadcasts—offers initial freshness, but execution relies on stock atmospheric elements (mist-shrouded alcove, haunting melody, swirling dust motes) without a surprising turn or synthesis. The emotional arc (solitary copyist successfully captures broadcast magic) follows a comfort-quest template with no complication or non-obvious moral calculus. The "thistled calm" and "secretly luminous" phrases gesture toward distinctiveness but feel ornamental rather than integral to character or stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Present throughout and her occupation frames the opening, but her copyist skills (transcribing melody onto paper) do not drive a key turn or choice—she listens, transcribes, and succeeds without the occupation constraining or enabling stakes. Swappable with "researcher" or "archivist" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The radio dial appears in multiple beats (opening, mid-scene glow, final waiting beacon) and its glow charges the atmosphere. However, it remains a scenic anchor rather than an object handled with evolving consequence; Emilia twirls it once, and it then serves as visual texture. The final reprise ("a beacon for the next pirate broadcast") reweights mildly but does not link to a causal cost or choice, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The pirate broadcast is the object of Emilia's search and triggers the central sequence (finding, listening, transcribing). However, it does not constrain tactics—she simply waits for it to air, then captures it without complication. Its presence shapes the premise but not the on-page pressure or cost, leaving it functional but replaceable with any rare signal or transmission.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The radio dial's face is described as "secretly luminous" and "pulse[s] with an otherworldly energy," but this trait does not constrain or enable any action. It remains label-only atmospheric description without visible tradeoff or causal role.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>Emilia reaches for her cloak and wraps it "as a shield against the unknown" when she feels a presence, but the gesture has no consequence—the presence vanishes, and the cloak is never mentioned again. Easily removed with no impact on outcome or closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The elusive song lyrics are named as the key to unlocking secrets, and Emilia transcribes them with urgency. However, the mechanics are vague (the lyrics "become clearer" but their content and use are never specified), and they do not shape multiple attempts or choices. The method is signaled but not developed beyond ornamental mention.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The ember alcove in mist is vividly established and anchors all action, providing consistent spatial grounding. However, it does not pressure Emilia's choices or supply resources that alter outcome—she could perform the same actions in any secluded workspace. The mist swirls atmospherically but does not constrain or enable tactics, placing the setting in the functional-but-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The "story famine" is mentioned as backstory context ("after the story famine had ravaged the airwaves") but does not create urgency or tighten on-page decisions. No clock or deadline shapes Emilia's tactics; she waits, the broadcast airs, and she succeeds. The timeframe is asserted rather than dramatized as pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Emilia's desire to teach dust to tell stories is stated multiple times and frames her years-long obsession. However, it is never dramatized through conflicting wants or costs—she pursues the broadcast without friction, sacrifice, or doubt. The motivation exists as expository label rather than lived tension that forces a choice with visible price.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The phrase "thistled calm" appears twice and the prose maintains a consistent atmospheric, contemplative register. However, the tone remains static—no modulation with rising pressure or turn—and does not charge the final image with additional meaning. It reads as a mood label rather than a dynamic element that reweights the ending.</comment>
