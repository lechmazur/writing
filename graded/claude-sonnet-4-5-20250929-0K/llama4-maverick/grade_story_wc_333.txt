<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The locksmith remains abstract throughout—no embodied emotion, no contradictory impulses, no micro-choices under visible pressure. Interiority consists of generic motivational labels ("curiosity and determination," "improbable longing") rather than character-particular texture. The final act of freeing the lock yields "satisfaction and wonder" but no felt cost or foreclosed path; the protagonist glides through the task without genuine struggle or trade-off. Agency is present but unearned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation remains vague past 120 words: "shadowed nexus under starlight" and "labyrinthine paths" anchor neither specific geography nor stakes until the tree appears mid-story (−0.4). The piece gestures toward Accumulative/Textural mode via recurring star/lock imagery, but the closure—locksmith frees the idea, watches light seep out, then leaves—lacks visible cost or a reweighting that changes prior material. The "enveloped secrets…given freedom" is asserted, not dramatized with consequence. No meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; the lock simply yields.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid in spots ("gnarled tree," "latticework of overhead branches") but remains postcard description without constraining choice. The lock of hair on the branch is the sole object handled, yet its mechanics are summarized ("set to work…tools…used with finesse") rather than shown. The "shadowed nexus" and clearing function as backdrop; spatial choreography is coherent but inert. No environmental feature pressures a tactic or charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—free the trapped idea—is declared but never tested. No on-page reversal or tightening occurs; the locksmith arrives, finds the tree, works, succeeds. "The air around them seemed to thicken, as if…resisting" gestures at opposition but dissolves without forcing a trade-off. The "soft click" resolves the task with no visible cost, no foreclosed option, no deepening. Escalation is absent; the piece is a single descriptive arc.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Theme—ideas trapped by fear, liberation—emerges from the central image (lock of hair as memory) but is stated rather than earned: "It was said that the lock of hair was…" and "the enveloped secrets had been given the freedom to roam." The final shimmering light is allegorical decoration, not a resonant answer grown from conflict. The locksmith's "piece of themselves" claim appears unmotivated. No thematic complexity or earned insight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("hush of cosmic possibility," "unassumingly bold"), though "unassumingly bold" is oxymoronic without dramatization. Perceptual signature is generic; the locksmith's way of noticing (sharp eyes, deep breath, quiet smile) could belong to any protagonist. Psychic distance remains constant; no modulation under pressure. Filter verbs ("seemed to thicken," "felt a surge") are frequent but voice-motivated and do not obscure immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades: "shadowed nexus under starlight, where the air was alive with the hush of cosmic possibility" stacks three metaphors in the opening line. Figurative density in high-pressure beats (the unlocking) obscures action: "the air…seemed to thicken…resisting" is vague (−0.5). Paraphrase loops appear: "task was to free this idea" / "act of freeing the trapped idea" / "enveloped secrets had been given the freedom" (−0.3). Template cadence in the locksmith's actions: "eyes scanned," "gaze followed," "eyes narrowed," "hands moving" (−0.4). Register drift into abstract philosophy ("larger symphony," "cognitive possibility") clashes with the task-focus (−0.3). Artifacts touch the closure beat; cumulative −1.5 in Q7, disallow 9+ globally, cap high-band at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Core premise—locksmith frees metaphorical lock—is allegorical template without fresh synthesis. The "lock of hair" pun and starlight-as-hint are surface cleverness, not transformation. Emotional progression is generic (curiosity → determination → satisfaction). The piece gestures at cosmic stakes but offers no specific world logic, no lived detail, no non-obvious moral calculus. Safe middle: elevated diction and symbolic objects substitute for risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The locksmith is present throughout and makes the decision to follow the star and free the lock, but these choices are summarized rather than dramatized with visible cost. No trade-off or tactic shift. Present in closure (watches the light, turns to leave) but not causally active there. Functional but replaceable; any "seeker" character would work.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The lock of hair appears mid-story (second beat), is described, then freed in the climax. Two beats: discovery and release. It is the object of the task, not a constraint or tool that shapes tactics. At closure it "drifted lazily to the ground," a static image without reweighted meaning. Swappable with any token object. Functional in one key turn but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Enveloped secrets are theme-claimed ("secrets they sought to uncover," "enveloped secrets had been given the freedom") but do not shape on-page stakes or tactics. The locksmith's task is to free "an idea trapped behind fear," not to navigate secrecy. Present as motif but not as driver. Ornamental use; not a constraint.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Unassumingly bold" appears once in the opening line as a label. No on-page action demonstrates this trait; the locksmith moves "with a purpose," works "with finesse," but nothing in their choices or costs reveals the paradox of unassuming boldness. Ornamental descriptor.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Disorient" is stated as the task: "they needed to disorient the protective mechanisms." The work itself is summarized ("their hands moving…the locksmith persisted") without showing disorienting action. No turn traces to this verb; the lock simply "yielded." Present as told goal but not dramatized. Summary-only use.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The first star at twilight appears in the second paragraph, provides a directional hint, and the locksmith follows it to the clearing. One beat: it enables discovery. Not revisited or reweighted at closure. Mechanics matter (position holds the key) but are not tested under pressure. Functional in one turn; swappable with any sign or map.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The shadowed nexus is named in the opening and provides atmosphere but does not constrain choice. The clearing and tree are discovered via the star, not navigated through setting obstacles. No resource or pressure from the environment. Postcard description without tactical impact. Ornamental anchor.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Across the hush of cosmic possibility" appears once mid-story as a poetic phrase, not a tracked timeframe. No clock, no urgency tied to time passage. Vague and untracked. Ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The motivation—free an idea trapped behind fear—is stated clearly and frames the task. The locksmith pursues it throughout. But it is told ("driven by a motivation that burned within them") rather than dramatized with conflicting wants or visible friction. No cost tied to this desire on the page. Functional but abstract; swappable with any rescue goal.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Improbable longing" appears once near the end ("the locksmith felt a surge of improbable longing") as a label. Tone is more wistful/cosmic than longing; the locksmith's emotional arc reads as curiosity → satisfaction, not yearning. Single static mention; does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image. Ornamental claim.</comment>
