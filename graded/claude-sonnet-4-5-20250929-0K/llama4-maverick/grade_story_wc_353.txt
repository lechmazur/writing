<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The sculptor's motivation to create felt music in silence is clear and consistent, but interiority remains abstract throughout—"symphonically minded," "attuned to the harmonics"—without embodied contradictions or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. The protagonist acts on their craft but never faces a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost; the work proceeds smoothly from analysis to strumming without friction. Emotional states are asserted ("the sculptor smiled") rather than shown through contradictory impulses or bodily specificity. No secondary character applies immediate pressure, so relationship dynamics cannot be assessed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes who (sculptor), where (siskin alder grove), and what (creating music in silence) within the opening lines. A Resonant Reconfiguration occurs: the sculptor reweaves sound into a silent world, and the final image shows the grove "forever changed" with the insulator as testament. However, the cost is told rather than shown—"the silence was still there, but it was no longer oppressive"—and the causal chain is loose; discovering the insulator and integrating it into the sculpture does not narrow options or create a reversal, it simply extends the existing project. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural (pattern of music-making, final cadence shift), but the deepening lacks a felt price on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The siskin alder grove is anchored early and sensory details—sap-stained fingers, half-buried insulator, trees swaying—are filtered through the sculptor's priorities. The porcelain insulator's "delicate, glazed surface" contrasts with "rough-hewn trees" and is integrated into the sculpture, constraining the final sonic texture. Spatial choreography is clear (forest floor, underbrush, trees). The setting modulates the ending: trees "whisper thanks" and "sway gently," charging the closure image with environmental response. No implausible detail or drift noted.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—creating felt music in a silent world—is signaled early, but pressure never tightens. The sculptor encounters stress cracks, analyzes them, finds an insulator, integrates it, and succeeds without obstacle or trade-off. No reversal: the analysis "unlocked a new level of understanding" without friction, and the final strumming achieves its goal immediately. Agency is present (the sculptor chooses to weave strings and strum) but no live option is foreclosed with on-page cost. The narrative is a sequence of additions rather than escalations.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme—empathy as conduit for music in silence—emerges from the sculptor's actions and the grove's response, avoiding overt statement until the penultimate lines ("their music had brought a measure of empathy"). The porcelain insulator and stress-crack analysis accumulate as motifs, though their recurrence does not constrain later choices. The final image of trees swaying offers a resonant, non-literal answer, but the middle declares the theme overtly: "by doing so, they could help others feel the music." Subtext operates in gesture (trees whispering, sculptor smiling) but the piece occasionally tells its thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; psychic distance remains close to the sculptor's perception throughout. Perceptual signature is present: the sculptor notices "harmonics," "symphonic" patterns, and "stress cracks," language consistent with their craft. Diction is elevated but controlled—"reweave that fabric," "conduit for a deeper expression"—and matches the contemplative tone. No dialogue. Filter verbs appear ("the sculptor's mind began to wander," "the sculptor felt") but do not obscure immediacy given the reflective mode. Syntactic variety is adequate; no head-hopping or tense breaks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is acceptable, but paraphrase loops cluster in the middle: "It was a method that had served them well" immediately follows the beat it summarizes; "The silence had fallen…It was as if the very fabric…" restates the same condition across two sentences. Template cadence appears in the final third: "As the…" opens three consecutive paragraphs ("As the music flowed," "As the music continued," "As the sculptor packed"). Stock metaphors—"fabric of sound," "tapestry of sound"—appear in high-pressure beats without fresh vehicle. Line-level clarity is adequate; no major grammar or coherence breaks. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and template runs, plus −0.3 for stock metaphor density in key beats, total −0.9 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—music made tactile in a silent world—is imaginative, but the execution leans on abstraction: "empathy in motion," "symphonically minded," "harmonics of the natural world" operate as labels rather than specific, grounded choices. The "hedgehog uncurling" event that caused silence is mentioned once without exploration, reading ornamental. The sculptor's success is smooth and declarative, with no fresh inflection or surprise; the emotional arc (analysis → integration → success) could transfer to a painter, architect, or healer with minor edits. The porcelain insulator offers a concrete detail, but its integration lacks specificity about how it alters the sculpture's sound or meaning.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The tree-song sculptor is present throughout and makes choices (to analyze cracks, unearth the insulator, strum the strings), but these are sequential additions rather than key turns. No decision narrows options or alters tactics with cost. The character's actions enable the plot but do not create reversals.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The porcelain insulator appears in two beats: discovered mid-story, then "integrated into the sculpture" and "remained, a testament." Its second appearance reweights its role (from curiosity to component), but the mechanics of integration are told, not shown, and its specific effect on the music is never dramatized. Removal would weaken the closure image but not break story logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Empathy in motion" is declared as the sculptor's goal and restated at closure ("brought a measure of empathy"), but it does not constrain on-page choices or tactics. The concept functions as theme rather than stake-shaping premise. No scene turn depends on whether empathy succeeds or fails.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Symphonically minded" is mentioned twice as a character trait ("always attuned to the harmonics," "The sculptor's symphonic mind was at work") but does not enable or constrain a specific action with cost. It describes how the sculptor perceives but does not create trade-offs or visible consequences.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Strum" appears in the climactic beat: "the sculptor's fingers began to strum the strings they had woven between the trees." This action triggers the grove's response and drives the ending, but earlier setup (weaving strings) is told in a single clause; removing "strum" and substituting "pluck" or "play" would not alter story logic. The action is present at closure but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Analyzing stress cracks is introduced early ("began to analyze the stress cracks") and returns at closure ("stress cracks…began to make sense, revealing hidden patterns"), but the method's mechanics are never shown—what the analysis involves, how it changes the sculpture, or what tactical cost it imposes. The method frames the sculptor's approach but does not shape dramatized attempts.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The siskin alder grove is anchored at the opening and returns in the closure image (trees sway, whisper thanks). The setting provides the underbrush where the insulator is found and the trees between which strings are woven, so it enables key actions. However, the grove does not pressure choices or supply resources that alter tactics; it is a stage rather than a constraint. The ending reprise reweights the grove's role from backdrop to participant.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>"After the hedgehog uncurls" establishes a post-event timeframe but does not tighten decisions or tactics. The event is mentioned once, never explored, and no clock or deadline pressures the sculptor's work. Time is vague and untracked throughout.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The motivation "to create music that could be felt, if not heard" is stated early and drives the sculptor's project across all beats. However, it is told rather than dramatized in conflicted choices; no scene tests whether the sculptor will abandon the goal, pay a cost, or face friction between desire and obstacle. The motivation is consistent but not pressured.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Intensely quiet" is established early ("intense quiet," "intensely quiet world") and modulates through the piece: the silence is oppressive, then the music flows, then "the stillness that followed" is no longer oppressive. Tone coheres through turns and the final image (quiet heartbeat, waiting forest) charges the ending with quietude made resonant. The tone supports closure without static repetition.</comment>
