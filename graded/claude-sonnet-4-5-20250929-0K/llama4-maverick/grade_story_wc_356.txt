<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lyra remains a static figure of serene competence throughout; her "ambition" is declared but never tested by genuine trade-offs or contradictory impulses. The "extraordinary olfactory sensitivity" functions as a label rather than a constraint that shapes micro-choices under pressure. Interiority is abstract and diagnostic ("cultivate serenity within motion"), offering epiphany without the embodied struggle or visible cost needed to earn the transformation. The final state—renowned apothecary, guardian of wisdom—arrives as summary rather than dramatized change with foreclosed paths.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece accumulates sensory detail and recurrent phrases toward a resonant final image. Orientation is delayed past 120 words (treetop village, herbalist role, and timeline remain vague until the seed purchase), applying a −0.4 penalty. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration via summary ("years later" jump to apothecary renown), but the cost is asserted rather than shown on the page—no visible foreclosure or felt price anchors the before/after. The "turning of the tide's thought" remains an abstract timing device without causal linkage to Lyra's choices.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The treetop village is introduced with vivid sensory cues (sweet air, blooming flowers, rustling leaves) but remains a postcard backdrop; it does not constrain a single choice or shape tactics. The corpse flower seed functions as a recurring object, but its handling is minimal—Lyra holds it, tends it off-page, and observes the bloom; no micro-setting detail alters a decision. Spatial choreography is clean within the implied single location, and the "wildflower hush" fragrance charges the bloom moment, but the environment itself remains ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—unlocking "the undercurrent of wisdom"—is signaled early but remains abstract and untested. No on-page reversal narrows options or forces a trade-off; Lyra's tending of the seed proceeds without visible obstacle, cost, or pressure escalation. The bloom itself is an event she witnesses passively; coincidence (the decade-long cycle) delivers the resolution rather than protagonist agency. Under the Accumulative lens, a meaningful deepening or cadence shift is required, but the piece offers only summary description of epiphany ("she realized") without a dramatized tightening that forecloses a path or changes tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme—serenity within motion, the undercurrent of wisdom—emerges through recurrent abstract phrases rather than concrete particulars. The corpse flower seed and journaling doodles are mentioned but do not constrain choices or accumulate pressure that reweights meaning at closure. The final paragraph moralizes explicitly ("she realized that the undercurrent of wisdom was not something to be discovered, but rather something that was always present"), violating the no-stated-moral standard with a −0.6 penalty. The "wildflower hush" recurs as tone and final image, offering some resonance, but the thematic answer remains a told epiphany rather than an earned reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present—Lyra notices scents and textures—but the diction throughout leans toward elevated, abstract register ("othorldly language," "undercurrent of wisdom," "turning of the tide's thought") that sits uneasily with the embodied herbalist role. Under peak moments (the bloom), the prose remains contemplative rather than compressed, and the rhythm does not modulate with pressure. No dialogue appears. Voice is consistent but generic, lacking the character-particular idiom needed for distinction in the 7+ band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The piece suffers from pervasive paraphrase loops and template cadence. Multiple adjacent sentences restate content without added pressure: "She realized that the undercurrent of wisdom was not something to be discovered, but rather something that was always present" immediately follows "Lyra felt a sense of serenity wash over her, a sense of being in harmony with the world around her." Stock metaphor strings ("the very essence of the forest," "the very fabric of reality," "the very heartbeat of the natural world") and filter-verb stacks ("She felt," "She watched," "She knew") dull immediacy across high-pressure beats, triggering cumulative artifact penalties of −1.4 in Q7. Figurative language is dense without coherence—mixed registers and vehicles that do not integrate. The "years later" summary compresses the ending without propulsion, and scaffolding phrases ("It was said that," "As she worked") pad transitions.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The core premise—herbalist discovers rare seed, experiences epiphany—follows a familiar template without a fresh angle or non-obvious synthesis. The treetop village, olfactory sensitivity, and journaling doodles are mentioned but remain ornamental; none transform the arc or offer a perspective that feels inevitable in hindsight. Abstract phrases ("undercurrent of wisdom," "tide's thought turning") substitute for grounded specificity, and the "years later" coda delivers a stock resolution (renowned apothecary, guardian of secrets) that could apply to many stories. No bold risk-taking or authentic stance distinguishes the execution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Lyra is present throughout and the seed purchase is an on-page choice, but her "ambition" does not create key turns—she observes, tends, and witnesses the bloom passively. No decision narrows options or alters tactics with visible cost. Setup is clear, but middle and closure beats lack protagonist agency that drives causality.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The corpse flower seed is introduced early, handled when purchased, tended (off-page summary), and blooms at the climax—three functional beats. It shapes the central event and returns in the final paragraph's reflection. However, its mechanics remain vague (decade cycle is told, not shown constraining choices), and the bloom is an observed event rather than a choice-driver. The seed is integral to the premise but does not impose a visible trade-off or cost that Lyra navigates.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"The undercurrent of wisdom" appears as a thematic label in the vendor's speech, Lyra's reflections, and the final summary. It frames the stake but never constrains an on-page action or alters tactics—Lyra's path to epiphany proceeds without friction or cost tied to this concept. The phrase is ornamental rather than operational.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Lyra's olfactory sensitivity is declared in the opening and enables her to "detect the subtlest nuances," including identifying the seed and experiencing the bloom's fragrance. However, no on-page beat shows this trait constraining or enabling a choice with visible trade-off—it functions as background color rather than a pressure point.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Journalizing appears in one middle paragraph as part of Lyra's routine and is summarized again in the ending. It does not drive a turn or shape the bloom event; removing it would require only minor edits. The doodles are mentioned but never dramatized as a tool that alters tactics or closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>The family custom of doodling on wrapping paper interiors is mentioned once in the middle section as part of Lyra's reflective practice. It does not appear in the closure, constrain a choice, or shape the bloom. The doodles "began to take on a life of their own, revealing hidden patterns," but this is told summary without on-page demonstration or cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The treetop village is introduced in the opening with vivid sensory description and anchors Lyra's home and apothecary location in the final summary. However, it does not pressure a choice or supply a resource that affects outcome—it remains atmospheric backdrop. Setup and closure mention are present, but no middle beat shows the setting altering tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>"The turning of the tide's thought" is mentioned twice: as an approaching event and when "the tide's thought turned" triggering the bloom. The timeframe is abstract and untracked—no on-page clock tightens decisions. It functions as poetic timing rather than a constraint that shapes Lyra's moves.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"To cultivate serenity within motion" is declared as Lyra's aim and recurs in the ending reflection. She begins journalizing toward this goal, but the desire is never dramatized in friction or trade-off—no moment shows want conflicting with cost. The motivation is told and thematic rather than tested on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Wildflower hush" appears in the bloom description ("a wildflower hush that seemed to carry the very essence of the forest") and reprises in the final image ("Lyra's spirit continued to flourish, a wildflower hush that echoed through the trees"). The tone is coherent—gentle, contemplative, lyric—and modulates slightly at the bloom moment, but the effect is primarily atmospheric. The charged reprise reweights the opening mood, nudging into the mid-band.</comment>
