<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Aria remains a label-only protagonist whose "wisely adventurous" trait is declared but never tested by contradictory impulses or meaningful sacrifice. Her journey is frictionless—no missteps, no hesitation, no visible cost in forfeiting alternatives. The throne-claiming moment offers no felt renunciation or foreclosed path; she simply arrives and sits. Interiority consists of stock adventure-quest phrases ("steeled herself," "heart quickened") without embodied contradiction or character-particular perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed past 120 words (who/where/when blur until the waterfall), triggering a −0.4 penalty and the Q3=7.0 cap. The piece follows a video-game fetch-quest structure (enter zone → collect item → follow light → reach goal) without causal linkage; the ruby flake simply "guides" without Aria making a choice that narrows options. Closure is a declarative arrival ("sat upon the throne") with no on-page cost, renunciation, or visible before/after shift—she gains power without forfeiting anything. The lens is nominally Causal but collapses into summary convenience.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The kaleidoscopic waterfall and iridescent orchard trees provide vivid imagery, and the setting shifts Aria's access (waterfall as entrance, staircase revealed by light). However, spatial choreography is vague—distances, proximities, and the mechanics of "peeling paint" are ungrounded. The orchard and staircase do not constrain tactics; they are backdrops traversed without friction. Because setting participates in one key turn (light reveals path) and supplies the closure location, it escapes the lowest bands but remains functional rather than essential.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (reclaim the throne) is signaled early but never tested by a competing want or visible cost. Aria encounters no reversals, no forced trade-offs, no moment where the quest demands sacrifice or failure. The ruby flake and murals deliver solutions on cue; the staircase simply appears. Pressure is asserted ("weight of her quest") rather than dramatized through narrowing options. The ending grants success without demonstrating what Aria risked or lost, leaving escalation ornamental.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Theme is stated rather than enacted: "futuristic nostalgia," "whispers of the past," and "promise of a brighter tomorrow" are asserted in exposition without arising from Aria's choices or the story's images. The cryptic phrase "Where shadows fall, light rises" is window-dressing with no interpretive friction. The final paragraph moralizes ("lore keeper had become the keeper of the throne") and summarizes theme rather than charging it through a resonant image. No genuine ambiguity or non-obvious synthesis emerges from the particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice is stable third-limited with no head-hopping, and POV distance remains consistent. However, diction oscillates between high-fantasy archaism ("sally forth," "loomed in her mind's eye") and modern cliché ("reach for the stars," "brought low by its own hubris") without a unifying perceptual signature. Aria's way of noticing is generic; no character-specific filters shape sensory selection. Compression during the staircase ascent ("air was alive with a futuristic nostalgia") demonstrates some rhythmic control, preventing the score from dropping further.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops proliferate: "whispers of the past" / "forgotten grandeur," "renewed determination" / "weight of her quest," "unclaimed throne" recycled five times without reweighting. Template cadence dominates the opening third ("Aria was wisely adventurous, and she knew…" / "she knew that she had to…"). Stock metaphors abound: "nature's own cathedral," "like a beacon," "coursing through her veins." The closing triad ("The lore keeper had become… / the unclaimed was now claimed / whispers… replaced by…") stacks summary rather than advancing image. Accumulated artifacts exceed −1.4, and proximity to closure triggers the −1.7 range and disallows 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The core premise (lost civilization + hidden path + mystical guide object + throne reclamation) follows a template quest structure without transformation. The murals, ruby flake, and staircase are interchangeable fantasy furniture; swapping "ruby flake" for "crystal shard" or "orchard" for "temple" changes nothing structural. "Futuristic nostalgia" gestures at a fresh angle but remains label-only—no actual tension between past longing and future stakes. No emotional truth or fresh inflection distinguishes this from hundreds of similar recuperation fantasies.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Aria is present throughout and makes the decision to enter the orchard and ascend the stairs, clearing setup and minimal development. However, her choices are passive responses to prompts (waterfall appears → she enters; light appears → she follows) rather than decisions that create turns or foreclose options. She reaches closure but does not drive it through conflicted agency. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The ruby flake appears early (caught in flower petals), is handled in two beats (claimed, then held aloft as beacon), and participates in closure (guides ascent, pulses at throne). Its properties (guiding through hidden paths, flaring to illuminate) enable specific tactics. However, it acts as a convenience device—no cost to its use, no trade-off, and easily swappable with any mystical guide token. Two-gate participation and beat involvement lift it to mid-range, but lack of irreplaceability and cost connection cap it here.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The unclaimed throne frames Aria's goal from the opening and serves as the closure destination, clearing setup and payoff gates. However, it remains abstract—no on-page depiction of what "unclaimed" means in terms of political rivals, social consequences, or personal sacrifice. It does not shape tactics in the middle; Aria never weighs the throne against a competing desire or confronts what claiming it will cost her. Present and goal-framing, but not causally active.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Wisely adventurous" is declared once in exposition and never demonstrated through an on-page choice that balances caution with boldness. Aria takes no risks, hesitates at no threshold, and makes no trade-off between wisdom and daring. The trait is label-only, does not constrain or enable a specific action, and carries no visible cost. Ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Sally forth before sunrise" is mentioned once as a reason for urgency but does not create a turn. Aria does not sally in any dramatized sense—she steps through a waterfall and walks forward without resistance. The action is a narrative summary rather than a depicted choice that redefines options. Easily replaced with "depart" or "advance." Present but inert.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Peeling paint layers is signaled early and used in one extended middle beat where Aria uncovers murals and finds the cryptic message. The method's mechanics (specialized tool, thick layers) are mentioned, and the discovered message triggers the ruby flake's illumination. However, the method does not recur or shape the closure; the staircase is revealed by light, not by further peeling. One-beat causal role, but not carried through to the end. Functional but limited presence.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The hidden orchard behind the kaleidoscopic waterfall is introduced early and hosts the middle action (murals, ruby flake, tree-parting for staircase). The waterfall functions as a threshold Aria must cross, and the orchard's trees part to reveal the path—mild constraint and revelation. However, the setting does not pressure choices or supply scarce resources; it is a stage rather than an active force. The staircase ascends "into the darkness," but that remains abstract. Two-gate participation (setup, middle) without strong causal grip or closure charge keeps it mid-low.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Until sunrise" is stated as a deadline ("sally forth before sunrise") and the twin suns rise at closure, framing the arc temporally. However, the timeframe is not tracked in beats—no clock tightens decisions, no moments where Aria must hurry or sacrifice thoroughness. The sunrise simply arrives as a backdrop to her success rather than forcing a trade-off. Setup and closure mention without middle pressure; present but not constraining.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Finding the stairway of ascension is Aria's explicit goal from the opening ("she was searching for the stairway") and drives her middle actions (uncovering murals, following light). The motivation is clear and sustained, reaching payoff when she ascends. However, it is never dramatized as conflicted—no competing desire, no cost weighed, no friction between wanting the throne and fearing its burden. Told and pursued, but not tested or deepened by on-page choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>"Futuristic nostalgia" is declared twice ("air was alive with a futuristic nostalgia," "sense of longing for a future that had never come to pass") but remains label-only. The tone does not modulate with pressure or emerge through diction, imagery, or rhythm—ruined spires and cybernetic birds are described in neutral high-fantasy register. The final image (sun rising, new era) shifts to generic optimism without tonal continuity. Present as assertion, absent as execution.</comment>
