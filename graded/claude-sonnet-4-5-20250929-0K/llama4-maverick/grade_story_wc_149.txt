<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The ghost bride and alchemist lack distinct interiority or embodied emotion; motivations are told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The alchemist's "inexplicable sense of longing" and the ghost bride's "lovingly venomous intent" remain labels without scene pressure or visible trade-offs. No micro-choices reveal hierarchy of values; the protagonist's transformation happens passively when she touches the bead rather than through earned struggle. The final "mournful elation" is asserted, not embodied through action or perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test: Who-where-when anchors arrive by paragraph one, but "when" remains abstract ("endless night," "hush of winter-cracked fields"). The closure unit—alchemist gains mastery, ghost bride fades—occurs on the page but lacks visible cost; the "debt slowly being repaid" is summary, not a decisive forfeiture or trade-off the reader witnesses. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (luminous atmosphere, recurring bead imagery) but the final paragraphs loop thematic restatements without deepening pressure or reweighting prior material. The alchemist's discovery happens through lucky contact with the bead rather than protagonist-driven escalation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The greenhouse's "luminescent orbs," "blooming flowers," and "endless night" establish vivid sensory anchors, and the carved stone bead functions as micro-setting. However, the environment does not constrain choice or alter tactics; the alchemist simply reaches out and claims the bead without spatial friction. The "over the hush of winter-cracked fields" tag appears twice but remains disconnected from the greenhouse interior. Occupational detail (transmutation, resonant awakenings) is mentioned but not shown through tool use or process that shapes the protagonist's moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—unlocking resonant awakenings—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or cost. The alchemist's discovery occurs through passive contact with the bead; no decision narrows options or forces a trade-off. The ghost bride's presence is atmospheric rather than an active pressure that the alchemist must navigate. The resolution ("debt slowly being repaid") is told in summary without an on-page tightening or reversal that forecloses a live path. Coincidence (touching the bead) resolves the central problem it did not help create.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme—repaying debt, transformation through guidance—is stated rather than emergent from particulars. The final paragraphs loop "mournful elation," "lovingly venomous," and "resonant awakenings" as overt thematic summaries rather than letting image do the work. The carved stone bead recurs but without shifting meaning; its symbolic role is fixed from first mention. No earned insight arises from concrete struggle; the alchemist's understanding is declared ("she understood the true nature") rather than demonstrated through choice or renunciation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>POV distance is stable third-person limited on the alchemist, but interiority is abstract and label-heavy ("inexplicable sense of longing," "mournful elation"). Diction drifts into elevated register ("ephemeral cameo appearances," "resonant frequency she had unwittingly unlocked") that does not match the alchemist's lived experience or urgency. No dialogue on the page. Perceptual signature is generic; the alchemist notices greenhouse details in catalog fashion without bias or selective attention reflecting her craft. The ghost bride's arrival is marked by scent and visual cues but not filtered through the alchemist's embodied reaction or micro-choices.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops and template cadence across the piece: "The ghost bride was driven… and her actions were guided" restates motivation in adjacent clauses; "the alchemist began to weave… using the carved stone bead" loops action without new detail. Runs of "As the alchemist…" and "The ghost bride…" stems flatten rhythm. Stock metaphors ("two dark pools of water," "cauldron of transformation") blur rather than sharpen sense. Filter-verb stacks ("felt a shiver," "sensed the weight," "felt a surge") dull immediacy in peak beats. Final paragraphs recycle "mournful elation" and "resonant awakenings" without propulsion, creating a summary loop rather than closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The ghost-bride-guides-alchemist frame and debt-repayment premise are familiar templates without fresh synthesis. "Lovingly venomous" and "mournful elation" are interesting phrase constructions but remain labels rather than lived contradictions. The carved stone bead and resonant awakenings function as fantasy-vernacular tokens without specific grounding in world logic or character cost. No bold structural or perspectival risk; the narrative progresses in and-then fashion without a non-obvious turn that grows from prior particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The ashen-veil ghost bride appears in multiple paragraphs but makes no choices that alter the alchemist's options. Her guidance is told in summary ("had been subtly guiding") rather than shown through on-page action. She materializes, watches, and fades without agency that shapes a key turn. Observation-only role trends low per the rubric.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The carved stone bead is introduced early (setup ✓), handled when the alchemist claims it (development ✓), and recurs in the final paragraph as "a symbol" and "a focal point" (payoff ✓). Two distinct beats: claiming and weaving into craft. However, the bead's effect is passive—touching it unlocks resonant awakenings without the alchemist navigating cost or constraint. Swappable with any "key" object; its carved symbols are mentioned but never leveraged in a choice.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Resonant awakenings is named frequently but remains a label without visible mechanics or trade-off. The concept does not constrain tactics or force a choice; the alchemist "unwittingly unlocked" it by touching the bead. Present as theme and world flavor but does not shape on-page stakes or alter options, trending low per the rubric.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Lovingly venomous intent" is ascribed to the ghost bride in one sentence but never enacted through a choice that shows both devotion and harm. Label-only mention without visible tradeoff or cost. Does not constrain or enable an on-page action.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The ghost bride's ephemeral appearances frame the story (setup ✓) and recur at the moment the alchemist claims the bead (development ✓) and at the ending when she fades (payoff ✓). However, the ghosting action is atmospheric rather than causal; the alchemist's discovery would proceed identically if the ghost simply stood present. Swappable with "observing" or "appearing"; the ephemeral quality does not redefine options or impose cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Through ephemeral cameo appearances" describes the ghost bride's method and is mentioned early (setup ✓). The method recurs when the ghost "materialized" and later "reappeared" (development ✓) and shapes the ending when "the last vestiges… dissipated" (payoff ✓). Yet the mechanics never matter to the alchemist's choices; the cameo mode is told rather than shown to constrain or enable tactics. Functional but replaceable with "brief visits" or "occasional presence."</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The alchemical orchard greenhouse shrouded in endless night is established in the opening sentence (setup ✓) and recurs throughout. The greenhouse "came alive" when the bead is activated (development ✓) and the final image gazes upon the transformed greenhouse (payoff ✓). The setting supplies vivid atmosphere but does not constrain the alchemist's moves or supply resources that alter outcome; she reaches for the bead without spatial friction. One causal beat: the greenhouse's plants respond to resonant frequency, but this is passive reaction rather than a choice-shaping pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Over the hush of winter-cracked fields" appears twice as a poetic tag but does not tighten decisions or track elapsed time. No live clock; the narrative progresses in summary fashion ("As the night wore on") without temporal pressure that alters the alchemist's tactics. Ornamental use only.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The ghost bride's motivation to repay a debt across lifetimes is stated in the second paragraph (setup ✓) and recurs when the alchemist "sensed the weight of the specter's motivation" and again when "her debt slowly being repaid" (development ✓ and payoff ✓). The motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices or visible cost; the ghost bride's actions (guiding, watching, fading) flow without friction between desire and price. Summary-only use trends mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Mournful elation" is assigned to the ghost bride's expression and later to the alchemist's heart in the final paragraphs. The tone is declared twice but not modulated with pressure or enacted through contradictory gesture or perception. Static mood applied as a label rather than charged through the final image. Present but not developed across turns.</comment>
