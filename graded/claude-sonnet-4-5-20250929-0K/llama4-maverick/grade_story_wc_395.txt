<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lena's motivation to uncover truth is stated but remains abstract through most of the piece. The late revelation that she's "searching for a way to fill the void left by her own lost loved ones" arrives as explanation rather than dramatized interior conflict acting in scene. Micro-choices under pressure are largely absent; she investigates, notices patterns, and arrives at conclusions without visible trade-offs or contradictory impulses complicating her decisions. The ending pivot—deleted files were "simply archived"—lands as information rather than a choice that forecloses a path with felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The piece orients who (Lena) and where (archive) early, satisfying the Orientation Test. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—recurring numbers, cryptic messages, layered metadata—building toward a final reweighting. However, the closure moment ("the files were not deleted, they were simply archived") offers a conceptual answer without visible or felt cost on the page; the discovery is exhilarating and terrifying in summary but does not visibly foreclose an option or reweight prior stakes with undeniable pressure. The lens holds but the closure unit lacks the Cost Proof Test requirement.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The archive setting is evoked with "labyrinth of servers and dusty hard drives," "dimly lit room," and "rows of metadata," anchoring mood and context. The digital detritus and forgotten passwords supply a textural backdrop. However, the environment does not demonstrably constrain a choice or charge the final image—Lena navigates it without friction, and the spaceship patch and recurring numbers function as clues rather than spatial or material obstacles. Micro-setting (the patch, the servers) is present but does not alter tactics at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—uncovering the truth behind the missing employees—is signaled early and sustained. The recurring numbers provide a pattern of intensification, and the cryptic warning ("They're watching") hints at escalation. Yet no on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows Lena's options with visible cost; she "dug deeper," "began to notice," "became convinced," all summary verbs that describe investigation without dramatizing a decision that forecloses a path. The resolution is discovery-driven rather than agency-driven, and the cost remains asserted ("both exhilarating and terrifying") without specific consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme—memory, absence, the persistence of the past—emerges from the archive setting and the recurring numbers motif. The final assertion that "the sensed absence...was no longer a source of pain" and "a reminder of what could be found" gestures toward thematic closure. However, the ending summarizes this shift rather than offering a resonant, non-literal image; the last lines drift into abstract philosophizing ("a hidden pattern in the fabric of the digital universe," "newfound sense of wonder and awe") that replaces scene pressure. The thematic echo in the penultimate paragraph ("she would continue to tend the corporate memory...with a newfound sense of wonder") reads as a thesis statement rather than earned particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited on Lena. Diction is generally controlled—"brightly attentive eyes," "ghostly signature," "digital abyss"—though some phrases veer into elevated register ("fierce determination," "exhilarating and terrifying") that feel writerly rather than character-particular. Perceptual signature is present (metadata, timestamps, IP addresses) but becomes generic in reflection passages. No dialogue appears. The final paragraphs accumulate summary interiority ("she knew that she would never look at the digital world in the same way again") that flattens immediacy, and the voice does not sharply distinguish itself under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Sentence openings recycle patterns: "Lena's brightly attentive eyes," "Lena's obsession," "Lena's search," "Lena knew," "Lena felt," creating template cadence across multiple beats (−0.5). Paraphrase loops appear: "She had been investigating" / "Lena's obsession with the case grew"; "the numbers were appearing everywhere" / "The numbers continued to appear." Filter verbs stack in reflective passages ("she realized," "she knew," "she felt") dulling immediacy. The final third summarizes rather than dramatizes ("her journey had taken her," "she had emerged transformed"), and the closure beat is buried in abstraction. Artifacts touch the closure zone, triggering disqualification from 9+ and a −1.0 cumulative penalty in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The premise—corporate archivist uncovers conspiracy via recurring digital clues—echoes familiar mystery templates without a fresh synthesis. The spaceship patch and "Echo-1" cryptic message feel ornamental rather than integral; the missing persons cold case and top-secret project "Stellar" supply genre furniture but do not transform through specific lived detail or moral calculus. The recurring numbers (4-1-5-9) promise pattern but resolve into a map metaphor without unique consequence. The revelation that files were archived rather than deleted is mildly clever but lacks the inevitability or human cost that would elevate it beyond a premise twist.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Lena is present throughout and her role as corporate memory keeper frames her access to the archive (setup gate met). She investigates, notices patterns, and uncovers the truth (development and payoff gates met). However, her choices are largely observational—she searches, pores over data, becomes convinced—without on-page decisions that alter tactics under pressure. The element is functional but her agency does not create key turns; discovery drives the plot rather than choice.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The patch appears early ("The only clue was a patch from a crashed spaceship mission") with cryptic message "Echo-1" and numbers 4-1-5-9 (setup gate met). It is mentioned again near the end ("The patch...was more than just a clue—it was a key") but only as summary; it is not handled, examined, or used in a second distinct beat (development gate weak). It does not appear in or shape the closure image (payoff gate missed). The numbers recur, but the patch itself remains static description. Cap at 4.6 for missing development; further deduct for ornamental/summary-only use.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The missing persons cold case is signaled early (setup gate met) and drives Lena's investigation throughout (development gate met). The search for the disappeared employees shapes her tactics—examining metadata, timestamps, and cryptic messages. The closure moment pivots to "where the deleted files had gone" rather than the fate of the persons, reweighting the mystery (payoff gate met). However, the case itself does not impose a visible cost or narrow options at the end; it remains a stake rather than a constraint that charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Brightly attentive eyes" appears once in the opening ("Lena's brightly attentive eyes scanned the rows of metadata") and again near the end ("her brightly attentive eyes now seeing the world in a new light"). The trait is described but does not constrain or enable an on-page action with cost; it functions as a label rather than a dramatized capability. The reprise reweights slightly (lyric resonance) but without causal pressure. Cap at 4.6 for missing development gate; further deduct for label-only use (−0.3) and summary reprise (−0.3).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The action "lie" appears explicitly once: "The message read: 'They're watching, and they're waiting. Don't lie to yourself, Lena.'" followed by "Lena felt a shiver...she had been lying to herself—she wasn't just searching for the truth, she was searching for a way to fill the void left by her own lost loved ones." This beat occurs in the second half (setup gate barely met, late penalty −0.3). The lie is revealed but does not drive a major turn; Lena continues her search unchanged. It does not shape the closure image (payoff gate missed). The realization is told rather than dramatized in a choice (summary-only −0.3). Cap at 4.6 for missing payoff; additional deductions lower the score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Recurring numbers (4-1-5-9) appear early on the patch, then "in the timestamps of deleted files, in the metadata of archived images, and even in the IP addresses of former employees" (setup and development gates met). Lena follows them as "a map, leading her deeper into the heart of the archive." The numbers guide her investigation tactics (causal pressure +0.5) and recur across beats (+0.9). However, they do not appear in or decisively shape the closure image—the ending pivots to archived files without referencing the numbers (payoff gate missed, cap at 4.6). Still, their middle-beat work and pressure earn credit within that cap.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The social network archive is established early ("dimly lit room...labyrinth of servers and dusty hard drives," "rows of metadata") and remains the consistent location throughout (setup and development gates met). Lena's access to "deleted files," "timestamps," "metadata," and "IP addresses" supplies the resources for her investigation, and the archive's structure ("the very edge of the digital abyss") frames the quest. The archive is referenced at closure ("As she shut down the archive") (payoff gate met). However, it does not impose a specific constraint or alter a tactic at the ending; it functions as backdrop rather than pressure. All gates met but no causal shaping of the final image limits the score to mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Across the echo of forgotten songs" appears once in the middle paragraph ("The journey was taking her across the echo of forgotten songs, through the digital detritus of years past") and again near the end ("The echo of forgotten songs still lingered"). The phrase is poetic but vague—it does not anchor a specific duration, deadline, or temporal pressure that tightens decisions. Time is not tracked or used to constrain tactics (all gates missed, cap at 2.8). The reprise reweights mood slightly but without causal function. Ornamental use (−0.5) and late first appearance (−0.3) lower the score further.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The motivation "to find where deleted files go" is stated near the end: "the real mystery was not the disappearance of the employees, but where the deleted files had gone." This is the closure revelation but arrives as summary rather than a desire dramatized through conflicted choices (setup gate missed, payoff gate weakly met via late arrival, cap at 4.6). Earlier, Lena seeks "the truth behind the disappearances" but the files-destination stake is not signaled or developed in the first two-thirds (development gate missed). The pivot feels convenient rather than earned. Late first appearance (−0.6) and summary-only (−0.3) further reduce the score.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Sensed absence" is present from the opening ("the haunting sense of absence that permeated the archive") and sustained as Lena searches for disappeared employees and lost loved ones (setup and development gates met). The tone modulates at closure: "The sensed absence...was still there, but it was no longer a source of pain—it was a reminder of the mysteries that lay just beyond the edge of perception" (payoff gate met). The tone coheres and reweights at the end, charging the final image with undeniable pressure (+1.2). However, the ending drifts into summary declaration rather than embodied perception, limiting the felt charge. All gates met with closure linkage earns solid mid-6s.</comment>
