<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The guardian remains opaque throughout, with motivation stated abstractly ("teach darkness the value of stars") rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. Interiority is generic and label-driven ("spiralingly calm," "unreadable expression") without embodied emotion or character-particular texture. The figure's arrival and departure lack causal grounding in the guardian's desires or constraints; no visible cost attends the final moment. Agency is observation, not decision that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early enough, but no meaningful escalation or decisive change occurs on the page—pressure remains static from first beat to last. The "stillwater tension" dissipates without cost, and the guardian's stance at closure is identical to the opening; no option is foreclosed, no knowledge altered. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural by intent, but no cadence shift or pattern break reweights the stake. The piece ends where it began, with the guardian gazing at water and the figure vanished, offering Charged Poise without undeniable pressure or felt consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The cobalt dock and mist establish atmosphere, but setting does not constrain a choice or charge the final image—it remains decorative postcard description. Sensory detail (wet earth, ozone, lapping water) is present but does not filter through POV urgency or alter tactics. The dental mirror and shutters are handled, yet spatial choreography (distance, sight lines, guardian's exact position) drifts vaguely across beats. The micro-setting allowance is not met; no tool or object forces a tradeoff at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake is never signaled concretely—"silent empathy" and "teach darkness the value of stars" remain abstract declarations without an on-page dilemma that narrows options. No reversal, tightening, or deepening occurs; the guardian watches, the figure weaves patterns, they share "understanding," and part without friction or trade-off. Coincidence (the figure's emergence from mist) complicates nothing. Agency is absent: no decision alters later tactics, no visible price is paid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Theme ("silent empathy," teaching darkness the value of stars) is stated repeatedly rather than emerging from concrete choices and images. The final paragraph moralizes overtly: "a testament to the power of silent empathy" and "the value of light in darkness" replace earned resonance with prompt-echo abstraction. No particular action or object reweights prior material; the dental mirror's "otherworldly light" is decorative, not thematic pressure. The story tells its theme rather than trusting scene work, triggering penalty for theme summary in the final third.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>POV remains third-person limited to the guardian with stable distance, but perceptual signature is generic—"unreadable expression," "mesmerized," "entranced"—without character-specific filtering. Diction drifts into elevated abstraction ("stillwater tension," "spiralingly calm," "otherworldly light") that clashes with the guardian's tacit, physical role. The figure's brief whispered speech is summarized rather than rendered, losing voice distinction. Psychic distance is controlled, yet the prose reads as committee voice rather than a singular perspective rooted in the guardian's way of noticing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade the text: "stillwater tension" appears five times; "silent empathy" recurs without new pressure; "unreadable" and variants cycle through adjacent beats. Template cadence ("The guardian's eyes…," "The figure…," "As the…") dominates sentence openings, creating drumbeat rhythm. Stock metaphors ("glistened like a still pond," "otherworldly light") and therapy-speak labels ("spiralingly calm") dull specificity. Figurative density in the final third ("testament," "intricate," "palpable") obscures rather than charges the closure image. Multiple artifacts touch the ending, triggering −1.7 baseline and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The premise (mysterious guardian meets enigmatic figure, shares wordless connection) follows a template mystical-encounter arc without transformation through specific detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The dental mirror, shutter patterns, and "teach darkness the value of stars" read as prompt-checklist items rather than organically synthesized elements. No turn feels inevitable in hindsight; the story could swap names and setting without altering its emotional or thematic arc. Elevated diction ("stillwater tension," "half-spoken secret") aims for lyricism but lands as generic placeholder mood.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>The guardian is present throughout and frames the opening and closing images, satisfying setup and closure gates. However, the character makes no on-page decision that alters tactics or forecloses a path; all action is observation and passive reception. The final gesture (hand weaving a pattern in the air) is mirrored empathy, not a choice with cost. Late first action (final third) and ornamental role apply penalties. Swappable with any silent witness archetype.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The dental mirror appears in two beats (reveal, final glow) but is handled passively—opened by the figure, then "lay abandoned." No evolving use or reweighted meaning; it does not constrain a choice or charge the closure beyond decorative "otherworldly light." Setup and development gates are present, but closure participation is ornamental mention rather than causal involvement. Swappable with any reflective object.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Silent empathy" is theme-claimed repeatedly but does not shape on-page stakes or tactics—it is atmosphere, not conflict driver. The connection between guardian and figure is asserted ("deep understanding," "thread of silent empathy") rather than dramatized through constrained choice. No cost is visible. Mentioned throughout (setup, development, closure gates present) but functions as label, not pressure. Trends low per concept-as-theme guidance.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Spiralingly calm" is label-only, appearing once in mid-story without constraining or enabling action. No visible tradeoff ties the trait to a decision; it describes mood rather than altering behavior under pressure. Missing setup (not mentioned until second third), missing closure participation. Swappable with any synonym for "deepening calm."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Weave" appears in two beats: the figure weaves shutter patterns, the guardian weaves a hand pattern in air. Setup and development gates are met, and the action frames the empathic exchange at closure. However, no major turn traces to weaving; it is aesthetic choreography rather than causally necessary. Swappable with "gesture" or "trace" with minor edits. Lyric reprise present but without high irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Creating patterns with shutters is dramatized in the middle beat (setup and development gates met) but does not return or shape closure; the guardian's final hand gesture is described as "weaving" but without shutter involvement. The method matters once, then is abandoned. Mechanics are vague (how do shutters create "intricate shadow"?) and swappable with any symbolic craft. Missing closure participation caps score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The cobalt dock after rain frames opening and closing images (setup and closure gates met) and provides spatial anchor, but does not pressure a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome. The wet surface, mist, and water remain postcard atmosphere. The final image returns to the dock, offering lyric reprise, but no tactic depends on the setting's properties. Functional but replaceable with any liminal outdoor locale.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Within the edge of a half-spoken secret" appears only as framing phrase in the penultimate paragraph—introduced after the 40% mark. No live clock tightens decisions; time is vague throughout. The phrase is metaphorical caption rather than dramatized constraint. Missing setup, missing development; ornamental mention at closure. Cap at 4.6 for late introduction, further reduced for summary-only use.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>"To teach darkness the value of stars" is stated twice (mid-story, final paragraph) but never dramatized through a conflicted choice or visible friction between want and cost. The guardian's motivation remains abstract declaration; no on-page action tests it. The stars "twinkling" in the final image is illustrative postscript, not earned pressure. Setup present (mentioned by midpoint), but development and closure participation are told-only. Label-only trait deduction applies.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Stillwater tension" is named five times and coheres across beats, modulating from "pervaded" to "dissipated" to "blend with" at closure. Setup, development, and closure gates are met. However, the tone is asserted via label rather than charged through diction, rhythm, or image that reweights the stake—it remains static mood descriptor. The final reprise ("becoming one with the stillwater tension") is told summary, not felt pressure. Functional but swappable with "quiet dread" or similar.</comment>
