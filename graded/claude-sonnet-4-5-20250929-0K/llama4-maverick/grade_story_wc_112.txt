<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Kaelin's motivation to prove time moves sideways is declared but never dramatized through on-page conflict or micro-choices under pressure. The touching-the-nexus decision lacks visible internal contradiction or cost; she hesitates "for a moment" then proceeds without dramatized risk assessment. Interiority relies heavily on label-only emotion ("sense of satisfaction," "sense of awe," "sense of wonder") rather than embodied perception. The final change—returning with tingles and excitement—feels asserted rather than earned through prior struggle or forfeited path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (xenobiology station, Kaelin, twilight repair task) arrive within the opening paragraph. The closure unit—Kaelin touches the nexus, experiences sideways time, returns confirmed—qualifies as Decisive Change under a Causal lens, but the cost is unclear: she gains data and excitement without visible trade-off or foreclosed option. The "reluctance" to return is mentioned but not dramatized, and her post-return state ("confident," "excited") shows no loss. The inferred lens (Causal) holds, but cost legibility at closure is weak, triggering the Cost proof test deduction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The research station is anchored early (laboratory, workstations, atmospheric simulator) and the simulator's mechanics (pumps, valves, holographic displays) ground the repair task. However, setting detail remains largely decorative: the simulator enables the nexus replication but does not constrain Kaelin's choices or alter her tactics under pressure. The planet's winged creatures and twilight atmosphere are mentioned but never pressure the closure moment. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving time moves sideways—is signaled early but never tested on the page. Kaelin repairs the simulator without complication, activates it successfully, and touches the nexus without resistance or visible cost. No tightening or deepening occurs; the sequence is additive (repair → activate → touch → experience → return) rather than escalating. The "reluctance" to return is asserted in one line but immediately resolved without dramatized trade-off. Agency at closure (touching the nexus) is present but uncomplicated by competing impulses or prices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The theme of time-as-sideways and discovery emerges through action, and the nexus functions as a recurring image that shifts meaning from spectral mystery to proven phenomenon. However, the final paragraph moralizes overtly: "she had uncovered a secret that would change the course of human understanding forever" and "she would never see the universe in the same way again" are abstract theme statements rather than resonant particulars. The phrase "icy warmth of discovery" in the penultimate paragraph attempts thematic synthesis but feels decorative. No earned wisdom arises from specific struggle; the breakthrough is convenient rather than costly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited throughout, and perceptual filtering is consistent (mechanically warm hands, focus on simulator mechanics). However, diction drifts into elevated register during peak moments: "the very fabric of reality was being manipulated," "infinite possibilities that lay beyond the veil of reality," "coursing through her veins like liquid fire." These phrases feel imported rather than rooted in Kaelin's vocational idiom as a mechanic. The phrase "within the hush of beating wings at rest" recurs twice but reads as authorial ornament rather than character-specific perception. Psychic distance is consistent but lacks the texture of a singular mind under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Multiple paraphrase loops and template cadence runs are present: "Kaelin felt a sense of [X]" appears four times ("satisfaction," "awe," "wonder," "excitement"); "the laboratory's [adjective] atmosphere" recurs; "As she [verb]" opens multiple sentences. Stock metaphors cluster: "liquid fire," "fabric of reality," "veil of reality," "diamonds in the night sky." The phrase "mechanically warm hands" appears twice in similar constructions without advancing pressure. Figurative language in the climax ("kaleidoscope of colors and lights") is generic. Information density is moderate; many lines describe without advancing stakes. These artifacts dull momentum and disallow 9+ globally per the penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The core premise—mechanic proves time theory via simulator—combines familiar SF tropes (lone technician, mysterious phenomenon, eureka moment) without transformation. The resolution is frictionless: Kaelin's theory is immediately validated without meaningful resistance, cost, or complication. The "time moves sideways" concept is asserted but never defined through specific, observable consequences that constrain or enable her choices. Emotional beats follow a predictable arc (task focus → curiosity → awe → triumph) without a non-obvious turn. The nexus as spectral harbinger → proven phenomenon could be fresh, but the journey lacks specificity that would make this story irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Kaelin is present throughout and makes two decisions: repairing the simulator and touching the nexus. The repair is completed without complication or choice under pressure. Touching the nexus is a turning action but lacks dramatized internal conflict or visible cost; her hesitation is mentioned in passing. "Obliging" is not demonstrated through on-page behavior; she works alone and no request or obligation is shown. Present in setup and closure, but neither decision alters tactics or forecloses a path with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The magnetic nexus appears in four beats: initial detection reference, holographic replication in the simulator, physical touch, and return to the laboratory with its "power still coursing." Setup is early, middle development occurs when it coalesces in the simulator chamber, and closure linkage is strong (Kaelin touches it and experiences the sideways-time vision). However, its unique properties are not specified—why magnetic, why at twilight—and its function is generic (portal to sideways time). Causal pressure is moderate; it enables the climax but does not constrain earlier choices. Swappable with "temporal anomaly" or similar with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Subdued awakenings" appears once as a phrase describing "stirring within the depths of the simulator" and is linked thematically to the planet's winged creatures in torpor. It does not shape stakes, constrain choices, or alter tactics on the page. The concept is ornamental, invoked to add atmosphere rather than drive causality. No cost or trade-off is tied to it. Late first appearance (middle third), summary-only use, and no closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Mechanically warm hands" is mentioned twice: once during repair and once after return. The attribute is descriptive and possibly refers to prosthetics or augmentation, but it does not constrain or enable any on-page action. No visible trade-off, limitation, or advantage tied to the warmth is shown. The detail could be removed without altering any beat. Setup is present, but middle development and closure participation are absent; label-only trait.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Flipping the lever activates the simulator, which generates the holographic nexus and drives the climax. The action is causally central: without it, the nexus does not appear and Kaelin cannot touch it. However, the lever-flip itself is not a moment of choice under pressure; it is the successful completion of the repair task. No cost or complication attends the action. Setup occurs in the first third, middle beat is the activation, and closure depends on its success, but the action is mechanical rather than stake-laden. Could be replaced with "pressed the activation panel" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Through holographic principles" is stated once to explain how the simulator replicates the nexus. The method is mentioned but not detailed; its mechanics do not constrain Kaelin's attempts or introduce complications. It appears in the middle third as an explanation rather than a shaping force. No setup beat establishes holography as a challenge or resource, and closure does not hinge on its specific properties. Functional but generic; could be "quantum field manipulation" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The xenobiology research station is named and anchored early (laboratory, sterile workstations, air-conditioned atmosphere, equipment hum). It provides the simulator and solitude necessary for the experiment. However, the xenobiology aspect is not integrated—no biological specimens, xenobiology tasks, or conflict tied to the station's research purpose appear. The station is a backdrop rather than a pressure source; any isolated research lab would serve equally. Setup and middle presence are clear, but the setting does not constrain tactics or charge closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Within the hush of beating wings at rest" appears twice as a lyric phrase tied to the planet's winged creatures in torpor. It does not function as a timeframe that tightens decisions or creates a live clock. The phrase is ornamental and thematic rather than causal. No urgency, countdown, or time-sensitive choice is dramatized. The story's timeline is vague (twilight fades, Kaelin works, activates simulator, experiences vision, returns) without tracked duration. Ornamental use, no middle development, weak closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The motivation to prove time moves sideways is stated explicitly in the opening third and referenced at closure ("she had proven her theory"). It drives Kaelin's repair task and data analysis. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized: no on-page friction between this goal and competing wants, no visible cost of pursuing it (time, resources, reputation), and no complication when she achieves it. The motivation shapes the overarching goal but does not generate conflicted micro-choices. Setup and closure presence are strong, but middle development lacks pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Icy warmth" appears three times: describing the laboratory atmosphere, Kaelin's bodily sensation near the nexus, and the feeling of discovery at closure. The phrase attempts to establish oxymoronic tone but remains abstract; what icy warmth feels like or why it matters is not embodied. Tone does not modulate with pressure; the narration maintains a dreamy, elevated register throughout without tightening during the lever-pull or nexus-touch. Present in setup and closure, but static and label-only rather than embodied or pressure-responsive.</comment>
