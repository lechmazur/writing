<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The keeper's motivation remains abstract throughout; "teach suffocating to breathe" is stated twice but never dramatized through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. Internal conflict is asserted ("a mix of sorrow and longing") rather than shown through simultaneous competing desires. The final decision to step forward feels declarative rather than earned by prior causality with visible cost. Embodied emotion is minimal; most interiority reads as summary labels.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Orientation is weak: "ashen charcoal sanctuary" anchors place vaguely, but who the keeper is and when this occurs remain hazy past the 120-word mark, triggering the −0.3 penalty and Q3 cap at 7.0. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (shadow-tending → reconnection → revival), and a Resonant Reconfiguration occurs when the keeper steps through the threshold. However, the cost is told ("their journey had changed them") rather than shown in a concrete forfeiture or image, weakening closure legibility. The "fading threshold" problem and its solution via the flickering flame feel convenient rather than causally seeded.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The "ashen charcoal sanctuary under starlight" and doorknocker ring provide atmosphere, but spatial choreography is vague—descent into "depths" lacks concrete anchors. The flickering flame at the heart constrains the keeper's final action, meeting the 9+ gate narrowly, but sensory detail is heavily visual and generic (starlight, grey, soft glow). The cap at 7.0 from Q2's orientation debt applies, limiting the score despite the flame's role in closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reviving the fading threshold—is signaled early but never tested by a meaningful reversal or tightening that narrows options. The keeper's journey is a smooth descent without obstacles; the flame responds immediately to touch, offering no resistance or cost. No agency-driven escalation occurs; the sanctuary "stirs" and transforms passively. The resolution is told ("the keeper's task was complete") without a visible price or foreclosed path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme ("teach suffocating to breathe") is stated twice but never emerges from concrete action or image. The ending asserts transformation ("they had learned") without showing what changed or what was risked. Subtext is absent; every idea is narrated directly. The doorknocker ring recurs but does not accumulate meaning or reweight prior material—it merely "fell silent." No non-literal answer or resonance; only summary moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>POV distance is stable (third limited), but the voice is generic and unmarked by the keeper's perceptual signature. Diction drifts into elevated register ("palpable sense of loaded emptiness," "phoenix from the ashes") that feels imposed rather than character-rooted. Purposeful compression is absent; the prose unfolds at uniform pace without modulation. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance remains constant, missing opportunities to tighten during the climactic flame-touch.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "the keeper's decision to isolate," "their path was not one of destruction, but of careful pruning," "to allow the sanctuary to flourish in its isolation" all restate the same idea across adjacent paragraphs. Template cadence: "The keeper's touch was gentle... their actions were always calculated... their path was not one of destruction" follows identical stems. Stock metaphors ("phoenix from the ashes," "slumbering giant," "dark tentacles") cluster without fresh inflection. Applying −1.2 for loops, template stems, and stock strings touching multiple beats. Figurative density in the final third ("ethereal light," "testament to tender care") lacks grounding and dulls the closure image, adding −0.5. Total deductions approach −1.7, capping this category and disallowing 9+ globally per artifact rules.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The premise—isolated keeper reviving a sanctuary—follows a familiar template (reluctant guardian returns to duty). "Teach suffocating to breathe" reads as prompt-label shorthand rather than a fresh synthesis. The flame resolution and "burns bridges carefully" trait are mentioned but do not transform the arc. No specific, non-obvious angle emerges; the journey could occur in any mystical refuge with minor edits. Emotional honesty is undercut by summary assertions and stock turns.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The tender shadow keeper is the POV throughout (setup ✓) and makes the final choice to step forward (payoff ✓), but middle development is passive—shadows respond to the keeper's presence rather than the keeper making a constrained choice. The trait "tender" is label-only; "shadow keeper" is a title without mechanics. One functional beat (closure step) yields mid-low band. Late penalty minimal since present early, but swappability and passivity prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The doorknocker ring appears in the opening (setup ✓) and final paragraphs (payoff ✓), but middle development is absent—it does not constrain or enable any choice. Description shifts from "skeletal hand" to "soft grey" to "ethereal light" without causal reason. Two touches (first and last) meet the object gate, but static, ornamental use and lack of cost linkage cap the score. Swappable with any threshold marker.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The fading threshold is named early (setup ✓), drives the keeper's descent (middle ✓), and is revitalized at closure (payoff ✓). It shapes the dominant stake and the final action (touching the flame). However, the mechanics are vague—"a gentle glow" that "began to wane"—and the resolution feels convenient. Cost is told rather than shown. Three-gate presence and stake linkage push into mid-band, but lack of specificity and causal friction prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>"Burns bridges carefully" is mentioned once in paragraph 6 as a character summary but never demonstrated through an on-page action with visible cost. No bridge is burned; no path is foreclosed. The trait remains a label without mechanics or consequences. Ornamental mention in setup only; no development or payoff. Low band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Encroach upon this decline" appears in paragraph 10 as a stated motivation but does not drive a major turn. The keeper's actual actions are "reaching out," "descending," and "touching"—generic moves that could serve any mystical-journey plot. No on-page moment where encroachment alters tactics or stakes. Functional mention but swappable; mid-low band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Linking through scars" is named in paragraph 11 (setup ✓) and used once when the keeper "reached out to the shadows, feeling the familiar tug" (middle ✓). The method does not appear at closure. Mechanics remain abstract ("a method they had mastered"); no cost or constraint is shown. Two beats meet minimal development, but lack of specificity and closure absence prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The ashen charcoal sanctuary under starlight frames the entire piece (setup ✓) and is described as "reborn" at closure (payoff ✓). Middle development is weak—the setting does not constrain movement or provide resources that alter tactics. Spatial details are vague ("depths," "heart"). The flame at the sanctuary's core enables the final action, pushing into mid-band, but postcard-level description and lack of micro-setting pressure limit the score.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"After cutting off all contact" anchors backstory (setup ✓) and is referenced at closure ("they could no longer remain isolated," payoff ✓). No middle development—elapsed time and its pressure are not tracked. The timeframe does not tighten decisions; it remains a static background fact. Two-gate presence yields low-mid band, but no live clock or temporal constraint that alters moves.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"To teach suffocating to breathe" is stated twice (paragraphs 15 and 29) but never dramatized through conflicted choices. The keeper's own suffocation is mentioned as backstory catalyst without on-page friction. At closure, the keeper claims to have "learned" this lesson, but no scene shows the teaching or the cost. Label-only use across setup and payoff; no middle development. Low band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Loaded emptiness" appears explicitly in paragraph 20 and is woven through descriptions of the sanctuary's atmosphere (setup and middle ✓). The final image ("the doorknocker ring fell silent") carries a muted, emptied tone that coheres with the phrase (payoff ✓). Tone modulates slightly as the sanctuary "stirs" and is "reborn," though the shift is more told than shown. Three-gate presence and coherence push into mid-band, but static mood and lack of tonal charge at the climax prevent higher scoring.</comment>
