<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The caretaker remains an abstraction executing a lonely task without contradiction, struggle, or genuine internal conflict. Motivation is told ("preserve the sound of forgotten names") but never tested on the page by a concrete choice with visible cost. The prose invokes "foxglove regret" and "melancholic smile" as labels rather than embodied emotion. No micro-choice narrows options or forecloses a path; the caretaker simply continues her work in perpetuity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The piece has no decisive change, no visible cost, and no before-after legible on the page. The caretaker begins her task and continues it; singing awakens light and glow, but this changes nothing—stakes, knowledge, and options remain static. Orientation is delayed past 120 words (no clear temporal or spatial anchor until well into the text) but does stabilize. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural, but the ending is a static restatement rather than a pattern break or cadence shift with cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The opal library, glass orchids, and wind chime are described with vivid sensory detail ("sweet with the scent of old parchment," "filigree-like structures," "cracked bamboo tube"). However, the setting never constrains a choice or alters tactics; it remains postcard description. The micro-setting test is not met—no object or tool pressures the caretaker's decision-making. Spatial choreography is vague (the museum's "labyrinthine structure" and "forgotten landscape" are mentioned but not navigated).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("preserve the sound of forgotten names") is signaled but never tested by a live on-page obstacle. No reversal, tightening, or deepening narrows options; the caretaker's song succeeds without friction, and the orchids glow. The final paragraph restates the opening condition with no escalation or cost. No agency choice forecloses a path; the task simply continues unchanged.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme of memory and preservation emerges from the imagery but is overtly stated in multiple places ("preserve the sound of forgotten names," "enduring power of memory"). The final image offers a soft glow and "faint echo" but no non-literal answer or reweighting—just a static tableau. Subtext is minimal; the caretaker's "foxglove regret" is named rather than dramatized. The museum of extinct feelings remains a conceptual flourish without particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The prose establishes a consistent lyric register ("nuanced blend of sorrow and nostalgia," "velvety softness of foxglove regret") with a distinct perceptual signature. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("singular motivation," "transience of human experience") that reads more expository than voice-filtered. POV distance is stable; no head-hopping. The piece teaches a patterned, meditative cadence, but the voice lacks specificity under pressure—no degradation or sharpening when the song is sung.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "deserted marvels" appears four times, "forgotten names" three times, "glass orchids" six times, often in adjacent paragraphs without added pressure. Template cadence runs cluster in the middle third ("The caretaker's task was... The caretaker's task was not limited..."). Stock metaphors ("labyrinthine structure," "sands of time") and filter-verb stacks ("seemed to," "seemed to emanate") dull immediacy. The final third repeats the opening's static tableau, flattening momentum. Artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The premise—caretaker tending glass orchids in a cloud library while singing to preserve extinct emotions—offers a fresh fantastical frame. However, execution relies on generic abstractions ("museum of extinct feelings," "bygone era," "echoes of the past") rather than specific, grounded choices. The transformation test fails: swap names and setting, and the emotional arc (a lonely curator continues her work) remains a template. No bold risk heightens stakes; the piece retreats into safe, lyric repetition.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The caretaker is present throughout and performs actions (tending orchids, singing), but no choice alters tactics or forecloses a path. She observes, works, and continues—observation without decision. No cost tied to her agency is visible.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The wind chime appears in three beats: initial description, the singing scene where it vibrates with light, and the final echo. However, its cracked tube never constrains a choice or alters tactics; it remains atmospheric. The reprise reweights mood but not stakes. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Deserted marvels are mentioned four times as theme-claim ("where relics of a bygone era gathered dust," "deserted marvels of the opal library") but never shape on-page stakes or tactics. They echo as concept without altering options. Ornamental use.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Gently systematic" appears twice as a label framing the caretaker's work but does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with cost. No tradeoff or visible consequence tied to this trait is dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Light appears in the singing scene ("soft, mournful light," "otherworldly light") and the final paragraph ("soft, ethereal light"). It is visually present but does not redefine options or drive a turn; the orchids glow, then the scene ends unchanged. Swappable with another atmospheric effect.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The method (singing a long-forgotten song) is signaled early, used in the central beat to coax emotions back, and reprised in the final line. It shapes the middle attempt and charges the ending image. However, no cost or complication tied to the method is visible—it simply works. Present in setup, development, and closure, but lacks causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The opal library is described richly but never pressures choices or supplies resources that affect outcome. It remains postcard setting. No micro-setting element (body, tool, object) constrains tactics. Functional atmosphere without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Across the museum of extinct feelings" frames the scope but does not function as a live timeframe. No clock tightens decisions; the piece operates in static, iterative time ("as she continued her work"). Vague temporal span without pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The motivation to preserve forgotten names is told repeatedly but never dramatized through a conflicted choice with visible cost. The caretaker pursues it without friction or tradeoff. Functional label without on-page test.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Foxglove regret is named once and modulates the tone throughout with consistent melancholic softness. The tone remains coherent and charges the final image ("melancholic beauty," "soft, otherworldly light"). However, it is static—no modulation under pressure or shift that reweights stakes. One-note mood that trends mid-band.</comment>
