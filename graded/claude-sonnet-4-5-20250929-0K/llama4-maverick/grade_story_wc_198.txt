<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The saxophonist remains a cipher throughout—no embodied emotion, no internal contradiction, no micro-choices under pressure. Her motivation ("to hush the prophecy") is declared but never tested or complicated; she plays, the mist responds, she smiles and leaves. The piece offers label-only interiority ("quietly vivid intensity," "moment of quiet reflection") without concrete particulars that reveal a mind under stress. No visible cost forecloses a path; the task completes without friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first two paragraphs, avoiding the Orientation Test penalty. However, no meaningful closure unit lands: the saxophonist plays, the prophecy is "laid to rest" by assertion, and she departs satisfied. The piece offers Resonant Reconfiguration in name only—no before/after options are legible, no cost is visible. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (mist, music, prism motifs recur), but the final paragraphs loop rather than deepen, and no cadence shift reweights the stake.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The prism atrium and radiant grotto supply vivid, repeated images (refracted light, mist tendrils, dewdrops) that anchor the scene spatially. Sensory detail is selective and poetic, filtered through an elevated register. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics—it remains backdrop. The mist "responds" to music metaphorically but imposes no friction. Micro-setting use (the body, the instrument) is minimal; the saxophone is mentioned but not handled in detail across beats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("hush the prophecy") is signaled early but never escalates or tightens. No reversal, complication, or cost appears; the music succeeds without friction, and the mist cooperates. Agency is absent—no choice forecloses an option, no trade-off is dramatized. The piece proceeds in a straight line: play → mist calms → task complete. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening or pattern break is required; none occurs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>A coherent theme (music as counter-ritual, beauty versus fear) emerges from imagery and the premise. Subtext operates lightly in the mist's personification and the "vested hush" motif. However, the ending asserts resolution ("the world is a little bit quieter") rather than offering a resonant image that reweights prior material. No ambiguity lingers, no earned insight complicates the saxophonist's success. The final paragraphs recycle "quietly vivid" and "vested hush" as labels without fresh charge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, no head-hopping. The voice carries a consistent lyric register ("otherworldly ambiance," "ethereal fingers," "haunting resonance") that matches the eerie-nostalgic tone. However, perceptual signature is generic—any narrator could notice these details. Diction remains elevated throughout with no modulation under pressure (the saxophonist's interior is absent). Purposeful compression and pattern are present but not taught early or paid off at closure; the prose reads as static lyricism rather than voice under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "the mist swirls," "mist begins to clear," "mist begins to creep back," "mist swirls on" recycle the same image without added pressure. Synonym churn affects key motifs: "vested hush" appears three times, "quietly vivid" twice, "radiant grotto" four times, each repetition paraphrasing rather than deepening. Template cadence: "The saxophonist's [noun] is [adjective]" and "As [event], [result]" structures repeat across multiple paragraphs. Figurative density is high ("tendrils of fog curling," "ethereal fingers," "haunting resonance") but metaphors do not cohere or intensify—they ornament without propulsion. Apply −1.2 cumulative for loops, churn, and template runs; the artifacts touch multiple beats including the quasi-closure paragraph, triggering the −1.7 escalation and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The premise (musician countering prophecy through performance in a magical grotto) is functional but derivative of ambient-magic and ritual-music templates. The mist-and-prism setting offers vivid images but no transformation of familiar material. Emotional specificity is absent; the saxophonist's arc could fit any solitary artist narrative. No bold risk-taking or unconventional structure elevates the piece. The ending restates the opening's promise without complication, hindsight inevitability, or surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The morning fog saxophonist is present throughout and her action (playing) drives the surface plot. However, she makes no on-page choices—no decision alters tactics, no friction tests her commitment. Setup and closure participation are present, but middle development is absent (no choice constrained by her role). The character observes and performs; she does not decide under pressure. Cap at 4.6 for missing middle development, then apply −0.8 for ornamental use (description and action without choice pressure) and −0.5 for summary-only involvement (her whispering and intent are told, not dramatized in conflict). Rounding: 2.4.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The prism atrium appears in setup, middle descriptions, and the final image. It is described across multiple beats (refracted light, glowing presence, facets glinting) but never handled or used—it remains static backdrop. No choice is constrained by its structure, no tactic altered by its presence. The element is swappable with any luminous architectural feature. Setup and closure participation caps eligibility at ~6.0, but swappability (−0.8) and ornamental use (−1.0) lower the score. Rounding: 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Vested hush" is named three times (paragraphs 4, 17, 24) as a thematic label. It does not shape stakes or tactics on the page—no choice is altered by its presence, no cost tied to its achievement. The concept echoes as atmosphere rather than driving pressure. Setup is present (paragraph 4), but middle and closure participation are thematic mentions only, not causal involvement. Cap at 4.6 for missing middle development; apply −0.6 for label-only use across mentions and −0.3 for swappability (easily replaced with "silence" or "calm"). Rounding: 3.8.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>"Quietly vivid" appears twice as a descriptor (paragraphs 3, 19) without constraining or enabling action. No cost is tied to this trait, no on-page moment dramatizes its effect. The attribute is label-only. Setup is present (paragraph 3), closure participation is present (paragraph 19), but middle development is absent. Cap at 4.6 for missing middle, then apply −0.8 for label-only use and −0.5 for ornamental presence (no action pressure). Rounding: 2.7.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Whispering appears in paragraphs 6, 12, and implicitly throughout the performance. The action is tied to the saxophonist's counterpoint strategy and recurs across beats. However, major turns do not trace to whispering specifically—the music (playing the saxophone) is the primary action; whispering is an accent. The element is swappable with "singing" or "chanting" without structural change. Setup, middle, and closure participation are present, granting eligibility ≥6.1, but swappability (−0.7) and secondary-action status lower the score. Rounding: 5.3.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Through negative space" is named once (paragraph 11: "music seeps into the mist, spreading through negative space"). The phrase is metaphorical description, not a method whose mechanics shape attempts or tactics. It does not appear in setup or closure. Introduced in the middle third without prior setup, it is ornamental. Cap at 4.6 for missing setup; apply −0.8 for ornamental use and −0.5 for summary-only mention (told as metaphor, not dramatized in action). Rounding: 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The radiant grotto is named throughout (setup, middle, closure) and supplies the spatial anchor. However, it never pressures choices or supplies resources that affect outcome—it is a postcard setting. The mist is the active environmental element, not the grotto itself. Setup and closure participation are present, capping eligibility at ~6.0, but the element does not alter tactics. Apply −0.8 for ornamental use (description without choice constraint) and −0.4 for swappability (any mystical outdoor location would serve). Rounding: 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"As dewdrops form" bookends the story (opening line, paragraphs 13, 21) but the timeframe never tightens decisions or alters tactics. Time is vague and untracked; no clock imposes pressure. The dewdrops are atmospheric imagery, not a constraint. Setup and closure participation are present, but middle development is absent (no choice shaped by time). Cap at 4.6 for missing middle; apply −0.8 for ornamental use, −0.5 for vague/untracked time, and −0.3 for decorative mention. Rounding: 2.1.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The motivation to hush a prophecy is declared in paragraph 5 and recurs as justification for the performance (paragraphs 8, 15). However, it is told rather than dramatized—no friction between this desire and a cost appears, no conflicting want complicates the choice. The prophecy itself is off-page hearsay; its threat is asserted, not tested. Setup and thematic closure are present, but middle development (a choice shaped by this motivation under friction) is absent. Cap at 4.6 for missing middle; apply −0.8 for told-only motivation and −0.3 for summary-only involvement. Rounding: 3.9.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Eerie nostalgia is coherent throughout: mist, prism light, "long-forgotten era" (paragraph 10), "haunting melody," and the repeated "quietly vivid" and "vested hush" motifs establish the tone. The tone modulates lightly from mystery (opening) to peace (middle) to lingering presence (closure). It charges the final image ("the saxophonist's music remains, a whisper that echoes"). Setup, middle coherence, and closure modulation are all present, meeting the all-three-gates threshold for ≥6.1 eligibility. However, the tone is static rather than dynamically shifting under pressure—no sharp tonal break marks escalation. Apply −0.4 for limited modulation range and −0.2 for single static mood through most beats. Rounding: 5.6.</comment>
