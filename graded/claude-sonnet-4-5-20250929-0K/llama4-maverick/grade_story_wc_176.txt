<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Akira's interiority remains abstract throughout—"gentle," "focused," "satisfied"—without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. Her forgiveness backstory is told rather than integrated into present conflict; the "labor of love" and "deep connection" read as asserted motives rather than dramatized struggle. The final "smile" and "peace" arrive without visible cost or path foreclosure. No secondary character appears to test her stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Drive lens infers Accumulative/Textural but delivers static description rather than pressure accumulation. Akira begins with her goal (preserve names) and methodically executes without reversal or meaningful tightening; the rope works on first attempt. Closure—"she had done it"—lacks felt cost: no on-page choice forecloses a path, and satisfaction is asserted rather than earned. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (sanctum, Akira, rope), averting penalty, but causality remains flat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The icebound sanctum and aurora supply vivid sensory anchors (candles, hiss/crackle, ethereal glow) and the ceremonial rope is handled across multiple beats. However, the setting functions as backdrop rather than constraint: no environmental detail narrows Akira's options or complicates her work. The aurora "seemed to grow brighter" and "pulsed in harmony" but this remains observational; the space does not pressure the task.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve forgotten names—is signaled early but never tested. Akira works "undeterred," the rope reconfigures successfully, and the hum emerges as desired. No reversal, trade-off, or visible price appears; the "painstaking" process is told rather than shown with escalating friction. Coincidence does not resolve because no problem arises. The ending asserts accomplishment without cost legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme (memory preservation) emerges through the rope-as-instrument conceit, which offers specificity. Yet the final paragraph moralizes—"testament to the power of memory and the human spirit"—and Akira's stated "sense of closure and purpose" replaces scene pressure. The aurora and rope motifs recur but do not shift meaning at closure; they illustrate rather than complicate. No counter-reading tension or ambiguity charges the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Single third-person POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is thin: Akira notices candles, aurora, rope, but her lens lacks character-particular selectivity or bias. Diction occasionally drifts elevated—"snowmelt ardor," "ethereal glow"—without matching interior urgency. No dialogue. Psychic distance stays consistent, and free indirect style is clean when used, but the voice reads generic rather than distinct.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops cluster in the middle third: "worked," "task at hand," "labor of love," "driven by" recur without added pressure. Several sentences restate mood—"sense of satisfaction," "peace and accomplishment," "closure and purpose"—across the final beats. Template cadence appears: "She had come…one that," "She had always been…their lives," "She would use…its pattern." Figurative language in most closure sentences (ethereal, snowmelt ardor, infusing) lacks functional payoff. Information density remains low; many lines repeat rather than advance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Lost-wax caster reconfiguring ceremonial rope via punched-card is a fresh premise blend. However, execution defaults to stock beats: solitary artisan achieves goal without friction, finds peace. The aurora-as-witness and forgotten-names motif read familiar; emotional arc (forgiveness → accomplishment) follows a template without ironic or oblique inflection. No risk-taking in structure or voice heightens stakes; the ending delivers stated satisfaction rather than a resonant surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Akira is present throughout and her occupation frames the setup, but her actions remain procedural observation rather than decision under pressure. She unravels, reconfigures, and plucks the rope without on-page choice that alters tactics or forecloses a path. The "lost wax caster" label appears twice but her casting skill does not constrain or enable the rope work; any artisan could execute the same steps.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The street organ punched card appears at the 60% mark ("To do so, she would use…") and is fitted into the rope in a single beat. It does not return or evolve; its mention is functional but late and swappable with any patterned template. No early signal or mid-scene complication; closure depends on the rope's hum, not the card's pattern.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"Transcribed memory" is named three times and shapes Akira's stated goal. It appears in the setup and ending as a thematic claim but does not alter on-page tactics or create a choice. The rope produces "the sound of forgotten names," yet how transcription occurs or what cost it imposes remains abstract. The concept frames stakes verbally without pressuring action.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Technically gentle" appears once in the opening as a trait label. It does not constrain or enable any subsequent action; Akira's rope work is described as "deft" and "quiet confidence" but no beat demonstrates gentleness foreclosing force or creating a visible trade-off. Purely ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Illuminate" appears twice: Akira will "illuminate the transcribed memories" and later "transcribed memories, now illuminated by the reconfigured rope." It names the goal and closure state, but the mechanics remain metaphorical. The action anchors the ending thematically yet is not irreplaceable—"reveal" or "preserve" would function similarly with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The ceremonial rope is signaled in the opening, handled across multiple beats (unravel, reconfigure braids, fit card, pluck), and produces the closure hum. Its "centuries-old" and "braids" specificity matter; the method shapes middle attempts and the final success. However, the reconfiguration itself is summarized rather than dramatized with friction, and no alternative method is tested.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The icebound sanctum under aurora is established early and recurs as sensory texture (candles, hiss, glow). Yet it never constrains Akira's work or supplies a resource that alters outcome; the cold and light remain atmospheric rather than tactical. The setting does not pressure choices or participate in closure mechanics beyond backdrop.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"After forgiving herself for past mistakes" appears once at the 30% mark as backstory summary. It does not tighten present decisions or create a live clock; Akira's current task proceeds without friction tied to forgiveness. The timeframe is static context rather than a constraint that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Preserve the sound of forgotten names" is stated early and anchors Akira's goal throughout. It drives her methodical work and names the closure success. However, the motivation remains told—"determined," "drawn to"—without on-page friction between want and cost. No competing desire or fear complicates the preservation effort.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Snowmelt ardor" appears once in the final third as a tonal label. The overall mood is reverent and meditative, consistent but static; no modulation tracks pressure since pressure itself is absent. The phrase does not charge the closure image—it decorates rather than reweights. Tone remains one-note throughout.</comment>
