<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The gardener remains a label-only figure without internal contradiction or embodied emotion; we see "blithe" and "tender" asserted but never a micro-choice under pressure that forces a value trade-off. The quest to "discover the shape of intentions" is told motivation without on-page friction between want and cost. No secondary character applies pressure, and the climactic "understanding" arrives as summary epiphany rather than dramatized struggle with visible consequences.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test penalty applies: who/where/when anchor past ~120 words without functional disorientation (−0.4). The closure reads as告知 summary ("the gardener found a sense of purpose") rather than a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with on-page cost; the final image recycles prior diction without reweighting stakes. Because/therefore linkage is weak: the tapestry untangling and crystal hum do not narrow options or force a choice that forecloses a path. Drive lens remains ambiguous (Causal elements mixed with Accumulative claims) and closure cost is asserted, not felt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The cobalt silo and starlight are vivid but postcard-static; they do not constrain a choice or supply resources that alter outcome. Spatial choreography inside the silo is vague (no body-positioning or tool-handling that matters to escalation). The recurring "lavender sachets" and "velveteen gloom" are atmospheric labels without on-page pressure work, though the silo's presence in the opening and closing offers minimal lyric framing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("discover the shape of intentions") is signaled but never tested; no reversal or tightening forecloses an option with visible cost. The gardener's actions—entering, untangling, opening the case—proceed without resistance or trade-off. The "chess clock runs down" is mentioned once without time-pressure affecting tactics. Escalation is conceptual drift (echoes → tapestry → crystal → purpose) rather than narrowing options under the chosen lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Theme ("intentions behind echoes") is asserted in prompt language rather than emerging from particulars: "the gardener began to sense the shape of intentions" is diagnostic label-speak that replaces scene pressure. The final paragraph moralizes ("echoes were a reminder of the intentions that lay beyond") instead of offering a resonant image (−0.6). The antique case and tapestry are symbolic tokens without causal constraint, and no counter-reading or ambiguity resists tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Voice remains distant third without perceptual signature; diction is elevated and generic ("ethereal glow," "celestial map") rather than character-particular. Repetitive syntactic stems: "The gardener's [noun]" and "As [clause]" recur across multiple paragraphs without variation. No dialogue to assess. POV distance is stable but affectless, offering no internal texture under pressure; the prose reads as committee consensus rather than a singular focalization.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Template cadence ("The gardener's X," "As Y") across eight+ sentences (−0.6). Paraphrase loops: "uncharted echoes" restated in adjacent lines without added pressure (−0.2). Stock metaphor strings: "thrum of uncharted echoes," "velveteen gloom," "celestial map" (−0.4). Figurative density in every high-pressure sentence without payoff (−0.5). Synonym churn: "tenderly" appears four times without fresh context. High-band entry disallowed due to cumulative artifact presence (cap 8.7 not reached).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Core premise (cemetery gardener seeks mystical artifact in silo) closely matches template discovery-quest structures without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus (−1.0 Derivative Premise adjustment). The "mysterious object" and "hidden message" are generic placeholder stakes. The ending retreats to abstraction ("journey into the heart of the uncharted echoes") rather than committing to bold specificity, and the turning image (crystal hum, tapestry message) arrives late without prior groundwork.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Present throughout but passive observer; choices (enter silo, untangle threads, open case) do not create reversals or alter tactics under pressure—setup present, middle ornamental, closure participation via label only (cap 2.8).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mentioned in three beats (silo contents, opening, closing whisper) but swappable with any mystical container; no unique property shapes a choice—early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, swappability −0.7, ornamental closure −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Uncharted echoes" recur as thematic label without constraining on-page action; the gardener's quest is told, not tested—setup present, middle label-only, closure thematic summary (cap 2.8 +0.3 for early seed).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Tenderly organized" appears twice (graves, lavender sachets) without forcing a trade-off or altering tactics; label without pressure work—setup +0.5, ornamental use −0.8 (cap 2.8 minus friction).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Untangling occupies mid-story beat and leads to pattern discovery, shaping one turn; not irreplaceable (could be "decode," "trace") but causally active—setup +0.5, one beat +0.4, causal link +0.8, swappability −0.5, closure participation +0.6 (lyric reprise via "secrets…unraveled").</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Method signaled and enacted in the tapestry beat, driving the discovery; mechanics (thread-by-thread work) matter to pacing but do not reappear at closure—setup +0.6, one beat +0.4, causal pressure +0.6, closure absent −0.7.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Cobalt silo frames opening and closing, providing atmospheric container and returning at end to charge final image; does not constrain a choice but lyric reprise reweights the stake—setup +0.7, closure linkage +1.0, no mid-scene constraint −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>Chess clock mentioned once in passing ("had long since run down") without tracking time or tightening decisions; ornamental timestamp—setup absent −0.5, mid-scene mention +0.2, no cost −0.6 (cap 2.8 minus frictions).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Motivation stated early and repeated but never dramatized as conflicting want versus cost; the gardener pursues without obstacle or trade-off—setup +0.6, summary-only −0.8, no friction −0.6 (cap 3.4 for missing development).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Velveteen gloom" appears twice and tone remains consistently somber-mystical; does not modulate with pressure or charge the closure beat beyond label—setup +0.5, static mood −0.5, closure label-only +0.3, no modulation −0.4 (late first full use ~midpoint −0.3).</comment>
