<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Eira is given label-only traits ("jittery") and a vague purpose but makes no on-page choices that involve trade-offs or internal contradiction. The absent mentor is mentioned but never pressures a decision. Interiority consists of abstract summaries ("felt her senses come alive") and therapy-speak ("nurture," "coax wonder") without embodied emotion or conflicting impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>No decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing occurs on the page. Eira walks, encounters a woman, they lock eyes, then part—no options are foreclosed, no visible cost is paid, and the encounter leaves her exactly as she began ("sense of peace"). The inferred lens (Accumulative/Textural) requires a pattern break or cadence shift that reweights the stake with cost; the ending offers only recycled summary and abstract thematic echo. Orientation is present early (aurora-lit ridgeway, relic courier), so no Orientation Test penalty applies.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The aurora-lit ridgeway anchors location early and receives vivid sensory treatment. However, the setting never constrains a choice or charges the final image—it remains postcard backdrop. The pendant and the woman's appearance are described but do not alter Eira's tactics or the closure moment, keeping the score in the functional-but-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("retrieve relics," "coax wonder") is declared but never tested by on-page pressure. No reversal, tightening, or deepening occurs; Eira walks unimpeded, meets a stranger, and continues. The encounter with the moon-pale woman offers no cost, no alteration of options, and no agency—coincidence complicates nothing and resolves nothing because no conflict was dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Theme ("magic beneath the surface," "wonder," "memory to myth") is stated repeatedly in narration rather than emerging from concrete events. The final paragraph moralizes ("her task was not just to retrieve relics, but to keep the spark of wonder alive") instead of offering a resonant image. The pendant's symbolic recurrence is ornamental—it does not constrain choice or reweight prior material at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited distance is stable, and POV remains with Eira throughout. However, diction drifts into abstraction and prompt-like phrasing ("coax wonder from the routine," "germinate a sense of connection") that feels authorial rather than character-particular. The encounter with the woman involves no dialogue, so dialogue bullets do not apply. Perceptual signature is generic; Eira's noticing lacks idiosyncratic bias.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "sense of wonder and connection" / "wonder and excitement"; "the pendant's gentle hum" repeated across beats without new function; "magic that lay just beneath the surface" appears twice in near-identical form. Template cadence runs ("As she walked," "As the aurora danced," "As she crested," "As they parted," "As the aurora-lit ridgeway") stack five sentence-opening "As" clauses. Stock metaphors ("veil between the worlds," "fabric of reality," "threads of memory") and therapy-speak ("nurture," "coax," "germinate") dilute specificity. Applying patterned-artifact penalties and paraphrase-loop deductions in Q7: baseline −1.2 for loops and template cadence, plus −0.3 for stock metaphor strings, totaling approximately −1.5.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Core premise (mystical courier on liminal path) follows a widely used template without transformation. The encounter with the moon-pale woman is a stock epiphany moment with no fresh synthesis or specific lived detail. No bold structural choices or thematic risk-taking; the story retreats into abstraction and declares its theme rather than dramatizing a non-obvious stake.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Eira is present throughout but makes no choices that create turns. Her "jittery" trait is label-only; the pendant calms her offstage, and she walks without conflict. Setup present, but no development or payoff beats involve her agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The dragonfly-wing pendant appears in multiple beats: Eira clutches it, it vibrates to calm her and extend encounters, it vibrates more strongly near the woman, and its "gentle hum" is mentioned in the final lines. However, it never constrains a choice or is used tactically—it is a passive mood device. Setup and middle presence qualify it for ~5.0 range, but lack of causal pressure and closure participation (it is mentioned but does not shape the ending's meaning or cost) keep it mid-band. Swappability is moderate (any calming talisman could serve); no visible cost ties to it.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>The absent mentor is mentioned once in paragraph 3 as context for the pendant gift ("whose wisdom and guidance she still felt the absence of deeply") but does not shape stakes, tactics, or any on-page choice. No setup in the opening third, no development, no payoff. Ornamental reference only.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Extends brief encounters" is demonstrated when locals smile and nod as Eira passes, attributed to the pendant's hum. However, this occurs in summary without a scene beat showing a choice or cost. The attribute is told and illustrated but does not constrain or enable a dramatized action with stakes. Setup present (paragraph 5), but no development or closure payoff; swappable with any "charisma" effect.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Germinate" appears twice as a verb describing the pendant's effect on connection and community, but it is metaphorical narration, not a dramatized action. No turn traces to germination; it could be replaced with "foster" or "create" with no structural impact. Summary-only use.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Vibrating sympathetically" is the pendant's method, signaled early (paragraph 4) and repeated across beats (calms Eira, extends encounters, vibrates near the woman). The mechanics appear but do not shape a choice or tactic—Eira does not use the vibration to solve a problem or alter her approach. Setup and middle presence without causal pressure or closure charge place it in the functional-but-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The aurora-lit ridgeway is established in the opening line and provides vivid sensory detail throughout. It frames the walk and the encounter with the woman. However, it does not constrain Eira's choices or supply resources that affect outcome—it remains atmospheric backdrop. Setup, middle presence (the ridgeway "unwound before her"), and closure mention qualify it for low 5s, but lack of tactical pressure or cost connection prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.5</grade><comment>"Across the fade from memory to myth" appears in the opening and reappears once mid-story as poetic narration, but no timeline is tracked and no urgency or decision window is established. The phrase is ornamental atmosphere, not a functional timeframe that tightens tactics. No setup of stakes tied to time, no development, no payoff.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"To coax wonder from the routine" is Eira's stated task (paragraph 8), repeated in the final paragraphs. However, it is told rather than dramatized—we never see Eira choose between wonder and routine, or pay a cost to coax it. The motivation is label-only, not conflicted in scene. Setup present (first third), but no development beat shows friction or trade-off, and the ending merely reasserts the claim without demonstrating it.</comment>
