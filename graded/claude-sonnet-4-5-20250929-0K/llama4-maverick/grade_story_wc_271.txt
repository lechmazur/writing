<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Amira's interiority relies heavily on metaphor ("branding iron," "pearl of stillness") rather than embodied contradiction. Her agency at closure—standing, breathing, walking away with a "lighter heart"—reads as passive reception of solace rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. The photograph's physical transformation (crumpled → smooth) is asserted without dramatized action. Therapy-speak phrases like "somatic markers" and "anchor optimism in realism" appear as diagnostic labels rather than lived experience under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The piece establishes who/where/when early and maintains single POV throughout. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Amira finds peace and resolves to return, but the cost is abstract—no on-page forfeiture or tactical shift demonstrates what she relinquishes to gain stillness. The dominant lens is Accumulative/Textural (density of metaphor and sensory detail building toward a final cadence shift), yet the ending softens pressure rather than charging it. The photograph's smoothing and her "lighter heart" are told outcomes, not dramatized consequences.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The arboretum setting is vividly rendered with specific sensory detail (twisted trees, sea breeze, cliff edge, orange sunset glow) and filters through Amira's trauma-informed perception. The cliff edge and stillness of the trees contribute atmospheric pressure. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—Amira passively receives its balm. The setting charges the final image but does not shape tactics, keeping it shy of the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding solace after trauma—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure is atmospheric rather than escalating: Amira walks, observes, feels tension ease, and departs with resolve. No on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows options; the arboretum grants relief without requiring trade-off or renunciation. The "pearl of stillness" moment registers as an internal shift, but lacks visible cost or a decision that forecloses a live alternative. One meaningful deepening occurs (stillness achieved), satisfying minimum scope, but agency is passive.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—healing and finding hope amid trauma—emerges from image and atmosphere (twisted trees, smoothing photograph, setting sun) rather than statement. The "pearl of stillness" and "anchor optimism in realism" phrases border on prompt-echo and thesis declaration. The final image (disappearing into trees, lighter spirit) offers resonance but lacks a non-literal answer or conceptual repricing; it restates the premise rather than reweighting it. Subtext operates in the contrast between the tortured trees and Amira's internal calm, and the piece avoids overt moralizing in the final lines.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("pervaded," "lulling her into a state of deep relaxation") that distances the reader from embodied immediacy. Free-indirect style is clean, but phrases like "somatic markers" and "anchor optimism in realism" read as authorial intrusion or therapy-speak rather than Amira's natural idiom under stress. Perceptual signature is present (trauma lens on environment), and rhythmic control supports the contemplative tone, though some stock metaphors ("blue-gray silk," "beacon of light") flatten texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Clarity and grammar are clean, with varied sentence structure supporting contemplative rhythm. Overwriting appears in stacked metaphors ("branding iron," "withered fingers," "endless expanse of blue-gray silk," "beacon of light") that inflate texture without advancing pressure. Paraphrase loops recur: "stillness" is asserted multiple times across adjacent paragraphs without new detail, and the photograph's transformation is repeated conceptually. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed") cluster in high-density passages. Information density is moderate; several lines restate emotional state rather than compounding it.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—trauma survivor seeks solace in nature—is familiar, and the piece does not transform it through unexpected inflection or moral calculus. The arboretum and photograph are apt but replaceable symbols; "pearl of stillness" is a lyric phrase without structural necessity. Emotional progression (arrival anxious → departure peaceful) follows a predictable arc. The twist of the trees (tortured → gentle) and the photograph (crumpled → smooth) are thematic rather than causal reversals. Specificity in setting detail (seaside cliff, lighthouse keeper) adds texture but does not yield a fresh synthesis or risky structural choice.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Drone strike survivor is established early (setup gate) and frames her trauma lens throughout, but Amira makes no on-page decision that turns the plot. She observes, feels, and departs; the trauma informs perception but does not constrain a choice or create friction. Present in the ending as framing context but not causally active.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The photograph appears in three beats: crumpled in her pocket (early), "burning a hole" (mid), and smooth at the end (closure). Its transformation is asserted, not dramatized through handling or a choice it enables. The lyric reprise reweights the stake (trauma easing) but the object itself does not constrain action or supply a resource. Swappable with another keepsake.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The "pearl of stillness" is named explicitly midway and reappears at the ending as a metaphor for calm. It shapes the dominant stake (finding solace) and is tied to the closure image, but remains abstract—no on-page action demonstrates how it alters tactics or options. It functions as theme articulation rather than a concrete constraint or tool.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Quietly talented at finding solace" is a label applied twice without visible enactment. Amira does not demonstrate this talent through a choice or technique that others lack; the arboretum grants solace passively. No cost or constraint tied to the trait on the page.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Freeze" appears in one line ("freeze time itself") as metaphor for stillness. It does not drive a turn or define a tactic; easily swappable with "pause" or "slow." Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Somatic markers" is named once in a single sentence describing bodily cues (tension easing, breathing slowing). The method is told rather than shown and does not shape attempts or choices. If removed, the scene functions identically. Late introduction, summary-only use.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The arboretum on a seaside cliff is established early, shapes atmosphere across multiple beats, and appears decisively in the closure image. The trees' transformation (twisted → gentle) and the cliff edge as solace anchor contribute to the ending's charge. The setting does not supply a resource or constrain a choice, but its specificity and recurrence across beats elevate integration. Irreplaceable for tone and final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"After the last lighthouse keeper" appears once as historical context without tightening a decision or altering tactics. Time of day (sunset) tracks clearly but the timeframe element itself is inert. Ornamental backstory.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Anchor optimism in realism" is stated explicitly and frames the visit's purpose. The desire is present throughout and resolved in the ending ("heart begin to heal," resolve to carry stillness forward), but the conflict between optimism and realism is not dramatized through a choice with visible cost. Told motivation rather than enacted friction.</comment>
