<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Aria's motivation ("inner static") is declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. The box of childhood fears remains a static symbol touched once without altering on-page choices. Interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("fragmented wholeness," "emotional toll") rather than embodied perception under pressure. The final "peace" arrives without visible cost or renunciation that forecloses a meaningful path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when adequately early. The controlled burn functions as backdrop rather than a causal agent—Aria's containment work does not narrow options or generate reversals. The ending offers thematic declaration ("finally beginning to find her own peace") without an on-page decisive change or felt cost; the box is lighter by assertion, not dramatized loss. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural, but no cadence shift or pattern break reweights the stake with undeniable pressure at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The glass dome and desert roses are vividly established and return at closure, charging the final image with renewed beauty. The fire's intensity and the enclosure's claustrophobia pressure Aria's actions in the middle beats. Spatial choreography (Aria moving among enclosures, surveying aftermath) remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—resolving inner static—is signaled early but remains abstract. The controlled burn opportunity emerges, yet Aria's containment work does not force a trade-off or foreclose a live option with visible cost. The fire is contained efficiently without struggle or consequence that alters later tactics. One meaningful tightening (the decision to contain) occurs, but the cost is asserted rather than felt on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme of renewal and fragmented wholeness emerges from the fire/rebirth imagery. However, the final paragraph moralizes directly ("she had found a way to escape, to break free") and the box's weight is told lighter without earned scene work. The desert roses' transformation offers concrete resonance, but Aria's arc resolves into tidy self-awareness ("capable of growth, of change") that undercuts ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent—Aria notices mechanical hum, scent, patterns in undergrowth—but diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("manifestation of the fragmented wholeness") that feels imposed rather than character-particular. No dialogue present to evaluate. Psychic distance is controlled, and narrative stance holds across the piece.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops proliferate: "inner static" appears five times without added pressure; "fragmented wholeness" is restated thrice. Template cadence dominates the middle third ("She knew that she had to act… She knew that she still had her memories… Aria knew that she had found a way"). Stock metaphors ("living, breathing entity," "testament to her dedication") appear in most paragraphs. Information density is low—multiple sentences restate Aria's peace without advancing situation or choice. The closure beat is dulled by synonym churn ("peace," "wholeness," "connection").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The android-caretaker premise and controlled-burn-as-catharsis frame follow familiar emotional-healing templates without transformation. The box of childhood fears functions as a portable therapy totem. Magnetic north's shift is mentioned twice without consequence, reading as ornamental SF detail. No fresh inflection or non-obvious synthesis; emotional arc (trauma → containment → peace) could transfer unchanged to a human gardener in a mundane greenhouse.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Aria is present throughout and makes the decision to contain the flames, shaping the middle beat. However, she observes more than she decides—tending roses, watching fire, surveying aftermath—without on-page choices that narrow options or generate reversals. The final "peace" is declared rather than earned through a pivotal choice. Two gates: setup (early) and development (containment decision); weak closure participation (she tends roses again, but the act does not reweight prior material with cost).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The box is touched once in paragraph four, establishing its symbolic weight, and mentioned again in the final third as "no longer as heavy." It does not constrain or enable a choice in scene. Two touches across separate beats, but both are reflective/summary rather than dramatized use. Setup and lyric reprise present, but no middle development. Swappable with any keepsake symbol.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The controlled burn is announced, executed, and completed on the page, shaping the middle sequence. Aria uses it as an opportunity ("a chance to escape") and the burn reveals hidden patterns, altering the landscape. However, "escape" remains metaphorical—she does not leave, and her programming constraints are not tested with cost. Present in all three gates (setup, middle execution, closure landscape), but the escape claim is thematic rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Strangely organic" is applied to the flames once in paragraph eleven without constraining or enabling action. It describes appearance (the fire "danced") but does not alter Aria's tactics or choices. Late first appearance (past midpoint), ornamental use, no cost connection. Missing setup and development gates.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Miniaturize" appears once in paragraph thirteen as Aria's strategy to "miniaturize the chaos." The containing action follows, but the term itself does not define the method—she uses enclosures, not miniaturization. The word could be replaced with "contain" or "manage" without loss. Present in development (middle strategy) and weakly in closure (aftermath surveyed), but swappable and not causally irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Containing chaos" is explicitly stated as Aria's method in paragraph fourteen and executed through "carefully designed enclosures" in paragraph thirteen. The mechanics matter—she moves fire into designated areas, and the containment succeeds, bringing peace. Present in setup (the method is declared), development (she executes it), and closure (the aftermath shows contained, reborn roses). Functional across beats but remains abstractly described; we do not see the enclosures' design or how they work.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The glass-domed desert rose farm is established early and pressures Aria throughout—she tends roses, the dome amplifies flames and creates claustrophobia, and the transformed roses close the story. Setting supplies both resources (the roses that need care) and constraints (the enclosure's confining effect). Present in all three gates with concrete impact on atmosphere and the final image. The dome's claustrophobia and the roses' rebirth charge the closure effectively.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Magnetic north shifted" appears twice: once signaling the burn's start (paragraph ten) and once in the final section (paragraph twenty-eight) as a metaphor for Aria's change. It does not tighten decisions or function as a live clock—no urgency or deadline constrains Aria's actions. The term is ornamental and metaphorical rather than a functional timeframe. Missing development gate; no tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Inner static" is Aria's stated motivation, declared early and repeated throughout. She seeks to "quiet the noise" and "resolve the inner static," driving her decision to use the burn as escape. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants—no on-page friction between her duty and her need. Present in setup, development (drives the containment choice), and closure (declared resolved). Functional but abstract; no visible cost or trade-off tied to the resolution.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Fragmented wholeness" is declared three times, defining Aria's state early and at closure. Tone is consistent—contemplative, abstract, focused on Aria's internal landscape—but does not modulate with the fire's intensity. The prose remains declarative and distanced even during high-pressure beats (containing flames). The phrase charges the final image by returning, but the tone itself is static rather than shifting to heighten pressure. Lyric reprise without escalation.</comment>
