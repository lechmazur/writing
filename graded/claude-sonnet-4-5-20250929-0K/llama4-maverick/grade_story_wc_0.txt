<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Maria remains a passive observer throughout, with no contradictory impulses or decisions that foreclose paths. Her interiority consists almost entirely of abstract philosophical musings ("reality preprocesses itself") without embodied emotion or micro-choices under pressure. The final paragraph offers no earned change—she simply continues contemplating, with no visible cost or renunciation. Therapy-speak pervades ("kindled humility," "recognition that her own understanding was limited") without dramatic grounding.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>No closure unit is present: Maria begins examining dust, reflects on patterns, and ends still reflecting with no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing that creates a before/after with cost. The piece follows an accumulative lens but fails to deliver the required tightening or deepening—pressure never escalates, and the final image merely restates the opening meditation. Orientation is adequate (who/where/when established early), but the absence of on-page closure with felt cost is disqualifying. The lens (accumulative/textural) is held but never pays off with a cadence shift or pattern break that reweights the stake.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The storm-damaged greenhouse is described vividly in the opening and returns intermittently, but it never constrains a choice or charges the final image—Maria moves through it without the environment altering her options. Sensory detail is present ("scent of damp earth," "grimy panes") but remains decorative. The butterfly wing and dust function as thematic objects rather than spatial pressures. Micro-setting standard is not met; the environment supplies atmosphere but no tactical friction.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>No dominant stake is dramatized on the page. Maria's desire "to strip away the needless drama" and understand gradual change is declared but never tested—no decision point, no opposition, no cost. The piece lacks escalation: she examines dust, reflects, and continues examining with no meaningful tightening or reversal. Agency is absent; Maria observes and ponders without any choice that narrows options or forecloses a path. The lack of a credible on-page pressure point or turn prevents higher scoring under any lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme (gradual change, patterns underlying reality) is overtly stated rather than emerging from dramatized events: "reality preprocesses itself," "accumulated dust patterns," "intricate web of connections." The final paragraph moralizes ("the world...was always in a state of becoming") instead of offering a resonant, non-literal answer. Repeated abstractions ("subtle, incremental steps," "intricate beauty") replace scene-driven discovery. No earned insight arises from conflict; Maria's meditation at the end is indistinguishable from her meditation at the start.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Voice is consistent but generic, lacking a distinct perceptual signature—Maria's way of noticing reads like philosophical essay rather than character-particular thought. Diction drifts into academic register ("intricate patterns that governed the universe," "contours of reality") without grounding in immediate perception. Free indirect style is clean, but the narrator's texture is not specific to Maria as a neutron star researcher; her professional lens never shapes what she notices. Psychic distance is stable but the prose never modulates with pressure because no pressure exists.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "gradual change" recurs across seven paragraphs without added meaning; "intricate patterns/web/beauty/dance" cycle redundantly. Template cadence appears in multiple paragraphs starting with "Maria's thoughts/research/work." Lines often restate rather than advance: "decay was not just a destructive force, but also a creative one" immediately followed by "shaping the contours of reality through the accumulated dust patterns." Stock metaphors ("intricate dance between chaos and order") and therapy-speak ("kindled humility") dull the final third. Information density is low; many sentences do only one job (describe theme) without propelling story or character.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Core premise—scientist finds philosophical meaning in post-disaster debris—is a widely used template executed without transformation. The neutron star / butterfly wing pairing offers a fresh juxtaposition, but the piece never dramatizes the synthesis; it remains ornamental. Emotional arc is absent (Maria contemplates at start, contemplates at end), so the transformation test fails. The connection between neutron stars and greenhouse decay is asserted ("principles...were not so different") but never shown through specific action or choice. Risk-averse: no bold structural or perspectival move heightens stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Maria (neutron star researcher) is present throughout but makes no decisions that create turns. She observes, collects a sample, and reflects without her occupation shaping any on-page choice or constraint. The researcher credential is label-only; her professional lens never alters what she notices or does. No causal pressure tied to this character element.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Dust from butterfly wing appears in three beats (discovery, slide examination, final paragraph) but functions thematically rather than causally. It is described, collected, and invoked as metaphor without constraining a choice or being handled in ways that alter tactics. The reprise in the ending ("dust from the butterfly wing would remain") reweights meaning slightly but lacks cost. Swappable with any small natural object.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Gradual change is the stated theme, mentioned across multiple paragraphs ("subtle, incremental steps," "quiet, incremental steps," "gradual change that preprocesses reality"). It never shapes stakes or tactics on the page—Maria does not face a choice about embracing or resisting gradual versus sudden action. Label-only thematic echo without causal integration.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>"Preprocesses reality" appears as abstract concept ("reality preprocesses itself, unfolding in subtle, incremental steps") without constraining or enabling any on-page action. No visible tradeoff or cost tied to this attribute; it is philosophized about but never tested. Purely ornamental mention.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Decay is discussed across multiple paragraphs as both "destructive force" and "creative one," shaping Maria's reflections. It functions as setting backdrop (storm damage, decaying plant life) but does not create a major turn or choice point. Easily swappable with "transformation" or "entropy" without structural impact. Present in closure meditation but not causally active there.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>"Accumulated dust patterns" is invoked as the mechanism of gradual change in the first third and final paragraph but never shown in action. Maria observes dust settling but the patterns do not shape her attempts or constrain her method. Summary-only use; the mechanics are asserted ("shaping the universe through the accumulated dust patterns") without being demonstrated.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Storm-damaged greenhouse frames the entire story and is described with specificity ("debris-strewn floor," "grimy panes"). It provides atmosphere and context but does not pressure Maria's choices—she moves through it without the damage altering her options or supplying resources that affect outcome. Present in setup and closure mention but not causally active in middle beats. One key turn (discovery of butterfly wing) occurs here, lifting score to mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"After the flood" anchors the timeframe in the opening line and is referenced once more ("the storm that had damaged the greenhouse had brought...a deluge of sediment"). Time does not tighten decisions or create urgency; Maria's examination is contemplative and untimed. The flood is backdrop, not a live constraint shaping tactics. Functional but replaceable with any past disaster.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"To strip away the needless drama" appears once in the middle as Maria's stated desire but is never dramatized through choices or tested by friction. No scene shows her resisting drama or paying a cost for simplicity. Told-only motivation without on-page conflict or tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Kindled humility" is named once and echoed in the final paragraph's "recognition that her own understanding was limited." Tone is contemplative and reverent throughout, modulating little because pressure never rises. The humility is asserted rather than earned through struggle or mistake. Coherent but static, with a slight charge in the final image ("gentle presence...seemed to calm") that lifts it above pure label-only use.</comment>
