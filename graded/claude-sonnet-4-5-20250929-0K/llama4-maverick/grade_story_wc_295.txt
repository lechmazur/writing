<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lyra's motivation to decode inscriptions is clear, but her interior life relies heavily on summary and abstraction ("sense of purpose," "heart swelled") rather than embodied contradiction. The lucid dream chronicler role is told rather than dramatized—we never see her guide a client or witness the process that defines her gift. Micro-choices under pressure are absent; she works steadily without meaningful conflict or cost until the resolution arrives by contemplation alone. The character reads as a vehicle for theme rather than a flawed individual making difficult trades.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>No on-page closure with legible cost. Lyra decodes inscriptions and feels renewed, but no decision, renunciation, or stance crystallization occurs; the "weight lifting" and "midnight solace" are asserted emotional states, not dramatized changes that foreclose options. The piece is a single continuous scene of reflection without a causal turn or reversal—she sits, thinks, works, and feels better. The Orientation Test is satisfied (who/where/when anchored early), but the ending offers summary of emotional resolution rather than a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with visible cost. Under any inferred lens (most likely Accumulative/Textural given the lyric cadence), the final image does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The celestial mapping observatory is anchored early and sensory detail (starlight through the dome, scent of old books, hum of machinery) establishes atmosphere. The daylily-pressed telegram and variable stars are recurring objects, but neither constrains a choice or charges the closure—they function as ornamental motifs. Spatial choreography is minimal but coherent; the setting remains static description rather than shaping tactics or outcome. The observatory's archives are mentioned but never used in a way that alters Lyra's path.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—decoding the temple inscriptions—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or cost. Lyra works steadily; no reversal, tightening, or deepening occurs. The "breakthrough" hinted by the telegram is never dramatized, and the inscriptions "begin to reveal their secrets" without struggle, trade-off, or visible price. Agency is passive observation; coincidence (the telegram, the timing of dawn, the stars "guiding") complicate atmosphere but do not resolve conflict because no conflict materializes on the page. Pressure never escalates; the arc is contemplative summary rather than escalation with cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The theme of shared burdens emerges through direct statement ("when individuals shared their struggles, the weight became more manageable") rather than dramatic particulars. The temple inscriptions speak "of an ancient people who had understood the value of shared burdens," repeating the theme claim without embodying it in Lyra's present choices. The final lines ("burdens she had once carried alone now seemed more manageable, shared as they were with the stars above and the inscriptions below") offer metaphorical assertion, not a resonant image that reweights prior material. The piece gestures toward theme but does not earn insight through specific experience or sacrifice on the page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present but generic (Lyra notices books, stars, machinery) without character-specific bias. Diction occasionally drifts toward elevated abstraction ("alleviating the burdens of the present," "collective efforts had brought about a golden age") that feels authorial rather than Lyra's lived idiom. Psychic distance is consistent but lacks modulation under pressure—no syntactic compression or rhythm shift during peak moments because no peak moments occur. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not applicable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "the burdens that once seemed insurmountable become manageable" / "the weight of her task slowly lifting" / "burdens she had once carried alone now seemed more manageable" cycle the same concept across paragraphs. Template cadence runs: "She had witnessed... she would witness... she would help" and "the stars shone bright... the stars still shone bright... the stars shone bright" repeat identical stems without pressure. Filter verbs and summary constructions ("she believed," "she knew," "she felt") dull immediacy. Figurative language ("beacon of hope," "holding out a beacon") is stock. The closure beat itself is summary ("the world seemed a little brighter") rather than a concrete image, and the repeated "shared burdens" phrasing touches it directly. Apply −1.2 for loops and template cadence plus −0.5 for artifacts in the final third; disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8 per the Text-Artifact rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The lucid dream chronicler decoding ancient inscriptions in a star observatory is a competent synthesis of fantasy elements, but the execution leans on familiar tropes (solitary scholar, midnight epiphany, stars as metaphor for guidance) without fresh inflection. The "shared burdens" theme is stated rather than transformed through specific, grounded choices. The daylily-pressed telegram and variable stars are ornamental rather than irreplaceable—removing them would not break the logic. No bold risk or non-obvious turn occurs; the arc is contemplative summary that could apply to many settings and professions with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>The lucid dream chronicler role is mentioned early and appears in multiple beats, but Lyra never guides a client on the page or uses the variable stars as a celestial map in a dramatized scene. The trait shapes her backstory and worldview but does not constrain a present choice or alter tactics. Present but ornamental; swappable with "scholar" or "researcher" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The daylily-pressed telegram appears twice (once as description, once as she unfolds it) and is mentioned in the final third as "glow[ing] with a new significance," but it does not constrain a choice or enable a turn. The "breakthrough" it hints at is never paid off on the page. Setup and closure mention present, but middle development and causal pressure are absent. Swappable with any token of encouragement.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Shared burdens is signaled early through the inscriptions Lyra studies and recurs thematically across beats ("when individuals shared their struggles," "collective efforts," "shared as they were with the stars"). The concept frames her research and appears in the closure image, but it does not shape a live on-page choice or impose cost. Thematic echo without causal pressure; the element is present in all three gates (setup, development, payoff) but functions as abstract commentary rather than stake-altering force. Eligible for mid-band but capped by lack of specificity and trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Heals with words" is mentioned once in summary ("she heals with words, offering solace") but never dramatized. We do not witness Lyra guiding a client, speaking healing words, or paying a cost for this gift. Label-only mention without on-page action or constraint. Missing setup in action, middle development, and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Witness" appears repeatedly (she "witnessed" power of shared burdens, "witness the deepest fears") but as summary of past work, not a present action that creates a turn. The inscriptions "reveal their secrets" to her observation, but this is passive reception rather than a choice-altering act. Present across beats but does not drive pressure or cost; swappable with "study" or "interpret."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Variable stars are mentioned early as a celestial map Lyra uses "to navigate the depths of their minds" and the archives hold information on their patterns, but the method is never enacted on the page. The stars "twinkle in rhythm with her thoughts" (ornamental) and appear in the closing lines, but they do not constrain an attempt or alter outcome. Setup and closure mention present; middle causal use absent. Summary-only; the mechanics never matter.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The celestial mapping observatory is anchored early (transparent dome, lamps, archives) and provides sensory atmosphere throughout. The archives are mentioned as a resource Lyra has studied, contributing to her knowledge base, and the setting frames the solitary, contemplative mood. However, the observatory does not pressure a choice or alter tactics—Lyra could decode inscriptions in any quiet study. Setup strong, development present (archives inform her work), closure participation weak (setting is backdrop, not active force). Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"When understanding dawns" appears as an abstract timeframe in Lyra's reflection and the piece moves from night to dawn, but no live clock tightens decisions. The passage of night is described ("as the night wore on," "first light of dawn," "as the sun rose") but does not constrain choices or create urgency. Time is backdrop; swappable with any span of reflection. Missing middle pressure and closure participation as a force.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Decoding the temple inscriptions is Lyra's explicit goal, signaled early ("Her current obsession was to decode the inscriptions") and pursued across beats as she studies and achieves breakthrough. The motivation drives the scene's action and appears in the closure ("by decoding the inscriptions, she was... holding out a beacon of hope"). However, the desire is never conflicted or tested by competing wants or cost—she works steadily and succeeds. Setup, development (sustained effort), and payoff (achievement) are present, but friction and trade-off are absent. Eligible for mid-band; lack of visible cost and opposition caps higher.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Midnight solace" is named explicitly and the tone of quiet, contemplative peace in darkness pervades the piece from "stillness" and "soft glow" through "midnight air" to the final "the world seemed a little brighter." The tone is coherent and modulates slightly as Lyra moves from task focus to emotional renewal, and it charges the final image of dawn and connection. However, the tone is static rather than tested by pressure—no tonal rupture or ironic tension occurs. Setup (early atmosphere), development (sustained mood), and payoff (closure resonance) are present. Functional integration with lyric reprise; lack of dynamic shift under pressure prevents higher score.</comment>
