<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The seed saver's "furiously tranquil" demeanor is asserted rather than embodied through contradictory impulses in action. Her motivations remain abstract—she "felt an overwhelming sense of purpose" and "knew" repeatedly without on-page friction between want and cost. The visions sequence lists emotional states ("threatened to overwhelm her") but her reactions are summarized rather than dramatized through micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The final "wild serenity" and legend status feel declared rather than earned through visible transformation with cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test: Who and where anchor by the opening, but "after winter's chill dissipated" and "the egg...had hatched" place time vaguely in backstory; no visible temporal constraint tightens present action (−0.4). Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural by midpoint (atrium thaw, vortex visions, cycle imagery), but closure drifts into summary exposition ("Years would pass...she would become a legend") rather than a charged final image that reweights prior material with cost on the page. The "act of passing it down" realization and entropy claim are told, not dramatized. Cost at closure is conceptual but not made undeniable through image or forfeited action; the piece ends in drift rather than reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The icebound atrium and starlight anchor setting early with vivid sensory detail (glass panes, melting frost, vibrating air). The cap's "intricate patterns" and the hum during the vortex sequence offer textural specificity. However, the environment does not constrain a choice—space and objects remain postcard backdrops rather than resources or obstacles that alter tactics. The final walk "into the unknown" and starlight "canopy" reprise earlier imagery but remain decorative rather than pressure-bearing at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—unlocking the vortex inheritance—is signaled early. The cap-blowing triggers visions, a meaningful tightening, but the protagonist remains passive observer throughout the sequence: "she saw," "she felt," "she realized." No on-page reversal forces a trade-off or narrows options; the decision to "spend the rest of her days tending to the vortex" is declared intent without visible cost or forfeited path at closure. The visions of past paradise and future wasteland raise conceptual stakes but never test the seed saver's commitment through a difficult choice on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Theme of cyclical balance and guardianship emerges from the egg-hatching, vortex, and seed-saving imagery. The realization that "the key...lay...in the act of passing it down" offers a non-literal answer to inheritance, and "decreasing entropy" gestures at maintaining harmony. However, the final paragraphs moralize overtly: "it was not the destination...but the journey itself" and "one seed at a time" veer into platitude. The prompt language ("vortex inheritance," "texture of borrowed time") echoes undigested in the text, reducing organic emergence. Closure lacks a resonant image that reweights prior particulars without stating theme.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present in the seed saver's attention to plants, frost, cap texture. Diction elevates ("furiously tranquil," "verdant paradise," "kaleidoscope") consistently, establishing a lyric register. However, interior certainty exceeds dramatized knowledge: "she knew" appears eight times, asserting insight the visions do not earn on the page. Peak moments lean on filter verbs and abstraction ("felt the familiar tug," "strange sense of clarity") rather than specific embodied perception. The final legend passage shifts to distant narratorial summary, breaking intimate focalization without structural justification.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "she knew that the time had come" / "she knew that she was now a part"; "feeling the weight...settle" / "feeling a deep sense...wash over"; "the seed saver stood firm" / "the seed saver smiled." Template cadence: eleven sentences open with "The seed saver [verb]" or "She [verb]," flattening rhythm. Stock metaphors: "canopy of light," "swirling around her like a vortex" (the vortex is literal, making the simile redundant). Filter-verb stacks cluster in the visions sequence ("she saw...she saw...she felt...she realized") dulling immediacy. Cumulative line-level debt (−1.2 for loops, template stems, filter stacks) and artifacts in final third disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The heirloom seed saver and ecological guardianship premise draw from familiar cli-fi and solarpunk templates without fresh synthesis. "Vortex inheritance" and "texture of borrowed time" remain abstraction labels rather than dramatized world rules with specific trade-offs. The "furiously tranquil" oxymoron and starlit atrium offer surface texture, but the plot—guardian unlocks mystical knowledge, sees visions, accepts duty—follows a median chosen-one arc. Transformation test fails: swap "seed saver" for "archivist" or "mapmaker" and arc holds unchanged. No bold risk or non-obvious moral calculus elevates the execution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>The heirloom seed saver is the sole on-page character and POV. She is named in the opening third and her occupation frames the vortex search. However, her key "choices"—raising the cap, blowing across it, deciding to tend the vortex—are passive or summarized without on-page alternatives that narrow options. The visions happen *to* her; she does not make a contested decision that alters tactics or forecloses a path with visible cost. Present at setup, middle (visions), and ending (legend intent), satisfying two gates, but observation without decision keeps the score low.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The oak acorn cap appears early (end of first paragraph), is handled in the blowing beat (middle), and remains "clutched in her hand" at closure, satisfying all three gates. It triggers the vortex hum and is described with textural specificity ("intricate patterns"). However, the cap's unique properties—why an acorn cap versus another object—are not dramatized; any small ritual object could substitute with minor edits. It does not constrain a choice or impose cost; it functions as a key that works once without complication. Present across beats and ending but lacks causal irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The vortex inheritance is named early, frames the search, and the reopening action occupies the middle third. The visions and "act of passing it down" realization tie to it at closure. All three gates met. However, the concept remains abstract: what *is* the inheritance? The text offers metaphor (cycle, balance, borrowed time) but no on-page mechanics or cost that alter tactics. Swappable with "ancient knowledge" or "sacred duty" without structural change. Thematic echo rather than a rule that shapes on-page choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Furiously tranquil" is declared in the opening and reprised as "wild serenity" at closure. Setup and payoff gates met. However, the trait is label-only; no on-page action shows the protagonist acting with fury *and* tranquility simultaneously in a way that constrains or enables a choice with cost. The visions sequence describes her as unshaken ("stood firm"), but this reads as simple composure, not a productive contradiction. Ornamental descriptor without dramatized tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Reopen" is signaled early ("the time had come to reopen the vortex") and dramatized in the cap-blowing beat that triggers the vortex hum and visions. Present at setup and development. The ending references "tending to the vortex" as ongoing duty, linking it forward. However, the action itself is uncomplicated—she blows, it works—without resistance, cost, or a failed attempt that raises stakes. Any ritual gesture (touch, speak, pour) could substitute with minor edits. Functional but not uniquely load-bearing at closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>1.2</grade><comment>"By decreasing entropy" appears once in the back third as an assertion: "By decreasing entropy, she could maintain the delicate harmony." No setup in the first third, no middle demonstration of the method's mechanics or cost. The phrase is told rather than shown through action that shapes tactics. It could be cut with zero impact on plot or closure. Ornamental concept claim without integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The icebound atrium under starlight is anchored in the opening sentence and reprised at closure ("starlight twinkled above"). Thawing plants and glass panes provide sensory detail in the middle. All three gates met. However, the setting does not constrain or enable a choice—she could perform the ritual anywhere. The atrium functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than a resource or obstacle that alters tactics. Vivid description without causal pressure keeps the score mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"After the egg hatches" is referenced once in the back half: "The egg...had hatched, marking the beginning of a new era." No setup anchor in the opening third, no ticking clock in the middle that tightens decisions. The timeframe is retrospective summary rather than a present constraint. Mentioned at closure thematically but does not shape on-page tactics or escalation. Ornamental time marker without integration.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"To discover the texture of borrowed time" appears once near the end: "she would spend the rest of her days...to discover the texture of borrowed time." No setup signal, no middle beat where this desire conflicts with another want or cost. The motivation is declared intent rather than dramatized friction. The earlier "overwhelming sense of purpose" is generic and does not specify this particular texture-discovery goal. Told-only, late appearance, no conflicted choice tied to it.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Wild serenity" is declared at closure, reprising the opening's "furiously tranquil." The tone aims for lyric calm layered with intensity. Early sensory detail (frost, hum, vibrations) and the visions sequence maintain coherent register. However, the final drift into distant summary ("Years would pass...she would become a legend") flattens the charge rather than crystallizing it in a final image. Tone is present and consistent but does not modulate with escalation or charge the ending decisively. Static mood across the arc keeps the score mid-band.</comment>
