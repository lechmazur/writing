<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Erebus remains largely opaque: his choices are described in reverent generalities ("precision that bordered on reverence," "deep understanding") rather than embodied contradictions or visible struggle. The protagonist functions as a vessel for the concept rather than a person under pressure; we never see him weigh competing goods or make a choice that forecloses a path with felt cost. The "wilts near dishonesty" trait appears as a label without dramatized consequence. Interiority consists of thematic declarations ("he knew that to reclaim the light") rather than character-specific perception or micro-choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who and where by the opening, meeting the test. The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: atmosphere and motif density build toward the moment the box plays. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration—the silent box now sings, balance is restored—but the cost is abstract ("task complete") rather than visible on the page. The covenant of rust and light/darkness motifs recur but never narrow Erebus's options or force a trade-off; the final turn feels declared rather than earned through prior causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The resonance chamber is vividly rendered with luminescent orbs, labyrinthine passages, and a palpable aura of "tinkersong wonder." Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through the craft. The golden chip glows brighter as a cue tied to the protagonist's work, and the chamber "vibrates in approval" at closure, charging the final image. However, the setting remains atmospheric backdrop; it does not constrain a key choice or alter tactics in a concrete way, capping the score below the 9-band gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—repair a music box that never played—is signaled early but remains abstract: what is at risk if Erebus fails is never made concrete. The "moment of truth" and "balance between sound and silence" are asserted rather than tested through a visible narrowing of options or a forced trade-off. Under the accumulative lens, density increases toward the box's song, but no on-page cost or reversal alters Erebus's approach or forecloses a path; the resolution feels inevitable rather than earned by protagonist agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme—balance between light and darkness, mending what isn't torn—emerges through motifs (the golden chip, rust, midnight's stolen light) and the music box's transformation. The final image of the box singing "with a voice both ancient and eternal" offers a resonant, non-literal answer. However, the piece edges toward meta-commentary ("his craft had, once again, tethered a piece of the world's essence") and thematic labeling in place of embodied pressure. The particulars (luminescent orbs, covenant of rust) feel more ornamental than causally integrated into character choice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited, anchored to Erebus throughout. Diction is consistent and elevated, fitting the mystical register ("whispers of a thousand midnights," "tether the very essence of sound"). However, perceptual signature is generic rather than character-specific; Erebus notices in the same reverent, distanced way across all beats. Under peak pressure ("the moment of truth was near"), syntax and rhythm do not shift to reflect urgency. No dialogue appears; the narration occasionally slips into abstraction ("the fabric of reality was at its thinnest") that distances rather than sharpens immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose is clean, grammatically sound, and rhythmically controlled. Sentence openings vary, and paragraph structure supports the accumulative build. However, scaffold and paraphrase loops appear: "the resonance chamber seemed to vibrate in approval, its whispers weaving into a soft, approving murmur" restates "vibrate in approval" and "approving" within one line. Figurative density is high throughout without escalation at peak beats ("a tear in the fabric of silence," "tether the very essence of sound"), creating a steady elevated register that flattens propulsion. Information density is moderate; several lines rephrase stakes ("mend what wasn't torn," "restore the essence") without advancing causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The premise—a repairman who mends what isn't torn using a philosopher's stone chip—offers a fresh synthesis of alchemy and craft mysticism. The covenant of rust and the "wilts near dishonesty" attribute add specificity. However, execution leans on familiar beats: the lone artisan in a mystical workshop, a sacred object that glows at closure, balance restored without visible cost. The emotional arc (reverence → completion → approval) follows a median template without risk or surprise. Transformation test: swap Erebus for another mystic artisan and the plot holds unchanged, signaling insufficient particularization.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Erebus is present throughout and his hands perform the repair, but his choices are described rather than dramatized. No moment shows him selecting one approach over another or weighing a cost; the work proceeds inevitably. Present in closure (he steps back, task complete) but without a decision that alters tactics. Two gates (setup, payoff); missing middle development and causal pressure. Late arrivals and swappability lower the score further.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The chip appears early ("among the treasures") and recurs across beats: it glows in resonance with effort, guides his hands, glows brighter at the climax, then dims after closure. However, its function is atmospheric (it "seemed to glow," "allowed him to hear") rather than mechanically constraining; Erebus never uses or loses it in a way that narrows options. Three gates met; causal pressure weak; closure linkage present but not transformative.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The covenant of rust is mentioned once in exposition ("a mystical bond between the corroded and the pristine") and never returns or shapes a choice. It frames theme but does not alter tactics, constrain action, or reappear at closure. Setup only; no development or payoff. Swappable with any thematic label; ornamental use.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Wilts near dishonesty" is introduced mid-story as a static trait ("a peculiar sensitivity that made him a truth-seeker") but never tested or dramatized. No moment shows materials wilting, no cost tied to honesty or deceit, no constraint on action. Label-only mention; no setup, development, or payoff in scene. Ornamental and easily cut.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Tether" appears twice: as metaphor ("tether the very essence of sound") and in the final paragraph ("tethered a piece of the world's essence back into place"). It frames the repair action but is not a distinct physical act that could be dramatized or swapped; the actual mechanics involve turning screws and aligning mechanisms. Present in closure image but as synonym for "restore." Two gates (setup, payoff); causal work minimal; swappable with "bind," "anchor," "restore."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Mending what isn't torn" is seeded early ("could coax music from the most lifeless of boxes"), developed as method ("repair a music box that had never played, its mechanism intact but its song lost"), and returns at closure ("mended what wasn't torn"). Shapes the task's paradox and the thematic answer. However, the method's mechanics are vague; we never see how mending differs from ordinary repair. Three gates; specificity moderate; causal pressure weak but thematic charge present.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The resonance chamber is introduced in the opening line, described across beats ("luminescent orbs," "labyrinthine passages"), and reappears at closure ("the chamber seemed to vibrate in approval"). It provides atmosphere and charges the final image. However, it does not constrain Erebus's choices or alter his approach; the work could occur in any mystical workshop. Three gates; closure linkage present; causal pressure absent; swappability moderate.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"In the balance" appears as metaphor ("a juncture where the balance... hung in the balance") but not as a live clock or tracked timeframe. The phrase describes stakes (balance between light and dark) rather than temporal pressure. No setup of urgency, no ticking deadline, no tactics altered by time scarcity. Payoff only (closure restores balance); ornamental use of the phrase; swappable with "at stake."</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The motivation is declared early ("reclaim the light stolen by midnight") and returns at closure ("reclaimed a fragment of the light"). It frames Erebus's larger purpose. However, it is never dramatized as a conflicted desire with friction or cost; the work proceeds smoothly without setback or doubt. Two gates (setup, payoff); missing middle friction where the desire is tested; told rather than shown through choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Tinkersong wonder" is introduced early ("an almost palpable aura of tinkersong wonder, a symphony of clinking tools and soft murmurs") and sustained through descriptors (luminescent, ethereal, crystalline note). The tone remains coherent and modulates slightly at closure (the pure note, the chamber's approval). However, the tone is static—no shift under pressure, no breach that later resolves—and the final image repeats the opening mood without transformation. Three gates; coherence strong; modulation weak; charges the ending but does not evolve.</comment>
