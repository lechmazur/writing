<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elian's interiority consists almost entirely of abstract philosophical declarations ("vibrations of intent," "purifies intentions," "screaming tenderness") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The central "motivation" to prove whispers travel farther is asserted repeatedly but never tested by an on-page dilemma with visible cost. Emotional states are labeled ("determination," "peace and contentment") rather than shown through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The vial cork discovery and garden-tending are narrated as complete summary; no choice or renunciation forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: the lighthouse keeper role is named early, but "assistant" appears only in line one with no spatial anchor until "small garden" emerges later; this mild delay does not severely harm closure, so no orientation cap is applied. The piece lacks a legible closure unit: Elian begins fascinated by the vial cork, beckons to the universe mid-story, feels energy wash over him, then climbs stairs "content to vibrate in tune"—no decision, renunciation, or reweighted image with visible cost occurs on the page. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (garden scent, vibrations, repeated "screaming tenderness"), but no density increase or cadence shift reweights the stake at the end; the final paragraph restates the opening premise without tightening or cost. Causality is intact but inert.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The cobalt lighthouse and garden are described vividly with scent anchors ("night-blooming flowers," "fresh earth") and the setting recurs in the opening and closing images. However, neither environment constrains a choice or alters tactics: Elian tends plants off-page, stands in the garden during his metaphysical ritual, then climbs stairs—no spatial pressure or resource limit shapes the outcome. Micro-setting (the vial cork on the workbench, the winding stairs) is present but ornamental. The piece satisfies basic anchoring and sensory economy but does not reach the 9+ gate (environment must constrain choice or charge closure).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to prove that whispers travel farther than shouts"—is declared mid-story but never tested by an on-page reversal, obstacle, or trade-off. Elian beckons to the universe, feels energy build, then reports peace and purpose with no live option foreclosed or cost paid. No antagonist, no failure, no choice that narrows tactics. The beckoning action and garden scent are presented as successful without friction, rendering escalation non-existent under any lens. Agency is absent; the protagonist observes his own uncontested ritual.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The theme of intention, purity, and gentle persistence emerges from recurring images (vial cork, garden scent, lighthouse), but the final paragraph ("screaming tenderness," "hidden harmonies") restates the premise in near-identical language without reweighting prior material or offering a non-literal answer. Elian's "truth that would stay with him forever" is asserted, not earned through a specific loss or insight. The lighthouse as symbol is treated overtly ("beacon of hope") rather than allowed to resonate. Reflection dominates (~40% of the text) but does not anchor in present micro-choices that alter stance, triggering mild thematic flattening.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (scent focus, metaphysical diction) but the voice converges on a single elevated register throughout ("intoxicating aroma," "palpable energy," "indelible mark") with no modulation under pressure. Diction remains abstract and uniform; the narrator's way of noticing does not shift between tending the garden, performing the ritual, or climbing stairs. Filter verbs ("felt," "knew," "was convinced") appear frequently but do not harm clarity. No dialogue. The prose reads as committee voice—earnest but not character-particular.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "vibrations of intent" recurs six times with minimal variation; "screaming tenderness" appears twice in identical phrasing; "gentle, insistent voice" is repeated verbatim. Template cadence dominates the middle third: "Elian felt…," "Elian stood…," "Elian knew…" across five consecutive beats. Stock metaphors ("vortex," "beacon of hope," "fabric of reality") cluster in the ritual sequence without fresh specificity. These artifacts dull the closure image ("world was full of hidden harmonies") and trigger cumulative penalties: paraphrase loops −0.4, template cadence −0.5, stock strings −0.4, touching closure adds −0.3 for total −1.6 baseline; the spread disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band entries at 8.8 per the artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The core premise—lighthouse keeper performs metaphysical ritual to prove the power of whispers—echoes familiar new-age and Romantic tropes without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious stakes. The vial cork's "purifying" property is asserted without causal demonstration; the garden scent as ritual method feels decorative. No bold risk heightens pressure; the safe, reflective mode avoids friction. The lighthouse and dawn are stock anchors; "screaming tenderness" as oxymoron is the piece's freshest note but remains under-exploited. Derivative Premise Guardrail applies: core template (solitary mystic performs ritual, feels cosmic connection) is widely used and not transformed by specific world logic or moral calculus, triggering −0.8 adjustment within Q8.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Elian is present throughout but makes no key decision with visible cost. He tends the garden off-page, finds the vial cork in summary, performs the beckoning ritual without obstacle, and climbs stairs content—all narrated actions without foregrounded choice or trade-off. Setup gate met (named early); development and closure gates missed (no middle choice, no ending decision). Swappable with "hermit" or "monk" with minor edits. Late limiter: ornamental protagonist role −0.8; no causal pressure −0.7; no closure linkage −0.6. Start 3.0, net 2.4.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The vial cork appears in three beats: discovered in storage (summary), sits on workbench glowing, carried in pocket at end. Setup gate met; middle gate weak (no handling or tactical use); closure gate met (present in final image but not causally active). The "purifies intentions" property is asserted without on-page demonstration or cost. Two-beat involvement +0.4, early signal +0.3, closure cameo (non-causal) +0.2, but ornamental use −0.6, swappability (any mystical token) −0.5, summary discovery −0.4. Start 3.0, net 4.1, cap 4.6 for missing middle development gate.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Vibrations of intent are named six times but operate only as theme; no on-page beat shows them narrowing options or enabling a tactic with visible cost. Setup gate met (signaled by midpoint); development and closure gates missed (no middle choice shaped by the concept, final image merely restates "vibrate in tune"). Label-only trait −0.8, no causal pressure −0.7, ornamental −0.5. Start 3.0, net 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Purifies intentions" is asserted once in exposition ("the vial cork, he was convinced, purifies intentions") but never demonstrated on the page through action, trade-off, or visible effect. Missing all three gates: not shown in setup action, no middle constraint, no closure participation. Label-only −0.8, no causal work −0.7, swappable −0.4. Start 3.0, net 2.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Beckoning appears once in a single ritual beat: "he raised his hands, beckoning to the universe." Setup gate met (signaled before midpoint); development gate weak (the action itself is the only beat); closure gate missed (ending restates state, does not reprise the beckoning). One-beat involvement +0.4, but swappable with "meditate" or "invoke" −0.6, no closure linkage −0.6, summary-only (outcome narrated, not dramatized in tension) −0.4. Start 3.0, net 4.8, cap 4.6 for missing closure gate applies → final 4.6, round 4.8 down per band guidance when one strong positive (early signal) slightly lifts.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"By the scent of the garden at night" is named twice: once in the beckoning beat as method, once in the opening as atmospheric setup. Setup gate met; development gate weak (scent mentioned but does not shape tactical attempt); closure gate missed (final image does not reprise scent as active means). Two mentions +0.4, early seed +0.3, but ornamental (no mechanics shown) −0.7, swappable with "moonlight" −0.5. Start 3.0, net 3.6, cap 4.6 for missing closure gate.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Cobalt lighthouse at dawn anchors the opening line and closing image, framing the piece with purposeful reprise. Setup gate met; development gate weak (lighthouse present but does not constrain middle action); closure gate met (final image: "light of the cobalt lighthouse danced across the waves"). Lyric early–final reprise +0.8, closure linkage (non-causal but charged) +0.5, but no middle constraint −0.4, postcard description (no tactical pressure) −0.6. Start 3.0, net 5.3, round 5.2 per band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>"After the heat wave breaks" appears in the opening paragraph only; the cool breeze is mentioned once with no later reference or tactical consequence. Setup gate met; development and closure gates missed. Single mention, no tightening of decisions, no time pressure on choices. Early signal +0.3, but ornamental −0.7, no middle or closure participation −1.0. Start 3.0, net 2.3, cap 2.8 for missing closure gate.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The motivation "to prove that whispers travel farther than shouts" is declared once mid-story in exposition and restated thematically at the end without on-page friction, obstacle, or choice testing the desire. Setup gate met (signaled by midpoint); development and closure gates weak (no conflicted choice, no cost paid). Early signal +0.5, closure thematic echo +0.3, but told-only (never dramatized in choice) −0.8, no friction or trade-off −0.7. Start 3.0, net 4.7, cap 4.6 for missing middle and closure dramatization → round 4.7 per allowance for thematic linkage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Screaming tenderness" appears twice: once mid-story ("screaming tenderness that threatened to overwhelm him") and once at the end ("sense of screaming tenderness"). The oxymoron is the piece's freshest note and recurs with reweighted emphasis. Setup gate met; development gate weak (tone label, not modulation); closure gate met (final beat reprises the phrase). Two appearances +0.4, closure linkage +0.5, early signal +0.4, but static mood (no tonal arc or pressure shift) −0.6, label-only (not embodied in rhythm or diction shift) −0.5. Start 3.0, net 4.3.</comment>
