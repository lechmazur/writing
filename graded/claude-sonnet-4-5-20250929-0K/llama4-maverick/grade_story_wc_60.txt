<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Aria remains a collection of labels ("luminous skeptic," "realistically imaginative") without embodied contradiction or visible cost-driven choices. Her interior is largely absent; we are told she possesses "sidereal patience" and "defiant hush" but never witness competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The walk through the city unfolds as a sequence of perceptual observations without internal friction or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The ending's "accomplishment" and "newfound responsibility" arrive as summary rather than earned alteration with visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive quickly and remain stable. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural but the piece never delivers a meaningful tightening or cadence shift that reweights the dominant stake with cost; the discovery of the box and the release of memories unfold without resistance or friction. The closure unit is asserted ("liberated memories," "city's rebirth") rather than shown through a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration; no visible price is paid on the page. Cost proof test fails: no exact sentence or image at the ending beat demonstrates legible sacrifice or foreclosure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with consistent sensory detail (dry fountains, dusty streets, glittering glass shards, hidden doorways). The city's forgotten state remains coherent throughout, and the final image of flowing fountains reconfigures the initial dryness. However, the environment never constrains a choice or forces a tactical trade-off; it functions as vivid backdrop rather than active pressure. Spatial choreography is clear and anchored, meeting baseline needs but not charging the closure moment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("liberate trapped memories") is signaled early but faces no on-page opposition or complication. Aria's quest unfolds as a linear treasure hunt with no reversal, tightening, or choice that narrows options; the breadcrumbs lead her directly to the box, which opens without resistance. No cost is visible when she absorbs the memories or takes on guardian duty. The Accumulative lens requires one decisive intensification or cadence shift that reweights the stake—this piece provides neither.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The theme of reclaiming forgotten history emerges from the premise, and the rebirth of the fountains offers a concrete image. However, the ending paragraph includes direct thematic statements ("keep its stories alive," "her realistically imaginative spirit guiding the way") rather than letting the final image speak. No fresh inflection or non-obvious angle complicates the straightforward arc of discovery and restoration. The stained glass box returns at the end but its meaning remains static rather than reweighted with cost or irony.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping, and perceptual filtering is consistent (Aria's attentiveness to whispers, glimmers, symbols). However, diction drifts into elevated register ("luminous skeptic," "sidereal patience," "defiant hush") that clashes with the grounded sensory work and reads as imposed rather than organic to the focalizer's mind. Syntactic variety is present but runs of similar sentence stems appear in the middle sections. No dialogue is on the page to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and rhythmically varied, with vivid sensory anchors and no major grammatical errors. Template cadence appears in several adjacent sentences ("She was a seeker… She was on a mission… She moved with…"), reducing propulsion. Paraphrase loops are minimal but present ("forgotten" recurs mechanically across many lines without intensification). Figurative language (luminous, sidereal, kaleidoscope) is slightly overwritten for the stakes but does not obscure causality. The opening and closing lines provide image-based framing without loops in the final beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The core premise—a seeker restoring a city's lost history via a magical object—follows a familiar template without fresh transformation. Character traits and setting details are specific but arranged in predictable sequence: clues → discovery → release → renewal. No unconventional structural or perspectival risk heightens stakes; the arc is linear and unthreatened. The "pause of migrating geese" and "sidereal patience" offer distinct idiom but remain ornamental rather than shaping an unexpected turn or moral calculus.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Aria is present throughout and her walking/searching drives the sequence, but she makes no key choice that alters tactics or forecloses a path. The "luminous skeptic" label appears early but skepticism never complicates her acceptance of the box or the memories. She observes, walks, and absorbs without internal friction. Setup and middle presence secure functional score; lack of closure-shaping decision prevents higher band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The stained glass box is signaled as the quest object early, discovered mid-story, opened at climax, and carried away at the end—four distinct beats. Its colors "dance" and it releases memories, but its specific properties do not constrain a choice or impose cost; it could be swapped for another container without structural impact. Setup, development, and closure presence met; causal pressure and irreplaceability are absent.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Sidereal patience" is mentioned once in the opening as a trait Aria possesses and echoed thematically in the closing image of slow rebirth, but it never shapes an on-page action or decision. The concept remains label-only; no scene demonstrates her exercising patience under pressure or trading speed for thoroughness. Ornamental use without beat involvement.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Realistically imaginative" appears twice as a descriptor but never enables or constrains an action. We are told Aria's mind "saw beyond the ordinary," yet no scene shows her imagining a solution, weighing a creative risk, or suffering a cost from this trait. Label-only mention without visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Unstick" appears once in the phrase "unstick the cobwebs of forgotten lore," framing her method. The action of clearing away dust and following breadcrumbs could be read as unsticking, and the final fountain flow suggests unsticking the city's stasis. One middle beat and closure linkage via metaphor, but the verb itself is not repeated or made tactically specific. Lyric reprise with modest reweighting.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Following breadcrumbs" is named explicitly and demonstrated through Aria tuning into whispers, noticing glass shards, and tracing carvings—setup, middle use, and arrival at the doorway. The method shapes her path and occupies multiple beats. However, the breadcrumbs never run out, mislead, or impose a cost; the trail is unbroken. Solid integration without high causal pressure or irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The "city of forgotten fountains" is anchored in the opening line, revisited through dry streets and dusty courtyards, and reborn in the closing image when waters flow again. The setting's dryness → flowing transformation carries thematic weight and brackets the arc. The fountains' state changes causally with Aria's success, and the final image depends on this exact location. Setup, development, and closure all present; strong lyric charge at the end.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"From the pause of migrating geese" appears as the inciting moment in the opening but no clock or seasonal pressure is tracked. The geese are mentioned once more in the carving on the doorway, offering a symbolic callback but no temporal urgency or tightening. Present in setup and lightly in middle; no closure participation or deadline that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"To liberate trapped memories" is stated as Aria's mission in the opening and enacted when she opens the box and releases the memories mid-story. The motivation frames the quest but is never dramatized through internal conflict, competing desire, or visible cost. Told-only desire without friction between want and price. Setup and middle presence; lacks closure complication.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Defiant hush" is named twice—once as "a shield against doubts" mid-story and again in the closing line as "a defiant hush that would soon become a triumphant cry." The tone is asserted rather than enacted through sentence rhythm or diction that modulates under pressure. Static descriptor without tonal shift that charges the final beat. Functional label with lyric reprise but no embodied cost.</comment>
