<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The negotiator remains a cipher throughout, defined by abstract labels ("uncommonly thoughtful," "calm determination") rather than contradictory impulses or embodied struggle. The piece tells us she's skilled but never dramatizes a moment where her method is tested by her own doubt or fatigue. The antique drawer pull is clutched and released without visceral connection to her inner state. No on-page micro-choice reveals hierarchy of values or forecloses a path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is established (negotiator, parapet, stalled talks), but the drive lens remains ambiguous—accumulative imagery competes with causal claims ("time for breakthrough was near," "began to flow") that are asserted rather than dramatized. The closure unit is a summary: "negotiations...began to flow...now began to flow...talks concluded." No on-page reversal, decision, or image reweights prior material with felt cost; the breakthrough happens off-stage between paragraphs. Lens ambiguity and summary-only closure trigger Q2 cap at 7.2 and cross-category cap at 8.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The parapet, mist, and moon are vividly evoked and anchored early. However, the environment never constrains a tactical choice or alters the negotiator's options—it remains atmospheric backdrop. The antique drawer pull sits on a pedestal and is pocketed but does not shape an action. Sensory detail is selective and purpose-driven, but the setting does not charge the final image or force a decision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—achieving the prisoner exchange—is signaled early, but pressure is asserted rather than dramatized. "Stalled for weeks" and "tension ebb and flow" are told; no on-page tightening or trade-off narrows options. The breakthrough is summarized ("negotiations...began to flow") without showing the negotiator's agency, cost, or the mechanics of the moon-phase synchronization forcing a choice. Escalation is claimed but not enacted.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Theme of recycling mistakes into wisdom is stated repeatedly ("recycle their mistakes," "past was not forgotten, but learned from") rather than emerging from specific event or image. The final paragraph moralizes ("mistakes of the past could be recycled into wisdom") instead of offering a resonant non-literal answer. The antique drawer pull and moon phases are symbolic gestures without thematic friction or charged reprise that reweights prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and the perceptual filter is consistent (mist as "living entity," "furrowed hush"). However, diction drifts into elevated abstraction ("delicate balance," "uncertain path of forgiveness") that feels authorial rather than character-specific. The negotiator's interior voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature or rhythmic signature under pressure. No dialogue is present to evaluate. Psychic distance is controlled but lacks modulation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Template cadence pervades: "She felt...she had helped...," "The mist swirled...a reminder...," "As the moon...she turned...," "For in the furrowed hush...she had found...." Paraphrase loops across adjacent paragraphs recycle "delicate balance," "fragile balance," "weight of responsibility," "weight of past mistakes." "Furrowed hush" is a mixed metaphor (furrowed = visual/tactile, hush = auditory). Filter-verb stacks ("she felt," "she knew," "she had watched") dull immediacy in peak beats. Artifacts touch the closure sequence; disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8 per patterned-artifact rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Core premise—mystical negotiation synchronized to moon phases—reads as ornamental magical realism without transformation or earned mechanics. The antique drawer pull, moon-phase method, and mist-shrouded parapet feel like prompt-fulfillment checklist rather than organic synthesis. Emotional truth is generic ("weight of responsibility," "path to healing"). The breakthrough is asserted without showing tactics, cost, or specific inflection. Derivative template without fresh angle.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Present throughout but makes no on-page decision that alters tactics or options. She speaks once in abstract generalities; the breakthrough is summarized rather than shown as her choice. Label-only role.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Introduced early on a pedestal, clutched mid-story, pocketed at the end. Described as symbolic of "delicate balance" but never handled in a way that constrains or enables a choice. Static metaphor, not causal tool. Swappable with any symbolic object.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The parapet is framed as neutral territory where "neither side could claim dominance," and this concept anchors the talks spatially. However, it does not constrain tactics or shape a pivotal choice on the page. Present in setup and thematically echoed at closure but not developed through middle pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Uncommonly thoughtful expression" is mentioned twice as a label without dramatizing a moment where this trait enables or constrains an action. No visible trade-off or cost tied to being thoughtful. Decorative attribute.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Untether the discussions from bitter recriminations" appears once in summary. The method is told, not shown; no on-page beat dramatizes the act of untethering or its cost. Could be replaced with "refocus" or "redirect" with minimal edits. Mid-band functional use without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>Mentioned as the negotiator's "unorthodox method" and referenced when talks "synchronized through moon phases...found themselves moving in tandem." Never shown in mechanics or used to shape an attempt. Summary-only, introduced early but not developed or paid off in a decision beat.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Storm-worn parapet in mist is vividly established early, anchors spatial choreography, and returns in the closing image. It provides neutral ground and atmospheric pressure but does not supply a resource or constraint that alters a choice. Purposeful early–final reprise reweights the mood but not the stake. Lyric resonance lifts score into mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.3</grade><comment>"Between apology and forgiveness" is a thematic label, not a tracked timeframe that tightens decisions. The talks are "stalled for weeks" and then conclude in an unspecified duration. No live clock or temporal pressure alters tactics. Functional metaphor, not a causal constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Stated as her task ("recycle their mistakes into wisdom") and repeated in the final paragraph. Never dramatized as a conflicted choice or tested against competing wants. Told motivation without on-page friction or cost. Swappable with any reconciliation goal.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Furrowed hush" appears twice, framing the negotiator's speech and final reflection. Tone is consistent and modulates slightly from contemplation to resolution. However, the phrase is a mixed metaphor and the tone does not intensify or reweight the final image with additional pressure. Coherent but static mood.</comment>
