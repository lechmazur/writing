<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The stargazer remains thinly sketched; her interior life is presented through abstract labels ("awkwardly confident," "renewed sense of purpose") rather than embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The stone-circle epiphany arrives as declarative summary—"visions of the rebellion's fervor...began to resurface"—without showing what inner cost or competing impulse she overcomes. No genuine on-page struggle or foreclosed path makes the transformation credible; the character observes and receives rather than choosing with visible trade-offs.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as loosely Accumulative (journey to circle, hum intensifies, return with renewed purpose), but the closure lacks legible cost: the stargazer simply "found what she sought" and walks forward with no visible trade-off or foreclosed option. The legend functions as a convenient solve introduced early but never tested by failure or complication. Orientation is adequate (spaceport, margin of daylight, mountains), waiving the penalty, yet the ending reconfiguration remains asserted rather than dramatized with felt consequence on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The spaceport and stone circle are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (rusting steel, moss-covered grey stones, low-frequency hum), and the barefoot contact grounds key moments. However, setting functions primarily as backdrop; the opera glasses and bare feet recur but do not constrain a choice or alter tactics. The hum charges the final third emotionally but does not force a decision with on-page cost, capping micro-setting credit.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—rediscovering purpose after the rebellion's lull—is signaled early but never tightens with genuine opposition or cost. The journey to the circle unfolds without complication; the hum simply delivers the desired effect without the protagonist choosing between competing goods or paying a visible price. No on-page reversal or deepening alters her options; the resolution is handed to her rather than earned through agency under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme of rekindling purpose in stillness emerges through repeated imagery (stars, hum, opera glasses), yet the ending states its answer—"she had found her way"—rather than offering a non-literal reconfiguration. The vintage opera glasses recur across beats, reweighting from observation tool to symbol of renewed vision, which elevates thematic texture. However, the final paragraphs moralise ("not stillness, but a held breath") instead of letting the image resonate, lowering closure impact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Voice is lyric and consistent, with elevated diction ("testament to the rebellion," "thunderous serenity") that fits the reflective register. However, psychic distance never tightens under pressure; the narrator maintains the same declarative, expository tone throughout without modulation when stakes should escalate. Free indirect access is clean, and the perceptual signature remains stable, but the prose does not embody urgency or contradiction in peak moments, limiting emotional charge.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The prose carries rhythmic variation and vivid phrases ("margin of daylight," "thunderous serenity"), but paraphrase loops pervade: "reignite the spark...rediscover the purpose," "reignite the rebellion...rekindle the fire," "renewed sense of purpose...renewed spirit." Template cadence appears in repeated structures ("As she...the stars"; "The stargazer's...still"). These artifacts dull momentum at closure ("walked on, awkwardly confident, into the unknown" recycles the opening trait without fresh pressure). Density and propulsion suffer under synonym churn, triggering −0.8 for loop spread and −0.3 for template runs in Q7, with the −1.7 artifact-at-closure deduction applied and global 9+ disallowed.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The premise—lone rebel seeks meaning at mystical site during lull—follows a familiar quest-for-renewal template without meaningful transformation. The stone circle legend is introduced as convenient lore and delivers exactly what it promises with no subversion or complication. Emotional arc (lost → journeys → receives epiphany → returns renewed) could port to any setting with minimal edits. One small inflection—barefoot contact and opera glasses as tactile anchors—adds texture but insufficient originality to escape mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The barefoot stargazer is present throughout and initiates the journey, satisfying setup and development gates. However, her choices are passive observation rather than decisions with cost: she "set her course," "traversed," "felt," and "knew," but no on-page action or renunciation alters tactics or forecloses a path. She receives the hum's effect rather than wrestling with competing options. Present and functional, but easily swappable with a generic seeker; cap at 3.8 for swappability and lack of causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The vintage opera glasses appear in four beats (clutched in hand, raised to eyes, slung around neck, final framing), satisfying setup, development, and closure gates. They "vibrated in harmony" at the circle and frame "a vision of the future" at the end, carrying symbolic resonance. However, they do not constrain a choice or enable a tactic under pressure; their use remains observational. The lyric reprise reweights meaning slightly, but the element is swappable with any viewing tool. Score 4.2 for functional presence across beats without causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The lull in rebellion is named in the opening third and motivates the journey: "unsettling stillness" drives her to seek the spark. It shapes the dominant stake—rediscovering purpose when fighting has paused—and the ending invokes "the next great movement." The concept constrains her emotional state and provides the problem the hum resolves, satisfying setup, development, and closure. However, it functions as backdrop rather than on-page pressure that alters tactics; no scene forces her to choose between waiting and acting. Score 5.1 for shaping one key turn (departure) and thematic closure participation without mid-beat causal work.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Awkwardly confident" is labeled in the opening ("a trait that manifested in her deliberate strides") and recycled at closure ("walked on, awkwardly confident"), but never constrains or enables an on-page action with visible cost. No scene dramatizes the tension between awkwardness and confidence; the trait remains ornamental. Present in setup and closure but purely decorative; score 2.4 for label-only use without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Reignite" appears as explicit goal ("set her course," "reignite the spark," "reignite the rebellion") in setup, drives the journey to the circle (development), and the hum delivers the effect at closure ("reignited the flame within"). The action is central to the dominant stake and meaningfully shapes three beats. However, it is handed to her by the hum rather than earned through protagonist agency or sacrifice; the mechanics are passive reception. Score 6.8 for essential presence across setup, development, and closure with moderate causal pressure, reduced by lack of on-page cost tied to her choices.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The hum is signaled in setup ("ancient legend about a stone circle, whose hum was said to awaken dormant passions"), structures the middle journey ("air thickened," "opera glasses...seemed to vibrate"), and delivers the closure effect ("hum grew louder...reignited the flame within," "thunderous serenity...still resonating within"). The method is present in all three gates and its mechanics—vibrational resonance—matter on the page. However, it solves the problem without complication or cost; she simply receives the effect. Score 6.3 for essential three-gate presence with moderate specificity, capped by lack of on-page struggle or trade-off tied to the method.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport repair bay frames the opening and closing beats, providing vivid imagery ("rusting hulks," "dusty floor," "cold metal"). It anchors the before-state and final return but does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome. The mountain stone circle does more tactical work. The spaceport is present in setup and closure (lyric reprise: "once a symbol of defeat, now seemed a reminder of what was to come") but replaceable with any departure/return location. Score 3.1 for functional bookend presence without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Margin of daylight" appears in opening and closing beats ("when the sun's rays struggled," "margin of daylight gave way to the stars," "margin of daylight was gone"). The timeframe provides atmospheric texture and marks passage from day to night, but it does not tighten decisions or alter tactics. No clock pressure forces a choice; the journey unfolds at leisure. Present in setup and closure with poetic resonance but no causal constraint. Score 3.6 for functional lyric reprise without live ticking pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"To discover meaning in the mess" drives the dominant stake throughout: "make sense of the chaos," "find meaning in the mess," "found what she sought." The motivation is signaled in setup, propels the journey (development), and the closure declares it satisfied. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicting choices or visible friction between wants and costs; she simply acts on it without internal resistance. Score 5.9 for shaping the arc across all three gates with moderate causal pressure, reduced by lack of on-page friction or trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Thunderous serenity" is named at the hum's peak ("thunderous serenity that enveloped her") and echoed at closure ("thunderous serenity...still resonating within"). The oxymoron captures the paradox of overwhelming calm and modulates between reflective opening and charged stone-circle sequence. However, it appears explicitly only twice and does not inflect sentence rhythm or imagery throughout; much of the prose reads lyrically calm without tonal thunder. Present in development and closure with purposeful framing, but static application. Score 4.7 for coherent but underutilized tonal charge.</comment>
