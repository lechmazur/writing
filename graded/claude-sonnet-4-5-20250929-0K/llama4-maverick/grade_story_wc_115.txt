<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The explorer is defined by curiosity and skepticism but never faces a moment where these traits create contradictory impulses or meaningful cost. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("piqued," "sense of clarity wash over them") and the protagonist remains passive—walking, listening, reading—without agency that forecloses options. The final "satisfaction" is told rather than earned through struggle, and no flawed choice compounds before resolution. The character reads as a vessel for atmosphere rather than a mind under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who and where by the opening lines, satisfying the test. However, closure is minimal: the explorer reads a logbook and feels "satisfaction" without visible cost or a decisive change in stance. The story operates in a loose accumulative mode—atmosphere, radio program, valve wheel, logbook—but the final beat does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure. The "swallowed truth" is discovered off-page (in text) rather than forcing a choice that narrows options. Drive lens remains ambiguous between Accumulative and Causal, and the ending simply stops rather than crystallizing a before/after with felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The tunnel setting is vivid ("scent of decay and rust," "twisted and rusted" train cars) and consistently atmospheric. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics—the explorer walks freely without obstacle or pressure from the space itself. The beaded valve wheel is handled twice (picked up, clutched) but remains ornamental; it does not charge the final image or force a decision. Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered ("morbid perfume"), meeting baseline competence, but the setting functions as backdrop rather than crucible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to find the weight of a swallowed truth"—is signaled early and coheres across beats. Yet no escalation or tightening occurs: the explorer walks, listens to radio, discovers a logbook, and achieves satisfaction without friction, reversal, or visible cost. The radio-psychic interlude and valve wheel do not complicate or narrow options; they merely punctuate transit. No agency-driven turn forces a trade-off, and coincidence (stumbling upon the logbook) resolves the quest without earned causality. Pressure remains static rather than accumulating or deepening under any lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Theme of "ghost shift," labor's residue, and hidden truths is asserted ("hum with the energy of past labor") but not dramatized through particulars that reweight the ending. The radio psychic's "swallowed truth" moment is told as resonance rather than shown constraining the explorer's stance. The final logbook discovery delivers on the stated quest but offers no non-literal reconfiguration or fresh moral calculus—merely confirmation. Thematic elements remain surface decoration without friction or cost that charges the closure image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Voice is consistent third-limited with controlled distance and some textural specificity ("staccato beat," "drowsy alertness"). However, elision of key action (what the logbook says, what the "truth" is) is not pattern-taught or paid off—it withholds for suspense rather than imposing cost. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("morbid perfume," "appraising the mood") that feels imposed rather than character-particular. No head-hopping, and POV modesty holds, but the perceptual signature is generic explorer-voice rather than singular.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Prose is grammatically clean with varied sentence structure and atmospheric cadence. However, paraphrase loops appear: "sense of drowsy alertness" / "drowsy alertness wash over them," "swallowed truth" repeated three times without reweighting. Stock metaphors ("wash over," "press in," "shiver run down spine") accumulate without fresh inflection. Filter-verb stacks ("felt a sense," "felt a shiver," "felt their senses") dull immediacy in peak beats. Information density is low—many lines describe mood rather than advancing situation or choice. The final beat summarizes satisfaction instead of showing the cost or choice that earns it.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The abandoned-tunnel-explorer setup is familiar, and the story does not transform it through character-specific calculus or a non-obvious turn. The beaded valve wheel is quirky but remains ornamental; the radio-psychic method is mentioned but not integrated into discovery tactics. The ending—finding a logbook that confirms the quest—follows a template path without synthesis or risk. Emotional specificity is absent; the explorer's "satisfaction" could belong to any seeker. No bold structural or perspectival choice elevates the material.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The explorer is present throughout and makes micro-decisions (touch valve wheel, listen to radio, read logbook), satisfying setup and development gates. However, choices are low-stakes observations rather than turns that narrow options or alter tactics. The ending reports satisfaction without a decision that forecloses a path. Late arrivals (valve wheel, logbook) drive beats, but the explorer remains passive. Swappable with "curious investigator" with minimal edit.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Setup: signaled early (paragraph 5). Development: picked up and turned over; clutched while walking (two beats). Payoff: mentioned in final third but does not shape the ending or reweight prior material—logbook discovery resolves the quest. The valve wheel's "intricate pattern of beads" is described but its specific properties never constrain a choice or charge closure. Ornamental recurrence without causal pressure. Cap applied for no closure participation (2.8 ceiling) but two-beat involvement lifts slightly within that band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Setup: "factory ghost shift" concept appears mid-story (paragraph 8). Development: shapes the explorer's frame of reference and thematic lens. Payoff: the logbook and "truth" discovery echo the ghost-shift idea but the concept does not alter tactics or create a visible constraint. Functions as thematic backdrop rather than a stake-shaping force. Introduced after first third (−0.3), no causal pressure on choices, swappable with "industrial haunting" or "abandoned labor."</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>Setup: "religiously skeptical" appears mid-story (paragraph 9). Development: mentioned once in relation to superstition but does not constrain or enable an on-page action. The explorer listens to the psychic radio without internal friction between skepticism and belief; no cost or trade-off emerges. Payoff: absent from ending. Label-only trait without dramatized pressure. Late introduction (−0.4), ornamental use (−0.7), no closure participation (cap 2.8).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Setup: "appraise" appears explicitly in paragraph 15 tied to the radio-psychic method. Development: the explorer "appraises the mood of a place" but the action does not drive a turn or narrow options—it describes their habitual method without on-page application. Payoff: the logbook discovery does not trace to appraisal; the explorer stumbles upon it. Swappable with "interpret" or "sense" without structural change. Functional mention but no causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Setup: radio-psychic program introduced mid-story (paragraphs 12–14). Development: the explorer listens and reflects on their interpretive method, but the method does not shape the search or alter tactics. Payoff: absent; the logbook is found by stumbling, not by applying psychic-call interpretation. Mechanics are told ("developed a method") without demonstration. Late introduction (−0.4), summary-only (−0.5), no closure participation (cap 2.8).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setup: tunnel anchored in opening line. Development: described across multiple beats with sensory detail; train cars and spatial progression track cleanly. Payoff: the tunnel is the site of the logbook discovery, present at closure. However, the setting does not constrain choices—explorer moves freely without obstacle—and does not supply resources that affect outcome. Atmosphere is strong but passive. Three gates met; causal pressure absent (−0.6).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Setup: "hush that follows a sudden confession" appears mid-story (paragraph 17) as a radio moment. Development: the hush triggers reflection but does not tighten the explorer's decisions or create urgency. Payoff: timeframe does not shape the ending; no clock or deadline alters tactics. The "hush" is a mood marker rather than a pressure lever. Introduced after first third (−0.3), ornamental (−0.6), no closure participation (cap 2.8).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Setup: motivation stated explicitly in paragraph 19. Development: drives the explorer's presence in the tunnel and frames the quest across beats. Payoff: logbook discovery delivers on the stated goal, present at closure. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices; no friction between wants and costs emerges on the page. The "swallowed truth" is confirmed without sacrifice or renunciation. Two gates (development, payoff) met; setup late (−0.3), no visible cost (−0.5).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Setup: "drowsy alertness" introduced mid-story (paragraph 16). Development: repeated once more (paragraph 33) and modulates the explorer's perceptual state across beats. Payoff: the tone shifts to "clarity" at the end, marking a subtle progression. Coherent through turns but does not intensify under pressure or charge the final image with undeniable force. Introduced after first third (−0.3), static recurrence rather than escalation (−0.4).</comment>
