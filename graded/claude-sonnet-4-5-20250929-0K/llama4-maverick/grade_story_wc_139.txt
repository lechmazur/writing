<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lena's internal journey from observer to active participant is present but undermotivated—her sudden determination to "take the risk" and "breach the boundaries" lacks embodied conflict or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The ink pot functions as a talisman rather than forcing a genuine internal trade-off. Her father's con-artist background is told rather than shown through speech or tactical choices, and their relationship lacks the friction necessary to test loyalty or complicity. Emotional progression remains abstract: "warmth spread through her chest" and "sense of calm" are label-only rather than grounded in bodily specificity or contradictory fear.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed—who, where, and when coalesce only after ~200 words ("funeral home's director" clarifies setting late). The dominant stake (securing asylum for a client) is declared but never dramatized: the father's offstage negotiation and the director's unseen "reconsideration" deny the reader causal linkage. Closure attempts Charged Poise ("ready to make their move") but the cost remains hypothetical and the breach itself occurs offstage, leaving no visible or felt consequence on the page. The lens reads Causal but the "because/therefore" chain is missing at the climactic beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The prep room anchors setting with formaldehyde, cold steel tables, and flowers, and the ink pot's "delicate curves and weighty presence" provides tactile specificity. However, spatial choreography is vague—Lena's position relative to the door, her father's movements, and the director's location remain unclear. The setting's funeral-home particulars (embalming equipment, lighting, acoustic details) are underused; the room functions more as backdrop than constraint. The ink pot does charge the final image, meeting the micro-setting threshold for mid-band placement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The declared stake (political asylum for a client) never tightens on the page—the father's offstage "negotiation" and the director's unseen "reconsideration" deny escalation through protagonist agency. Lena's arc from passive observer to willing accomplice lacks a credible on-page cost or choice that narrows options. The "breach of protocol" is announced as imminent but never enacted, leaving no reversal or visible price. The mathematics-of-a-fair-trade motif is conceptual rather than dramatized through competing goods or unavoidable harms.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The theme of fair trade and moral calculus is asserted ("what was the value of a person's freedom") rather than embodied through specific choices with competing costs. The ink pot recurs but its meaning remains static—it symbolizes determination without reweighting prior material at closure. The father's pride and Lena's readiness are told emotions, not particular realizations earned through scene pressure. The final image ("armed with the vintage ink pot and a determination to see justice done") states theme rather than resonating through action or image that recharges earlier beats.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, and Lena's perceptual filter (drawn to the ink pot, watching her father) is consistent. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("liquefy the rigid thinking," "deathly vitality," "mathematics of a fair trade") that feels authorial rather than character-particular for a young woman handling props in a funeral home. Dialogue is minimal but functional; the father's lines ("reconsider our client's application," "You're a natural, kiddo") carry subtext of mentorship. Internal voice lacks rhythmic modulation under pressure—syntax remains uniform across calm observation and stated crisis.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops abound: "waited, the ink pot cradled in her hands" / "wait actively" / "waiting was infusing it with life" / "waited for the perfect moment" cycle the same content without advancing pressure. Template cadence runs through the middle third ("She was surrounded," "She started to think," "She looked down"). Stock metaphors ("liquefy the rigid thinking," "deathly vitality") and therapy-speak ("understanding what people truly wanted") cluster in key beats without embodied specificity. Figurative language appears in most sentences of the climactic paragraph without pattern-teaching, obscuring propulsion. The orientation debt and line artifacts together disqualify high-band consideration.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The con-artist father mentoring his daughter in a funeral home offers a promising frame, but the political-asylum grift remains generic and the prep-room setting is underused for tactical specificity. The ink pot as talisman and "mathematics of a fair trade" feel prompt-derived rather than organically discovered through scene pressure. The waiting-actively method is asserted rather than demonstrated through tactical choices or embodied restraint. The piece reads as a template response—replace "asylum" with any favor and "ink pot" with any heirloom and the emotional arc remains unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Lena (the con artist's daughter) is present throughout and her shift from observer to willing accomplice anchors the arc, but her choices are largely internal and declared rather than enacted on the page. She handles the ink pot, watches her father, and resolves to act—but the breach itself occurs offstage. Functional presence without driving a visible turn.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The vintage ink pot appears in the opening beat (polishing), recurs as Lena holds it during her father's negotiation, and is present in the final image ("armed with the vintage ink pot"). However, its function remains static—a symbol of determination without evolving use or reweighted meaning. It does not constrain a choice or alter tactics. Early signal and closure participation earn mid-band placement, but swappability (any heirloom would serve) and lack of causal pressure prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Political asylum is the declared stake ("seeking political asylum for a client") and frames the father's offstage negotiation. However, the mechanics of asylum—why this funeral director, what documents or influence are at stake—remain opaque, and the concept never shapes on-page tactics or choices. It functions as a generic high-stakes favor rather than a dramatized legal or ethical calculus. Present and functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Liquefies rigid thinking" appears once as a metaphor describing the ink pot's effect on Lena's perspective ("seemed to liquefy the rigid thinking that had been plaguing her"). The attribute is told rather than demonstrated through a visible shift in problem-solving or tactical choice. Label-only mention without constraint or enabling action.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The "breach of protocol" is announced in dialogue as a future act ("will require a breach") and remains imminent at the ending ("time to put their plan into action"), but it never occurs on the page. The element frames the stakes but does not drive a visible turn. Summary-only use and lack of dramatization cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Waiting actively" is named explicitly ("the best way to get what you want was to wait actively, to observe and listen") and Lena enacts it by holding the ink pot and watching while her father negotiates. The method is signaled early and shapes her stance across two beats, but the mechanics—what active waiting accomplishes versus passive waiting—remain abstract. The moment to act arrives but the action itself is deferred offstage. Functional role without tactical payoff.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The funeral home prep room anchors setting from the opening line ("prep room's lamps," "formaldehyde," "cold steel tables") and recurs in the final beat ("prep room, with its cold steel tables"). The space provides atmosphere and tonal charge ("deathly vitality") but does not constrain choices or supply resources that alter tactics—Lena could hold the ink pot and resolve to act anywhere. Early signal and closure participation without causal pressure place it in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"The mathematics of a fair trade" is named explicitly ("She started to think about the mathematics of a fair trade") and recurs in the penultimate paragraph ("The mathematics of a fair trade was a complex equation"). However, the motivation remains abstract—no on-page choice dramatizes competing values or visible trade-offs. Lena's desire to "see justice done" is declared rather than tested through friction between cost and want. Present and thematically coherent but not embodied in choices.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Deathly vitality" is named explicitly ("seemed to vibrate with a deathly vitality") and the tone is sustained through formaldehyde, cold steel, flowers, and the juxtaposition of funeral setting with grifter energy. The oxymoron charges the atmosphere across beats and modulates with Lena's rising determination in the final third. However, the phrase itself is on-the-nose and the tonal charge does not reshape the final image in a way that reweights prior material. Coherent and purposeful without full integration into closure.</comment>
