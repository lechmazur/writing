<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Aria remains abstract throughout; her "quest to learn why some people echo" is stated but never dramatized through concrete choices under pressure. No internal contradiction or embodied struggle appears—she simply sings, receives revelation, and walks away satisfied. The final "smile" and continuation feel unearned because no cost, renunciation, or foreclosed path is visible. Interiority consists of poetic declaration rather than character-particular thought that changes under stress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>No legible closure unit. Aria ends where she began—still seeking, still singing—without a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing that reconfigures stakes or knowledge with visible cost. The "step closer to understanding" is asserted, not demonstrated; no option is foreclosed, no price paid on the page. Orientation is delayed past 120 words with vague "serpentine nexus under starlight" and "canyon echo singer" labels that remain undefined. The ending simply restates the opening premise in lyric dress, offering no before/after legibility.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The "serpentine nexus under starlight" and "whispering seashell half" are named but never anchored in concrete spatial or sensory detail that constrains action. No body, tool, or environment meaningfully pressures a choice or alters tactics. Descriptions are atmospheric but generic—"universe hums," "stars closer," "morning dew"—without POV-filtered specificity or causal involvement in the narrative.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—learning why some people echo—is declared but never tested on the page. No reversal, tightening, or choice narrows options or raises cost; Aria sings, receives passive revelation, and continues unchanged. "Progressive disclosure" is mentioned as method but not dramatized through tactical adjustments or prices paid. The story offers no escalation under any lens: no causal because/therefore links, no accumulative density shift at closure, no situational pressure that crystallizes stance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The theme—connection, echoes, hidden truths—is stated rather than emergent from concrete particulars. "Webs of intrigue," "doors of perception," and "mysteries beyond understanding" are abstract placeholders. The ending delivers no resonant image that reweights prior material; instead it loops back to the opening's thesis in nearly identical language. No earned insight arises from specific struggle; the "voice that sang of mysteries" is unanchored meta-commentary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Third-person distant narration maintains stable tense and POV but offers no perceptual signature specific to Aria. Diction drifts into elevated, abstract register—"labyrinthine canyons of the soul," "doors of perception"—that feels imported rather than character-rooted. Repeated sentence stems ("As she sang," "The shell's," "Aria's") create template cadence. No dialogue appears to test voice distinction. Aria's way of noticing is generic poetic rather than individually selective.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Pervasive paraphrase loops and synonym churn: "whispers"/"murmurs"/"hum" cycle without advancing meaning; "webs of intrigue" appears three times in static restatement; "reed-blown melancholy" bookends without reweighting. Template cadence runs across multiple paragraphs with identical stems. Stock metaphors—"threads of a spider's web," "doors of perception," "key that unlocked"—appear without fresh inflection. Final paragraph nearly duplicates the opening, flattening closure momentum. Information density is low; most sentences restate rather than advance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>The premise—mystical singer seeks truth about echoes—reads as a generic fantasy-quest template without transformation. "Canyon echo singer," "whispering seashell," "webs of intrigue," "progressive disclosure" are named elements stitched together rather than organically synthesized. No fresh angle or specific lived detail distinguishes this from archetypal myth structures. The circular ending that restates the opening avoids risk and offers no turn, cost, or ingenuity that could elevate familiar material.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>Aria is present throughout but makes no on-page decision that alters tactics or forecloses options. She sings, perceives, and walks away; observation without agency. Her role as "canyon echo singer" is label-only; the trait does not constrain or enable specific action.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The whispering seashell half appears in opening, middle ("grew warmer"), and closing paragraphs but remains static description. It does not constrain choice, enable a turn, or return with reweighted meaning at closure—merely reprises as prop. No causal work; easily swappable with any mystical object.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Webs of intrigue" is mentioned three times as thematic imagery but never shapes on-page stakes or tactics. No character navigates, avoids, or is trapped by intrigue in dramatized action. Functions as atmosphere, not plot driver.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.6</grade><comment>"Richly perceptive" appears as a label in the opening line and is never demonstrated through specific sensory choices or tradeoffs. No scene shows perception enabling or constraining action with cost. Could be removed without altering any beat.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Ensure" appears once in a summary sentence about method; it does not drive a turn or create a choice point. The story's structure does not hinge on any act of ensuring; the term is ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.2</grade><comment>"Progressive disclosure" is named once as Aria's method but never shown. No sequence dramatizes gradual revelation shaping her attempts or altering her approach. The method is told, not enacted, and plays no causal role in beats or closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The "serpentine nexus under starlight" opens and closes the story, framing location, but spatial details remain vague. No path, obstacle, or environmental feature pressures a choice or alters outcome. Functions as aesthetic backdrop without causal integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.4</grade><comment>"While the universe hums its secret song" is a poetic refrain (opening, middle, close) with no time-pressure function. No clock or deadline tightens decisions; duration is untracked. The phrase is atmospheric tag, not temporal constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Aria's desire "to learn why some people echo" is stated in paragraph six and restated at the end, but never dramatized through conflicted choice or friction between want and cost. Told motivation without on-page test or consequence.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Reed-blown melancholy" is named twice and evoked through diction ("haunting," "lonely bird," "sorrowful and redemptive"). Tone is coherent and modulates slightly from opening wonder to closing wistfulness, but does not sharpen under pressure or charge the final image with new weight. Static mood rather than dynamic tonal arc.</comment>
