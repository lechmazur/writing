<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The prophet remains a vessel for atmospheric description rather than a character with contradictory impulses or credible interiority. Her motivation "to turn obstacles into instruments" is asserted but never tested by genuine friction or trade-offs; she moves through the orchard without resistance, making no choices that foreclose paths or reveal costs. Interiority consists of stock mystical phrasing ("her eyes sparkled with a restless energy," "her chest heaving with exertion") without embodied emotion or character-particular thought. No visible change or renunciation occurs; she simply vanishes, leaving the story without earned closure rooted in her agency.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>No closure unit—Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing—lands on the page. The prophet performs, then vanishes; nothing reweights her options, forecloses a path, or crystallizes a stance with legible cost. The piece reads as a static tableau: blue hour → performance → departure, with no causal pressure or meaningful tightening. Orientation is present (who, where, when established early), but the inferred lens (Accumulative/Textural) never deepens or shifts cadence to charge the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The orchard-on-driftwood image is vivid and consistently rendered across beats, and the blue-hour sky anchors mood. However, the setting remains postcard-descriptive; it does not constrain a choice or charge the closure. The driftwood circle is mentioned repeatedly but never alters tactics or options—it creaks gently, an atmospheric detail without consequence. Micro-setting allowance (body, tool, object) is present (xylophone mallet handled twice), lifting the score slightly, but setting never pressures the protagonist's path.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to turn obstacles into instruments"—is declared but never dramatized through friction, reversal, or cost. No obstacles appear on the page; the prophet moves freely, strikes branches, taps driftwood, and departs without resistance or trade-off. Pressure does not escalate; the performance unfolds smoothly from inception to conclusion with no tightening or deepening. The prophet's agency is absent; coincidence or authorial arrangement drives every beat, leaving no earned stakes or visible price paid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme of transformation and resonance is stated repeatedly ("turn obstacles into instruments," "hidden harmony," "synthesis of sound and atmosphere") rather than earned through concrete particulars. The final image—stars twinkling, orchard afloat—offers no non-literal answer or reweighting; it restates the mood without friction or cost. Thematic echo in the final third ("a testament to the prophet's art") replaces scene pressure with summary assertion. No counter-reading or complexity emerges; the piece declares its own profundity without dramatizing insight or paying conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited, and the voice maintains a lyric register throughout. However, diction drifts into elevated abstraction ("restless euphony," "resonance of the atmosphere," "tiny, shining jewel") that feels authorial rather than character-particular. Perceptual signature is absent; the prophet's way of noticing reads generic and interchangeable. Free indirect style is clean, but the prose lacks a distinct rhythmic or syntactic identity rooted in the focalizer's mind under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "sweet scent of blooming flowers" recurs three times; "creaked softly/gently" appears twice; "tiny, shining jewel" is restated identically. Template cadence runs through the final third ("The stars shone… The stars continued…"), and stock metaphors ("diamonds in the sky," "canopy of light") dull specificity. Information density is low; multiple sentences restate atmosphere without advancing pressure. Filter-verb stacks ("seemed to reverberate," "seemed to capture," "seemed to linger") flatten immediacy across high-priority beats, triggering the Q7 artifact cap and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The prophet-musician-mystic archetype is executed without transformation; cloud-reading and sound-conjuring are familiar mystical tropes presented as postcard tableau rather than specific lived detail. The orchard-afloat premise is visually distinctive but not integrated into causal choices or thematic friction. No turn or reconfiguration feels earned in hindsight; the piece unfolds as a single mood held static from opening to close. Emotional truth is absent; complexity is replaced by abstract declarations of "restless euphony" and "hidden harmony."</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>The Leeward tide prophet is present throughout and performs the music, but makes no choices that create turns or alter tactics. She observes, walks, strikes objects, then vanishes—observation and action without decision or cost. Missing middle development (no choice constrained by her role) and missing closure participation (she exits without reweighting stakes). Late penalty does not apply (present early), but ornamental use and lack of causal pressure cap the score low.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The xylophone mallet appears in two distinct beats: grasped early, then used to strike branches and tap the driftwood circle. Setup and development gates are met. However, it does not shape the closure; the prophet departs and the mallet vanishes from the final image. No cost is tied to the mallet's use, and it could be replaced with "stick" or "baton" without structural change. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Sketched resonance" is mentioned as "hidden harmony" and "resonance of the atmosphere," but remains abstract theme rather than a tactic or stake that changes on-page options. It does not constrain choices or drive beats; the prophet simply performs and the resonance is declared present. Missing development and closure participation; ornamental use only.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Interprets cloud movements" is described early ("began to interpret the cloud movements," "patterns, shapes, and forms") and mentioned again in the penultimate paragraph, but never constrains or enables an on-page action with cost. The prophet watches clouds, then proceeds to make music; the interpretation does not alter her tactics or face a trade-off. Label-only trait without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Dub" appears once in the middle beat ("began to dub the sounds of the orchard") and drives that moment's action (striking branches to release tones). However, major turns do not trace to this action; the prophet could "play," "coax," or "summon" sounds with identical structure. Present in setup and development, but missing from closure and easily swappable. Mid-band functional use.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Fractal generating" is mentioned once in the middle ("rooted in fractal generating, a technique that allowed her to uncover hidden patterns") and claimed to shape the driftwood rhythm. However, its mechanics are not demonstrated; the text asserts the method without showing how it alters attempts or choices. Late signal (past midpoint), summary-only use, and missing closure participation cap the score low.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The orchard-on-driftwood setting is vividly established early and returns in the final paragraphs, creating a purposeful reprise. It supplies the performance space and the driftwood circle provides a surface to tap, meeting setup and development. However, the setting does not pressure choices or supply a constraint that alters outcome; it remains backdrop. The lyric return reweights the image slightly, lifting the score into mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Blue hour" is named early and tracked through the piece ("blue hour deepened," "given way to a deeper shade of indigo"), meeting setup and development. However, time does not tighten decisions or tactics; the prophet has unlimited time to perform, and the transition to night is atmospheric rather than pressuring. Present in closure (stars appear) but without causal force or cost tied to the timeframe.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"To turn obstacles into instruments" is stated as the prophet's singular motivation early, meeting setup. However, no obstacles appear on the page to test this desire; she moves freely and encounters no friction or trade-off. The motivation is told-only, never dramatized through conflicted choices or visible cost. Missing development and closure participation; declarative rather than enacted.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Restless euphony" is named once late and echoed in descriptions of "haunting," "euphoric mixture," and "soothing melody" throughout. The tone is coherent and modulates slightly from anticipation to performance to aftermath. However, it does not charge the final image with new cost or conceptual weight; the mood holds static. Present across beats and at closure, but without the decisive reweighting that would reach higher bands.</comment>
