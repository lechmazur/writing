<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The knight remains withdrawn throughout with no embodied contradictory impulses or genuine internal conflict dramatized in scene. Interiority consists largely of stock phrasing ("shiver ran down their spine," "heart pounded with a mix of excitement and trepidation") and abstract claims of connection without character-particular reasoning. The final "sense of purpose" replacing withdrawal is asserted rather than earned through on-page choices that foreclose a visible path. Motivation is declared ("murmured allegiance," "capture the shape of possibility") but never tested by competing wants or costs that would reveal a hierarchy of values.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test: who (knight), where (greenhouse), and when (endless night) are present early, but the Orientation Test penalty is waived because the setting anchors are functional. The closure unit attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (withdrawn nature replaced by purpose, allegiance to Lysander) but the cost is not legible on the page—no visible trade-off, forfeiture, or constraint is shown. The knight's actions (unsnapping the wooden catch, grasping the shimmering entity) do not narrow options or change knowledge in a way that demonstrates because/therefore linkage or accumulative pressure with price. The ending asserts transformation ("their journey was far from over") without dramatizing what has been lost or foreclosed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The alchemical orchard greenhouse is anchored early and sensory details (blooming flowers, mystical tang, glass walls, whispering trees) are present, but they remain largely decorative. The wooden snap is handled twice (grasped, unsnapped) and triggers a cascade, so it functions as micro-setting. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics—trees lean in and walls ripple in response to the knight's actions rather than pressuring them. Spatial choreography is coherent but static; the knight wanders without environmental friction shaping their moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("capture the shape of possibility") is signaled but never tested by on-page opposition or cost. The knight's actions (finding the program, murmuring allegiance, unsnapping the catch) proceed without reversal, resistance, or trade-off; each step succeeds as described with no tightening of options. The "shimmering entity" manifests and merges with the knight without any visible price paid or path foreclosed. Agency is present (the knight initiates actions) but no decision forces a choice between competing goods or unavoidable harms, and the ending celebrates acquisition rather than confronting loss.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>A theme of connection to the unknown and transformation through allegiance is present, but it emerges through direct statement ("their allegiance grew stronger," "capture a piece of the unknown") rather than image and implication. The wooden snap recurs but does not shift meaning at the end; it triggers a mechanism and is then absent from the closure. The final image (knight gazing into endless night, journey far from over) offers mood but no non-literal answer that reweights prior material—there is no conceptual cost or irony to the acquisition of possibility. The puppeteer Lysander remains abstract, never tested as a concept with friction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping, and the knight's withdrawn nature is maintained as a perceptual stance throughout. However, voice lacks distinct texture—diction is generic fantasy register ("otherworldly energy," "ethereal light," "shivering bliss") without character-particular idiom or selective attention shaped by the knight's background. Psychic distance stays consistent but offers no compression or modulation under pressure. No dialogue is present. Filter verbs ("felt," "knew," "seemed") are frequent but do not obscure immediacy enough to penalize heavily at this length.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn are pervasive: "mystical energies" / "mystical atmosphere" / "mystical experimentation"; "shiver ran down their spine" / "shivering bliss"; "murmured allegiance" repeated across six paragraphs without variation. Template cadence appears in runs: "The knight's eyes…," "The knight's voice…," "The knight's fingers…," "The knight's withdrawn nature…" across consecutive paragraphs. Stock metaphors ("ripple like the surface of a pond," "river," "beacon") and elevated diction ("coalesce," "transcended," "crescendo") clash with the limited interiority. The Non-closure Accumulation Cap (−1.5 for two distinct issues: loops + template stems) is applied within Q7, lowering from a base ~6.2 to 4.7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The core premise (withdrawn knight in mystical greenhouse encounters abandoned theater program, murmurs allegiance to puppeteer, triggers reality shift) combines familiar fantasy tropes (withdrawn knight, mystical greenhouse, puppeteer/fate figure, reality-warping artifact) without a fresh synthesis. The ending reaffirms the setup rather than transforming it through a non-obvious choice or irony. Emotional specificity is absent; the knight's "sense of wonder" and "shivering bliss" are generic labels. No turn arises from established character flaw or world constraint; the greenhouse and snap cooperate without resistance, reading as convenience rather than earned inevitability.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The withdrawn knight is present throughout and performs actions (wanders, reads program, murmurs allegiance, unsnaps catch, grasps entity), satisfying setup and closure participation. However, the knight's choices do not create key turns—each action proceeds without reversal or cost, and the withdrawn trait does not constrain or complicate decisions. The knight's agency is initiatory but not tested; removing "withdrawn" would not alter the plot. Beat involvement is substantial (multiple paragraphs) but the knight's internal state does not narrow options or enable tactics under stress. Scored in the functional-but-replaceable band with a small lift for closure presence.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The abandoned marionette theater program appears early (setup gate satisfied) and is handled twice: the knight scans it and later crumples it. The program introduces Lysander's name, which triggers the allegiance, so it enables a causal step (middle development gate satisfied). It is present at closure ("crumpled in their hand") as the knight feels Lysander's presence grow, satisfying the payoff gate. However, the program's meaning does not reweight at the end—it remains a static trigger rather than an object whose significance transforms. It could be replaced with any token bearing a name (a card, a sign, a book) without structural change. Scored in the functional band with two-beat involvement but capped by swappability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The murmured allegiance is signaled early (first third), recurs across multiple beats (middle paragraphs where it "grew louder" and "became a beacon"), and is present at closure ("still echoed through the greenhouse"). It drives at least two beats: the initial murmur triggers reality to shift, and the ongoing chant coalesces mystical energies. The allegiance shapes the knight's stance and connects them to Lysander, so it participates in the ending's transformation. However, the allegiance is never tested by conflicting wants or costs; the knight does not face a choice between allegiance and another value, so the concept does not narrow options. Scored in the 5.0–6.9 band for shaping one key turn and contributing to closure, but capped below 7.0 by lack of causal pressure or trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>"Factually mystical" appears once as a descriptor ("a factually mystical atmosphere that the knight had grown accustomed to") and does not constrain or enable any on-page action. It is label-only, serving as world-building flavor without affecting the knight's choices, the greenhouse's behavior, or the outcome. The attribute is not tested, does not shape tactics, and could be removed without plot impact. Scored in the ornamental band; setup gate is satisfied (first third) but development and payoff gates are missing.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Unsnap" is signaled early (knight grasps the wooden snap with "intricately carved" detail in the first third), executed in the middle ("began to unsnap the wooden catch, releasing a hidden mechanism"), and the release triggers the cascade that coalesces energies and manifests the shimmering entity, so it participates in closure. The action is causally significant: without the unsnap, the shape of possibility does not take form. However, the mechanism is generic—any lock, latch, or seal would serve the same function with minor edits. The unsnap does not impose a visible cost (no injury, effort, or trade-off shown) and the knight's choice to unsnap is not dramatized as a difficult decision. Scored in the 5.0–6.9 band for shaping one key turn and closure linkage, elevated by beat involvement but capped by swappability and lack of felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Through forgotten patterns" appears once in the middle ("the snap's release triggered a cascade of subtle movements") and once implicitly at closure (the trees' "complex dance" and energies coalescing suggest pattern). The method is present but its mechanics are not specified—what makes the patterns "forgotten," how they differ from remembered patterns, or how the knight accesses them is not shown. The method does not shape the knight's attempts or constrain choices; it is a passive effect triggered by the unsnap. Setup and development gates are weakly satisfied (the phrase appears mid-story and describes an outcome), but payoff is implicit rather than active. Scored in the functional band, capped by late signal, summary-only use, and lack of causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The alchemical orchard greenhouse shrouded in endless night is anchored in the opening line and recurs throughout (whispering trees, glass walls, blooming flowers, mystical energies). It provides atmosphere and is present at closure ("gazed out into the endless night"). The greenhouse responds to the knight's actions (trees lean in, walls ripple, golden light erupts), so it participates in the ending. However, the setting does not pressure choices or constrain tactics—the knight wanders freely, and the environment cooperates rather than resisting. The endless night and alchemical nature are descriptive but do not impose a cost (no danger from darkness, no resource scarcity). Scored in the 5.0–6.9 band for shaping one key turn (the environment's mystical energies coalesce) and contributing to closure atmosphere, but capped by lack of tactical friction or choice-shaping pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"As reality shifts" is the prompt's timeframe element, and "reality shifted" / "reality continued to shift" recurs across the middle and ending paragraphs, so setup, development, and payoff gates are satisfied. However, the shifts are described as ongoing and atmospheric rather than as a tightening clock. No deadline or urgency is imposed—the knight has unlimited time to wander, read, murmur, unsnap, and grasp the entity. The shifts do not alter the knight's tactics or force faster decisions; they are effects of the knight's actions rather than external pressure. Scored in the functional band for presence across beats, but capped by lack of time pressure or decision-tightening effect.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"To capture the shape of possibility" is stated early ("they knew they had to capture the shape of possibility") and recurs across the middle and ending (the shape takes form, the knight beholds it, holds it, and it merges with their being). The motivation drives the knight's actions (wandering, murmuring, unsnapping, grasping) and is present at closure ("they had captured a piece of the unknown"). However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized—no scene shows the knight wanting possibility, no friction tests it against a competing desire, and no cost is visible (the knight acquires what they seek without sacrifice). Setup, development, and payoff gates are satisfied, but causal pressure and trade-off are absent. Scored in the 5.0–6.9 band for shaping the arc and contributing to closure, capped by lack of conflicted choice or visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Shivering bliss" appears twice: mid-story ("with a sense of shivering bliss, they reached") and near the end ("The knight's shivering bliss reached a crescendo"). The tone is present and coheres with the mystical, wonder-filled atmosphere, but it does not modulate with pressure—the knight remains in elevated, positive affect throughout without contrast or degradation under stress. The phrase is repeated identically rather than evolving, and the final image ("the knight smiled") shifts to calm satisfaction without carrying the "shivering" quality forward. Setup and development gates are satisfied; payoff is weakly present (the smile suggests bliss). Scored in the functional band for coherence and recurrence, capped by static application and lack of dynamic modulation or closure charge.</comment>
