<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dealer's interiority remains abstract throughout—emotions are "crafted," "woven," labeled as "half truths" without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal competing impulses. The "affectionate detachment" is asserted rather than dramatized through gesture or perception under pressure. No credible cost forecloses a path; the dealer simply "finishes her work" and leaves, with no visible trade-off or renunciation that would signal earned stasis. The fragrance chemist never appears on the page, eliminating relational pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early enough, but no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with legible cost occurs. The dealer completes her task and departs; the grotto "waited" and "remained" in static description. The story presents a single extended tableau without a meaningful tightening, deepening, or reversal that narrows options or changes knowledge. Under any inferred lens (likely Accumulative/Textural given the atmospheric density), closure fails to land with felt or conceptual cost on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The amber grotto receives sustained sensory detail (luminescent stones, honey-like light, aged amber scent, warmth) and recurs throughout, but it never constrains a choice or charges the final image with pressure—it remains postcard description. The petal is handled twice (sensed, then packed), offering minimal spatial constraint. Micro-setting use is present but ornamental, preventing entry to the 9-band despite vivid atmosphere.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—crafting emotions for the fragrance chemist—is signaled early but faces no on-page opposition, cost, or tightening. The dealer simply works, finishes, and leaves without a reversal, complication, or decision that forecloses an option. No escalation occurs under any lens; "half truths" are declared but never tested against a counterpressure. The static emotional arc and absence of agency-driven turns prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme (authenticity versus artifice, insight fused with empathy) is signaled through repeated abstractions—"half truths," "authentic and fabricated," "affectionate detachment"—but these remain label-only without on-page friction. The petal's metaphoric promise ("rooted in something genuine") is stated, not dramatized. The ending offers no resonant reconfiguration or conceptual repricing; the grotto "remained" in thematic echo rather than a non-literal answer. The repeated phrasing borders on sermonizing without scene pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with consistent psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature (the dealer's focus on molecules, static electricity, texture). Diction is controlled and atmospheric. However, reflection dominates without interleaved micro-choices that alter present options, flattening momentum. The lack of dialogue is fine, but the narrator's certainty about the dealer's internal states ("affectionate detachment," "professionally thorough") leans toward exposition rather than showing those qualities through action under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "warm, golden light" / "warm, honey-like light," "emotions she had crafted" appears five times, "luminescent stones" recurs in static description without evolution. Template cadence runs appear in the final third ("The dealer's task was… / She packed… / As she stood… / The dealer's footsteps…"). Figurative language ("tapestry of feeling," "dance of molecules") is stock and does not sharpen under pressure. These artifacts touch the closure beat, disqualifying 9+ globally and triggering mid-band deductions in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The counterfeit-emotion-dealer premise is intriguing but not transformed through specific choices; the grotto, petal, and "half truths" remain abstract tokens. The dealer's process is described in generic terms ("weave," "craft," "fusion") without verifiable detail or fresh inflection. The ending recycles the opening's mood without a non-obvious synthesis or earned surprise. The piece reads as competent execution of a template rather than a singular artistic stance.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Counterfeit emotion dealer is present throughout and frames the premise, but makes no on-page decision that alters tactics or narrows options. Observation and preparation dominate; the "completion" is summarized, not turned into a choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Fragrance chemist's blotter petal appears in two distinct beats (sensed via static electricity, packed in the box) and is invoked thematically in the final third. It enables one action (sensing molecules) and recurs with symbolic weight ("rooted in something genuine"), but does not constrain a middle choice or decisively shape the closure image. Two-gate presence and lyric reprise lift it into mid-band; lack of causal pressure caps it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Half truths appear as theme claim ("half truths she was about to sell," "not lies, exactly") but do not shape on-page tactics or force a trade-off. The concept is told rather than tested against opposition. Present but largely ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Professionally thorough is asserted in the opening line but never constrains or enables an action with visible cost. The dealer's work is described as meticulous, yet no on-page decision dramatizes thoroughness against a competing pressure. Label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Subsume appears once in the reflective block ("learned to subsume her own emotions") as backstory without direct participation in a present choice. The action is told, not dramatized, and could be replaced with "suppress" or "set aside" with no structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Sensing through static electricity appears in one beat (holding the petal) and is referenced in closure-adjacent description, but its mechanics do not constrain attempts or shape a turn. The method is mentioned, not leveraged under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Amber grotto at dusk frames every beat and recurs in the ending image with sensory specificity. It provides atmosphere and a container for reflection but does not constrain a tactical choice or alter outcome. The setting is vivid yet postcard-functional; the final reprise reweights mood slightly, lifting it above purely ornamental use.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>As the transformation completes appears in the third line but is never tracked or used to tighten decisions. No live clock alters tactics; time remains vague ("dusk deepened," "last light") without urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>To fuse insight with empathy is stated once ("driven by a desire to fuse…") as internal motivation but does not generate on-page friction or force a choice between competing goods. The desire is told, not dramatized through conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Affectionate detachment is named once and sustained through the narrator's measured distance and the dealer's observation-without-immersion. Tone modulates subtly (warmth at closure, cooler exterior night) and charges the final image with quiet resonance. Coherent across beats, but the static mood and absence of tonal escalation under pressure prevent higher scoring.</comment>
