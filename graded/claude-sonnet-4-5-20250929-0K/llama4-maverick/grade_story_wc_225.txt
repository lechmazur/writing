<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The tutor's motivation to forgive himself is declared but never tested by contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The labyrinth journey operates as a symbolic pilgrimage where internal shifts are told ("felt a sense of peace settle over him") rather than embodied through micro-choices under pressure. The former student prodigy exists only as summary backstory without altering present options. Emotional progression is summarized in therapeutic language ("weight of his guilt slowly lifting") without the irrational layering or visible cost that would earn the arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test: who/where/when anchors appear early enough. The closure unit is a Decisive Change (tutor emerges reborn, forgiven) but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized—no on-page forfeiture, renunciation, or visible trade-off occurs. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (atmosphere, symbolic labyrinth, pattern of guilt/redemption) but the final deepening is delivered through summary ("finally found a way to forgive himself") rather than a charged image or cadence shift that reweights prior material. Cost proof test fails: no exact sentence shows what the tutor sacrifices or loses to achieve peace.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The time-frozen village, cobblestones, and platinum labyrinth are visually specific but remain postcard backdrops—no environmental feature constrains a choice or supplies a resource that alters outcome. The labyrinth's "twisting passages" are described but never require navigation decisions or embodied struggle. Spatial choreography is vague throughout the walk and interior sequence. The tapestry functions as an informational unlock but is not handled in tactile, lived-in ways that would ground micro-setting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (self-forgiveness) is signaled early but never tightens through a live trade-off or reversal. The tutor decodes the tapestry, walks to the labyrinth, and emerges forgiven in a linear sequence without escalation or cost legibility—no option is foreclosed, no price paid on the page. The labyrinth is described as "a maze of reflections" but no specific choice or renunciation occurs inside. Agency is missing: the resolution arrives through symbolic transit rather than protagonist decision under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme (forgiveness as journey, redemption through self-confrontation) emerges from the premise but is stated rather than dramatized through particulars. The final paragraph moralizes directly: "forgiveness was a journey, not a destination" and "fierce repose, and a deep, abiding peace." The tapestry-as-map metaphor is serviceable but conventional. Thematic resonance is undercut by the explain-everything ending that mechanically resolves ambiguity instead of offering a non-literal answer through image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is weak—the tutor's way of noticing does not reflect chess-tutor specificity or exile's particularity. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("woven hush," "fierce repose") that feels imposed rather than voice-motivated. No dialogue present. Psychic distance is consistent but the prose lacks distinct rhythmic texture; many sentence stems repeat ("As he...," "The tutor...") without purposeful cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Template cadence runs pervade: "As he fidgeted...," "As the tutor worked...," "As he walked...," "As he navigated...," "As he emerged..." across seven sentences triggers −0.6. Paraphrase loops: "woven hush" appears in paragraph 2, 13, and 25 without reweighted meaning; "fierce repose" in paragraphs 16 and 27. Stock metaphors: "weight of his guilt slowly lifting, like the ebbing of a tide" is clichéd. Filter-verb stacks are minimal. Information density is low—many lines rephrase the journey without advancing pressure. Artifacts touch closure (final paragraphs repeat "woven hush," "fierce repose") triggering the −1.7 penalty and global 9+ disqualification.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Core premise (exiled expert decodes artifact to find redemptive labyrinth) follows a familiar template: symbolic quest for self-forgiveness via metaphysical space. The chess-tutor detail and platinum labyrinth offer surface novelty but do not transform the arc—swap "tutor" for "painter" and "labyrinth" for "gallery" and the emotional journey remains unchanged. No bold structural or perspectival risk. The transformation test fails: plot and arc work identically with different nouns.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The exiled chess tutor is named and motivated by past failure but makes no key decision that alters tactics—he decodes, walks, enters, and emerges in a linear path without agency-driven turns. Present in setup, middle (decoding), and closure (emerges forgiven) but his choices do not create reversals. Functional presence without causal pressure or visible cost tied to his decisions.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The platinum labyrinth is revealed at the story's midpoint (paragraph 10), mentioned again as destination (paragraphs 11–14), and entered/exited at closure (paragraphs 15–22, 28). It does not constrain navigation choices or evolve in meaning—it functions as a symbolic threshold rather than an obstacle or tool. Two-beat involvement (reveal, enter/exit) but no causal pressure or specificity that would make it irreplaceable. Late first appearance and ornamental use in closure lower the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>The phrase "woven hush" appears three times (paragraphs 2, 13, 25) as atmospheric description but never shapes stakes or alters tactics on the page. It echoes thematically (stillness, expectation) but does not change options or constrain choices. Ornamental use without causal pressure; swappable with "deep silence" or similar. Present in setup and closure but only as texture.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Fidgets productively" appears once in paragraph 3 as the tutor unravels tapestry threads—it enables the decoding action but the trait itself is not dramatized with visible cost or constraint. The mechanics of fidgeting do not recur or shape later beats. Single-beat involvement, functional but replaceable with "works intently" or similar. No tension between the trait and another need.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Winnow" is named once (paragraph 8) as the tutor separates truth from deception in the tapestry threads. The action is summary-only rather than dramatized beat-by-beat, and the revelation (labyrinth location) is delivered as an outcome rather than a process that shapes attempts. Single-beat involvement; swappable with "decode" or "sift." Does not redefine options or recur with reweighted meaning.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Decoding frayed threads in a tapestry's border is introduced in paragraphs 3–4, executed in paragraphs 5–8, and the result (labyrinth location) shapes the middle journey. The method is signaled early and its mechanics (scanning threads, spotting inconsistencies) are sketched, but the process is summarized rather than dramatized with specific setbacks or trade-offs. Two-beat involvement (decode, result guides walk) but the mechanics do not constrain later attempts or recur at closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The time-frozen village is named in the opening and provides ambient stillness throughout the walk (paragraphs 2, 11–13, 22–23, 26). It supplies the labyrinth's location but does not pressure choices—the tutor walks unimpeded. The village "beginning to stir" at closure (paragraph 22) signals thematic release but does not alter tactics. Functional backdrop with thematic resonance but no causal constraint or resource role.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"During the lull of distant thunder" is mentioned in paragraphs 1–2 and echoed at closure (paragraph 22: "distant thunder now a gentle rumble"). Time is static rather than tracked—no sense of urgency, no clock that tightens decisions. The lull functions as mood rather than a ticking constraint. Lyric reprise at closure but no middle development or pressure on tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The motivation to forgive himself for past mistakes is declared in paragraphs 5–6 (haunted by former student's loss), drives the decoding and labyrinth journey (paragraphs 7–21), and is resolved at closure (paragraphs 21–24: "finally found a way to forgive himself"). Present across all three beats but the friction between the want (forgiveness) and cost is told rather than dramatized—no on-page choice where self-forgiveness competes with another need. Functional spine without embodied conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Fierce repose" is named twice (paragraphs 16, 27) as a descriptor of the tutor's final state. Tone is contemplative and elegiac throughout but does not modulate with pressure—emotional intensity remains flat across decoding, walking, and emerging. The phrase charges the final image thematically but the tone itself is static rather than coherent through turns. Lyric reprise without dynamic range or escalation.</comment>
