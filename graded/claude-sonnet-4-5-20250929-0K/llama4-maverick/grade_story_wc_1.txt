<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The glass artist remains a vessel for abstraction rather than a character with contradictory impulses acting in scene. Interiority consists of label-only feelings ("sense of disorientation," "sense of clarity") and stock bodily clichés without embodied particularity. The final "smile" and discovered purpose arrive without prior causal struggle—no micro-choices reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Therapy-speak ("discover purpose in the pauses") and diagnostic self-awareness pervade peak moments where embodied cost should dominate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive promptly, but the piece lacks a legible drive lens—neither causal linkage nor accumulative pattern is taught by midpoint, creating drift between lyric description and vague discovery. The ending offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (the artist claims new purpose), but cost remains asserted rather than dramatized: no visible forfeiture, no option foreclosed on the page. The ledger strip discovery and frost observation do not narrow tactics or change knowledge in a way that alters her stance with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The canyon setting anchors space and time cleanly, and sensory details (frost patterns, starlight, crisp air) are vivid and purposeful. However, the environment never constrains a choice or supplies a resource that affects outcome—frost "guides" her walk but does not alter tactics or charge the final image with concrete pressure. Micro-setting potential (body, ledger strip as tool) remains ornamental; the strip is unrolled and pondered but does not impose spatial or tactile friction that shapes her decisions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("discover purpose") is signaled early but remains abstract and never faces a concrete on-page test. No tightening narrows options: the ledger strip reveals "a hidden message," she decides to retrace steps, frost "guides" her, and clarity "emerges"—all passive receivership without agency-driven reversal or visible cost. Coincidence (frost patterns echoing the code) complicates without pressure, and the resolution ("she had finally found her way") is declared rather than earned by a choice that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Theme ("purpose in pauses," legacy, stillness as crucible) is stated rather than emergent from concrete action. The final image—standing in dawn light, "world…a source of peace"—offers a tidy moral summary instead of a resonant, non-literal answer. Thematic Echo appears throughout ("to discover purpose in the pauses," "drifting resonance") and peaks in the final third with explicit thesis statements: "she felt an overwhelming desire to discover purpose in the pauses" and "the pauses would forever be a source of inspiration." The ledger strip and frost could anchor specificity but remain symbolic conveniences introduced to harvest thematic points.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Narrative stance is consistent and the piece maintains stable third-person limited focalization with no head-hopping. However, perceptual signature is generic—the artist notices in catalog fashion (canyon, frost, stars) without character-specific bias. Diction drifts into elevated register ("drifting resonance," "crucible," "ethereal light") that clashes with concrete scene action, especially during purported moments of discovery. Filter verbs and expository interiority ("she felt," "she knew") dull immediacy throughout, and the voice reads as committee consensus rather than a singular perspective.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "sense of disorientation" / "scorched testament" / "fragility and beauty" recur without added pressure; "stillness" and "pauses" are restated across multiple beats. Template cadence runs: "She felt…she felt…she knew…she felt" stacks across the final third. Stock metaphors ("world seemed to hold its breath," "crucible") and therapy-speak labels ("discover purpose in the pauses") dull peak beats. The Text-Artifact Screen triggers −0.8 for loops touching the closure paragraph, and register drift into abstract diction (e.g., "drifting resonance of her surroundings") adds −0.4.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The premise—artist seeks ancestral legacy via cryptic ledger—is template-familiar and not transformed through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The "hidden message encoded in charcoal marks" and "frost patterns as hidden language" are stock symbolic conveniences. No fresh inflection: the arc (disorientation → discovery → peace) follows a median path without risk or particularity. The transformation test fails: swapping "glass artist" and "charcoal ledger" for any craft and artifact leaves the emotional arc unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The glass artist is present throughout and frames the story, but her choices do not create key turns—she observes, ponders, and "decides to retrace," all passive receivership. No decision alters tactics or stakes; the final "smile" and sense of peace arrive without a prior forfeiture or choice that narrows options. Setup and closure participation are present, but middle development lacks agency-driven pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The ledger strip appears early (setup), is unrolled and examined (one beat), and is mentioned again near the end as "a key to unlocking her true potential" (closure participation). However, it is never used in a second distinct beat—no handling or reweighted interaction. The strip's "hidden message" is declared but never decoded on the page, so it does not constrain or enable tactics. Swappable with any cryptic heirloom.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Scorched testament" appears twice as a metaphor for fragility and memory but never shapes stakes or tactics on the page. It functions as thematic decoration rather than a concept that changes options or imposes cost. No choice hinges on "scorched" logic; the term could be replaced with "fragile legacy" without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Steadily adaptive" is a label-only trait mentioned once without constraining or enabling an on-page action. No visible tradeoff or cost demonstrates adaptability under pressure. The artist adjusts to "twists and turns" in summary, not through a specific choice where the trait matters.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Retrace" appears early ("decided to retrace the steps of her ancestors") and is mentioned again at the end ("retrace the steps of her ancestors"). However, no on-page retracing occurs—no journey, no discovery beat where following a path alters tactics. The action is declared intention rather than dramatized movement. Setup and closure participation are present, but middle development is absent, capping the score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Frost patterns appear in the first third ("morning frost was beginning to etch"), guide her walk in the middle ("patterns in the morning frost guiding her"), and are carried into the final image ("patterns in the morning frost still etched in her mind"). However, the mechanics are vague—how the patterns "guide" or encode information is never shown. The method is signaled but does not shape attempts or constrain tactics with specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The canyon is anchored early, provides atmospheric detail throughout, and frames the final image at sunrise. However, it never pressures a choice or supplies a resource that affects outcome. The setting is consistent and vivid but remains postcard description rather than micro-setting that alters tactics. The lyric reprise (stars at open → sunrise at close) reweights the mood but does not impose cost.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"After surviving the attempt" anchors the story in a post-crisis timeframe and signals backstory, but the phrase does not tighten decisions or tactics on the page. No live clock pressures her; she ponders, walks, and discovers at leisure. The timeframe functions as setup context but does not constrain or escalate present action.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"To discover purpose in the pauses" is stated explicitly multiple times as her desire but remains abstract and never faces friction or trade-off. No competing want or fear creates tension; she simply receives insights passively. The motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Drifting resonance" appears as a phrase twice and the tone attempts a lyric, meditative quality throughout. Tone is coherent but static—no modulation with pressure, as there is no escalation. The final image (dawn, peace, gratitude) sustains the ethereal register but does not charge it with cost or reweight prior tension, since none was built.</comment>
