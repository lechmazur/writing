<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Kael's motivation to understand time dilation is asserted but never dramatized through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The "serene anger" remains a label without embodied tension; we get stock gestures (narrowed eyes, gentle hand) rather than character-particular reactions. The missing person is a cipher—no agency, no resistance, no friction. The final "bond forged in the fire of curiosity and discovery" is declared rather than earned through on-page cost or struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The closure unit attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via shared understanding of time's slowing, but the cost is entirely abstract—no visible forfeiture, no path foreclosed. Orientation is delayed: "wind-carved encampment" and "after the eclipse ends" provide minimal anchor, and we never learn where this is or why these two people matter until the final third. The causal chain is thin: Kael follows ink patterns, crests a ridge, touches a shoulder, and suddenly achieves metaphysical insight without any tightening or reversal. The "moment" when "time seemed to slow" at contact is asserted, not demonstrated through changed options or knowledge.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Wind-carved encampment," "rocky outcroppings," and "precipice" offer visual placeholders without spatial coherence or sensory texture beyond sight. The disappearing ink on rock is the sole tactile detail that might constrain action, but it fades passively rather than forcing a choice. The final "soft, ethereal light" is generic atmosphere. No detail—terrain, tool, or body—meaningfully narrows Kael's options or charges the ending image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The stated stake—understanding time dilation—is philosophical rather than situational, and no cost accrues when Kael "finds" the answer. There is no on-page reversal: Kael tracks, approaches, touches, and receives insight in a smooth glide. The missing person offers zero resistance or complication. The "glimpse into the mystery" is handed over in a single beat without tightening, trade-off, or visible price. Agency is observation, not decision that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The theme—time's slowing in crisis—is declared in exposition rather than emerging from image or action. The disappearing ink might serve as metaphor for ephemerality, but its thematic weight is told ("ephemeral patterns") not shown through consequence. The ending offers a stated "tale of patterns and time" rather than a resonant image that reweights prior material. "Serene anger" and "bond forged" are abstract claims unsupported by concrete particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, but perceptual signature is generic: "eyes scanned," "mind racing," "senses on high alert" are stock filters. Diction occasionally lifts into elevated register ("enigmatic smile," "ethereal light") without clear motivation from Kael's tracker background. The prose reads as neutral-literary rather than character-particular. No dialogue appears to test voice distinction. Distance control is consistent but lacks intensity modulation under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "the world around them dissolving into a sea of uncertainty" followed by "bond forged in the fire of curiosity and discovery" recycles abstraction without advancing knowledge. Template cadence in the opening: "scanned… searching… moved… darting." Stock constructions dominate peak beats: "eyes narrowed," "eyes locked," "world seemed to expand." Figurative language is generic ("sea of uncertainty," "fire of curiosity") and contradictory (fire/sea). Rhythm is uniform; no sentence-level propulsion. Closure is softened by stacked abstractions rather than a concrete image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The tracker-finds-missing-person frame is familiar; the "time slows in crisis" premise borders on writing-prompt template. Disappearing ink and artificial hummingbird offer surface novelty but function as plot conveniences rather than constraints that deepen character or theme. The resolution—standing together, shared understanding—echoes countless epiphany endings. No bold structural or perspectival risk; the emotional arc could transfer to any protagonist without material change.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Kael is the POV throughout and makes tracking decisions, but the albino trait is ornamental—mentioned once in the opening and never constraining or enabling a choice. The tracker role is functional (follows ink patterns, uses the drone) but replaceable with any investigator archetype. Late in setup (~15% mark after the eclipse/encampment anchor), but present across beats. Swappable; no unique properties tied to albinism or tracking skill shape the ending.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The drone appears in three beats: comforting presence, picks up a disturbance, settles on Kael's shoulder at the end. It enables one middle choice (following the air disturbance) but resolves no problem it helped create. Setup is early (~20%). Closure participation is a cameo ("settled onto Kael's shoulder") without causal weight. Functional but largely swappable with any tracking tool; its "iridescent feathers" are decorative.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Disappearing ink shapes the tracking method (ephemeral patterns on ground) and appears at setup, middle (Kael examines the smudge, follows faint remnants), and ending (the missing person is "surrounded by a faint aura"). It constrains one tactic—Kael must follow fading clues—and charges the final image when the person "had become one with the ephemeral patterns." Two beats plus closure linkage. Introduces a cost (difficulty of tracking) and irreplaceability is moderate (the vanishing property matters). However, late first concrete use (~25%) and the ending aura is more metaphor than mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Consciously wild" hair is label-only, mentioned once in paragraph three as a visual descriptor. It does not constrain or enable any action, carry cost, or return. No middle development, no closure participation. Ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The missing person's act of disappearing (via ink patterns) is the inciting problem and frames Kael's entire tracking effort. It appears at setup (Kael searches for "the missing person"), is explained in the middle (patterns used to vanish), and is resolved when Kael finds them at the precipice. The action is central to the plot's causal chain and not easily swappable. However, the act itself happens off-page before the story opens, so on-page presence is indirect. Two gates (setup as premise, middle as mechanics, payoff as discovery) plus causal pressure, but no direct dramatization of the disappearing act itself.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The method—ephemeral patterns in spilled ink—is signaled early (smudge on rock, fading patterns on ground) and explains how the missing person vanished. Kael uses this knowledge to follow the trail. Setup ~30%, middle beat (Kael examines and follows), and it informs the ending image (person surrounded by ink aura). It shapes one tactic (tracking fading clues) but mechanics are vague ("managed to vanish into the rocky landscape"). Functional but the final aura is metaphorical rather than mechanical. Two beats plus thematic closure echo; moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The wind-carved encampment is named in the opening line and again at the very end ("wind-carved encampment was bathed in a soft, ethereal light"), creating a lyric frame. Rocky outcroppings and precipice provide minimal spatial detail but do not constrain choice—Kael moves freely. The setting is backdrop; no resource, access, or proximity alters tactics. Setup and closure presence via reprise, but no middle development. Swappable with any desolate landscape; no unique properties matter.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"After the eclipse ends" anchors the opening and is referenced once more ("the experience of time dilation during the eclipse had been particularly intense"), but the timeframe does not tighten decisions or impose a clock. The eclipse is past; no urgency or deadline shapes Kael's tracking. Setup only, no middle or closure pressure. Ornamental temporal marker.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Kael's motivation—to understand why time slows in crisis—is stated explicitly in the middle third and frames the thematic resolution when Kael finds "a glimpse into the mystery of time's slowing." It appears at setup (implicit in "turmoil within Kael"), middle (direct statement of the desire), and ending (achieved insight). However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicting choices or visible cost. No on-page friction between this want and another need. Functional presence across three beats, but execution is summary-only.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Serene anger" is named once in the middle ("growing sense of serene anger") and echoed at the ending when Kael's "serene anger simmered just below the surface" before the gentle touch. It does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image—Kael's actions (quiet approach, gentle hand) read as calm throughout, and the "anger" is unearned by prior friction. Label-only; no embodied contradiction or tonal shift. Setup and ending mention, no middle development of the tone's duality.</comment>
