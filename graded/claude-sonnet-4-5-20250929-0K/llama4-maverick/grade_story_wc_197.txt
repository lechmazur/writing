<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Aria remains entirely abstract—described through generic rebel traits ("carefully resourceful," "underestimated") without contradictory impulses or embodied emotion. Her "motivation" is told in sweeping abstractions ("resist the creeping indifference") rather than dramatized through on-page choices with felt cost. The gathering scene offers no internal conflict or micro-choice that reveals hierarchy of values; she arrives, speaks, smiles, and vanishes without visible friction or change. No genuine stake is tested; the character reads as a prompt-assembled symbol rather than a person under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>No on-page closure: Aria's situation at dawn is identical to her situation at the story's opening—she holds the key, believes in resistance, and walks away. The "gathering" beat offers no reversal, tightening, or cost; allies appear, she shares her tale, they disperse. Orientation is delayed (who/where/when unclear until ~15% in) but eventually lands; however, the structural issue is terminal—there is no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with legible cost. The piece reads as atmosphere and exposition rather than a pressured sequence with causally linked turns.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The auric lagoon is rendered with vivid sensory detail (shimmer, starlight, luminescent orbs, lapping water), and the setting is named early. However, it functions as backdrop rather than constraint: no environmental feature shapes a choice or alters tactics. The phone booth key and worn-leather map are described but never used in action; the clearing and reeds do not pressure the gathering or the ending. Micro-setting and object-as-setting tests fail—nothing about place or tool charges the final image or narrows options.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("resist tyranny of indifference") is declared but never tested on the page. No reversal or tightening occurs; Aria walks to the lagoon, finds allies, speaks, and departs without opposition, cost, or altered options. The "plans unravel" timeframe is told but not dramatized—nothing fractures, no tactic fails, no price is paid. Coincidence assembles the gathering; protagonist agency is absent. Zero escalation under any lens; pressure remains static from first to last line.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme ("revised histories," resistance against erasure) is asserted repeatedly in abstract language rather than emerging from concrete action. The phone booth key is presented as a "symbol" and told to represent stories, but it never constrains a choice or shifts meaning through use. No earned insight or non-literal final image—Aria's smile and vanishing are summary gestures, not resonant reconfiguration. The piece reads as a thematic manifesto with illustrative dressing rather than a story that earns its concept through pressure and cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent but generic—"testament to the spirit of resistance," "fabric of the established order," "beacon of hope"—reads as placeholder literary voice rather than character-specific perception. No dialogue appears (cannot assess naturalism or subtext). Filter verbs and stock phrases ("she knew," "she felt") flatten immediacy. Perceptual signature is absent; Aria's way of noticing is indistinguishable from a consensus narrator.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Pervasive paraphrase loops and scaffold: "revised histories" recurs five times with synonym churn; "resistance/rebel/defiance" cycles without added detail. Template cadence in the final third: "As she spoke… As they dispersed… And as the first light…" Figurative language stacks without pattern payoff ("beacon," "canvas," "tapestry" metaphors for memory/history blur together). Stock phrases dominate peak beats: "hold the line," "reclaim their narratives," "weave a new narrative." Orientation completes by ~15%, but clarity at closure is dulled by repetitive phrasing. Artifacts touch the ending (−1.7 guideline).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Core premise (underestimated rebel with symbolic relic gathering allies under starlight) follows a familiar template without fresh synthesis. The phone booth key, auric lagoon, and "coded freedom" are named but function as ornamental quirks rather than driving specific, non-obvious choices. Emotional arc is generic (belief → action → resolve) and could transfer unchanged to any resistance narrative. No turn or final reconfiguration grows inevitably from prior particulars; the piece reads as a competent assembly of assigned elements rather than a singular artistic vision.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Aria is present throughout and labeled "underestimated rebel," but makes no on-page decision that alters tactics or options. She walks to the lagoon, speaks, and departs; all moves are declarative summary. No reversal or cost tied to her agency. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The phone booth key is named in paragraph one, clutched at the gathering, mentioned as "still clutched" at dawn—three static mentions without functional use. It is told to symbolize resistance but never handled in action, never enables or constrains a choice, never shifts meaning through reprise. Swappable with any talisman; no specificity matters.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Revised histories" appears in six paragraphs as thematic echo (keeper, gathering testament, canvas metaphor, Aria's tale of erased histories, "rewrite" plan, final sanctuary). It is told to matter but does not shape on-page stakes or tactics. No choice hinges on revision versus preservation; the concept is claimed, not dramatized. Present but abstracted.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Carefully resourceful" is stated once as a label; Aria's collection habit is told in exposition but no on-page action demonstrates resourcefulness under pressure. The map and key are carried but never used to solve a problem or impose a tradeoff. Trait exists as assertion without visible cost or enabling moment.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Reappear" is named once ("time to reappear") after Aria has been in hiding, and she does emerge at the gathering. However, the act of surfacing carries no dramatized risk or consequence; allies welcome her, no authority threatens. The action is present and temporally central but functionally replaceable—she could simply "arrive" with the same outcome. Mid-functional.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>The puddle-reflection map is introduced in one sentence, described as guiding Aria, but its mechanics are never shown. We do not see her consult it, decode reflections, or adjust course based on its input. It appears as atmospheric setup and does not constrain or enable a middle or final choice. Ornamental mention.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The auric lagoon under starlight is named in the opening line and revisited at closure ("remained a sanctuary," "shimmered with otherworldly glow"). Sensory detail (water lapping, luminescent orbs, reeds) is vivid. However, no environmental feature pressures a choice or alters tactics—it is stage rather than actor. The early–final reprise reweights mood but not stake or cost; lyric resonance is present but causal pressure is absent. Near the threshold for purposeful frame.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"When plans unravel" is stated as the trigger for action, and "the night deepened" / "first light of dawn" bookend the sequence. However, no on-page unraveling is dramatized—nothing fractures, no deadline tightens decisions. The timeframe is told rather than tracked with pressure. Present as narrative marker but does not alter moves or impose urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"To hold the line against the tyranny of indifference" is articulated explicitly and recurs ("held the line, for now" near the end). Aria's actions (gathering, speaking, remaining) align with this desire. However, the motivation is never conflicted or tested—no moment shows indifference threatening to win, no tradeoff between resistance and safety. The want is asserted and static; dramatization and cost are missing.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"Coded freedom" is named once ("the tone of coded freedom, a language understood by those who listened") and echoed in "coded messages" near the end. Tone remains consistently elevated, mystical, and declarative throughout—no modulation under pressure, no dissonance or irony. The notion of a hidden language is told but not demonstrated in diction or rhythm. Present as thematic label; coherence is static rather than charged at closure.</comment>
