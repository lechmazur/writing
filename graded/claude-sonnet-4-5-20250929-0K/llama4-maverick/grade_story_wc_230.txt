<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The forager's "involuntarily truthful nature" is told as backstory rather than tested on-page; no scene forces them to speak truth with visible cost. Interiority relies on abstract labels ("unease," "resolve," "fractured grace") rather than embodied contradiction. The motivation to "cultivate psychological safety" is declared but never dramatized through a choice that forecloses another path. The final walk-away lacks earned causality—no prior action by the forager creates the conditions they're leaving.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>No clear closure unit: the forager discovers cures, experiments (off-page), then walks away with "resolve" but no visible cost or decisive change in options. The dominant stake—whether to use the cures—is never tested in scene. Orientation is delayed: the empathy virus premise and the forager's affliction are not anchored until deep into the story, and their connection to present action remains abstract. The lens reads as attempted Accumulative/Textural, but no pattern is taught early or paid off with a cadence shift that reweights the stake.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The storm-battered orchard and ravine are described vividly but never constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—the forager navigates "with ease." The antique glass eye and tattered textbook appear as discoveries but their physical properties don't affect tactics. Sensory detail (twisted trees, tangled undergrowth, damp soil) is present and filtered through the forager's perspective, grounding the reader in place, but remains ornamental to the pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The stated stake—experimenting with rumored cures to temper involuntary honesty—is introduced late and never tested on-page. No reversal or tightening: the forager finds the glass eye, finds the cache, reads the book, and leaves; each beat adds information but no narrowing of options or trade-off. The "dark history" of the relic is summarized, not dramatized. Agency is observational; the decision to "continue to cultivate psychological safety" is asserted in the ending without visible cost or a prior choice that forecloses another path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Theme—empathy's cost, individuality versus collective feeling—is stated directly ("pursuit of empathy had been taken too far") rather than emerging from concrete events. The phrase "fractured grace" recurs but remains abstract; no image reweights it with new pressure. The final paragraph moralizes ("testament to the enduring power of nature and the human spirit") instead of offering a resonant non-literal answer. Subtext is minimal; the forager's internal conflict between rationality and emotional trauma is told rather than enacted through contradictory choices.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present but generic: the forager notices "intricate details," "cryptic messages," "obscure remedies" without character-specific filtering. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("catastrophic loss of individuality," "fractured state of their own psyche") that feels authorial rather than focalizer-bound. Psychic distance modulates purposefully at the ending ("the forager knew"), but the voice lacks the rational, smell-driven specificity promised by the premise. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Sentence openings are varied and rhythm supports mood. Heavy paraphrase loops: "fractured grace" appears twice in nearly identical phrasing, "cultivate psychological safety" recurs without reweighting, and the empathy-virus premise is restated multiple times across paragraphs. Template cadence in the middle third: "As they [verb]" and "Their [noun]" stems repeat. Stock metaphors ("tangled undergrowth," "storm clouds gathering") and therapy-speak ("trauma," "psychological safety," "emotional scars") flatten peak beats. Clarity is maintained but information density is low; many sentences restate rather than advance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The empathy-virus premise is intriguing but underdeveloped; the forager's journey mirrors familiar discovery-quest templates (find relic, find book, gain knowledge, leave changed). The "involuntarily truthful" trait and truffle-foraging occupation are mentioned but not leveraged for fresh inflection. The final image—walking into rain with a stowed eye—echoes archetypal closure without transformation. "Fractured grace" as a phrase aims for originality but remains abstract. No bold structural or perspectival risk that heightens stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>The rational truffle forager is the POV but makes no key turn; they observe, discover, and leave without a choice that narrows options. Their rationality and keen sense of smell are mentioned but never applied to solve a problem or create pressure. Present throughout but passive.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The antique glass eye appears in two beats (discovery, final stow) but its function is symbolic rather than causal. It's "a component of a smuggled relic" but this property never alters tactics. The final mention ("safely stowed away") recurs but does not reweight prior material with new cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The smuggled relic frames the discovery but its status as smuggled or its connection to the empathy virus is summarized, not shown to change on-page options. The forager pieces together its history off-page. Present and functional but replaceable with any mysterious artifact.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Involuntarily truthful is mentioned as a childhood affliction that made the forager an outcast and granted "unique perspective," but no scene forces them to speak truth under pressure with visible cost. It compels acknowledgment of unease (internal only) but never constrains an external action. Label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>Occlude appears once ("methods to occlude the emotional scars") as the function of the cures. No on-page action of occlusion; the forager intends to use the cures but does not attempt one in scene. Swappable with "suppress" or "mask" without impact.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Rumored cures in discredited textbooks are discovered in the hidden cache and read; the method is signaled. The forager begins to "experiment" but this occurs off-page between paragraphs. The mechanics (how the cures work) are not shown to matter or shape a failed/successful attempt. Functional but not integrated into closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The hanging orchard in a ravine battered by storms is the setting throughout and described with vivid decay (twisted trees, tangled undergrowth). The forager navigates it "with ease," so it does not constrain their search. The storm intensifies at the end and "the trees creaked in response," mirroring internal turmoil—a purposeful resonance that contributes to tone and the final image. Present early, returns at closure with reweighted meaning, but no mechanical pressure on tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>After the empathy virus frames the world as "scarred" and the orchard as changed, but the timeframe does not create urgency or tighten decisions. The empathy virus is referenced as past catastrophe; no present ticking clock. The storms are atmospheric rather than a temporal constraint. Present as setup and context but does not shape escalation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>To cultivate psychological safety is stated as the forager's motivation twice. It drives their interest in the cures but is never dramatized in a scene where it conflicts with another want or cost. The final resolve to "forge a new path" echoes this motivation but remains told rather than tested. Declared, not enacted.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Fractured grace appears as a phrase twice and is enacted through the imagery of the battered orchard and the forager's "fractured state." Tone is melancholic and coherent, modulating with the intensifying storm at the end. The final image charges the phrase with the rain and vanishing, lifting it from abstraction to embodied closure moment. Lyric resonance without mid-scene mechanical use qualifies for mid-band.</comment>
