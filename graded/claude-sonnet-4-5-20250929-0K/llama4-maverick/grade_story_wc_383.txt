<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lyra's motivation to "translate isolation into independence" is declared but never tested through contradictory impulses in scene. The seashell unlocks memories in a passive reception rather than through difficult choice; she "felt an inexplicable connection" and "decided to archive" without visible cost or competing desires. Interiority relies on abstract labels ("profound longing," "ghostly resolve") rather than embodied contradiction. The transformation from isolation to independence occurs through summary across "days that followed" rather than a single on-page choice that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early enough, but the closure unit lacks on-page cost. Lyra walks out "changed" and "stronger" in the final third, yet no specific forfeiture, trade-off, or visible price appears in the ending image—only assertion ("her sense of independence forged"). The retrospective summary ("In the days that followed") displaces the decisive moment off-page. Because/therefore linkage is present (seashell whispers → memory recovery → decision to leave), but the final beat offers declaration rather than a felt reconfiguration, failing the cost-proof test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The velvet garden at twilight is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (shadows "like ethereal ballerinas," "velvet flowers"), but it functions primarily as backdrop. The seashell—discovered among the flowers, held on a bench, carried out—operates as setting-proxy and constrains one micro-choice (to sit and listen), meeting the micro-setting allowance. However, the garden does not pressure the final decision to leave; Lyra's transformation occurs through internal summary rather than spatial constraint or resource.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (reclaim suppressed memories) is signaled early, but escalation is passive: Lyra listens, memories "begin to unravel," and resolve "forms within her" without a tightening choice that narrows options. The peak moment—deciding to archive the whispers—occurs midway and does not force a trade-off; the memories arrive as gift rather than cost. The ending asserts transformation ("emerged stronger") across off-page days, displacing the pressure point. One micro-turn (sit and listen) does not constitute meaningful escalation under causal lens expectations.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Theme (isolation to independence, memory as key to selfhood) is coherent and emerges from the seashell motif, but the final paragraphs state it directly: "Lyra's story was one of transformation, a journey from isolation to independence." The closing image (walking into morning light) offers visual beauty without reweighting prior material through a non-literal answer. Recurrence of the seashell and garden is present but operates as decorative reprise rather than a charged reconception with undeniable cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and distance is consistent, with no head-hopping. However, diction drifts into elevated literary register ("ethereal ballerinas," "tragically radiant beauty," "quarantined memory") that reads authorial rather than character-specific. Lyra's perceptual signature is generic; "charmed skeptic" label does not manifest in distinct idiom or biased noticing. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed") cluster without voice motivation, dulling immediacy in several beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "whispers… whispers… whispers" across adjacent lines; "memories… memories… recollections… memories" in successive paragraphs; "resolve… resolve… resolve" in the final third. Template cadence dominates the ending: "Lyra's story was… Lyra's heart remained… Lyra emerged… The whispering seashell half had been…" Stock metaphors ("beacon," "key," "threshold," "fire of her memories") cluster without fresh embodiment. These artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering the −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The core premise—magical object unlocks suppressed memories leading to self-discovery—is a widely used template without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The garden, seashell, and memory-recovery arc could swap into many similar stories with minor edits. Emotional progression follows a predictable trajectory (discovery → catharsis → resolve → hope) without contradiction or a fresh inflection that reweights expectations. No bold structural or perspectival risk elevates the familiar material.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Lyra (charmed skeptic) is present throughout and makes two micro-decisions (examine seashell, sit to listen), but neither creates a key turn with visible cost. The skepticism label does not constrain her immediate acceptance of the seashell's allure. Observation dominates; the final departure is asserted across off-page "days" rather than dramatized in a closure choice. Present and logically consistent, but easily replaceable with a different character trait.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The whispering seashell half is handled in multiple beats (discovered, held in palm, listened to on bench, carried out, remains silent afterward) and its state evolves (whispers → grows louder → silent). It seeds expectation early, enables the memory-unlocking action, and reappears in the final image. However, it does not constrain a difficult choice or create visible cost; Lyra's transformation would function similarly with any memory-triggering artifact. Present across setup, development, and payoff, but swappable without breaking story logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Quarantined memory is named once ("a piece of her own quarantined memory") and thematically echoed ("memories she had suppressed," "no longer quarantined"), but it does not shape on-page tactics or narrow options. The concept functions as label rather than constraint; the memories arrive passively when Lyra listens, without a locked-door problem or cost to breach the quarantine. Mentioned but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>Tragically radiant appears once as description ("The seashell's tragically radiant beauty seemed to be a beacon") without constraining or enabling action. The attribute is a visual claim, not a tradeoff or cost-bearing trait. It does not recur or shape any choice. Ornamental mention only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Archive (Lyra "decided to archive the seashell's whispers") is the pivotal action that triggers memory recovery. It appears at the one-third mark, drives the central beat (sitting, listening, memories unraveling), and informs the ending (seashell "now silent" as tangible connection). However, the mechanics are vague—archive via "resonance structures" is asserted but not shown—and the action is easily swappable with "decode," "listen to," or "record." Causal role in one major beat, purposeful reprise, but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>Through resonance structures is mentioned once ("focused on the seashell's resonance through resonance structures") without explanation or mechanics. The method does not shape attempts, constrain failure, or differentiate this unlocking from generic listening. It reads as decorative jargon. Present but non-functional.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Velvet garden at twilight is vividly described and frames the entire piece (opening and closing images). It supplies the seashell (buried among flowers) and a bench for the listening beat, meeting setup and development gates. However, it does not pressure Lyra's choice to leave or alter her tactics; the transformation occurs internally via memory rather than through environmental constraint. The garden's final personification ("seemed to whisper its own farewell") is lyric reprise but does not reweight the stake with cost. Functional across two beats but replaceable with another contemplative locale.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>When the last star fades into morning light is signaled early ("last remnants of daylight faded") and returns at closure ("last star faded into morning light," "first light of dawn"). However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions; Lyra listens "as the night deepened" without a clock forcing choice, and the ending spans "days that followed." The dawn arrival is atmospheric rather than a tactical constraint. Lyric bookend without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>To translate isolation into independence is stated explicitly ("Lyra's motivation to translate her isolation into independence had driven her to seek out the truth") and the ending asserts achievement ("her sense of independence forged"). The desire is present but not dramatized through conflicting wants or visible costs; Lyra does not sacrifice connection, risk misunderstanding, or pay a price to pursue independence—she simply receives memories and walks away. Told rather than tested in friction. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Ghostly resolve is named twice ("A ghostly resolve that was both haunting and liberating," "The ghostly resolve that had formed within her continued to guide her") and the tone modulates from melancholy ("soft, melancholic whispers") through catharsis to hope ("heart filled with a sense of hope"). The adjective "ghostly" coheres with twilight and fading imagery, charging the final morning-light contrast. However, the tone does not constrain a choice or create pressure—it accompanies rather than tests resolve. Present across setup and ending, purposeful modulation, but not essential to the closure's logic.</comment>
