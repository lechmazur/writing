<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The protagonist exists as a vehicle for reflection rather than a character with embodied choice under pressure. Interiority consists of abstract meditation ("geography of healing," "lonesome splendor") without contradictory impulses or micro-decisions that foreclose options. The weft-thread moment offers potential for choice but dissolves into passive observation; the thread snaps on its own, not through the protagonist's agency. No visible cost or renunciation emerges—only declared understanding without dramatized struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration through the thread-snap and "peace" declaration, but no before/after stance is legible because no prior choice or pressure has been established. The piece operates in pure reflection mode without a dominant stake tested on the page. Orientation anchors who and where by the garden, but "after the last ship" remains decorative rather than a constraint that narrows options. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural intent, yet no pattern break or cadence shift reweights material with cost—only assertion of transformation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The shadowed autumn garden supplies vivid sensory detail (damp earth, decaying leaves, lunar glow transformation) and the carpet/thread functions as a recurring object. However, the garden does not constrain a single choice or alter tactics; it remains backdrop for meditation. The carpet is handled (touched, clutched) but does not enable or block an action with consequence. Micro-setting potential exists but is not leveraged for pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>No dominant stake is dramatized. The protagonist seeks "to understand the geography of healing," but this remains abstract and untested; no reversal, tightening, or deepening occurs because no live option is ever at risk. The thread snaps by itself rather than through protagonist decision, eliminating agency. Without a coherent stake or escalation under any lens, conflict cannot register.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme of healing/connection emerges through the garden, thread, and obituary motif, and the piece avoids overt moralizing. The final image (thread snap, peace) attempts non-literal resonance but lacks prior causal weight—no concrete struggle has occurred to charge the moment. The "lonesome splendor" phrase and "geography of healing" tilt toward prompt-echo abstraction rather than earned wisdom from particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains a lyric, meditative register with consistent psychic distance and purposeful compression. Diction is controlled and POV-stable; no head-hopping. However, vocabulary occasionally drifts toward elevated abstraction ("morbid perfume," "cathartic release," "otherworldly music") that flattens immediacy under what should be peak moments. The obituary-writing conceit is mentioned but not enacted on the page with distinct perceptual signature.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "silence…echoed," "fading light…melancholic shadows," "lonesome splendor…haunting and redemptive" restate mood without advancing pressure. Template cadence runs dominate ("As I…," "The…," "I felt…") across consecutive paragraphs. Stock metaphors (silence as "mournful sigh," thread as "fragile connections") and filter-verb stacks ("seemed to," "felt a sense of," "seemed to symbolize") dull immediacy throughout. Multiple artifacts touch the closure beat (final paragraph filter verbs and synonym churn), triggering the disallow-9+ clause globally and the −1.7 artifact penalty here.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The obituary-for-the-living conceit offers a fresh premise, but the story does not transform it through on-page action—no obituary is written in scene, no specific lived detail dramatizes the process. The thread/garden/healing structure follows a recognizable lyric-meditation template without a non-obvious turn. The piece hedges into safe abstraction rather than committing to risky particulars that would test the premise.</comment>
