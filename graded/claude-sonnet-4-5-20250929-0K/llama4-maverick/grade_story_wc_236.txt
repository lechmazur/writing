<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's interior is dominated by abstract reflection and thematic self-diagnosis ("her ability to map emotional terrain remained intact") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The loss of smell is narrated as backstory pathos rather than dramatized constraint forcing a present choice. No on-page decision alters tactics or forecloses a path with visible cost; she arrives, reflects, and departs unchanged. Internal voice leans toward therapy-speak ("trembling calm," "humanize the mundane") that flattens character particularity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who and where early, but no escalation or decisive change occurs on the page. Elara's arc is entirely reflective: she picks up the screw, thinks about her methods, puts it down, and leaves with the same stance she entered. The "trembling calm" and fog recur as atmospheric motifs but impose no cost or choice reversal. Under an Accumulative lens, the piece would require density increase or cadence shift that reweights a stake; under Causal, a because/therefore link narrowing options—neither materializes. No closure unit (DC, RR, or CR) with legible cost is present.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The water clock shop is vividly rendered with sensory particulars (lapping water, soft ticking, muted fog) and the birthing clamp screw receives tactile attention. However, setting functions as backdrop rather than constraint: none of the shop's tools, spatial layout, or temporal pressure shapes Elara's choices. The fog recurs lyrically but does not narrow options or charge the final image with consequence. Occupational detail (water clocks, aromatherapy) remains ornamental, never tested in a choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>No dominant stake is signaled or tested on the page. Elara's motivation "to unveil ordinary miracles" is narrated thematically but never faces friction, cost, or a conflicting want. The screw-handling beat and fog-walking beat are meditative observations without reversal or tightening. No agency (decision, renunciation, endurance with cost) appears; the story moves and-then through reflection without escalation. Pressure remains static from opening to close.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme—finding meaning through occluded views, humanizing the mundane—is overtly stated in multiple passages ("her ability to map emotional terrain," "unveiling the ordinary miracles") rather than earned from concrete action. The birthing clamp screw carries potential symbolic weight (births it facilitated, lives touched) but this is told, not dramatized into a present choice or cost. The final image (fog closing in, Elara departing) reprises atmosphere without reweighting prior stakes or offering a non-literal answer. Thematic statements replace scene pressure, especially in the closing third.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping, and the misty, contemplative register is consistent throughout. However, diction leans toward elevated abstraction ("trembling calm," "occluded views," "ordinary miracles") that reads more like thematic essay than character-particular perception. Filter verbs ("felt," "realized," "envisioned") stack in reflective passages without voice-motivated compression. No dialogue appears. Perceptual signature is generic-lyric rather than distinctly Elara's; syntax and rhythm remain uniform across emotional beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Prose is grammatically clean and paragraph rhythm varies, but paraphrase loops and thematic restatements pervade: "unveiling the ordinary miracles" and variations recur across four paragraphs without added pressure; "trembling calm" appears three times as atmosphere rather than action. Template cadence in reflection beats ("It was a skill she had honed," "It was as if the very atmosphere") and filter-verb stacks ("felt," "realized," "knew") dull immediacy. The final third restates the opening's mood without propulsion. Loop penalty (−0.6) and template runs (−0.4) apply; closure beat also touched by restatement triggers higher penalty band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The aromatherapist-without-smell premise holds potential, but execution retreats into familiar lyric-meditation territory: foggy morning, reflective wanderer, objects-as-symbols, quiet departure. The birthing clamp screw's backstory (births, tears, joy) is told in generic terms rather than made specific to Elara's present conflict. "Reading between the lines" and "occluded views" function as thematic labels rather than fresh narrative tactics. No turn or intensification feels non-obvious; the piece could swap fog for rain, water clocks for antique watches, and leave the emotional arc unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her lost sense of smell is mentioned twice, but this trait never constrains an on-page choice or creates visible cost. She observes and reflects without decision; her aromatherapist role and anosmia remain backstory context rather than active pressures. No turn or tactic traces to her profession or sensory loss.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The birthing clamp screw appears in three beats: she picks it up, turns it over while reflecting on its history, and places it back. However, its function is purely symbolic-contemplative; she does not use it, and its presence does not alter her choices or the ending. The screw's meaning (births, lives touched) is told rather than reweighted through action. It seeds early and reprises in memory at closure, satisfying two gates (setup, payoff), but middle development—constraining a choice—is absent. Swappable with any evocative object.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Reading between the lines" is named once in exposition as a skill Elara honed, but the concept does not shape on-page tactics, constrain options, or charge the closure. It functions as thematic flavor rather than a method that alters what she does or sees. No cost or friction tied to this concept appears.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Maps emotional terrain" is mentioned as a retained ability despite her loss, but this trait remains label-only. No scene demonstrates her reading someone else's emotional state, navigating interpersonal pressure, or paying a cost for this skill. It seeds early but never develops into action or closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Humanize" appears twice in narration ("to humanize the world," "humanize the mundane") but as thematic claim rather than dramatized action. Elara does not humanize anyone or anything on the page; the verb describes her general motivation without a concrete beat where she enacts it with cost or consequence. No major turn traces to this action.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Through occluded views" is named explicitly in a reflective passage and the fog functions as literal occlusion throughout. The method seeds early and reprises at closure when Elara departs into fog, satisfying two gates. However, the fog does not mechanically constrain her perception or force a tactical adjustment; it remains atmospheric. Mid-development (a choice enabled or blocked by occlusion) is absent.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The water clock repair shop is established early with vivid sensory detail (lapping water, ticking clocks, workbench) and frames the entire scene, satisfying setup and setting-as-container. The shop's tools and atmosphere do not constrain Elara's choices or supply a resource that affects outcome; she could conduct the same reflection in any quiet space. The final line references "the soft ticking of the clocks" but as ambiance rather than tactical pressure. Postcard description elevated by recurring presence but still low causal role.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Within the hush of morning fog" anchors the timeframe early; fog appears in eight passages and the "morning" cue recurs three times. However, the fog functions as mood rather than a ticking clock that tightens decisions. No urgency or temporal deadline shapes Elara's actions; she could linger indefinitely. Fog clears slowly in one line but this does not alter her tactics. Setup and atmospheric presence satisfy two gates; middle development (time pressure forcing a choice) is absent.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"To unveil ordinary miracles" is stated explicitly twice and paraphrased in four additional passages, satisfying setup and thematic closure participation. However, the desire is narrated rather than dramatized into a conflicted choice with cost. Elara encounters no friction between this want and a competing need or obstacle. The motivation colors reflection but does not drive a beat where she must choose or sacrifice. Told-only with lyric reprise.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Trembling calm" appears three times and the prose sustains a meditative, unhurried register throughout with no tonal breaks. The tone matches the reflective character and misty setting, and the final image (fog closing in, Elara attuned to subtle vibrations) reinforces this mood. However, the tone remains static without modulation under pressure—there is no pressure peak to test it. Coherence across all beats but no escalation or charge at closure; the story ends in the same key it begins.</comment>
