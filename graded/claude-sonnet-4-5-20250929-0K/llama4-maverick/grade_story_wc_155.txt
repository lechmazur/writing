<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lena's motivation to rediscover lost joy is established early, but her interiority remains declarative rather than contradictory—"She had been feeling lost and uninspired" tells rather than embodies. The fragment discovery and mural creation proceed without meaningful internal friction; her shift from stuckness to inspiration unfolds too smoothly, lacking the credible struggle or visible cost that would make the transformation earned. Micro-choices under pressure are absent; she wanders, finds, creates, and departs without foreclosing a live option or paying a dramatized price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors Lena in the ruined orchard by the opening paragraph. The closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration—Lena rediscovers joy and the orchard is symbolically reborn—but the cost remains asserted rather than legible on the page: "she had rediscovered the lost joy" is told, and no prior option or path is visibly foreclosed. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (fog, fragment, film, colors layering toward a thematic payoff), yet the final image—colors seeping into trees—recycles the premise rather than reweighting it with undeniable pressure. Under the selected lens, one meaningful deepening or cadence shift is required; here the mural's completion feels like fulfillment of setup rather than a turn that narrows or transforms.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The ruined orchard is vividly rendered with scent, fog, and gnarled trees anchoring the atmosphere throughout. Sensory detail is purposeful and layered, supporting the daydream-like tone. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop; it does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters Lena's tactics at closure—she paints freely, unimpeded, and the fog swirls decoratively rather than complicating her work.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—rediscovering lost joy through art—is signaled early but never meaningfully tightened. Lena encounters no on-page reversal or complication; the fragment's discovery, the exposed film's transformation, and the mural's success all proceed without resistance, trade-off, or visible cost. The resolution is declared ("she knew that she had rediscovered the lost joy") rather than earned through a decision that forecloses a path or alters tactics under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the orchard's decay, the fragment's survival, and Lena's creative act—transformation, reclamation, beauty beyond perception. The fresco fragment and exposed film are deployed as motifs, but their recurrence does not constrain choice or charge the closure with new pressure; they fulfill their setup rather than reweight it. The ending offers a resonant image (colors seeping into trees) but undercuts it with explicit thematic summary: "a reminder of the magic that lay just beyond the fog."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, with a lyric, slightly elevated register that matches the daydream frame. Psychic distance remains stable and narrative certainty fits third-limited POV throughout. Perceptual signature is present—Lena notices textures, light, and decay—but the prose occasionally drifts into declarative summary ("She had always been drawn to this forsaken place") that flattens immediacy. No dialogue is present; filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is adequate, but several paraphrase loops and synonym cycles appear: "she had rediscovered the lost joy" repeats the opening premise without adding pressure, and "the veil between reality and dreams" is restated twice. The final third stacks declarations—"she knew," "seemed to glow," "already planning"—that summarize rather than dramatize the closure beat. Figurative language is controlled until the ending, where "kaleidoscope," "shimmering curtain," and "haunting harmony" cluster without pattern-taught payoff, approaching density overload (−0.4 in Q7 for paraphrase loops and end-paragraph summary stack).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—artist finds inspiration in ruins—is familiar, and the execution does not transform it through non-obvious moral calculus or world logic that would break in different hands. The fresco fragment and exposed film are specific objects but function as convenient catalysts rather than constraints. The daydream frame and "pensive mirth" tone offer a lyric angle, yet the arc (lost artist rediscovers purpose via perfect creative moment) follows a recognizable template without risk or complication.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lena is present throughout and her choices (wandering, unearthing the fragment, painting the mural) advance the sequence, but none alter tactics or foreclose a path with cost. She observes, envisions, and creates without friction; the fragment discovery and mural completion are fulfillment of her stated goal rather than turns that narrow options. Setup is early, development spans multiple beats, but payoff at closure is declarative ("she knew") rather than a decision with visible price.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The fresco fragment is introduced early, handled physically (unearthed, displayed beside easel, incorporated into the mural), and returns in the final image ("seemed to glow with an inner light"). It shapes the mural's content and charges the ending, but its secret or message is never specified—cost or constraint tied uniquely to this object is implied rather than dramatized. Three beats (discovery, display, incorporation) and closure participation elevate the score, but swappability (any evocative ruin artifact could serve) and the lack of a specific tradeoff cap it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Exposed film appears mid-story, is carried "for weeks" as a reminder of an abandoned project, then transformed "with a few deft movements" into a "shimmering curtain of color" for the mural. It enables the final artwork but does not constrain choice or impose cost—Lena uses it successfully without friction. Setup is mid-arrival (~40% mark), development is summary-only ("transformed it"), and payoff contributes to closure image but remains ornamental. The concept of exposing/revealing hidden beauty resonates thematically but is not pressure-tested on the page.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Paints with light" is stated once as a label ("Lena paints with light, using it to coax color and texture") but never constrains or enables a specific on-page action. The mural's creation involves light and color, yet the attribute does not visibly alter her method, impose a tradeoff, or shape closure—any vivid artist could execute the same arc. Setup is present but development and payoff are absent; the trait is decorative rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Display" is Lena's stated intent ("She would display her art here, among the ruins") and the mural is indeed displayed/created in the orchard, charging the setting and thematic payoff. However, the action itself is not a turn—it fulfills the setup without complication. The display does not redefine options or face resistance; it is the story's foregone conclusion rather than a choice under pressure. Setup, development (envisioning the piece), and payoff (the mural remains) are present, but swappability (create, install, leave would function identically) and lack of cost limit the score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>The "knowledge network" is mentioned once in backstory ("Through this network, she had learned about the history of the orchard district") but never shown on the page or used to shape a present choice. It supplies context but does not constrain tactics, enable a turn, or appear at closure. Setup is absent (introduced in reflection), development is summary-only, and payoff is missing—purely ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ruined orchard district is anchored early with vivid sensory detail (fog, damp earth, gnarled trees) and present throughout, framing Lena's exploration and the mural's site. The fog "swirled around her, as if drawn to the colors" and the trees become part of the closure image ("colors...seep into the trees themselves"), charging the final beat. The setting supplies atmosphere and thematic resonance but does not constrain a tactic or impose cost—Lena works unimpeded. Three gates met (setup, development as exploration site, payoff in final image) and closure linkage elevate the score, though lack of tactical pressure prevents higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Within the fold of a daydream" bookends the story (paragraph 1 setup, "the daydream...began to dissipate" near closure) and frames the narrative's lyric, unmoored quality. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or track duration—Lena's creative process unfolds without urgency or temporal constraint. The daydream frame is taught as a conceptual container but does not impose cost or alter moves; it is thematic rather than causal. Setup and payoff present, but development (pressure from time) is absent.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Lena's motivation "to rediscover lost joy" is established early ("She had been feeling lost and uninspired") and declared fulfilled at closure ("she knew that she had rediscovered the lost joy"). The desire drives her exploration and mural creation across multiple beats, but friction between want and cost is absent—she succeeds without trade-off or foreclosed path. The motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicted micro-choices under pressure. Setup, development (the search and creation), and payoff (declared success) are present, but the lack of visible cost and too-smooth resolution cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Pensive mirth" is implied in the story's lyric texture and in the line "a sense of pensive mirth washing over her as she beheld the vibrant, dreamlike world she had created," but the tone does not modulate meaningfully with pressure or charge the final image—it remains decorative. The ending is earnest and declarative rather than holding contradictory emotional registers. Setup is mid-story, development is minimal, and payoff is a single label rather than a tonal reconfiguration that reweights the closure.</comment>
