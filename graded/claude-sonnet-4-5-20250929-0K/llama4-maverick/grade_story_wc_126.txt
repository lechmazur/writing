<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The violinist remains entirely externalized—we watch her walk, pick up a bowl, and play music, but never glimpse contradictory impulses or embodied emotion that would make her choices legible. Her connection to "beauty in the unfinished" is asserted ("She picked it up, feeling an inexplicable connection") rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The elderly woman and storytelling group are props without distinct voices or pressure; the violinist's final "sense of hope" arrives as label rather than earned shift. No visible cost forecloses a path; she simply walks away "forever changed" by authorial fiat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within bounds. The piece attempts an Accumulative lens—violinist wanders, encounters group, plays music—but no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; the "chronic hush" lifts because the text declares it does, not through escalating pressure or a constraining choice. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration claim ("the chronic hush...was now a reminder of the beauty"), but the cost is not legible on the page: the violinist departs with a smile and lingering music, no visible forfeiture or foreclosed path. The lens wobbles between lyric description and a causal search without committing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The sunken greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks is vivid but functions as postcard backdrop; it does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome. The mendicant's bowl is handled twice (picked up, cradled), meeting minimal involvement, but its presence does not charge the final image with cost—it is merely "tucked into her pocket." Sensory detail (charred earth, blooming flowers) shifts arbitrarily to mood rather than POV priority. Spatial choreography inside the greenhouse is vague; we do not track where the violinist sits relative to the bonfire or storytellers.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to find beauty in the unfinished"—is declared but never tested by a live choice that narrows options. The violinist's encounter with the storytelling group is coincidental, not driven by her agency, and the music "unbinds" sorrow without visible resistance or cost. No reversal or deepening: she arrives seeking beauty, witnesses warmth, plays, and departs affirmed, her tactics unchanged. The "chronic hush" lifts through assertion rather than protagonist action that forecloses a path. Coincidence delivers resolution without earned escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme is stated rather than embodied: "beauty that was not polished or perfect, but raw and honest" and "transformative power of art" appear as direct thesis rather than emergent from particulars. The final paragraph moralizes ("The chronic hush remained, but it was now a reminder of the beauty that could be found in the stillness"), replacing scene pressure with abstract summary. The mendicant's bowl and "unfinished" motif are mentioned but do not accumulate pressure or charge the closure—they serve as symbolic tokens rather than constraints. No non-literal answer arises from conflict; the piece delivers a tidy epiphany without ambiguity or cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds without head-hopping, and the perceptual signature ("acoustically perceptive") is asserted but not enacted through specific noticing. Distance is stable but generic; diction ("magnificent simplicity," "morbid perfume," "celestial map") drifts into elevated register without character-specific idiom. Dialogue is absent. Filter verbs ("seemed to," "felt," "began to") proliferate in peak beats, dulling immediacy. The prose reads as neutral literary voice rather than the violinist's particular way of perceiving sound and texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops: "chronic hush" is restated six times with synonyms (suffocating, oppressive, lingering, reminder) without new pressure. Template cadence runs: "The violinist [verb]" and "As she [verb]" open consecutive sentences throughout. Stock metaphors: "branches like withered fingers," "stories unfolded like a rich tapestry," "stars twinkled above." The final five paragraphs recycle the same closure claim ("chronic hush...transformed," "beauty can still be found," "chronic hush...now a reminder") without adding causal detail. Line-level artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering disallowance of 9+ globally and accumulation cap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The premise—artist wanders post-apocalyptic landscape, finds healing community, plays transformative music—follows a well-worn template (lone wanderer discovers hope through art and connection) without specific transformation. The greenhouse-and-shipwrecks setting is visually striking but not integrated into character choice or world logic. The "echo-harbor violinist" and "acoustically perceptive" labels promise fresh specificity but remain ornamental. Emotional arc (desolation → connection → hope) proceeds along the most predictable path without friction or non-obvious synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Character: echo-harbor violinist. Present throughout but her choices do not create key turns. She wanders (passive), picks up a bowl (no cost), joins the group (invited), and plays music (the music itself "unbinds," not her decision to play). The role "echo-harbor violinist" is mentioned but her acoustic perception does not constrain or enable a choice. Removing "violinist" and replacing with "traveler with flute" would not alter story logic. Setup ✓ (first paragraph), Development ✗ (no middle choice), Payoff ✓ (plays at end). Two gates → cap ~6.0, but no causal pressure or cost tied to her specific choices → 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Object: mendicant's bowl. Handled twice (picked up ground, cradled in lap). Described as embodying "beauty in the unfinished" but does not alter a choice or charge the final image with cost—it is simply "tucked into her pocket" and vanishes. Setup ✓ (found midpoint), Development ✗ (held, not used), Payoff ✗ (not present in or shaping the ending image). One gate → cap ~3.0, but two touches and thematic link lift slightly → 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Core Concept: chronic hush. Mentioned early and late, shaping the dominant stake (the hush must be transformed). It functions as both obstacle (suffocating stillness) and the element the music alters. The hush "begins to lift" and is "transformed" at closure, though the mechanism is asserted rather than causal. Setup ✓, Development ✓ (hush oppresses, music counters), Payoff ✓ (final image reconfigures hush as "reminder of beauty"). All three gates; changes options → eligible ≥6.1, but cost is declared not shown → 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Attribute: acoustically perceptive. Mentioned once ("acoustically perceptive and attuned to the subtlest vibrations") but never constrains or enables an on-page action. She does not use heightened hearing to navigate, avoid danger, or shape her music. Label-only. Setup ✓ (first paragraph), Development ✗, Payoff ✗ → one gate cap ~3.0, ornamental use −1.0 → 2.4.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Action: unbind. Appears twice: "began to play a melody that seemed to unbind the sorrow" and "seemed to unbind the very earth itself." The music is the climactic act, but "unbind" is a metaphorical descriptor rather than a physical or tactical action the violinist performs. The effect is asserted ("seemed to") not dramatized with visible cost. Setup ✗ (first use is late), Development ✗, Payoff ✓ (shapes ending image). One gate, ornamental metaphor without causal work → 5.4 (lyric reprise allowance applies, lifting from lower band).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Method: family tradition of storytelling around a bonfire. Present in the middle act; the group's stories "weave a spell" and the violinist's music "wove together with the stories." The method creates the communal encounter that alters the violinist's stance. Setup ✗ (appears midpoint), Development ✓ (group's method frames the violinist's participation), Payoff ✓ (storytelling context charges the music's effect). Two gates; causal role in one major beat → 6.2.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Setting: sunken orchard greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks. Visually distinct and present at the key scene, but does not pressure a choice or supply a resource that affects outcome. The greenhouse shelters the group, but any shelter would serve the same function. Setup ✓ (signaled quarter-mark), Development ✗ (postcard), Payoff ✓ (location of closure scene). Two gates; swappable setting without causal pressure → 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Timeframe: after the rainforest burns. Anchors the opening and explains the "charred earth" and desolation, but does not tighten decisions or tactics—no live clock, no urgency tied to elapsed time. The timeframe is backdrop, not constraint. Setup ✓ (first line), Development ✗, Payoff ✗ (not active at closure) → one gate, ornamental past-tense frame → 3.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Motivation: to find beauty in the unfinished. Declared early ("her eyes scanning the horizon for a glimmer of hope") and restated at closure ("she had found what she had been searching for"). The bowl is connected to this desire, but the violinist never faces a conflicting cost or choice that tests the want. Told-only; no dramatized friction between want and price. Setup ✓, Development ✗ (asserted not tested), Payoff ✓ (satisfaction declared). Two gates; no on-page conflict → 4.7.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Tone: magnificent simplicity. The prose aims for lyric restraint ("simple, unadorned vessel," "soft crackling of the bonfire") but is undercut by purple constructions ("morbid perfume," "celestial map," "magnificent simplicity" as direct label). Tone is static—elegiac throughout—without modulation under pressure. The final image attempts quiet resonance but loops thematic declarations instead. Coherent intent, execution inconsistent; does not charge the final image with fresh cadence → 5.1.</comment>
