<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The guardian remains a static observer throughout; her "dimensional homesickness" and desire to "make friends with uncertainty" are labeled states without visible contradiction or micro-choices that test them under pressure. The claimed internal shift—from crushing weight to peace—occurs through passive receptivity to mist rather than earned action or renunciation with visible cost. No on-page trade-off or forfeiture demonstrates what she gives up or risks to achieve this serenity. Interiority leans heavily on abstract therapy-speak ("foggy lucidity," "interiorize exteriors") that distances rather than embodies her experience.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive quickly, but no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration with visible cost, or conceptual repricing occurs on the page. The guardian begins waiting and ends waiting; her stated peace is asserted rather than earned through causal linkage or a renunciation that forecloses a path. The mist "reveals secrets" and she "grasps the true nature of boundaries" entirely off-stage, leaving closure to summary claims ("she realized," "she knew") without dramatized pressure or felt consequence. Under any lens—causal, accumulative, or situational—the ending recounts a transformation rather than landing it with cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The frozen garden, mist, and statues are described with atmospheric density and sensory detail (damp earth, decaying leaves, frost-rimed paths). However, these elements function as backdrop rather than constraint; no environmental feature narrows her options or supplies a resource that alters her tactic. The pendant glows and pulses but never becomes a tool she must handle or manipulate to achieve an end. Spatial choreography remains clear, and the mist's thickening modulates pressure symbolically, lifting the score into functional range despite the lack of tactical integration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to make friends with uncertainty"—is declared but never tested by a choice that forecloses an alternative or imposes visible cost. The guardian's only action is waiting and receptive visualization; no reversal, tightening, or deepening narrows her options or forces a trade-off. The mist's clearing and the whispers' revelation happen to her rather than through her agency, and the final state of peace is granted without struggle. No escalation under any lens; pressure is asserted in description but never materializes in a dramatized beat that changes what she can or will do.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The boundaries-of-light concept and dimensional-homesickness motif recur frequently, but remain abstract labels rather than emerging through concrete action or image. The ending asserts thematic resolution ("she had finally made friends with uncertainty") in direct statement rather than allowing a resonant image to reweight prior material. The pendant and mist are symbolic gestures without particularity that would anchor universals. The piece gestures toward complexity (knowledge/ignorance, death/threshold) but resolves into a tidy epiphany without ambiguity or felt cost, resulting in thematic telling over earned resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping, and the narrative distance is consistent. However, diction frequently drifts into elevated, abstract register ("dimensional harmonics," "foggy lucidity," "interiorize exteriors") that feels imposed rather than character-particular. Perceptual signature is generic; the guardian's way of noticing does not carry a distinct idiom or bias. The prose shows syntactic variety and purposeful rhythm in places, lifting it past baseline, but lacks the specificity and voice control needed for higher bands. No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn are pervasive: "mist swirled," "mist seemed to thicken," "mist began to clear," "mist continued to clear," "mist swirled around her" recur without advancing knowledge or pressure. Template cadence runs appear ("As she walked… As she waited… As the mist…") across multiple paragraphs. Stock metaphors ("ethereal tentacles," "otherworldly glow," "chorus of forgotten knowledge") and filter-verb stacks ("seemed to pulse," "seemed to loom," "felt a sense") dull immediacy in peak beats. Information density is low; many sentences restate atmosphere without propelling action. These artifacts touch the closure paragraph, triggering the −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The core premise—mystical guardian achieving peace through receptive waiting—closely matches widely used contemplative-fantasy templates without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The frozen garden, cultist's pendant, and mist-shrouded revelation are familiar genre furniture deployed conventionally. No turn or inflection feels inevitable in hindsight; the guardian's journey from melancholy to serenity could be transplanted to any mystical setting with minor cosmetic edits. Derivative Premise Guardrail applies: −1.0 adjustment within Q8 for template adherence without fresh synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>The feral library guardian is present throughout but makes no decisions that alter tactics or create turns. She walks, visualizes, listens, and waits—all passive receptivity. Her only "choice" is to close her eyes and "allow the mist to seep into her mind," which is permission rather than agency. The ending claims she has achieved peace and understanding, but this is granted by external forces (mist, whispers) rather than earned through her action. Setup and middle presence are clear, but no closure participation through decision or renunciation; cap at 2.8 for missing closure participation, then apply −0.5 for ornamental use (observation without choice).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The cultist's pendant appears in the fourth paragraph, pulses twice (once mid-story, once near the end), and glows softly in the penultimate paragraph. However, it is never handled, used, or manipulated by the guardian; it simply hangs and glows passively. Its "answering energy" and role as "key to understanding" are asserted in summary rather than demonstrated through action or causal pressure. Present in the closure image but not causally active there; cameo mentions do not count as closure participation. Setup present, middle mention present, but no middle development (does not constrain or enable a choice); cap at 3.4 for missing middle development, then apply −0.3 for ornamental/descriptive use.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>The "boundaries of light" phrase appears five times as a thematic label but never constrains a choice or alters on-page tactics. The guardian is said to "confront" and "grasp" and "push" these boundaries entirely in summary; no scene dramatizes what knowledge or ignorance costs her or what she must give up to cross a threshold. The concept is echoed at closure but as thematic claim, not as a reweighted stake with visible cost. Setup present (paragraph 7), but missing middle development and active closure participation; cap at 3.4, then apply −0.6 for label-only use and summary-only treatment (−0.3 each).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Dimensionally homesick" is labeled in paragraph 5 and mentioned again in the final paragraph as "assuaged," but never constrains or enables an on-page action with cost. No scene shows what dimension she longs for, what she cannot do because of this homesickness, or what trade-off she accepts to ease it. The trait is purely descriptive atmosphere. Setup present (first third), absent from middle beats, and mentioned but not reweighted at closure; all three gates technically touched but no causal work. Start at 3.0, apply −0.6 for label-only treatment and −0.5 for late closure cameo without causal charge.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The action "wait" is mentioned explicitly six times and frames the story's structure (she patrols, then waits, continues to wait, will continue to wait). However, waiting here is static endurance without dramatized cost or visible trade-off; no scene shows what she forgoes or risks by waiting rather than acting. The final "she stood watch" and "she waited for the next revelation" recur without deepening stakes. Setup and closure presence are clear, but the action does not create turns or redefine options—it is the story's baseline state rather than a pivot. Present across all three gates, but functionally replaceable (could swap "meditate," "observe," "guard" with minor edits) and no specific cost tied to waiting itself; cap at 3.8 for swappability, lift +0.3 for closure presence.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Interiorizing exteriors" is named once in paragraph 9 and explained as "allowing the mist to seep into her mind," then credited in paragraph 19 as giving "a new perspective." The method is labeled rather than demonstrated; no mechanics are signaled (does she visualize? chant? breathe in a pattern?), and no middle beat shows her attempting or refining this technique under pressure. Introduced at ~37% (borderline late), absent from middle development, and summarized at closure without causal charge. Cap at 4.6 for late introduction past 40% mark, apply −0.6 for ornamental summary-only use, then apply −0.3 for label-only mechanics, −0.3 for summary resolution, −0.3 for late closure cameo; dominant limiter is late intro, so cap at 4.6 and apply −0.9 cumulative text-pattern debt, then round to −1.0 max per element, yielding ~3.6; apply −0.6 primary for ornamental + −0.3 label + −0.3 summary = approx 2.4 after rounding down.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The frozen garden in mist is present from the opening line, described with atmospheric detail throughout, and mentioned in the final paragraph. However, the setting never constrains a choice or supplies a resource that alters outcome; the guardian moves freely through it, and no environmental feature (ice, mist density, statue placement) blocks a path or enables a tactic. The mist functions as symbolic pressure rather than spatial constraint. Setup strong, middle presence as backdrop, closure presence as image; all three gates met but no causal pressure or cost tied to setting. Start at 3.0 base, lift +0.8 for setup, +0.4 for one beat (atmosphere), +0.7 for closure image linkage, but apply −0.5 for ornamental use (postcard description) and −0.4 for swappability (could occur in any mystical locale); net ~4.0 range, round to 4.8 for sustained atmospheric integration without tactical work.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>"Through the veil of sleep" appears in paragraphs 13, 15, and 22 as a phrase describing the guardian's state, but no time pressure or clock tightens decisions. The story's duration is vague (she patrols, waits, and will continue to wait in an untracked cycle), and the "veil of sleep" functions as mood descriptor rather than timeframe constraint. No deadline, no ticking clock, no scene where elapsed time forces a choice. Setup nominal (paragraph 13 is ~50% mark—late), absent from middle as constraint, and mentioned at closure as static label. Introduced after 40% mark, no middle development, cameo at closure; cap at 4.6 for late intro, then apply −0.6 for ornamental use, −0.3 for label-only, −0.3 for no tracked time; dominant limiter late intro at 4.6, cumulative −0.9, apply −1.0 max text debt, net ~3.6; apply primary −0.6 ornamental + −0.3 label + −0.3 untracked + dominant late cap = ~1.9 after rounding.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The motivation "to make friends with uncertainty" is stated explicitly in paragraph 6 and declared fulfilled in paragraph 17 and 22, but never dramatized through conflicted choice. No scene shows her weighing a known safe path against an uncertain risk, or paying a price to accept ambiguity. The desire is told and resolved in summary ("she had finally made friends with uncertainty") without friction between want and cost. Setup clear (paragraph 6, first third), absent from middle beats as a dilemma, and asserted at closure without causal charge. All three gates nominally touched but no beat involvement or causal pressure. Start at 3.0, lift +0.3 for setup, +0.3 for closure mention, apply −0.5 for told-only treatment and −0.3 for summary resolution without friction; net ~2.8, round to 3.7 for sustained thematic presence despite lack of dramatization (adjustment for coherent signal across story, though not enacted).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Foggy lucidity" is named once in paragraph 9 and in paragraph 23, and the tone—dreamlike, mist-shrouded, contemplative—is sustained consistently throughout without modulation under pressure. The prose maintains a single static mood of mystical receptivity from opening to close; no tonal shift marks escalation or deepening. The tone is coherent and purposeful, supporting the story's lyric-atmospheric design, and the final image ("lost in the mist") charges the tone with a note of dissolution that reweights the guardian's presence. Setup implicit (established by paragraph 9), middle coherence strong, closure participation through charged final image. Start at 3.0, lift +0.8 for early coherence, +0.4 for sustained middle presence, +0.7 for closure charge, apply −0.3 for static mood without modulation; net ~5.6, reflecting coherent tonal control that supports but does not deepen stakes under pressure.</comment>
