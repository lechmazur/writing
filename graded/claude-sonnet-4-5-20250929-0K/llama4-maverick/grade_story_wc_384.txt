<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The forger remains abstract throughout—we see her hands moving and feel her "desire to forgive the unfinished," but no contradictory impulses act in scene. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("her eyes shining with a sense of pride and accomplishment") and the final satisfaction arrives without visible cost or genuine struggle. The heritage rose thorn pricks her finger early but never constrains a later choice or complicates her work. No meaningful change or credible endurance is earned; she simply completes the task and walks away pleased.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early enough, but no on-page closure with felt cost materializes. The forger works, finishes, smiles, and leaves—her "calibrated treason" and new narrative are asserted complete but never tested or paid for on the page. The piece reads as a single continuous scene under an attempted Causal lens, yet no because/therefore linkage tightens options or changes knowledge; the task simply ends when declared done. The Cost Proof Test fails: no sentence or image at the ending beat makes cost legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The marble sanctuary, aurora, candles, and stalactites supply vivid atmospheric detail filtered through a consistent authorial lens. However, none of these elements constrains a choice or charges the final image—they remain postcard description. The heritage rose thorn and the key are mentioned but never used tactically. Spatial choreography is coherent and sensory selection (scent of parchment, pearl twilight hue) adds texture, keeping the score in mid-band despite the lack of causal setting work.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—subverting a historical text to reveal hidden truth—is signaled early but never tested on the page. No reversal, tightening, or deepening occurs; the forger encounters no resistance, makes no trade-offs, and pays no visible price. The text flows "with a precision that was both wisely enduring and deeply intuitive," but pressure remains static from first paragraph to last. Under any lens, escalation is absent and agency at closure is missing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>A coherent theme—art as subversion, forgiveness of the incomplete—emerges from imagery and the forger's task, but the final paragraph moralizes overtly: "she had finally been able to forgive the unfinished" and "brought closure to the narrative." These declarative theme statements replace scene pressure and the ending offers no non-literal answer or resonant reconfiguration. The heritage rose becomes a symbol "of the beauty and complexity of the task," announced rather than earned. Thematic Echo penalty (−0.6) applied for final-paragraph thesis articulation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>POV and distance remain stable throughout; no head-hopping. The prose carries a consistent elevated register ("pearl twilight hue," "wisely enduring") that fits the authorial voice, though it lacks perceptual signature specific to the forger as an individual. Filter verbs ("seemed to," "felt a sense of") appear frequently but not disruptively. Dialogue is absent. The voice is competent but generic, without the selective bias or rhythmic modulation under pressure that would lift it higher.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Pervasive paraphrase loops and synonym churn degrade momentum: "faithful to the original and yet, utterly distinct" recurs in varied phrasings across multiple paragraphs without adding pressure or detail. Figurative language appears densely ("pearl twilight hue," "otherworldly energy," "soft, luminous color") in nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or payoff. Template cadence runs ("The forger smiled... The forger left... The forger felt") span the final third. Combined artifact penalties (−1.4) and disqualification from 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The premise—a calligraphy forger subverting an oppressive historical text—holds potential, but execution defaults to template: the artisan in her atmospheric workspace, completing her meaningful task without friction, then departing satisfied. No turn feels earned in hindsight; the "calibrated treason" is declared rather than demonstrated. The aurora, marble sanctuary, and heritage rose read as ornamental checklist items rather than organic synthesis. Transformation Test fails: swap names and setting with minor edits and the emotional arc (such as it is) remains unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The calligraphy forger is present throughout but makes no key choice that alters tactics or options. She works, completes the task as intended, and leaves—observation without decision. Setup and development gates met (present early, involved in middle), but closure participation is missing: no forger choice drives the ending. Late penalty and swappability lower the score further.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The heritage rose thorn pricks her finger in the opening third and is mentioned again as "a symbol of the beauty and complexity" near the end, satisfying the two-beat minimum. However, it never constrains a choice or shapes tactics; both appearances are ornamental description. Setup and payoff gates met, but development gate missing (no middle constraint). Lyric reprise without causal pressure caps eligibility.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Calibrated treason" is named and thematically echoed but never enacted on the page—we're told the forger commits it, not shown how it changes options or what cost it imposes. Setup gate met (concept named early), but development and payoff gates missing (no middle choice driven by the concept, no closure linkage). Swappable with "careful subversion" or similar phrasing.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Wisely enduring" appears as a label modifier ("her hands moving with a precision that was both wisely enduring") and again in the final paragraph as abstraction. No on-page action is constrained or enabled by this trait; it functions as adjective decoration. Setup gate missing (first mention is second paragraph but as descriptor only), development and payoff gates missing.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Unlink" appears twice: once as the forger's task "to unlink the original author's intent" and once near the end "she had unlinked the original narrative." No major turn traces to this action—it's the goal she pursues throughout, stated and restated, but never dramatized as a moment that redefines options. Setup and closure gates met (present early and mentioned at end), development gate missing (no middle choice driven by unlinking). Easily swappable with "sever," "detach," or "reframe."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>The key with no apparent lock is introduced mid-story as "a tool that was both literal and metaphorical" and said to "unlock the secrets of the text," with one callback near the end. Its mechanics never matter on the page; the forger does not use it to solve a problem or alter her approach. Setup gate missing (arrives after first third), development and payoff gates missing. Ornamental metaphor.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The marble sanctuary under aurora is present throughout, anchoring every beat, and receives detailed atmospheric treatment. However, it never pressures a choice or supplies a resource that affects outcome—it's postcard backdrop. Setup and development gates met (present early, involved across beats), payoff gate weak (setting mentioned at closure but does not shape the final action). Swappable with any atmospheric workspace.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>0.8</grade><comment>"As stalactites drip" appears once in the middle and once near the end as a poetic marker of duration. No time pressure tightens decisions or alters tactics; the forger works at her own pace with no clock or deadline visible. Setup gate missing (first mention is mid-story), development and payoff gates missing. Vague and untracked time.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>"To forgive the unfinished" is named early as the forger's desire and restated at the end as achieved. No on-page conflict or cost dramatizes this motivation—she simply completes the text and feels forgiveness. Setup and closure gates met (desire stated early, resolution claimed at end), development gate missing (no middle friction between this want and a competing cost). Told-only motivation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Pearl twilight" appears as the hue of the text and recurs in the forger's mind near the end, creating a lyric reprise. Tone remains static—soft, reverent, luminous—throughout without modulation under pressure. Setup and payoff gates met (tone established early, recalled at closure), development gate weak (tone does not shift or charge a middle beat). The final image carries the color but without altered stakes or felt cost, limiting score despite presence across the arc.</comment>
