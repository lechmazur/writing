<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The shepherd remains abstract throughout, defined by occupation rather than embodied traits or contradictory impulses. Interiority consists of philosophical musing ("what lay beyond the ticking surface") without concrete sensory anchors or micro-choices under pressure. The "newfound sense of purpose" and "deep sense of satisfaction" are asserted labels rather than earned shifts with visible cost. No internal conflict or foreclosed path emerges on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed—who, where, and when coalesce slowly across the opening third without clear spatial grounding (−0.4). No causal escalation or decision point narrows options; the shepherd observes clocks, turns a key, counts backwards, and feels satisfaction in a flat sequence without because/therefore linkage. The ending offers no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with visible cost; it simply reasserts the shepherd's vigilance. Closure is absent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The "horizon measurement station" and "hydraulic clocks" provide conceptual setting, but spatial choreography remains vague—no anchor for scale, layout, or tactile detail. The mantle clock key is handled twice (turn, replace), giving modest object-as-setting function. Sensory detail defaults to generic ("serene landscape," "warm orange glow") without POV filter or choice constraint. The final image does not charge through environment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The stated stake—"to understand what clocks really measure"—remains abstract and untested; no scenario forces a trade-off or narrows options. Counting backwards is described but never creates friction or cost. No reversal, tightening, or deepening occurs; the shepherd ends as watchful as he began. Escalation is absent under any lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Theme is stated rather than emergent: "mystery the shepherd was determined to unravel," "essence of time." The mantle clock key and counting method are mentioned but do not accumulate pressure or shift meaning at closure. The final paragraph summarizes theme ("guardian of time") instead of offering a resonant non-literal image. No subtext operates in action or silence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("eminently peculiar," "razor edges of time") that feels imposed rather than character-particular. No dialogue appears. Perceptual signature is generic; the shepherd's noticing lacks bias or selectivity. Filter verbs ("seemed," "felt") appear frequently but do not obscure clarity at this length.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "clocks were more than just timekeeping devices; they were a gateway," then "secrets waiting to be unlocked," then "essence of time" recycle the same claim without advancement (−0.6). Template cadence: "The shepherd's [noun]" opens multiple beats. Figurative language ("razor edges," "grand symphony") lacks vehicle coherence and reads ornamental. Information density is low; many lines restate rather than propel.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The premise—solitary figure contemplating time via antique mechanisms—is familiar and executed without fresh synthesis. "Counting backwards" as method is mentioned but not dramatized with specific logic or friction. The ending reasserts the opening situation without transformation. No risk-taking or non-obvious angle emerges; the shepherd remains an archetype rather than a particular voice.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Present throughout but makes no decision that alters tactics or options. Observation and routine monitoring only.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Handled twice (turn, replace) across distinct beats. Does not constrain a choice or charge the final image with reweighted meaning.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>"Razor edges" appears once as metaphor mid-story, does not shape stakes or tactics on the page.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Eminently peculiar" is a label-only descriptor in one sentence; no cost or enabling action flows from it.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Squinting occurs once in the opening to focus on terrain alignment; easily swappable with "gazed" or "scanned."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>Counting backwards is described ("mentally reversed the flow") but its mechanics never matter to a turn or choice; summary-only.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Named and framed early; provides backdrop for clock-tending but does not pressure a decision or supply resources that alter outcome.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"After blowing the whistle" anchors the opening moment but the timeframe does not tighten later decisions; no live clock pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Stated motivation ("to understand what clocks really measure") frames the shepherd's presence but is never dramatized in conflicted choice or cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Fjord quiet" appears twice (opening, near end) and sets a calm register; tone does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image.</comment>
