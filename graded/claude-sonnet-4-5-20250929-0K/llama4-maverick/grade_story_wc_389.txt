<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The visionary remains an abstraction throughout—no embodied emotion, no micro-choices under pressure, no contradictory impulses. Her "lyrically prophetic mind" and "sense of calm" are labels without behavioral specificity. The prophet is told-only, never on the page to create relational pressure. The final "smile" and retrospective pride flatten what could have been a stance crystallization into generic satisfaction without visible cost or foreclosed path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>No on-page closure effect: the ending recounts years of success in summary without a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing moment. The "variant allegiance" shift is told across decades, never dramatized in a single beat with felt cost. Orientation is vague past 120 words (who is the visionary? what is her actual situation?). The drive lens appears causal but no because/therefore linkage tightens options; the piece reads as accumulative but offers no cadence shift or pattern break at closure—leaving it ambiguous and unearnred.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The cobalt glass portico and stormlit observatory are mentioned repeatedly but never constrain a choice or alter tactics. Spatial choreography is absent—no body, tool, or environment pressure. Sensory detail is generic ("winds howling," "tempest raging") and filtered through declaration rather than POV-specific perception. The setting functions as backdrop, not crucible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("shaping a new dawn") is declared but never tested on the page. No on-page reversal, tightening, or deepening—just a told progression of success. The visionary watches and listens without agency; the prophet's rise happens off-stage across years. Coincidence (fragmented radio frequencies conveniently delivering a mosaic) complicates nothing and no visible price is paid. Escalation is replaced by summary.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Variant allegiance" and "ancient shadows to shape a brighter tomorrow" are prompt labels repeated without embodiment in scene particulars. The ending states a moral ("legacy lived on, a beacon of hope") rather than offering a resonant image. No complexity, no counter-reading, no earned insight—just thematic echo. The cobalt portico's symbolic recurrence is decorative, not charged by a choice or reweighted cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Third-person narration maintains stable distance but the voice is generic and committee-written, lacking perceptual signature. Diction drifts into elevated abstraction ("lyrically prophetic," "gritty whimsy," "nucleus of change") that feels ornamental rather than voice-motivated. No dialogue on the page. Psychic distance never modulates with pressure because no pressure beat is dramatized. The prose reads like averaged consensus rather than a singular perspective.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "pondered the mysteries" / "began to sense," "watched as the prophet's influence grew" / "saw how the prophet's words captured," "shaping a new dawn" / "shape the new dawn" / "shaped the world anew." Template cadence dominates (e.g., "As she…" x5, "The visionary…" x7). Stock metaphors ("like moths to a flame," "spreading like a wildfire") and weak nominalizations ("a sense of," "a growing sense of") dull momentum. Information density is low; many sentences restate without advancing pressure. Final-third loops and artifacts disallow 9+ globally and trigger the −1.7 penalty in Q7, yielding a score in the 3–4 band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>The premise (visionary listens to radio, guides prophet's rise) is a template plot without fresh angle. The "cobalt glass portico" and "gritty whimsy" feel like ornamental checklist items rather than organic synthesis. No bold risk-taking, no unconventional structural choice, no specific lived detail that transforms the archetype. The emotional arc (lonely → proud) could run unchanged with different names and places. Proximity check: "moths to a flame," "wildfire," "beacon" are stock.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Character present throughout but makes no key turn via on-page decision. She observes, listens, and watches across years in summary. No choice alters tactics; no cost is visible. Swappable with "observer" or "watcher."</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Cobalt glass portico appears in opening, middle, and closing paragraphs but is never handled, used, or reweighted—only described as symbol. No beat involvement beyond static mentions. Ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>Variant allegiance is told as theme ("shifting allegiance," "variant allegiance now a badge of honor") but does not shape on-page stakes or alter tactics. Label-only.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.0</grade><comment>"Lyrically prophetic" appears twice as label; no on-page action constrained or enabled by this trait. No visible tradeoff or cost tied to being "prophetic."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Unfold" recurs ("unfold a tale," "unfold the narrative," "continue to unfold") but as metaphor only. The visionary does not perform a literal unfolding action with cost. Swappable with "reveal" or "interpret."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Fragmented radio frequencies mentioned once in paragraph 6 as the means by which she "pieced together a mosaic of voices," then never returned to or mechanically detailed. Does not shape attempts or constrain choices.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Stormlit observatory above clouds recurs as location but supplies no resource or constraint that affects outcome. Postcard description. The setting does not pressure a single choice.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>Timeframe "across the rise of a prophet" spans years in summary ("days passed," "weeks into months," "years later"). No live clock, no tightening of decisions by elapsed time. Vague and untracked.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>Motivation declared in paragraph 3 ("key to shaping a new dawn lay hidden in ancient shadows") and repeated at closure, but never dramatized in a conflicted choice. Told-only; no friction between wants and costs on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>2.2</grade><comment>"Gritty whimsy" appears once as descriptor (paragraph 11) but the prose throughout is earnest and abstract, lacking both grit and whimsy. Tone does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image. Single static mood.</comment>
