<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The restorer's motivation to ground spirits is told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. Interiority relies heavily on abstract states ("lucid unrest," "quiet intent") without embodied sensation or micro-choices under pressure. The character performs her craft in a loop of undoing knots with no visible struggle, mistake, or alteration that would reveal contradictory desires. The final "sense of lucid unrest" and "newfound sense of purpose" read as labels rather than earned shifts with foreclosed paths.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive adequately early. The piece establishes an accumulative lens through repeated "interlaced hush" and the gradual unwinding of knots, but the closure lacks visible cost: the spirits dissipate, the restorer walks away feeling purpose, and returns to work unchanged. No option is foreclosed, no price paid—Resonant Reconfiguration requires undeniable pressure or cost at the final image, and here the ending simply reasserts the opening state without tightening or reweighting.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary and starlight are vividly rendered with shifting kaleidoscope colors that charge the atmosphere. However, the setting remains largely postcard: it does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters the restorer's approach. The tapestry needle and net are handled, but the sanctuary itself functions as backdrop rather than pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—grounding restless spirits—is signaled early but never tested. The restorer simply unravels knots in sequence without complication, reversal, or cost: no knot resists, no spirit turns hostile, no trade-off emerges. The "last knot fell away" moment arrives without agency or sacrifice, and the resolution (spirits dissipate, restorer continues) lacks the tightening or foreclosed option required under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme of silence, accumulation, and peace emerges through repeated imagery (hush, stillness, starlight). Yet the final paragraphs state rather than dramatize: "a testament to the restorer's art," "the power of silence," "brought peace to the restless spirits." The ending offers no non-literal answer or resonant reconfiguration—it simply reasserts the premise without complication or reweighting of prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Voice is consistent and employs elevated diction ("interlaced hush," "lucid unrest," "exhume the secrets") that fits the sanctuary's atmosphere. However, perceptual signature is generic: the restorer notices light, silence, and needle glint in undifferentiated cycles. Repeated sentence stems ("As she worked," "The restorer's," "The tapestry needle") and synonym loops ("silence accumulated," "interlaced hush," "velvety stillness") flatten rhythm and create template cadence across multiple beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "interlaced hush" / "accumulated silence" / "velvety stillness" recur without added pressure; "tapestry needle glinted" appears twice; "As she worked" opens multiple beats; "restorer's art" / "restorer's craft" cycle. These loops dull momentum and occupy space without advancing causality. Stock metaphors ("balm to the spirits," "soft exhalation") and abstract phrasing ("lucid unrest," "living, breathing entity") reduce concreteness at peak moments.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The broken-mask-restorer-as-spirit-tender premise is familiar, and execution does not transform it through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. Centuries-old fisherman's net, prism sanctuary, and starlight are evocative but generic fantasy furniture. The resolution—spirits released, restorer continues—follows a predictable arc without a fresh inflection or hinge that reweights prior material in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The broken mask restorer is named and performs the central action (unraveling knots), present across setup, middle, and ending. However, her choices do not create turns: she simply executes the task without complication, mistake, or trade-off. Observation and execution dominate; decision under pressure is absent.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The tapestry needle appears in three beats: teasing out knots early, glinting mid-story, and clutched with "residual energy" at the end. It is handled and returns with slight reweighting ("symbol of her craft"), satisfying two gates. However, it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—its presence is functional but replaceable with any similar tool.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The "interlaced hush" is named repeatedly and accumulates as the restorer works, shaping the atmosphere and thematic texture. It does not, however, change on-page options or force a tactical choice. The concept operates as motif rather than active pressure, present in setup and ending but not constraining middle decisions.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Accumulates silence" is stated as the restorer's trait ("the silence she accumulated was a testament to her craft") and echoed at the ending. It is labeled rather than dramatized through a visible cost or trade-off: we never see silence enabling one action while foreclosing another. The trait exists as thematic claim without on-page constraint.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Exhume the secrets hidden within the net's twisted fibers" is stated as motivation early and mentioned again at the ending ("to exhume the secrets that lay hidden"). The action is not dramatized in a distinct beat with consequences—it is a background goal rather than a pivotal turn. Easily swappable with "uncover" or "reveal" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Unraveling knots in the centuries-old fisherman's net is the method, signaled early and executed across multiple beats: "tease out the knots," "every knot she undid," "the last knot fell away." The mechanics (deliberate slowness, tapestry needle, tangled threads) are shown, and the method drives the middle progression and closure. However, no complication or variation in technique emerges—each knot undoes without cost, limiting causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary under starlight is named in the opening and closing, and starlight "intensified, casting a kaleidoscope of colors" mid-story, present across all three gates. It supplies vivid atmosphere but does not pressure a choice or alter the restorer's approach. The sanctuary remains postcard setting rather than active constraint on tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Across the span of sharing a secret" appears once mid-story as a poetic phrase without clear temporal function. Time is otherwise vague ("centuries-old," "days that followed," "passage of moments") and does not tighten decisions or create a deadline. The timeframe does not shape tactics or escalate pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"To ground restless spirits" is stated early as motivation and referenced at the ending ("she had succeeded in grounding the spirits"). The desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices: the restorer never faces a trade-off between grounding spirits and another want. The motivation drives setup and closure but lacks friction or visible cost on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Lucid unrest" is named twice (mid-story and near the end) and the tone blends stillness with restlessness throughout: "heavy, velvety stillness," "restless spirits," "quiet intent," "tension that was both creative and unsettling." The tone is coherent and modulates with the task's progression, charging the sanctuary atmosphere. However, it does not shift decisively at closure—the final paragraphs sustain the same register without intensification or release.</comment>
