<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The poet remains abstract throughout—no contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene, only ornamental labels ("furiously tranquil"). Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("maddening vortex," "washing away the detritus") and therapeutic self-diagnosis ("cartography of scars") rather than embodied specificity. The envelope-opening moment arrives without earned causality; we never see what constrains her before the masks slip, so the final "understanding" reads as declared rather than dramatized. No micro-choices under pressure narrow options or reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Closure form is unclear: the poet reads a letter and "feels understanding," but no decisive change, renunciation with cost, or conceptual repricing is legible on the page—only assertion of inner peace. The vigil structure implies Accumulative or Situational pressure, yet no tightening or pattern-break reweights the stake; the storm "rages on" while she stands static until the envelope arbitrarily delivers resolution. Orientation is delayed: "censored poet," "remote outpost," and the storm's cause remain vague past the opening third, and the spatial anchor (observatory mechanics, how she arrived) never clarifies. The lens wavers between lyric accumulation and a causal letter-reveal without teaching either pattern early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory and churning clouds provide vivid visual anchors, and the darkroom timer offers tactile grounding. However, the setting remains postcard-descriptive—wind, lightning, darkness—without constraining a single choice or altering tactics. The bus timetable and envelope are named but not spatially choreographed (where does she pull them from? how does wind affect handling?). No occupational detail (observatory instruments, access) or micro-geography (rail, door, interior layout) shapes her actions, leaving the location ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding her scars—is declared but never tested by an on-page decision with competing costs. The poet stands, waits, then opens an envelope she wrote to herself; no reversal or tightening narrows options, and no visible price is paid (she simply "feels understanding" and remains at peace). The storm as external pressure is metaphoric only, never forcing a choice between staying or leaving, reading or burning, confronting or fleeing. Agency is passive observation rather than renunciation or endurance that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Theme (self-knowledge, hidden patterns, masks slipping) is stated repeatedly—"cartography of scars," "the masks...were beginning to slip," "hidden contours"—rather than arising from concrete actions. The darkroom timer and envelope recur but as symbols without friction; they do not constrain or reweight the ending image beyond label-level resonance. The final "peace" and "understanding" are asserted directly ("she felt a sense of understanding wash over her") instead of offered through a non-literal image or question. Some conceptual ambition in the vigil-in-pause frame, but execution leans toward thematic echo rather than earned particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping, and elevated diction ("rarefy," "topography," "detritus") matches a poet's lexicon. However, perceptual signature is generic—storm descriptions and introspective phrasing could belong to any reflective observer. Recursive phrasing weakens specificity: "the storm raging outside seemed to be a manifestation of the turmoil within" tells rather than filters perception through character-particular bias. Distance control is consistent but lacks modulation under pressure; the vigil's climax (envelope opening) receives the same narrative stance as the opening.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "the storm raging outside seemed to be a manifestation of the turmoil within" / "storm was stripping away the layers"; "seeking to understand the cartography of scars" / "comprehension of the cartography of scans that had haunted her"; "the masks...were beginning to slip" / "ready to confront the truths." Template cadence runs: "She had always been drawn..." / "She had used this method before..." Stock metaphors cluster without fresh vehicles: "maddening vortex," "washing away the detritus," "threads of a tapestry." These artifacts dull the closure beat—"the poet smiled, knowing that she would always be drawn to the hidden patterns"—into scaffolding rather than earned image. Sentence openings repeat structural stems across paragraphs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The vigil-at-observatory premise and storm-as-inner-turmoil metaphor are familiar templates executed without transformation. The sealed-envelope device (writing to oneself, opening when masks slip) echoes countless therapeutic-journey narratives; no specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus distinguishes this iteration. The darkroom timer is named but not used in a way unique to a photographer's practice—it ticks generically. Emotional arc (turmoil → understanding → peace) follows a predictable path with no risk-taking in structure, voice, or stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>The censored poet observes, stands, waits, and reads; no choice creates a key turn. The envelope-opening is handed to her by prior setup rather than arrived at through conflicted agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The darkroom timer is clutched in paragraph 4, ticks in paragraph 15, and ticks again in paragraph 24. All mentions are ornamental—comfort object, heartbeat metaphor—without altering tactics or being handled differently. No charged reprise reweights its meaning at closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"A vigil in pause" is named in paragraph 6 and echoed in paragraph 21 ("her vigil in pause finally coming to an end"), but it does not shape on-page tactics or narrow options. The concept remains thematic label rather than constraint.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>"Furiously tranquil" appears once in paragraph 3 as a descriptor. No on-page action demonstrates the friction between fury and tranquility, and no cost or tradeoff is tied to this attribute.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Rarefy" is used once in paragraph 8 as an impulse ("to rarefy the air around her, to distill the essence"). The action is not dramatized—we never see her attempt or achieve rarefaction—so major turns do not trace to it.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The sealed envelope wedged in a bus timetable is introduced in paragraph 10, signaled as a recurring method, and retrieved in paragraph 19. The mechanics (wedging, creased pages) are named but do not shape earlier attempts or create friction. Present in setup and payoff but absent from middle development; the reveal does not alter prior tactics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory is anchored early and provides vivid atmosphere. It supplies no resources or constraints that alter the poet's choices—she could conduct the same vigil anywhere above the weather. The setting frames rather than pressures.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"When masks slip" is mentioned in paragraph 12 ("until the masks slipped") and paragraph 18 ("The masks...were beginning to slip"). Time remains vague—no urgency or clock tightens decisions; the masks slip when the narrative declares readiness rather than through escalating pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"To understand the cartography of scars" is stated in paragraph 6, repeated in paragraph 16, and claimed as achieved in paragraph 20. The motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices; no friction between competing wants or costs is visible on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Storm-kissed wonder" is named in paragraph 14 and maintained through the ending's "awe at the beauty...in the turbulence." Tone is coherent but static—reverent observation throughout—without modulation under pressure or sharpening at the closure image.</comment>
