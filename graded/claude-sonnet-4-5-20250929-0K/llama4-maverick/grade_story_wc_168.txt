<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Kael's motivations are declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The interiority relies heavily on abstract pain and "world of pain" label-speak without embodied specificity. His interaction with the box—opening it, gazing into the mirror—generates reflection but no visible micro-choice that forecloses a path with cost. The transformation from "scarred firefighter" to "messenger" is asserted in the final third without prior causal pressure forcing that shift.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early enough. However, no decisive change occurs on the page: Kael walks, reflects, opens a box, reflects more, and walks on. The piece offers Conceptual Repricing language ("translate pain into a universal language") but the cost remains abstract and the closure image (disappearing into shadows with the box) does not reweight prior material with legible pressure. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, yet no cadence shift or density break charges the ending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The moonlit ridge path is anchored early and sensory details (gravel crunch, silvery glow, velvet expanse) are vivid. The cracked porcelain box functions as a micro-setting object and appears in multiple beats, though it constrains no choice. Spatial choreography is clean. The moon and stars recur but remain ornamental; removing them would not alter Kael's trajectory or the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Kael seeking enlightenment or transformation—is signaled but never tested. No reversal or tightening choice narrows his options: he walks, opens the box, reflects, and continues walking with unchanged trajectory. The declared internal conflict (pain, lost innocence) generates no on-page trade-off or visible cost. Coincidence does not resolve because nothing resolves; pressure remains static throughout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme ("translate pain into a universal language") is stated repeatedly rather than emerging from particulars. The cracked porcelain box gestures toward symbolic work but its meaning does not shift across beats. The ending offers mood ("hard softness") rather than a resonant answer to the central question. Epiphany is declared ("he realized...") without scene-earned friction, trending toward platitude.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>POV distance is stable and third-person limited throughout. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("ethereal glow," "abiding movement") that feels ornamental rather than voice-specific. No dialogue appears. Perceptual signature is generic: Kael notices landscape and celestial bodies in predictable ways. Psychic distance does not modulate with pressure because pressure does not escalate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "pain he had carried" / "pain he had witnessed," "the box...had become a catalyst" / "the box...had become a symbol," "once a mysterious object" / "once a simple object." Template cadence runs in the final third with repeated "As he..." and "The..." stems. Stock metaphors ("diamonds scattered," "velvet expanse") cluster without fresh angle. Information density is low; many sentences restate mood rather than advance situation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The "scarred hero walks at night with symbolic object and reflects on past pain" frame is widely template-familiar. The cracked porcelain box and "translate pain into universal language" motif echo prompt elements without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The story could substitute different names and places with no arc change (transformation test fail). No bold structural risk heightens stakes; the piece opts for lyric safety without tight causality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Kael is present throughout but makes no decision that alters tactics or forecloses a path. He walks, opens the box, reflects, and walks on; observation dominates. His occupation (forest firefighter) primes backstory but does not constrain present action. Setup and closure participation are present but development (middle choice) is absent; cap at 3.4 per missing-development gate. Late narrative claim of transformation ("no longer just a scarred forest firefighter, but a messenger") is told, not enacted.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The cracked porcelain box appears in multiple beats: Kael holds it while walking, it "seemed to glow," he opens it to reveal a mirror, and it remains "clutched in his hand" to the end. Setup and closure gates are met. However, the box's properties do not constrain choice or enable tactics under stress; it functions as passive symbol. The mirror inside prompts reflection but no visible cost or decision. Lyric reprise without causal pressure places it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Bargained innocence" appears once as a thematic phrase: "the bargains he had made in his life, the innocence he had lost." It does not shape stakes, alter tactics, or recur with reweighted meaning. The concept remains ornamental—a label rather than a force that narrows options on the page. Introduced past the first third, it plays no causal role; cap at 2.8 for missing closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Gently skilled" appears once: "Kael's hands, gently skilled at navigating the rugged terrain, moved with a quiet reverence as he opened the box." The attribute enables the box-opening action but imposes no cost or trade-off; opening a delicate box does not pressure the scene. No visible constraint or friction tied to skill level. Ornamental use with late first appearance and no closure linkage; multiple friction caps converge near 2.8, round down to 2.4.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Enlighten" appears twice: once when the stranger claimed the box "held the power to enlighten those who possessed it," and again when Kael "realized...his journey...had given him a unique perspective, one that allowed him to enlighten others." Both uses are summary claims rather than dramatized turns. The action does not drive beats or redefine options; swapping "transform" or "guide" would require only minor edits. Setup and thematic echo present but no causal middle work or closure linkage; cap around 4.6, adjust down for swappability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Reflecting deeply" is signaled when Kael "began to reflect deeply on his past" after gazing into the mirror. The method appears in one beat and generates interior summary but does not shape attempts or constrain tactics. Memories flood his mind without cost or friction. Functional but replaceable; setup and one-beat involvement without closure mechanics or causal pressure place it at the lower edge of the functional band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The "moonlit ridge path" anchors the setting throughout: Kael walks it from opening to close. Setup, middle presence, and closure participation are clear. However, the path supplies no resource or constraint that alters Kael's tactics; he could walk anywhere with the same internal arc. The terrain is described ("rugged," "gravel crunch") but does not pressure choice. Gate completion with minimal causal work places it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Slow dance of celestial bodies" appears three times: "the slow dance of celestial bodies above seemed to be reflected in the gentle rhythm of his footsteps," and twice more echoing the phrase. The timeframe is vague and imposes no deadline or urgency; Kael's walk could occur over minutes or hours with no tactical change. Ornamental recurrence without clock pressure or closure mechanics; setup and thematic echo without development cap around 3.8, adjust down for swappability and lack of urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>"Translate pain into a universal language" is stated twice as Kael's motivation: once in reflection, again near the end. The desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choice. No on-page friction between the want and a competing cost appears; Kael experiences no trade-off or obstacle testing this goal. Summary-only use with setup and closure mention but no middle choice or visible cost; functional but not causal.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Hard softness" is named once in the phrase "deep well of hard softness" and echoed in the final line "the hard softness that lay at the heart of the world." The tone of juxtaposed gentleness and scars threads through description (scarred yet gentle, cracked yet delicate). The tone modulates slightly with reflection but does not sharpen under pressure because pressure does not escalate. Early seed and final reprise with coherent mood but no stake-reweighting or cost connection; lyric-resonance allowance places it mid-band.</comment>
