<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The peacekeeper's motivation "to map empathy onto action" is stated rather than embodied through contradictory impulses. Her internal experience remains abstract—"calmly intuitive nature," "sense of wonder and awe"—without the embodied tension or micro-choices under pressure that would make her particular. The crystal restoration unfolds as meditative process rather than dilemma; no visible cost or foreclosed path emerges from her choices. The character functions as a vessel for atmospheric reflection rather than a mind in conflict.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the peacekeeper gathers mirror-glimpses to reconstitute the crystal, culminating in a soft blue glow and renewed resolve. Orientation anchors (lighthouse orchard, ice floes, peacekeeper) arrive early. The closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the crystal whole, balance reaffirmed, landscape sighing—but the cost is asserted ("burden of her role") rather than dramatized in a trade-off or forfeiture. One meaningful deepening occurs (crystal fragment → whole), yet the final image reconfigures more through declaration than on-page pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard above shifting ice floes and vintage store mirrors supply vivid, recurring anchors. The mirrors constrain her method (she must move mirror to mirror, seeking patterns), and the reconstituted crystal charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clear. However, the ice floes and orchard remain postcard backdrops; they do not pressure a choice or alter tactics. The mirrors' mechanics—how glimpses yield the crystal's pattern—stay vague, limiting their constraint value.</comment>

<queston>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: restore the crystal to deepen understanding and maintain balance. The piece delivers one meaningful tightening (broken fragment → reconstituted whole via mirror-work), consistent with the Accumulative lens. Yet the process unfolds without opposition, error, or trade-off; no live option is foreclosed. The ice floes "slow their restless motion" and the landscape "sighs," but these are reactions, not costs the protagonist pays. Agency reads as meditative attention rather than decision under pressure, and the resolution arrives without visible sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme—empathy mapped onto action, fragile balance, fragments hiding in plain sight—emerges through image and motif (mirrors, crystal, ice, breath). The reconstituted crystal offers a non-literal answer to the thematic question. However, the final paragraph ("in that moment…") lapses into direct thematic summary: "mapped empathy onto the shifting landscapes of the heart," "courageous anomaly had found a way to heal the fractures." This moralizing replaces earned resonance and triggers penalty per the Thematic Echo rule. Subtext operates in the mirrors and ice, but closure articulates rather than embodies.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV holds stable; the peacekeeper's perceptual filter ("calmly intuitive," "weighted breath before reply") is consistent. Diction is elevated and lyric, matching the meditative tone. However, register drifts into abstract philosophizing ("mapping of empathy," "shifting landscapes of the heart") that feels imposed rather than voice-particular. No dialogue is present. Psychic distance remains steady, and no head-hopping occurs, but the narrator's interior lacks idiosyncratic texture—phrasings such as "courageous anomaly," "reconstitute," "sentinel" read more like thematic labeling than a singular consciousness under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmically controlled and imagistically rich. Sentence variety supports the meditative pace. However, artifact patterns accumulate: paraphrase loops ("weighted breath before reply" appears three times; "shifting ice floes" / "shifting landscapes"), templated constructions ("The peacekeeper's [noun]" opener recurs six times), and stock metaphors ("mirrors seemed to loom like sentinels," "branches etched…like a delicate pen and ink drawing"). Figurative density in the final third (glow, pulse, sigh, whisper) risks overwriting without pattern-payoff. These issues dull momentum and trigger cumulative Q7 penalties (−0.8 for loops and templates, −0.3 for mixed/stock metaphor).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The shadow-laced peacekeeper, lighthouse orchard above ice, and vintage mirrors offer vivid, specific staging. Yet the premise—guardian restores magical object to maintain balance—follows a familiar template without transformation through lived cost or moral calculus. The reconstitution process is told rather than dramatized as struggle; no fresh inflection or risk elevates the material. Phrases such as "courageous anomaly," "map empathy onto action," and "weighted breath before reply" lean on abstraction rather than grounded surprise. The piece reads competent but derivative, lacking the particularity that would make this restoration story irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The peacekeeper is present throughout and her goal (restore the crystal) frames the action. She makes one key decision: to use the mirrors. However, her choices do not create reversals or alter tactics under pressure; the process unfolds as meditative observation. Setup and development gates are met, but closure participation is passive (she tucks the crystal away, walks back). Swappable with "guardian" or "keeper" without structural loss. Band: functional but replaceable. Deductions: ornamental interior (−0.5), no cost tied to her trait (−0.3). Score: 5.0 base − 0.8 = 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The broken crystal ball fragment appears early (roots of apple tree), drives the middle action (reconstitution via mirrors), and charges the final image (pulsing blue light, tucked in cloak). Three beats, clear causal role, closure linkage. However, its properties (how it was broken, why these mirrors reconstitute it) remain vague, limiting irreplaceability. Another fractured object could serve with minor edits. Band: essential across beats. Adjustments: early +0.5, three beats +1.4, closure +1.0, swappability −0.6. Base 5.5 + 2.3 = 7.8, cap at 6.8 due to mid-range specificity and no unique cost tied to this exact fragment.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Courageous anomaly" is a label applied to the peacekeeper three times but never dramatized as stake or tactic. It does not constrain choice or shape a turn; removing the phrase would not alter plot. Setup gate met (paragraph 3), but no development or payoff. Band: ornamental. Deductions: label-only (−0.3), no causal pressure (−0.6). Score: 3.0 + 0.1 (mention) − 0.9 = 2.2, rounded to 3.1 for setup presence.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Calmly intuitive" is introduced early and attributed to her navigation of the landscape and mirror-gazing. However, it remains a descriptor rather than a trait that constrains or enables action with visible cost. No on-page moment shows intuition failing or costing her an alternative. Setup gate met, weak development (mirror method loosely tied), no payoff. Band: functional but replaceable. Deductions: label-only (−0.3), no tradeoff (−0.5). Score: 4.0 − 0.8 = 3.2, adjusted to 3.4 for thematic consistency.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Reconstitute" is the central action: the peacekeeper's goal, the mirror process, and the closure image all hinge on it. Early setup (paragraph 7 "itched to reconstitute"), middle beats (paragraphs 16–18), and payoff (paragraph 19 "reconstituted crystal pulsed"). Removing this exact action would break story logic. Band: essential. Adjustments: early +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure +1.2, causal +1.0. Base 5.5 + 3.7 = 9.2, capped at 7.1 because the process mechanics (how glimpses yield wholeness) are vague, limiting irreplaceability and cost specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The vintage store mirrors are introduced (paragraph 8), shape the middle method (paragraphs 12–16: "move from mirror to mirror, gazing"), and return at closure (paragraph 31). However, their mechanics—how glimpses reconstitute the crystal—remain opaque. Another reflective surface could substitute with edits. Setup +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure +0.8, swappability −0.7. Base 5.0 + 1.6 = 6.6, reduced to 5.9 for lack of unique causal pressure (the mirrors enable but do not constrain or impose cost).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard above shifting ice floes anchors the opening and closing and supplies vivid atmosphere. However, the setting does not pressure a choice or supply resources that alter outcome; it remains descriptive backdrop. Setup gate met (paragraph 1), no development (action occurs inside the lighthouse), weak payoff (she walks back through orchard). Band: functional but replaceable. Adjustments: early +0.4, closure mention +0.3, ornamental −0.6. Score: 4.0 + 0.1 = 4.1, raised to 4.8 for strong atmospheric coherence and reprise.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"The weighted breath before reply" appears as metaphor in paragraphs 2, 24, and 32 but does not function as a timeframe that tightens decisions. No clock, deadline, or urgency constrains the peacekeeper's mirror-work. The phrase evokes tone rather than temporal pressure. Setup gate met (early mention), no development or payoff as time constraint. Band: ornamental. Deductions: metaphor-only (−0.6), no tactical pressure (−0.5). Score: 3.0 − 1.1 = 1.9, adjusted to 2.6 for thematic reprise.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"To map empathy onto action" is stated as her motivation (paragraph 14) and echoed at closure (paragraph 30), but it is never dramatized as a conflicted choice with friction or cost. The mirrors and crystal work proceeds smoothly; no tension between empathy and a competing want or fear. Setup gate met (paragraph 14), weak closure participation (told rather than enacted). Band: functional but replaceable. Deductions: told-only (−0.7), no friction (−0.5). Score: 5.0 − 1.2 = 3.8, raised to 4.9 for thematic coherence and reprise at closure.</comment>
