<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Kael remains a cipher throughout—"diminutive titan" and "regally unpretentious" are labels never dramatized through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The protagonist performs research and leaves messages in pure summary; no embodied emotion, no visible stakes that test commitment. The pretender's unmasking happens entirely off-stage in dialogue reported as "gentle rebuke," with no interiority to make the cost of this long vigil felt. Internal conflict is absent; Kael executes a plan without friction, doubt, or visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as loosely Accumulative (titan weaves messages over time), but the closure—Kael speaks, pretender crumbles, titan vanishes—occurs entirely in summary without on-page cost or a legible before/after. The Orientation Test is violated: who Kael is, what "diminutive titan" means in this world, and what the pretender seeks remain vague past 120 words and never anchor. No meaningful tightening appears; the "final confrontation" is narrated as outcome, not dramatized choice. Causality is skeletal: "cryptic messages" → "pretender revealed" with no mechanics shown.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The temple library is described with vivid sensory anchors—aged parchment, candlelight, cold stone—and the iron gall ink pellet appears twice (open beside Kael, then discarded). However, setting never constrains a choice or alters tactics; it remains postcard backdrop. The "rune of drift" and "pause of shifting constellations" are atmospheric but never shown shaping access, proximity, or cost. No micro-setting or tool changes the protagonist's approach on the page.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—unmask the pretender—is declared but never tested on the page. Kael works "tirelessly" in pure summary; no reversal, no tightening, no moment where a message fails or the pretender adapts. The "final confrontation" telescopes from anticipation to "revealed in all their duplicity" without showing the exchange or its cost. Agency is absent: luck and exposition resolve everything off-stage. No escalation under any lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>A theme of patient revelation versus ambition emerges, but it arrives through assertion ("patient work would be vindicated") rather than embodied particulars. The "rune of drift" and "graceful collapse" are invoked as symbols without scene-work to anchor them. The ending moralizes: "a reminder of the power of truth and the unyielding dedication"—a thesis statement rather than resonant image. No earned insight tied to specific struggle; the pretender's "duplicity" is told, not shown.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and the perceptual frame remains with Kael, but the narrative voice is generic high-fantasy register ("regally unpretentious demeanor," "gentle rustle of leaves") without character-specific idiom. Diction is elevated and uniform, lacking modulation under pressure. The pretender's brief dialogue is summarized ("words, laced with the power of the rune") rather than rendered. Filter verbs and stock phrasing ("like two glittering stars") dull immediacy throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "cryptic messages" restated across five paragraphs without new detail, "patient work" and "slow accumulation" echoed, and the ending recaps "diminutive titan" and "iron gall ink pellet" in near-identical phrasing. Template cadence: "As the constellations…, Kael worked…" / "As the days turned…, Kael's presence…" / "As the darkness…, Kael's heart…" in three successive paragraphs. Figurative language is stock ("like two glittering stars," "gentle rustle of leaves"). Information density is low; many sentences restate the same concept. Apply −1.4 for loops and template stems, plus −0.3 for figurative clichés at peak beats, totaling −1.7 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The premise—hidden messages in a library to unmask a pretender—is familiar chosen-one fantasy without transformation. "Diminutive titan," "rune of drift," and "pause of shifting constellations" are genre labels assembled without fresh synthesis. No specific, lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus; the protagonist's method and the pretender's downfall follow template beats. The tone and voice read like aggregated high-fantasy conventions rather than a singular perspective. Transformation test fails: swap names and the arc is unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Kael is present throughout but makes no on-page decisions that alter tactics or options. "Diminutive titan" appears in the opening and final paragraphs as a label; the attribute never constrains or enables action with visible cost. All key turns (leaving messages, awaiting the pretender, speaking the unmasking words) are summarized rather than dramatized. No middle development or closure participation beyond summary mention. Cap at 2.8 for missing closure participation; apply −0.5 for ornamental/summary-only use.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The iron gall ink pellet appears in two beats: open beside Kael in the middle section, then discarded on the floor at the end. However, its use is described ("Kael used to record cryptic messages") rather than shown in action, and its final state (empty, discarded) does not reweight meaning or cost—it's a postscript detail. Setup and payoff gates are met, but middle development is weak and no causal pressure or closure linkage. Cap at 4.6 for missing strong middle development; descriptive use lowers further to ~4.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>The "rune of drift" is mentioned three times as a theme symbol ("symbol of ancient power," "key to Kael's plan," "words laced with the power of") but never shown shaping on-page choices or altering options. No mechanics, no cost, no middle beat where it constrains action. Setup is vague, no middle development, and at closure it appears only as a decorative label in the pretender's unmasking. Cap at 2.8 for missing closure participation; ornamental use lowers the score within that band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Regally unpretentious" appears once as a label in paragraph 4 ("The titan's regally unpretentious demeanor belied the intensity of their focus") without constraining or enabling any on-page action. No setup, no middle development, no closure participation—it's a descriptive flourish. Absent any causal work or cost, the score trends low within the ornamental band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>1.2</grade><comment>"Sunder" appears once in the middle as a thematic description: the rune "held the power to sunder the very fabric of reality." No character performs this action on the page, and no turn traces to it. The verb is flavor text, easily swappable. Ornamental mention without beat involvement or closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Through cryptic messages left in library books" is the stated method, signaled in paragraph 5 and echoed across the middle. However, the mechanics are never shown—no message content, no observer reaction, no moment where a message succeeds or fails. At closure, the method is summarized ("Kael's cryptic messages") but does not shape the final confrontation. Setup and middle mention are present (two gates), but no dramatized causal work. Functional but replaceable; summary-only use caps at ~3.8, with minor deductions for lack of specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The ancient temple library is established early with vivid anchors (parchment, candles, cold stone) and remains the sole location throughout, satisfying setup and continuous presence. However, the setting never constrains a choice or supplies a resource that alters outcome—it's atmospheric backdrop. At closure, the temple is mentioned ("the cold, unforgiving light of the temple") but does not charge the final image with spatial or access-based pressure. Two gates met (setup, closure mention), but no middle development where the space shapes tactics. Cap at ~6.0 for two gates; lack of causal pressure or choice constraint lowers to ~4.8.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "pause of shifting constellations" is mentioned in paragraphs 8, 15, and implied in "days turned into weeks, and weeks into months," but no clock tightens decisions. Time is decorative: Kael works "tirelessly," and the pretender arrives when the plot requires it. No live deadline, no moment where the pause's end forces a tactic shift. Setup is vague, middle is summary-only, and closure does not depend on the constellations. Cap at 2.8 for missing closure participation; vague tracking and ornamental use lower further.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"To unmask a pretender to the throne" is stated as Kael's goal in paragraph 9 and repeated in the ending, satisfying setup and closure mention. However, the desire is never dramatized through conflicted choices or visible cost—Kael executes the plan in summary without friction, doubt, or trade-off. No middle beat where the goal is tested or adapted. Two gates met (setup, closure), but no development or felt cost. Cap at ~6.0 for two gates; told-only and lack of friction lower to ~4.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Graceful collapse" is named explicitly in paragraph 18 ("The tone of the moment was one of graceful collapse") and echoed in the ending's imagery of the pretender's facade crumbling. Setup is late (67% mark), middle development is absent, and at closure the tone is asserted rather than modulated through rhythm or syntax. The phrase feels ornamental—a label rather than an embodied tonal shift. Late introduction caps at 4.6; label-only use and lack of modulation lower to ~3.2.</comment>
