<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The dresser remains thinly characterized, defined primarily by devotion and pragmatism labels rather than contradictory impulses under pressure. No micro-choices reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost; the marble-polishing ritual is described but never tests competing desires. The conviction that "gardens know their gardeners" is stated rather than dramatized through choice, and the "mended deception" backstory is alluded to but never concretized in a way that shapes present action. The piece reads as portrait rather than character under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: who, where, and when anchor after ~120 words; "after luck became measurable" remains abstract and unexploited. The piece follows an Accumulative lens but no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with visible cost occurs on the page—the dresser continues tending, polishing, and vanishing into shadows without foreclosing a path or crystallizing a stance. The ending offers atmospheric repetition ("the garden maze...stood as a monument") rather than a charged final image that reweights prior material. No causal linkage or meaningful tightening; the narrative describes a static devotion across seasons without escalation or closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The garden maze setting is vivid and sensory ("scent of blooming flowers and the gentle withering of spent blossoms"), but it remains decorative rather than constraining choice or supplying resources that alter outcome. Spatial choreography is clear, and the "withering beauty" tone integrates with the flora descriptions. The marbles and vines are handled across beats, giving the piece a micro-setting quality, yet neither the maze's paths nor the garden's measurable luck pressures a decision on the page.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to prove that gardens know their gardeners"—is declared but never tested by on-page opposition or reversal. No meaningful tightening, deepening, or turn narrows options; the dresser's actions (pruning, polishing, surveying) cycle without escalation or cost. Luck becoming measurable is mentioned but never constrains a tactic or forces a trade-off. The piece describes a static devotion without agency choices that foreclose paths or alter stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The theme of nurturing and silent dialogue emerges from images and motifs, avoiding overt statement until late paragraphs where "mended deception" and "truth that was both simple and profound" drift toward abstraction. The marbles recur and shift from reminder of loss to symbol of mended peace, a valid thematic arc, but the final lines ("gardens know their gardeners," "the power of dedication") lean toward summary rather than a resonant, non-literal answer. The marble motif earns partial credit for accumulating meaning, yet late thematic statements ("the garden, in its own way, knew them") replace scene pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited, and diction ("bittersweet aroma," "ritualistic quality") establishes a lyric register consistent with the contemplative tone. Perceptual signature is present but generic—filtered through reverence rather than character-specific bias. Multiple sentence stems recur ("The dresser, [aware/wise/once]..."; "As the [sun/seasons/night]...") creating template cadence, and figurative language ("monument to the power of dedication") inflates at closure without tightening pressure. No dialogue appears. The prose is competent but lacks rhythmic control under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn appear throughout: "testament to years of toil" / "testament to the dresser's devotion"; "knowing that the garden...knew them"; multiple paragraphs restate the dresser's devotion without advancing pressure. Template cadence runs dominate ("As the seasons passed," "As the sun began to set," "As the night deepened"). Figurative language is dense but often mixed or stock ("narrative of growth," "pulse, a rhythm," "beacons in the fading light"). These artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering the artifact cap. Information density is low; many sentences paraphrase prior claims.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The vine-dresser and garden-maze premise is familiar; "luck becomes measurable" is introduced but unexploited, reading as decorative world-building rather than a transformed constraint. The marbles and polishing ritual offer texture but no fresh inflection or non-obvious synthesis. The emotional arc—devotion leading to silent understanding—follows a predictable path without risk or surprise. The piece remains in the safety middle, avoiding bold structural or perspectival choices.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The withered vine dresser is present throughout and performs repeated actions (pruning, polishing, surveying), but makes no decisions that create key turns or alter tactics. Observation and description dominate; the dresser's choices are habitual rather than under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The cracked marble collection appears in multiple beats (introduction, polishing ritual, final image) and shifts meaning from reminder of loss to symbol of mended peace. However, the marbles are never handled in a way that constrains a choice or enables a tactic; they remain symbolic rather than causal. Purposeful reprise elevates the score into mid-band, but lack of causal pressure caps it below 5.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>1.2</grade><comment>"Mended deception" is mentioned twice in the final third as abstract backstory ("a mended deception that had brought the dresser to this place") but never dramatized or shown to shape stakes, tactics, or choices on the page. It reads as thematic echo rather than causal force.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Wisely pragmatic" is stated once ("The dresser, wisely pragmatic, had adapted to this new reality") as a label without visible tradeoffs or on-page actions that demonstrate the trait constraining or enabling a choice with cost. The dresser's optimization of garden output is summarized, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Polishing appears in multiple beats (commemorating victories, restoring luster, final return of marbles) and structures the dresser's ritualistic actions. The act recurs with reweighted meaning (loss → mended peace) and shapes the final image. However, no major turn traces to polishing; the dresser could commemorate victories through other means without breaking story logic. The element is purposeful but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Commemorating small victories elaborately (polishing marbles for first bloom, successful grafting) is signaled early and its mechanics matter to the dresser's ritual. The method appears in multiple beats and charges the ending image. However, it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics under pressure; it remains expressive rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The garden maze setting is established early and provides vivid sensory detail across beats, but it does not pressure choices or supply resources that affect outcome. The maze's paths "weaving a narrative" and the dresser vanishing into shadows are atmospheric rather than causal. Postcard description dominates over tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"After luck becomes measurable" is stated in the first third but never tightens decisions or alters tactics. The garden's "measurable luck" is mentioned as backdrop without shaping the dresser's choices or the story's escalation. Time remains vague and untracked; seasons pass without pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to prove that gardens know their gardeners" is stated explicitly and recurs, but it is never dramatized through conflicted choices or tested by opposition. The dresser's conviction drives devotion but faces no friction between wants and costs; it is described rather than enacted under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Blooming withering" tone is coherent and consistent, woven through imagery ("vibrant colors and fading light," "withering beauty," "bittersweet aroma") and modulating with the elegiac mood. The oxymoron charges descriptions and recurs in the final third. However, tone remains static rather than escalating with pressure; the mood is singular and does not shift at closure to reweight the dominant stake.</comment>
