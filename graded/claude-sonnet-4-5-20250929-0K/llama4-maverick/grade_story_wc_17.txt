<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The cartographer remains a label rather than an embodied presence with contradictory impulses under pressure. Interiority consists of generic observations ("felt a shiver," "mind racing") without specific sensory anchors or visible micro-choices that foreclose paths. The "sensitively perceptive nature" is asserted but never dramatized through a trade-off or cost. No meaningful change occurs; the cartographer simply continues mapping with "newfound purpose" that arrives unearned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive adequately by the first paragraph. However, no on-page closure unit exists: the cartographer discovers artifacts, reads diaries, and decides to continue work—a summary of intent rather than a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with visible cost. The ending ("departed...left behind a piece of themselves") is abstract declaration without a final image that reweights prior material. Drive lens reads as intended Accumulative but never tightens or breaks cadence to land a closure effect.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The ivy-veiled passage and fireplace provide spatial grounding, and the film strip/diaries anchor discovery beats. However, setting remains postcard description ("long shadows," "cold and dark hearth") without constraining a choice or charging the final image. The "climate shifts" mentioned twice never pressure tactics or alter the cartographer's access. Micro-setting (body, tool, recurring object) is present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding the estate's secrets—is signaled early but never tested. No reversal, tightening choice, or visible cost appears: the cartographer seeks, finds, reads, and continues with no narrowed options or forfeited path. "Legacy's burden" is theme-claimed, not dramatized as a trade-off. Coincidental discovery (film strip hidden in plaster, diaries in fireplace) supplies information without the protagonist's agency shaping escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme (legacy, walls' dreams, preservation) is asserted through direct statements ("legacy's burden was not just a weight to be carried, but a story to be told") rather than emergent from scene particulars. The final paragraph moralizes closure instead of offering a resonant image: "their work would be a part of the estate's legacy, forever entwined with the walls' dreams." No conceptual repricing occurs because the cartographer's relationship to the work never shifts with visible cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>POV distance is stable third-limited, but diction frequently drifts into elevated abstraction ("testament to the lives that had once flourished," "enduring power of legacy") mismatched to the cartographer's on-page perceptual signature. Recycled sentence stems appear across beats: "The cartographer's..." opens five paragraphs, flattening rhythm. No dialogue; internal voice lacks specificity. Psychic distance remains uniform without modulation under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: paragraphs 11–12 repeat "the estate was more than stone and mortar / a testament"; paragraphs 16–17 restate the cartographer's role in preservation. Template cadence runs cluster in the final third: "The cartographer's work...," "The cartographer's journey...," "As they departed..." Stock metaphors ("mind racing," "shiver run down their spine") and filter-verb stacks ("seemed to," "began to") dull immediacy in peak beats. These artifacts touch the closure zone, triggering the −1.7 and 9+ disallowance per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The core premise—cartographer maps estate, finds hidden relics—follows a familiar discovery template without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. "What walls dream about" is poetic phrasing but remains abstract; no fresh angle emerges from the climate-shift frame or the cartographer's method. The ending recycles preservation-as-legacy without a twist earned in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The corridor echo cartographer is named and present throughout but makes no decision that alters tactics or forecloses a path. Observation (examining film, reading diaries) dominates; the final "continued their work" is summary intent, not a pivotal choice. Present in closure paragraph but not causally active there.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The film negative strip appears in three beats: unfolding (para 1), examination (para 5–6), and rewinding (para 13), then mentioned again near the end. It triggers the search for more information but does not constrain a choice or return with reweighted meaning at closure. Functional across beats but swappable with any hidden artifact.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Legacy's burden" is named twice and echoed thematically but never dramatizes a cost or choice. The cartographer reads about it in diaries and declares it "not just a weight...but a story to be told"—theme claim without on-page friction. Present in setup and thematic reflection but absent from middle development and closure pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Sensitively perceptive" is asserted in para 2 and 18 but never enables or constrains an action with visible cost. The cartographer "picked up on subtle cues" (told summary) without dramatizing a trade-off between perception and another need. Label-only mention.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Glimpse" appears three times: para 5 (film images flicker to life in mind's eye), para 15 (glimpse of walls' dreams), para 24 (glimpse into the past). The first triggers examination; the others are metaphoric recaps. No major turn traces uniquely to this action; easily swappable with "discovery" or "insight."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Half-burned diaries found in a fireplace are introduced in para 7, used in para 8 to piece together the past, and mentioned again near the end. The method shapes one beat (reading to understand history) and is present at closure mention but does not constrain attempts or force a tactical choice. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The ivy-veiled passage frames the opening and closing paragraphs and is mentioned mid-story ("seemed to grow darker"). It provides atmospheric setting but does not pressure a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome. Lyric reprise without causal pressure or cost.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"After the climate shifts" appears in para 1 and is referenced once more (para 9: family struggles). The timeframe does not tighten decisions or tactics; no live clock or deadline. Mentioned but ornamental to escalation and closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"To discover what walls dream about" is stated in para 3 and echoed in para 15 and the ending. The motivation frames the cartographer's project but is never conflicted on the page—no friction between this want and a competing cost or fear. Told desire without dramatized trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>N/A</grade><comment>Tone requirement is "None."</comment>
