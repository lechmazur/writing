<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Kaito's interior life is largely told through abstract labels—"emotional numbness," "identity crisis," "newfound sense of clarity"—rather than embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The brain-in-jar symbol remains static decoration; he never handles it or makes a choice shaped by its presence. The clone custody battle is pure backstory with no on-page pressure, and the final "transformation" arrives as assertion rather than earned change. Therapy-speak pervades peak beats without dramatized cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive quickly, but the piece offers no legible closure unit—no decisive change, no renunciation with visible cost, no final image that reweights prior material. Kaito meditates, feels peace, and walks out; the "journey" is recounted in summary without causal pressure or a before/after that foreclosed a path. The inferred lens (Accumulative/Textural) never coheres because no density increase or cadence shift lands at the end. History "rewriting itself" is mentioned but never constrains a choice or alters tactics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The floating-rock dojo is vividly named but functions as postcard backdrop; it never constrains a choice or supplies a resource that affects outcome. The brain-in-jar sits on a shelf across multiple paragraphs without Kaito touching it, moving it, or using its proximity to force a micro-decision. Sensory detail is generic ("air thick with tension," "hum of levitation engines") and not filtered through Kaito's professional or personal lens.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"defeating emotional numbness"—is declared but never tested on the page by a choice that forecloses an option or imposes visible cost. No reversal, no tightening: Kaito meditates, feels energy, and achieves peace without friction. The clone custody battle and history-rewriting timeframe are mentioned but do not complicate or narrow his options in scene. Escalation is absent; the final paragraph asserts resolution rather than dramatizing it.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Theme is stated overtly—"embracing contradictions," "vivify his true nature"—rather than arising from concrete particulars. The brain-in-jar recurs as a static symbol without shifting meaning across beats. The ending offers a thesis ("he was ready") instead of a resonant image that reweights prior material. No non-literal answer to a central question; only direct moralizing about self-discovery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping, and perceptual stance remains consistent. However, diction frequently drifts into elevated, abstract register—"vivify," "contradictions within himself," "catalyst for the growth"—that feels more like prompt echo than character-specific thought. Filter verbs ("seemed," "felt," "appeared") cluster in high-pressure beats without voice motivation, dulling immediacy. No dialogue present to assess.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "emotional numbness" appears five times, "vivify" three times without added pressure; "identity crisis" and "clone custody battle" recycle as summary. Template cadence dominates—"As he [verb], [noun] [verb]" across a dozen sentences. Figurative language is stock: "weight of uncertainty," "fire of his own inner struggle," "sense of peace settle over him" (twice). The final third is thick with scaffold ("a sense of," "seemed to") and synonym churn ("clarity and purpose," "fully alive" repeated). Line-level artifacts touch the closure beat, disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The core premise—ego-death survivor meditating in a sci-fi dojo to resolve clone-custody trauma—reads as a checklist response to the prompt rather than an organic synthesis. "Complementary opposites," "vivify," and "slices through pretense" appear as unintegrated labels. The emotional arc (numbness → peace via meditation) is a familiar template executed without a fresh inflection or non-obvious turn. Removal of the floating dojo or brain-in-jar would not alter the plot or emotional stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Kaito is labeled an "ego death survivor" in the opening paragraph but this past event does not shape any on-page choice or tactic. The attribute is mentioned once and never returns or constrains his meditation practice. Present only as backstory; no causal pressure or closure linkage. Late first appearance and swappability cap at 4.6; ornamental use and lack of beat involvement lower to mid-2s.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The brain-in-jar appears in three paragraphs but is never handled, moved, or used; Kaito only looks at it. It does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic. The final mention ("seemed to fade into the background") is passive summary, not a reweighted image that charges closure. Present in setup and mentioned near the end, but no middle development or causal work. Two-gate partial (setup + weak ending cameo) with ornamental use and swappability cap at ~3.8; no cost connection lowers further.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>The clone custody battle is recounted as past backstory ("once a source of great pain," "now seemed like a distant memory") without shaping any on-page stake or tactic. It does not narrow options, impose cost, or participate in the closure. Present only as a label in setup and summary; no beat involvement or causal pressure. Missing middle development and closure participation; swappability and summary-only use pull to low band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.0</grade><comment>"Slices through pretense" appears once as narrative summary ("Kaito's eyes sliced through the pretense") without enabling or constraining an action. No on-page cost, no visible tradeoff, no second beat. Label-only mention in the first third; no middle development or closure linkage. Missing two gates and ornamental use cap at 2.8; no specificity or causal work lowers to 2.0.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>"Vivify" appears three times as a thematic label ("to vivify," "vivify his true self," "vivify his true nature") but never as a dramatized action that changes options or imposes cost. Kaito does not perform a specific act of vivification that drives a turn. Present as abstract claim; no causal pressure, no closure linkage beyond a final-paragraph echo. Swappable with "awaken" or "realize"; summary-only use and late repetition without cost cap at low band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.2</grade><comment>"Complementary opposites" is mentioned once in the first third as a practice Kaito "hopes" to use, then never demonstrated through specific technique, choice, or cost. No mechanics shown; no middle beat where the method enables or constrains tactics. The final paragraph alludes to "opposites within him began to reconcile" but offers no on-page action. Missing middle development and closure participation; label-only and swappable cap at 2.8; no specificity lowers to 2.2.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>The floating rock dojo is named early and appears in the final paragraph ("stepped out of the dojo") but never pressures a choice or supplies a resource. Description is postcard ("suspended high above the earth," "a world unto itself") without spatial constraint or tactical use. Present in setup and ending cameo, but no middle development where the setting alters options. Two-gate partial with ornamental use caps at ~4.6; no causal pressure or cost lowers to 3.0.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.5</grade><comment>"History rewrites itself" is mentioned in three paragraphs as ambient context ("timeline in flux," "world below continued to change") but never tightens a decision or alters Kaito's tactics. No clock, no visible consequence of the rewriting on his meditation or choices. Present as background claim; no middle development or closure linkage. Missing all three gates and ornamental use cap at 2.8; no causal work lowers to 1.5.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Defeat emotional numbness" is declared as Kaito's goal in the opening and restated across multiple beats, but no on-page choice dramatizes friction between this want and a cost. The "defeat" is asserted in summary at the end ("would not be defeated") without a visible forfeiture or tactic shift. Present in setup and ending, weak middle mention; no causal pressure or visible cost. Two-gate partial with told-only execution and swappability cap at ~4.6; lack of cost connection lowers to 3.8.</comment>
