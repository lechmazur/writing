<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Emilia's interiority is present but abstract—"turmoil that churned beneath her surface" and "subtly confident demeanor" are labels, not embodied contradictions. Her micro-choices (tracing pages, deciphering the pattern) advance plot but lack visible cost or competing impulses in the moment. The "fierce determination" repeated throughout reads as assertion rather than dramatized struggle under pressure. No meaningful alteration or renunciation with felt consequence appears on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Causal-quest with Accumulative texture, but the closure unit is absent: Emilia walks onto the ice toward an off-page convergence with no on-page Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing. The pattern on the glass is cracked as a puzzle but does not reweight prior stakes or foreclose a path with visible cost—she simply continues her journey. Orientation anchors (outpost, frozen lake, Emilia) arrive early, waiving that penalty, but the ending delivers anticipation rather than closure. The Cost proof test fails: no exact sentence shows a price paid or option foreclosed at the final beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The outpost and frozen lake are vividly sketched with sensory economy (crunch of snow, wood smoke, golden sunset glow). Spatial choreography is clean through the buildings and onto the ice. However, setting functions primarily as atmospheric backdrop; the ice and outpost do not constrain a choice or charge the final image—Emilia walks forward unimpeded. Micro-setting (windowpane, phrasebook) is handled but does not alter tactics at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding the convergence—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the condensation pattern is decoded, narrowing her search direction. However, no on-page reversal or visible cost alters tactics afterward; the decoded message simply permits continuation rather than forcing a trade-off. Agency at closure is continuation, not a decision that forecloses a path. The Cost clarity test in the final third is not met: no visible price or loss appears on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Theme of quest and discovery emerges through concrete images (phrasebook, falcon, convergence) rather than assertion. The final image—Emilia stepping onto the ice under stars—offers poetic resonance but does not reweight prior material with a non-literal answer; it reiterates the search rather than repricing it. The phrasebook mantra recurs but remains ornamental; no earned insight or conceptual shift lands on the page. Thematic potential is present but not fulfilled at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Narrative distance is stable third-limited; no head-hopping. Diction is consistent and moderately textured ("dry-witted," "forsaken," "harbinger"). However, perceptual signature is generic—Emilia's way of noticing reads as neutral observer rather than character-specific bias. Repeated constructions ("As she…," "The world was…") create template cadence in the final third, mildly dulling propulsion. No dialogue to assess. Voice is competent but not distinctive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Clarity and grammar are clean; no causality breaks. However, paraphrase loops and synonym churn appear throughout: "worrying sense of anticipation" / "sense of awe" / "sense of connection" / "sense of trepidation" recur without added pressure. The final six paragraphs loop through variants of "the journey," "the mystery," "the discovery" with little new information. Template cadence ("As she walked…," "The world was…," "Emilia felt…") runs across multiple sentences in the closing third, applying −0.5 in Q7 and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact penalty pack. Information density is moderate; many lines restate stakes rather than advance them.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The core premise—atlas editor seeking a geographical convergence—offers a fresh angle on the quest template. However, the emotional arc and plot structure remain generic: discover clue, decode message, set out toward goal. The "singular convergence" and falcon as harbinger are intriguing but underexploited; no transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The piece reads competent but safe, avoiding bold structural or perspectival risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Emilia is present throughout and her search drives the sequence. However, her choices are continuations rather than turns: she explores, deciphers, and walks forward without a key decision that narrows options or alters tactics with visible cost. The decoding beat is the closest to agency, but it unlocks continuation rather than a trade-off. Observation dominates; no moment where competing impulses force a choice that changes the story's trajectory.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The phrasebook appears twice: Emilia traces its dog-ear early and whispers its words near the end. Setup and payoff gates are met, but middle development is absent—it does not constrain or enable a choice. The reprise recharges the mantra motif but does not reweight the stake with new cost or meaning. The object is present and thematically consistent but functionally ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The singular convergence frames the quest from the opening and is reiterated as Emilia's goal. It shapes her tactics (tracking leads, decoding the pattern) and is named in the final paragraph. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. However, the concept remains abstract and off-page; no on-page moment dramatizes what the convergence *is* or how it alters options. It functions as a MacGuffin rather than a constraint with visible mechanics or cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Subtly confident" is mentioned twice as a label ("subtly confident demeanor," "subtly confident stride") but never constrains or enables an action with visible cost. No trade-off or friction arises from the trait. It reads as authorial assertion rather than embodied quality that shapes a choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Herald" appears once in summary ("to herald the discovery") without dramatization. The decision to share the news is stated but not enacted or tested on the page. No turn traces to this action; the moment is easily swappable with "announce," "proclaim," or similar verbs. It arrives mid-story and does not participate in closure, missing the payoff gate.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The condensation pattern is introduced, examined, and decoded across two beats in the middle third. Its mechanics matter: Emilia works to decipher it, and the solution provides directional information. Setup and development gates are met. However, it does not appear in or shape the ending; once decoded, it vanishes. The method drives one key turn but does not charge closure, missing the payoff gate.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The rusted outpost and frozen lake are vividly rendered and anchor the entire sequence. They supply concrete resources (windowpane, buildings to explore) and pressure Emilia's urgency through isolation and harshness. Setup, development, and payoff gates are all met: the outpost frames the opening, supplies the decoding beat, and the lake is the final image. The setting does not constrain a choice with visible cost but provides coherent spatial logic and atmospheric charge throughout.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The falcon's return is mentioned once as a local legend that signals seasonal change and heightens Emilia's urgency. It does not tighten decisions or alter tactics on the page. The timeframe remains vague; no live clock or deadline forces a trade-off. Setup is present (locals' saying), but development and payoff are absent. The element is atmospheric rather than functional.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Emilia's desire to find the convergence is stated early, sustained through her tracking and decoding work, and reiterated at closure. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. The motivation drives her actions across multiple beats (exploring, decoding, walking onto the ice). However, it is told more than dramatized: no visible friction between want and cost, no competing desire that creates internal conflict. The motivation shapes the arc but lacks embodied struggle.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Worrying tranquility" is named twice and evoked through the stillness, silence, and ominous calm of the setting. The tone is coherent and modulates slightly as urgency rises. Setup and closure participation are present (opening silence, final "worrying tranquility" on the ice). However, the tone does not shift decisively under pressure; it remains a static backdrop rather than charging the final image with new meaning. Mid-band for consistent presence without transformation.</comment>
