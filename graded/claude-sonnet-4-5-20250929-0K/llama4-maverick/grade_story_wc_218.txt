<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The caretaker remains a one-note figure whose "brazen calm" is asserted rather than embodied through contradictory impulses. No micro-choices under pressure appear; the protagonist moves through a montage of activities without visible internal conflict or trade-offs. The terminal diagnosis arrives as a plot device that declares urgency but never dramatizes it through a single hesitation, regret, or moment where fear and purpose collide. Interiority consists entirely of summary statements about beliefs and satisfaction, not lived thought under stress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed well past 120 words—by line 4 we have "island caretaker," "temple orchard," and "living stone pillars," but no anchored scene, no present tense action, and no legible timeframe until the diagnosis arrives mid-story (−0.4 in Q2; Q3 capped at 7.0). The piece operates as a life-summary montage rather than a continuous scene or two-shard window, violating the 600–800 word scope defaults without teaching a mosaic pattern or providing legible transitions. No on-page closure unit exists: the caretaker's work "continued" and "would live on," but no decisive change, earned stasis with visible cost, or conceptual repricing occurs in the final image. The ending recounts legacy in abstract terms ("a reminder of the power") rather than landing a concrete, charged moment. The drive lens remains ambiguous throughout—neither causal linkage, accumulative pattern-break, nor situational crystallization coheres at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The orchard, living stone pillars, and copper wire are described with moderate vividness but remain postcard elements; none constrains a choice or alters a tactic. Spatial choreography is vague—no legible distances, no body-environment interaction beyond "walked through" and "wrapped." The 9+ gate (environment/body/tool constrains choice or charges final image) is not met, capping the category at 8.8 even if other elements were strong. Sensory selection defaults to generic "scent of blooming flowers" and "soft hum of insects" without POV filter or urgency modulation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"foster interspecies respect"—is declared but never tested on the page through a dilemma, reversal, or choice that narrows options. No escalation occurs; the work proceeds smoothly ("the orchard began to transform," "flourished") without friction, failure, or visible cost. The terminal diagnosis could tighten urgency but instead functions as background context; no scene shows the caretaker weighing time against ambition or sacrificing one task for another. Agency is absent: the protagonist observes and records outcomes rather than making decisions under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Theme is stated rather than emergent: "interspecies respect," "harmonizing the natural and built environments," and "power of their gently systematic approach" are asserted in exposition. The copper wire and botanical diary recur but do not shift meaning or constrain choices, failing the motif test. The ending paragraph ("a reminder of the power...") delivers a thematic summary rather than a resonant, non-literal answer to a dramatized question. No earned insight arises from on-page struggle; the caretaker's satisfaction is reported, not felt.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Narrative distance is stable but generic; perceptual signature is absent—the caretaker notices in textbook-neutral prose without bias or selective attention shaped by expertise or dying urgency. Reflection dominates (well over 30% of text) without anchoring in present stimuli or micro-choices that alter tactics. Register occasionally drifts into corporate-speak ("repository of their experiments," "promote a sense of respect and reciprocity") that sits uneasily with a solitary island caretaker. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not scored.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "the orchard began to transform" / "the temple orchard became a haven"; "brazen calm" appears three times; "gently systematic approach" recurs without variation. Template cadence dominates sentence openings: "The caretaker [verb]" (five instances), "As [clause]" (four instances), creating rhythmic monotony. Information density is low—long stretches restate the same content (e.g., paragraphs 10–12 loop on "legacy" and "lasting tribute"). Baseline artifact penalty −1.0 in Q7; artifacts touch the closure paragraph ("a reminder" × 3), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The premise—dying caretaker creates a legacy garden—follows a familiar template without transformation. The copper-wire method is mentioned but never mechanized or made specific enough to feel invented rather than generic. "Interspecies respect" and "harmonizing natural and built environments" read as prompt labels rather than lived stakes. The ending's language ("a lasting tribute," "the power of interspecies respect") could apply to countless legacy stories. No bold structural or perspectival risk elevates the execution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>The caretaker is present throughout but makes no on-page choices that create turns. All action is recounted in summary ("set out to remodel," "continued to tend") without dramatized decision points. Setup is satisfied (paragraph 1), but middle development and closure participation are absent—the final paragraphs describe outcomes rather than showing the caretaker acting or crystallizing stance. Missing middle development caps at 3.4; missing closure participation caps at 2.8; lowest cap wins.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The botanical diary appears in paragraph 1 (setup), is mentioned again in paragraphs 6 and 13 (three total touches across beats), but is never handled or opened on the page—no concrete use constrains a choice or shapes a tactic. The diary does not appear in or shape the ending; "testament to their life's work" is a thematic claim, not closure participation. Missing closure participation caps at 2.8. Two beats and early signal lift slightly, but static description without action pressure limits the score to 3.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Architectural secrets" are mentioned in paragraph 2 (setup) and invoked as context in paragraph 4 ("using their understanding"), but the secrets themselves never constrain a choice or alter tactics—the caretaker simply "used" them without on-page discovery, trade-off, or dramatized application. Missing middle development caps at 3.4; missing closure participation caps at 2.8; lowest cap wins. The concept functions as backstory exposition rather than live stake.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Gently systematic" appears as a label in paragraphs 2, 8, and 15 without constraining or enabling a single on-page action. No scene shows the trait forcing a trade-off (e.g., patience versus urgency, order versus improvisation). Setup is present (paragraph 2), but the trait never shapes middle choices or the ending. Missing middle development caps at 3.4; missing closure participation caps at 2.8; label-only use and swappability (could be "methodical" or "patient") further limit the score.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Remodel" is introduced in paragraph 4 (setup) and recurs across middle paragraphs as the through-line action, satisfying two-gate presence (setup + development). However, the action is summarized rather than dramatized—no scene shows the caretaker making a remodeling choice under pressure. The action does not appear in or shape the ending; the final image is the orchard's ongoing state, not a remodeling beat. Missing closure participation caps at 2.8, but strong middle presence and causal centrality lift within available range to 3.7.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Copper wire is introduced early (paragraph 5), used across multiple beats (paragraphs 5, 7, 10, 17), and reprises in the final paragraph ("the copper wire sang its gentle song"), satisfying all three gates. The method shapes the dominant action (wrapping wire) and is causally linked to the orchard's transformation. However, the mechanics remain vague—"enhance the trees' natural harmonics" and "subtle vibrations" do not constrain choices or create visible trade-offs. The element is present and functional but replaceable with any similar method. Two beats + closure participation + early signal allow entry to mid-band; lack of irreplaceability and causal pressure limits ceiling.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Temple orchard with living stone pillars is established in paragraph 1 (setup) and recurs throughout (paragraphs 1, 4, 8, 10, 15, 17), satisfying setup and development. The pillars reappear in the final paragraph, providing closure participation. However, the setting functions as backdrop—no choice is constrained by spatial layout, resource, or social context. The orchard "became a haven" but does not pressure tactics. All three gates present but only descriptive use; no causal pressure or irreplaceability limits score despite recurring presence.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.3</grade><comment>Six-month timeframe is introduced mid-story (paragraph 3), satisfying setup by position but arriving late in the text (~20% mark). The diagnosis is invoked in paragraphs 3, 11, and 13 (three touches), but time never tightens a decision—no scene shows the caretaker racing a deadline or sacrificing depth for speed. Missing middle development (no on-page choice shaped by the clock) caps at 3.4; missing closure participation (ending is timeless legacy, not a timed beat) caps at 2.8; lowest cap wins. Late introduction and lack of tactical constraint further limit the score.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>"Foster interspecies respect" is declared in paragraph 4 (setup) and repeated in paragraphs 5 and 12, but the motivation is never dramatized through a conflicted choice. No friction appears between this want and another cost (time, health, legacy scope). The motive does not shape the ending; the final image is passive observation of the orchard's ongoing state. Missing middle development caps at 3.4; missing closure participation caps at 2.8; told-only motivation with no on-page friction applies the lowest cap.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Brazen calm" appears in paragraphs 1, 10, and 16 as a label, satisfying setup and touching the ending paragraph. However, tone is declared rather than embodied—no syntactic or rhythmic modulation reflects pressure or calm under stress. The phrase recurs without reweighting; the final mention is another assertion ("a testament to their brazen calm") rather than a charged demonstration. Closure participation is present by mention but not by dramatic charge. Static mood across all beats and label-only execution limit the score despite recurring presence.</comment>
