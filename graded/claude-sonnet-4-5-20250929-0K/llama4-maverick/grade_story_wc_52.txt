<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The widow's grief is embodied through tactile woodworking and sensory anchors (tea aroma, rain sound, wood grain), but interiority leans toward abstract labels ("rust-hued peace," "palpable weight") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The carving process provides concrete micro-choices, yet the emotional arc moves too smoothly from grief to hope without visible internal conflict or cost that forecloses a path. The final smile and "sense of having found a way to honor her loss" reads as achieved stasis without the messy irrationality or trade-off that would earn it under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (widow, loft, fortnight since loss, kettle ritual) land within the opening paragraph. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the carving blank "takes shape" as grief becomes "something manageable," and the completed carving at closure offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis via craft containment). However, the cost remains abstract—"pain slowly begin to contain"—rather than a visible forfeiture or image that reweights prior material with undeniable pressure. The closure lands, but the felt price is muted, capping higher bands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The rain-beaded skylight, kettle, stove, and ash wood create a coherent micro-setting with sensory layering (rain sound, tea aroma, wood grain, scraping tool). The loft filters perception through the widow's craft focus, and the carving blank constrains her hands and attention across multiple beats. The setting does not decisively narrow a choice or charge the final image—it supports rather than pressures—but the recurring wood and kettle anchor the ritual structure and ground the ending tableau, qualifying for mid-band recognition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—containing grief through craft—is signaled early and sustained. The piece accumulates texture (tea ritual, wood selection, carving emergence) but lacks a meaningful tightening or turn that narrows options or imposes visible cost. The kettle reaches a boil, the carving completes, and "pain slowly begin to contain," yet no live choice or trade-off forecloses a path on the page. Under the Accumulative lens, one decisive intensification or pattern break that reweights the stake with cost is needed; the smooth progression from grief to manageable peace undershoots that bar.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The "here and gone" concept and the grief-containment theme emerge from concrete particulars (wood grain, kettle whisper, carving tool scrape) rather than overt statement. The final image—completed carving, silent kettle, "rust-hued peace"—attempts a non-literal answer but remains slightly abstract; the carving's form is described as capturing "the essence of her emotions" without showing what that essence looks like or how it reweights prior material. The thematic resonance is present but muted, avoiding both platitude and full embodiment of the conceptual cost at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Single-POV third-person limited with consistent psychic distance and a stable perceptual filter (widow's craft-focused attention). The prose carries moderate texture—"rust-hued peace," "crystallized time," "hauntingly practical"—that occasionally drifts toward elevated diction but remains legible and voice-coherent. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed") appear but do not dull immediacy excessively. No head-hopping, and the narrative stance remains controlled. The voice is competent and purposeful, though not highly distinctive in rhythm or idiom under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Sentences vary in structure and paragraph rhythm supports the meditative pace. However, several phrases loop or paraphrase: "sense of rust-hued peace settle over her" appears twice verbatim; "the pain of her loss" and "to contain" recur without added pressure; "the ash wood carving blank" is restated across adjacent paragraphs. The figurative register ("rust-hued," "crystallized time," "hauntingly practical") occasionally stacks without clear payoff. Information density is moderate; some lines restate rather than advance. These artifacts do not obscure causality but dull closure sharpness, triggering cumulative Q7 penalties (−0.6 for loops and template cadence, per the patterned-artifact pack).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The widow-processing-grief-through-craft setup is familiar, and the piece does not transform it with a non-obvious angle or synthesis. The "here and gone" concept, rust-hued peace tone, and crystallized-time method function as thematic labels rather than driving specific, irreplaceable turns. The carving blank and kettle ritual add particularity but do not create a fresh inflection that reweights the premise in hindsight. Emotional honesty is present, yet the arc—grief softened by repetitive craft—remains within well-worn grooves without bold risk or transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The widow selects the ash wood blank, begins carving, pours tea, and completes the carving—micro-choices that shape the ritual but do not create key turns. Her presence anchors the piece, yet the escalation is textural (carving progresses, peace settles) rather than decision-driven. She is functional and central but not indispensable to the plot logic; another grief-processing protagonist could occupy the role with minor edits. Present in all three gates (setup, middle, closure) but causal pressure and cost-tied decisions are limited, capping the score in the functional band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The ash wood carving blank is introduced in paragraph six, handled in paragraph nine ("began to carve"), described as "beginning to take shape" in paragraph sixteen, and noted as "taking shape" and "now complete" in paragraphs twenty-four and twenty-six. It appears across four distinct beats and shapes the widow's tactile ritual. However, it is swappable—clay, stone, or fabric could serve the same function with minor edits—and its specific properties (ash grain, smoothness) do not constrain or enable a unique choice. The blank structures the process but does not charge the final image with irreplaceable meaning, placing it solidly mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Here and gone" is introduced in paragraph ten as a concept the widow has "grappled with since her husband's passing" and echoed in paragraph twenty-seven ("a truth that applied to all things"). It frames the thematic stakes and subtly shapes her desire to "contain" ephemeral grief, but it does not alter tactics or present-tense choices on the page. The concept is present in setup and closure (two of three gates) and provides thematic weight, qualifying for mid-band, but lacks causal pressure or visible cost tied directly to it.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Hauntingly practical" appears once in paragraph eleven as a descriptor for the "here and gone" truth, functioning as a thematic label rather than a trait that constrains or enables action. It does not recur, does not shape a choice, and carries no visible cost. The phrase is ornamental and could be removed without altering plot or closure. Present but non-functional, capped by swappability and lack of beat involvement.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The action "contain" is introduced in paragraph five ("seeking to contain the swirling emotions"), restated in paragraph twelve ("to contain the pain of her loss"), and resolved in paragraph twenty-five ("the pain of her loss slowly begin to contain"). It anchors the dominant stake and appears across three beats (setup, middle, closure), shaping the widow's craft-driven tactics. However, the action is abstract—"contain" describes an internal state rather than a decisive physical or social move—and could be replaced with "channel," "hold," or "manage" without breaking story logic. Present in all three gates and integral to the thematic arc, but the lack of irreplaceable specificity and visible cost caps the score in the solid mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Through crystallized time" appears once in paragraph thirteen as the "method she employed," described as "working through crystallized time, allowing the slow, deliberate process of creation to unfold." The phrase is metaphorical rather than mechanical; it labels the meditative pace but does not specify a technique or constraint that shapes attempts or alters tactics. It does not recur or participate in closure. Present in the middle third but ornamental and easily swappable with "patience" or "slowness," capping the score in the functional-but-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The "rain-beaded skylight loft" is introduced in the opening line and anchors the widow's sanctuary. Rain sound recurs in paragraph nineteen ("the rain continuing to fall") and twenty ("gentle sound of the rain"), providing atmospheric continuity. The loft supplies the stove, kettle, and carving table, enabling the ritual, but does not constrain a choice or pressure the outcome—no spatial limit or resource shortage alters tactics. Present in setup and middle, absent from the closure image (which focuses on carving and kettle, not the loft itself). The setting supports but does not drive; two of three gates met, with moderate causal involvement, placing it in the mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The timeframe "while the kettle boils" is signaled in paragraph five ("While the kettle boils, she would work on her craft") and closed in paragraph fourteen ("As the kettle reached a rolling boil") and paragraph twenty-seven ("The kettle, now empty"). The kettle marks the ritual's duration but does not tighten decisions—no urgency or countdown alters the widow's choices, and the boil completes without consequence. The timeframe structures the scene but functions as ambient rather than causal pressure. Present in setup and closure (two gates), but vague tracking and no tactical constraint cap the score below mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The motivation "to harvest lessons from loss" is stated explicitly in paragraph eighteen ("to harvest lessons from her loss, to distill the pain into something of value"). It drives the widow's craft ritual and appears in setup and middle beats, shaping her selection of wood and carving process. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or visible trade-offs—no friction between cost and goal is enacted on the page. The motivation frames the stake but does not generate the micro-choices or felt cost needed to elevate the score. Present in two gates (setup, middle), but lacks closure participation and on-page conflict, capping it in the functional band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Rust-hued peace" appears in paragraph three ("rust-hued peace settle over her"), recurs verbatim in paragraph twenty-nine ("deep sense of rust-hued peace"), and modulates subtly with pressure (initial settling, midpoint struggle, final affirmation). The tone is coherent and purposeful, signaling a tempered, autumnal calm rather than sharp grief or triumph. It brackets the piece (early and final image), providing lyric resonance, and the reprise reweights the widow's emotional arc. However, the tone remains relatively static—no clear break or cadence shift under peak stress—and the phrase itself is ornamental (easily replaced with "quiet peace" or "muted calm"). Present in setup and closure (two gates), with lyric payoff but limited causal pressure, placing it solidly mid-band with the lyric-resonance allowance applied.</comment>
