<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Emilia remains a placeholder throughout—"empirically intuitive" is asserted but never enacted through contradictory impulses or difficult micro-choices. The whimsical pivot to following ants arrives without internal friction or cost, and the cavern trials are summarized rather than dramatized. The note from her father at the end delivers resolution through discovery rather than through her own renunciation or choice that forecloses a path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: we learn "lonely antique map dealer" but no concrete spatial anchor or time-of-day grounding by ~120 words; the shop remains a white room. The drive lens wobbles between situational (ants as guide) and accumulative (symbols, maps, flowers) without teaching a pattern early. Closure relies on finding a note and a hidden chamber—discovery without agency or felt cost—so no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing lands on the page. The "doorway of decisions" is named repeatedly but never crystallizes into a choice that narrows options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The creek, cavern, and blooming flowers are named but never constrain a choice or alter tactics; spatial choreography inside the cavern is vague (no distances, no physical obstacles). The type foundry chip "glimmers" three times without tactile handling or evolving meaning. Sensory detail cycles through generic "heavy scent" and "dripping water" without POV filter or pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—fulfilling her father's promise—is declared but never tested by a reversal that narrows options or forces a trade-off. The trials in the cavern are summarized in one sentence ("each one testing her resolve") rather than dramatized with visible cost. No moment where Emilia must choose between competing goods or pay a price that alters later tactics. Escalation is asserted ("confidence grew") without on-page demonstration.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The "lingering promise" and "doorway of decisions" are stated as theme rather than emerging from concrete actions. The chip and ants function as plot tokens, not motifs that accumulate pressure or shift meaning at closure. The final paragraph moralizes directly: "knowing that the lingering promise had been fulfilled" and "the promise of new discoveries" tell rather than reweight through image. No earned epiphany—discovery of a note substitutes for reflection on cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction remains generic and interchangeable throughout ("maze of dusty relics," "veil of foliage," "sense of wonder") without a perceptual signature rooted in Emilia's profession or grief. No dialogue to evaluate. Filter verbs ("felt," "knew," "realized") appear frequently but remain legible. The prose lacks rhythmic modulation under pressure; syntax is uniform across calm and climactic beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "The chip… seemed to glimmer" / "now shone with a new light" / "glimmered in the fading light" / "glimmered softly in the darkness." Template cadence runs across adjacent paragraphs: "As she [verb]… As the [noun]… As the [noun]…" Stock metaphors ("heart swelled," "weight lifting") and therapy-speak ("sense of connection," "sense of peace," "sense of wonder") dull closure beats. Deduction baseline −0.8 for loops and template runs; escalated to −1.2 because artifacts touch the final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The lonely map dealer fulfilling a parent's promise via mysterious object is template-level familiar. The whimsical "follow the ants" pivot and hidden cavern with a map puzzle echo quest structures without fresh inflection. Emilia's discovery is handed to her (note in a compartment) rather than synthesized through specific expertise or moral calculus. No risk-taking in structure or perspective; median choices throughout.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Emilia is named "lonely antique map dealer" in paragraph three but her occupation never constrains a choice or enables a tactic. She observes and follows rather than deciding under pressure. Present throughout but functionally passive; swappable with any "seeker" archetype.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The chip appears in paragraph five, is pondered, then serves as a key in paragraph twenty-three to unlock a compartment. Two touches (initial find, final use) but the cryptic symbols are never decoded through her effort—they "now shone with a new light" via assertion. Middle development absent; it does not enable a tactic or narrow options between appearances. Cap for missing middle development: 3.4; slight lift for closure use to 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Lingering promise" is named in paragraph one and revisited at closure ("the lingering promise had been fulfilled"). It frames expectation early and returns with emotional weight, but it does not constrain a middle choice or force a trade-off. Lyric early-seed/final-reprise structure allows mid-5s despite no middle beat involvement.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>"Empirically intuitive" is a label in paragraph four with no subsequent demonstration. No on-page moment where she chooses between data and instinct, or where this trait enables success or imposes cost. Ornamental attribute.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Glimmer" recurs four times as description ("seemed to glimmer," "grew brighter," "glimmered softly") but never triggers a turn or alters tactics. The understanding it signals is told, not enacted through a choice. Swappable with "shone" or "pulsed" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Following the ants is introduced in paragraph nine and leads to the cavern entrance. One clear causal beat: the method enables discovery of the hidden location. But the ants vanish after delivery; they do not shape trials inside the cavern or return to charge closure. Single beat involvement with setup and middle development present; closure participation absent caps at ~6.0, lowered to 4.8 for lack of ongoing constraint.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The cavern appears at paragraph ten and hosts the map puzzle and final chamber. It provides the spatial frame for the resolution but does not constrain movement or impose environmental cost (rising creek threatens but never forces a timed choice). Setup and closure participation present; middle pressure weak. Mid-band for structural presence without tactical friction.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"As the creek rises" opens the story and recurs three times, but the rising water never tightens a decision or cuts off an option. The timeframe remains vague; no live clock alters her moves. Swappable with any slow environmental change. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>"To find the doorway of decisions" is stated in paragraph fourteen and returns in paragraphs twenty-two and thirty-one. It frames the quest and is present at closure, but the "doorway" is discovered rather than chosen through conflicted action. Early signal and closure presence allow mid-5s; lack of middle friction (no moment where desire conflicts with cost) prevents higher.</comment>
