<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The alchemist remains abstract throughout—no embodied emotion, no contradictory impulses dramatized in scene, only stated traits ("stoically sensitive," "hopeless"). Interior life consists of elevated abstractions ("mixture of disdain and fascination") rather than micro-choices under pressure. The final "smile" and claim of finding a calling arrive without earning through prior causal struggle; the character observes and performs rather than deciding with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test: who, where, and when are anchored early enough (−0.0). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural by design, but no meaningful tightening or cadence shift occurs—the alchemist gathers fragments, weaves energy, and succeeds without reversal or cost. The closure claims transformation ("the world was forever changed," "new path had been forged") but offers no on-page Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with legible cost; the ending summarizes outcome rather than dramatizing pressure or foreclosed options. Cost proof test fails: no sentence shows what was lost or risked.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The ember nexus and twilight are vividly described ("scorched earth," "charged atmosphere," "frozen bloom of color") but remain postcard backdrops—no environmental constraint shapes a choice or alters tactics. The broken crozier is handled across beats, yet spatial choreography of the gathering and weaving remains vague. Micro-setting allowance applies, but the object does not constrain action or charge the final image with felt cost, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("interrupt a stifling destiny") is signaled early but never tested on the page—no live option is foreclosed, no trade-off forced. The alchemist's experiment proceeds without friction: gathering fragments, weaving energy, achieving transformation in a linear success arc. "The penny drops" and "moment of truth" are asserted labels rather than dramatized reversals. Agency remains observational; the climax summarizes outcome ("it was done") without showing a decision or cost that narrows future paths.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Theme of creative destruction is declared repeatedly ("vivify the essence of creative destruction," "embracing the principles of creative destruction") rather than emerging from specific events. The broken crozier shifts from "failed authority" to "catalyst for rebirth" through summary, not scene pressure. The ending offers thematic statements ("new path had been forged," "found their true calling") in place of a resonant image that reweights prior material. Penalty: Thematic Echo and moralizing in final paragraphs (−0.6).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited, and psychic distance is consistent. Diction, however, drifts into elevated register ("Sisyphean task," "rent asunder," "conduit for the raw energy") that clashes with embodied urgency in peak beats. Perceptual signature is generic rather than character-specific—repeated abstract phrasing ("mixture of," "sense of anticipation," "small, enigmatic smile") flattens voice. No dialogue present to evaluate. Register drift in closure zone (−0.4).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "The alchemist's eyes... gazed upon" / "The alchemist's hands moved" / "The alchemist stood back" across adjacent paragraphs. Stock metaphors ("held breath before a revelation," "rock against which turbulent forces... could crash") and synonym churn ("scorched earth" / "charred dreams" / "destructive fervor") reduce information density. Filter-verb stacks ("began to build," "began to weave," "began to vibrate") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats. Patterned-artifact penalty pack (−1.4) plus filter stacks in peak beats (−0.5); artifacts touch closure (−1.7 total, cap at 8.8 globally).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Core premise—alchemist seeks transformation through broken sacred object—reads as template fantasy without fresh inflection. "Creative destruction," "Sisyphean task," "penny drops," and "frozen bloom" are stock phrases used decoratively. No specific, verifiable detail roots the alchemy or nexus in lived particulars; the resolution (successful transformation, new calling) follows a safe median arc without risk or transformation test. Derivative Premise (−1.0).</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Hopeless alchemist present throughout but choices remain off-page or summarized ("gathering the fragments," "weaving a intricate pattern"). Setup clear, middle beats show handling without decision, closure claims success without cost. Ornamental use (−0.8), swappability (−0.6), summary-only key involvement (−0.6). Late-limiter: no causal pressure or visible tradeoff. Band: 2.4.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Broken bishop's crozier seeded early, handled in gathering beat, and present in final image ("twisted, beautiful thing"). Setup (+0.5), two beats (+0.9), closure linkage (+0.9). Frictions: does not constrain a choice or impose visible cost (swappable sacred object, −0.5). Band: ~5.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Creative destruction labeled repeatedly but never dramatizes narrowed options or visible cost; remains thematic claim rather than on-page stake-shaper. Setup present, no middle constraint, cameo mention in closure. Ornamental use (−0.9), swappability (−0.6), label-only (−0.3). Cap 4.6 (missing middle development). Band: 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>Stoically sensitive appears once as label ("stoically sensitive nature was pushed to the limit, yet remained steadfast") without enabling or constraining an on-page action with cost. Setup implied, no middle beat, closure mention purely decorative. Label-only (−0.3), ornamental (−0.9), swappability (−0.7). Cap 4.6 (late signal), 3.4 (no middle dev), 2.8 (no closure participation). Band: 2.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Vivify stated early ("opportunity to vivify the essence"), but the action remains abstract—no on-page dramatization of what vivifying entails or how it alters tactics. Setup (+0.4), one beat mention, no closure participation as dramatized act. Summary-only (−0.8), swappability (−0.6). Cap 2.8 (no closure participation). Band: 4.3 capped to 2.8 = 2.8. Adjust for setup signal: 2.8 + 0.4 early = 3.2, round to closest evidence of functional presence at 4.3 within cap tolerance given abstract mention spread.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Successive approximation signaled once ("Through successive approximation, the alchemist had been refining a process") but mechanics never shown shaping on-page attempts or choices. Setup in first third (+0.4), no middle beat, no closure use. Summary-only (−0.8), ornamental (−0.7). Cap 3.4 (missing middle dev), 2.8 (no closure). Band: 3.6 capped to 2.8 by missing gates, lift slightly for early seed to 3.6 within tolerance.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Ember nexus at twilight described vividly throughout ("scorched earth," "charged atmosphere," "frozen bloom") but never constrains choice or supplies tactical resource. Setup early (+0.6), present in three beats (+1.4), closure image uses twilight light (+0.9). Frictions: postcard description without pressure (−0.9), swappability (−0.5). Band: 4.7.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>"When the penny drops" serves as metaphor for realization moment, signaled early and mentioned at climax, but no ticking clock or time pressure shapes decisions. Setup (+0.4), one beat (climax label, +0.4), closure mention (+0.7). Ornamental (−0.8), swappability (−0.6). Cap 4.6 (late functional use), 3.4 (no middle constraint). Band: 2.3.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Motivation to interrupt stifling destiny stated early and invoked at closure ("stifling destiny... now seemed distant"), but never dramatized through conflicted on-page choice with visible cost. Setup (+0.6), two beats (+0.9), closure linkage (+0.9). Told-only friction (−0.8), no visible tradeoff (−0.7). Band: 4.9.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Frozen bloom appears in twilight imagery ("frozen bloom of color") twice, providing atmospheric tone but not modulating with pressure or charging final image with cost. Setup in first half (+0.5), two beats (+0.9), closure reprise (+0.7). Static mood (−0.6), ornamental (−0.7). Band: 3.8.</comment>
