<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The embroiderer remains abstract throughout—no contradictory impulses, no embodied struggle, just serene competence. "Disguises wisdom as foolishness" is asserted but never dramatized in a choice with visible cost. The final stance (narrowed eyes, racing mind) tells rather than shows internal conflict, and no path is foreclosed with felt price. Interiority consists of generic observations ("pondering the whispers") without character-particular texture or micro-choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: "where, when, who" anchor by ~120 words but the embroiderer's agency and the conspiracy remain vague throughout (−0.4). No causal turn occurs on the page—the chart's completion is narrated as inevitable rather than earned by a decision that alters options. The "coup" arrives as summary in the final third without on-page stakes or cost; the closure unit (chart complete, secrets uncovered) is asserted rather than dramatized with visible consequence. Drive lens reads as attempted Accumulative/Textural, but no cadence shift or density increase reweights the dominant stake with cost at the ending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The cobalt observatory and autumn air are named early, and the eternal candle recurs across beats. However, the setting remains postcard description—no environmental constraint shapes a tactic, and the chart's spatial mechanics (how adjacent possibilities translate to needle-work) are never grounded. The flame "dances" and "burns brighter" as atmosphere, not as a resource or obstacle that alters the embroiderer's choices at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("unravel conspiracies before the coup") is declared but never tested on the page. No reversal, tightening, or visible trade-off occurs—the embroiderer works without obstacle, and the chart's completion is narrated as success without dramatized cost or foreclosed option. The urgency is asserted ("sense of urgency," "just in time") but pressure remains static; no choice narrows tactics or changes knowledge under the chosen lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme (listening for unheard stories, synchronizing with celestial rhythms) is stated directly rather than emerging from particulars. The final image ("echoed silence filled with purpose") offers abstract reassurance instead of a resonant, non-literal answer. The chart as "key to unlock mysteries" is a stock metaphor without fresh inflection, and the ending moralizes ("the stories they had uncovered would be the guide") rather than trusting dramatized scene pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, and perceptual signature is mildly character-colored ("needle moved with a newfound sense of purpose"). However, diction frequently elevates beyond the focalizer's lexicon ("otherworldly energy," "implications," "role they would play") into generalized narrator register. No dialogue appears; internal voice is consistent but lacks distinctive rhythm or syntactic particularity. Filter verbs ("knew," "believed") are frequent without voice motivation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops abound: "the embroiderer worked on" / "the embroiderer's work began to take on a life" / "the embroiderer worked on"; "secrets" recurs six times; "otherworldly energy" appears twice in adjacent paragraphs. Template cadence ("As the days passed," "As the autumn days shortened," "As the work neared completion," "As the embroiderer gazed," "As the flame continued") runs through seven sentences without payoff (−0.6). Stock metaphors ("threads that seemed to shimmer," "chart was alive," "key that would unlock") reduce clarity in peak beats (−0.5). The final third is heavily scaffolded with summary rather than scene propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The premise (artisan embroidering celestial maps in an observatory facing a coup) offers surface novelty but executes via stock thriller tropes: whispered conspiracies, ticking-clock urgency, "secrets that would change history." The method "exploring through adjacent possibilities" is named but never specified or transformed into fresh procedure. Emotional arc (serene → determined) could transfer unchanged to any protagonist in any high-stakes scenario. No bold risk or non-obvious synthesis; the piece hedges toward safe, median choices.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>The embroiderer is present throughout but makes no on-page decision that alters tactics or forecloses a path. Work proceeds without obstacle; "finished their work" is summary. Observation dominates; no beat shows choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The flame appears in three beats (workbench edge, rhythm with needle, burns brighter at end) but remains decorative atmosphere. It does not constrain a choice or supply a resource; the final "gentle glow" reprises without reweighting meaning or cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Unraveling conspiracies" is declared as theme and motive but never shapes on-page tactics. The embroiderer does not gather evidence, test hypotheses, or face a choice between secrecy and revelation. Summary-only: "they had succeeded in listening for the unheard stories."</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>"Disguises wisdom as foolishness" is mentioned once ("known for their ability to disguise wisdom") without dramatization. No scene shows the embroiderer making a witty remark or leveraging the trait to enable or constrain an action. Label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Synchronize" appears in two beats (celestial rhythms, final paragraph) but the mechanics are never grounded—what does synchronizing needle-work with star patterns entail? The action is asserted at closure ("they had truly synchronized their work") but could be replaced with any other artisan method without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.0</grade><comment>"Through adjacent possibilities" is mentioned once mid-story ("exploring through adjacent possibilities, allowing their needle to wander") with no setup, no demonstration of mechanics, and no role in the ending. Late, vague, and swappable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The cobalt observatory and autumn air are named in the opening line and recur ("observatory's staff," "engulf the observatory in chaos"). Setting supplies atmospheric detail but does not constrain a tactic or provide a resource that alters outcome. Mid-range functional presence without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Before the coup" brackets the entire narrative and the ending declares urgency ("just in time"), but no on-page clock tightens decisions. "Days passed," "autumn days shortened" are vague markers; no countdown or deadline forces a tactical shift.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>"To listen for unheard stories" is stated as motive in paragraph 7 and recurs at closure ("succeeded in listening"). However, the desire is never dramatized in a choice with friction or cost—no scene shows the embroiderer sacrificing safety or efficiency to pursue a hidden thread. Told rather than shown in conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Echoed silence" appears twice (penultimate and final paragraphs) as atmosphere. Tone remains consistent (serene, slightly portentous) but does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image beyond abstract reassurance. Static mood rather than dynamic tonal shift.</comment>
