<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elian's motivations are declared rather than dramatized through choice under pressure. The interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("mulberry ache," "perforated destiny") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The telepathy-with-plants trait appears only as descriptive habit (fingers intertwined with orchid) without constraining an on-page decision. No meaningful change or renunciation is earned; the ending offers determination without visible cost or foreclosed path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who/where/when) appear early, but no causal escalation or decisive change occurs on the page. The piece is a single reflective passage describing Elian's task and internal state without a beat that narrows options or alters knowledge. The "closure" consists of stepping into the unknown with determination—a gesture without visible cost or before/after legibility. Drive lens remains unclear; the piece reads as extended setup without payoff.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The velvet observatory, midsummer setting, and sensory details (blooming flowers, crimson/gold sky) are vivid and coherent. However, the environment remains decorative; no spatial element constrains a choice or charges the final image. The transparent violin is described but never handled as a tool that alters tactics. Solid atmospheric grounding without functional integration into pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (weighing dream against empire) is signaled but never tested on the page. No reversal, tightening, or choice narrows options; the entire piece is Elian's internal summary of what she will do rather than a dramatized escalation. Coffee-stain divination is described as method but produces no consequence or complication. Declared intention without visible cost or agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"Perforated destiny" is asserted as concept but never explored through specific events; it remains a thematic label. The final image—stepping into the unknown with determination—offers no non-literal answer or resonant reweighting of prior material. Subtext is minimal; most elements (empire, dream, promise losing glow) are directly stated rather than implied through gesture or image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited, and perceptual signature (sensory attention to flowers, sky, scents) is consistent. However, the prose often slips into elevated, abstract register ("labyrinthine path," "threads of fate," "bittersweet pain") that feels generic rather than character-particular. No dialogue to assess. Distance control is clean but the voice lacks distinctness under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Multiple paraphrase loops and synonym cycles mar momentum: "transparent violin made of ice crystal" / "the violin's provenance" / "the violin's history" recur without advancement; "perforated destiny" / "threads of perforated destiny" / "threads of fate" churn concept. Template cadence runs through opening and closing thirds with identical participial structures. Stock metaphors ("threads of fate," "velvet cloak") and abstract elevations ("labyrinthine path," "mulberry ache") accumulate without payoff. Deduct −1.4 for patterned artifacts across multiple beats; disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8 per the artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Core premise (provenance researcher with plant telepathy using coffee-stain divination to uncover violin history and propagate perforated destiny) assembles prompt elements without organic synthesis or fresh angle. The plot could be summarized as "character contemplates task" without transformation. No turn or risk-taking that grows from prior particulars; the piece reads as checklist assembly rather than inevitable design.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Provenance researcher is Elian's role, mentioned early and in the final third, but she makes no research decision on the page. Observation and intention only; no choice that alters tactics or creates a turn.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The transparent violin made of ice crystal is introduced early, mentioned multiple times, and clutched in the final third. However, it is never handled, examined for clues, or used; it remains a held object without evolving role or charged reprise. Static description across beats.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.0</grade><comment>"Perforated destiny" is named early and recurs as theme ("threads of perforated destiny" in closing), but it never shapes an on-page choice or alters options. Label-only use without causal pressure or tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>Accidentally telepathic with plants appears as a habit (fingers intertwined with orchid petals) in the opening but generates no on-page cost, enablement, or constraint. Mentioned once without functional integration.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Propagate" appears as Elian's stated goal ("to propagate this notion," "to propagate the concept") but no propagation action occurs on the page. Intention without dramatized execution; easily replaceable with "prove" or "explore."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.3</grade><comment>Reading the future in coffee stains is demonstrated in one beat (pouring coffee, interpreting stains that reveal "complex web of possibilities"), signaled early, and shapes her method. However, the divination produces no specific consequence or tactical constraint; the images are described but do not alter her next move.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Velvet observatory at midsummer is anchored early and sustained (sun dipping, stars twinkling, blooming flowers, automated hum). Setting is coherent and atmospheric but does not constrain choice or supply a resource that affects outcome. Postcard-level description without tactical function.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Before the promise loses its glow" is introduced in the final third ("the promise she had made to herself was on the verge of losing its glow") without prior setup or tracking. Time pressure is asserted but not dramatized or used to tighten a decision.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Weighing a dream against an empire is stated as Elian's task and recurs in her thoughts, but the conflict is summarized rather than tested through choice. No on-page friction where she chooses one over the other or pays a cost for the attempt.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>"Mulberry ache" appears once ("like a mulberry ache, a bittersweet pain") as a descriptor for her realization. Tone is contemplative and mildly elegiac throughout, coherent but static. The phrase does not modulate or charge the final image; one-time mention without progression.</comment>
