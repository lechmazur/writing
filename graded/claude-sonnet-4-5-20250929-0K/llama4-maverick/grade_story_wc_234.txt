<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The alchemist remains thinly characterized throughout, defined primarily by stock labels ("scientist, but also a romantic") rather than contradictory impulses dramatized under pressure. Her interiority consists of abstract wonder and generic curiosity without embodied emotion or character-specific perception. The final "satisfaction" is told rather than earned through visible cost or renunciation. Friends appear as narrative props without distinct presence or pressure on her choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>No legible closure effect. The protagonist begins examining a shell and ends having "unlocked its secrets" and "captured the density of presence," but no decisive change, visible cost, or conceptual repricing occurs on the page—only assertions of success. The piece offers continuous description without a meaningful tightening or turn that narrows options or changes knowledge. Orientation is delayed: the "who" and operative goal remain vague past 120 words, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The ember nexus and nautilus shell are named and visually described, but neither constrains a choice or charges the closure image. Setting elements function as postcard backdrop: the nexus "glowed softly," "pulsed," then "faded" without altering the alchemist's tactics or options. Spatial choreography is minimal and the grasses, breeze, and twilight remain ornamental throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Stakes are declared ("unlock secrets," "capture the density of presence") but never tested or tightened on the page. No reversal, cost, or trade-off appears; the alchemist works without obstacle, and success is summarized rather than dramatized. Coincidence does not complicate, but neither does agency—she simply "finished her work" with no visible price paid or option foreclosed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Theme is stated rather than emergent: "density of presence," "directed spontaneity," and "revalue" are prompt labels delivered as exposition without dramatized grounding. The final image offers no resonant reconfiguration of prior material; instead, it cycles through thematic echo ("power of directed spontaneity") and summary moralizing. Subtext is absent; every concept is narrated directly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Third-person narration maintains consistent distance but lacks perceptual signature—sensory detail and diction could belong to any careful observer rather than reflecting the alchemist's particular priorities. Register occasionally drifts into abstract academic phrasing ("palette of resolve," "revaluation," "directed spontaneity") without POV anchoring. The overheard phrase "the truth lies in the density of presence" reads as planted exposition rather than naturalistic dialogue.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Pervasive paraphrase loops and synonym churn: "secrets" and "hidden patterns" recur across adjacent lines; "sense of wonder and curiosity" / "sense of connection" / "sense of satisfaction" stack without advancing pressure. Template cadence dominates ("She was…," "She had…," "As she…"). Stock metaphors ("eyes shone," "spark of inspiration," "quietly confident hands") and therapy-speak ("scientifically romantic intensity") flatten texture. Multiple artifacts touch the closure paragraph, triggering artifact penalty escalation (−1.7 baseline in Q7, plus disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band at 8.8).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The core premise—a contemplative alchemist unlocking a shell's secrets through careful observation—follows a well-worn template without transformation. Prompt labels ("palette of resolve," "revalue," "directed spontaneity") are imported as surface ornament rather than integrated into character logic or world rules. No fresh inflection or specific synthesis distinguishes this from generic "scientist in wonder" scenes.</comment>
