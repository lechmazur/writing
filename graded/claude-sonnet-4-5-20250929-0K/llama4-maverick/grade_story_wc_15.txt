<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Aria remains a passive vessel for abstract meditation rather than a character under pressure. Her "hauntingly optimistic vision" and desire to "carve a path from ruin to reverence" are asserted repeatedly but never tested by a concrete choice with visible cost. The interiority consists entirely of therapeutic abstractions ("broken dreams," "shattered hopes," "orchid solace") without embodied contradiction or micro-decisions that reveal hierarchy of values. No meaningful change or credible endurance occurs; the work simply completes without friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>No legible closure unit appears on the page. The story loops through decorative description of Aria's weaving without a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing; the tapestry glows, dawn arrives, and the narrator summarizes thematic hope in place of dramatized cost. Causality is replaced by synonym churn: "the threads weaving together" → "fabric began to glow" → "creation took shape" with no because/therefore linkage or price paid. The final paragraphs offer meta-commentary ("a testament to the power of art") rather than an image that reweights prior material. Orientation Test penalty (−0.4): who/where/when anchors emerge gradually across the first 15% without deliberate disorientation taught as pattern, and the delay does not serve closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The labyrinth and canyon are described vividly in multiple passes but function as postcard backdrop rather than constraint or resource. Aria's workbench, the worn fabric, and the tide pools are mentioned but never alter a tactic or choice. The illustration plate sits inert on the workbench until it "seemed to glow" at the end—a decorative reprise without causal pressure. Spatial choreography remains clear; the setting's lyric specificity ("red canyon walls," "twisted tunnels") lifts the score above generic but does not reach the 7.0 gate requiring environment to constrain choice or charge the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to carve a path from ruin to reverence"—is declared but never encounters on-page opposition or tightening. Aria sews without friction; no reversal, deepening, or tactical shift occurs. The fabric glows, the night passes, dawn arrives—outline sequencing without pressure escalation. No visible cost, forfeiture, or trade-off appears; the resolution is asserted in summary ("her work was complete") rather than earned by protagonist agency under the selected lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme is stated overtly and repeatedly: "the power of art to transform," "a path from ruin to reverence," "hope and beauty." The final paragraphs abandon scene pressure entirely for meta-commentary and sermon ("a testament to the enduring power of hope"). No resonant answer emerges from concrete action or image; instead, the narrator explains the meaning directly. The illustration plate and glowing tapestry gesture toward symbolic recurrence but remain ornamental without reweighting prior material through a non-literal image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited remains stable but the narrative voice is generic and unanchored to Aria's particular perceptual signature. Diction repeatedly drifts into therapeutic abstractions ("orchid solace," "broken precedents," "hauntingly optimistic") and essay register ("a testament to," "the enduring power of") that flatten urgency. Synonym loops dominate interiority: "broken dreams and shattered hopes," "transform and redeem," "heal and transform." No dialogue appears; internal texture is indistinct and could belong to any contemplative artisan.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Pervasive paraphrase loops and template cadence across multiple beats: "Aria's sewing was a form of meditation" recaps prior description without new pressure; "the labyrinth seemed to grow quieter, as if the very walls were listening" → "the air was heavy with anticipation" → "the weight of her task" all restate mood without advancing situation. Figurative language saturates high-pressure beats without payoff: "threads weaving together," "fabric of solace," "tone of orchid solace," "inner radiance." Final third contains four paragraphs of summary-mode restatement ("And so, the wharf weaver's work would continue... And so, the story of Aria...") that loop conceptually. Artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering −1.7 and disallowing 9+ globally per Q7 patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Core premise—solitary artisan weaving hope in ancient ruin—follows a widely used template without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The "poetic wharf weaver" occupation label, the glowing tapestry, and the thematic arc from darkness to light are generic fantasy/fable conventions executed at surface level. No fresh inflection, bold risk, or synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight; the emotional arc and imagery could transfer unchanged to any mystical artisan in any sacred space.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Aria is present throughout but makes no key choices; she sews without friction or decision point. The character functions as a passive conduit for abstract theme rather than an agent whose decisions create turns.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The illustration plate is mentioned in two beats (workbench discovery, glowing near the end) but remains static; it is never handled, used, or reweighted with new meaning. Ornamental reprise without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Broken precedents" appears once as an abstract phrase without shaping stakes or tactics. The concept is echoed thematically but never constrains or enables an on-page choice.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Hauntingly optimistic" is asserted twice as a label for Aria's vision but does not constrain or enable any action. No visible trade-off or cost tied to the trait appears.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Sewing is Aria's continuous activity across the story and frames the closure scene, but no major turn traces to the act itself; the work completes without friction or reversal. Functional but swappable with any meditative craft.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>0.8</grade><comment>"Overlapping sleepwalking paths" is mentioned once in abstract summary ("As she sewed, Aria's thoughts drifted to the overlapping sleepwalking paths...") without mechanics, signal, or impact on attempts. Decorative phrase only.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The labyrinth and canyon walls are vividly described and anchor multiple beats (opening, middle reflection, dawn), but they function as atmospheric backdrop rather than constraint or resource. The setting does not alter Aria's tactics or supply a tool that affects outcome. Lyric reprise across opening and closing paragraphs reweights mood but not stakes.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"After the tide pools emptied" appears in the opening third and is mentioned once more near the end ("The tide pools would refill") but does not tighten decisions or track elapsed time. Vague temporal anchor without pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"To carve a path from ruin to reverence" is stated twice and frames the thematic desire, but no on-page friction between want and cost appears. The motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Orchid solace" is named twice and the tone remains consistently meditative and abstract throughout, but it does not modulate with pressure (no pressure exists) or charge the final image beyond mood. Static tone without escalation or cadence shift.</comment>
