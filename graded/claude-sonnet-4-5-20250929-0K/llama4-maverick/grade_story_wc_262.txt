<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The crystal gazer remains an abstract cipher throughout, defined by function ("spatially imaginative mind") rather than contradictory interior life. No genuine micro-choices under pressure appear; the protagonist drifts through a passive psychometry session without embodied struggle or visible cost. The final "understanding" arrives as assertion—"not just farewells, but a testament to the enduring power of love"—without dramatized consequence that forecloses a path. Interiority consists of stock meditation-speak ("energies emanating," "vibrations of the film strip") that never particularizes this mind under stress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Drive lens inferred as Accumulative/Textural (immersive meditation sequence building to thematic resonance). Orientation anchors arrive within bounds (projection booth, crystal gazer, film strip by ~80 words). Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the reweighted film strip and "secrets now a part of their own story," but cost remains asserted rather than dramatized—no on-page forfeiture, altered tactic, or foreclosed option. The psychometry vision unfolds as uninterrupted description; no reversal or tightening tests the protagonist's commitment. Because/therefore linkage is absent; events succeed one another without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The projection booth is vividly anchored early (celluloid scent, dust, reels, projector hum) and returns at closure to frame the exit. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the vision sequence. However, the setting never constrains a choice or supplies a resource that alters outcome; it functions as atmospheric container rather than active pressure. The film strip is handled twice (pickup, replacement) but does not evolve or force a trade-off. Sensory detail tilts visual-heavy without POV-filtered selectivity during the vision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—"to find where unused love is stored"—is declared but never tested by on-page opposition or cost. The protagonist's "mission to uncover the secrets" proceeds without obstacle, failure, or competing pull. No reversal appears; the vision simply unfolds, then ends. The "weight of unused love lifting" is told as outcome rather than earned through a choice that narrows options. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening or cadence shift that reweights the stake with felt cost is required; here the accumulation remains flat and the exit restates the entry without friction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Theme—enduring power of love and memory—emerges through the goodbye-letters vision and the film-strip frame. The final image attempts resonance: "some things remain forever." However, the piece states its thesis overtly in multiple lines ("testament to the enduring power of love," "enduring power of human emotion," "love that continued to resonate through the ages") rather than trusting concrete particulars. The letters remain generic swirl without individual story that would deepen ambiguity. Thematic Echo penalties apply: restating the prompt concept in prompt-like language reduces subtext.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is generic mystic-register throughout: "inexplicable pull," "gentle tremor," "vibrations," "energies emanating." Diction never modulates with pressure; the crisis-vision and the calm booth share identical elevated tone. Filter verbs cluster without voice justification ("felt," "knew," "realized" in quick succession). No dialogue. Psychic distance stays fixed at one remove, describing rather than inhabiting the experience. The prose reads as committee spiritual-fantasy voice rather than a singular focalizer's idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "secrets hidden" / "hidden truth" / "secrets now a part" / "secrets that had been uncovered"; "enduring power of love" appears three times with minor variation; "testament to" repeats. Template cadence: multiple paragraphs open "The crystal gazer [verb]" or "As they [verb]." Stock metaphor strings: "autumn leaves on a gusty day," "hush before thunder," "mournful sigh." Figurative density in the vision beat (letters swirling, melody coalescing, atmosphere thickening) obscures causal linkage without pattern-teaching. Information density is low; many lines restate situation rather than advance it. Artifacts touch the closure paragraph ("secrets now a part of their own story," "love that would continue to resonate").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The core frame—psychic reads old film to access stored emotion—is a familiar template (object-reader uncovers past via supernatural means, gains insight, exits changed). The goodbye-letters vision and "unused love" motif lean on generic spiritual-journey tropes without fresh inflection. No turn, choice, or cost arises from established particulars; the arc is declare-quest / receive-vision / exit-wiser, a median plot path. The "spatially imaginative" trait and "forgotten lyrics" phrase are ornamental rather than driving unique tactics. Transformation test fails: swap projector for attic trunk, film for letters, and emotional arc remains unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Crystal gazer is on-page throughout but makes no choice that alters tactics or outcome. Observation dominates; the protagonist passively receives the vision, then exits. No decision point with cost appears. Present in setup, middle, and ending, but causal role is absent.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Film strip appears in three beats: pickup (frames 3–4), psychometry focus (frame 5), return placement (frame 20). However, its use is static—trigger for vision, then inert object. No evolving property or reweighted meaning at closure; it simply remains on the floor. Early signal and ending presence earn mid-band, but swappability (any artifact could serve) and lack of causal pressure cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Goodbye letters dominate the vision sequence (frames 7–12), providing the central image cluster. They shape the thematic question but never alter on-page tactics or force a choice. The concept functions as atmosphere and theme echo rather than stake-driver. Present in middle and thematically linked to closure, but does not constrain or enable protagonist action with cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Spatially imaginative mind" is mentioned once (frame 2) as label-only trait. No on-page action demonstrates spatial imagination constraining or enabling a choice. The vision is purely receptive; no navigation puzzle or spatial trade-off appears. Ornamental use without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Incubate the memories" is stated (frame 5) but the action itself—holding the strip, closing eyes—could be "channel," "absorb," or "summon" with no structural change. The vision sequence does not depend on incubation mechanics. Functional mention without irreplaceability or cost linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Psychometry reading is named (frame 6) and frames the vision method. Appears in setup and middle, but its mechanics are not tested or constrained; the gazer simply "allows the energies" and the vision unfolds without effort or failure. Present but replaceable with any divination synonym.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Projection booth anchors the opening and closing frames with vivid sensory detail (celluloid scent, projector hum, reels). Spatial location is clear throughout. However, the setting never pressures a choice or supplies a resource that alters outcome; it functions as atmospheric container. Early signal, ending presence, but no causal pressure or cost connection.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.2</grade><comment>"Forgotten lyrics search for tune" appears once (frame 14) as poetic image within the vision. No timeframe constraint tightens decisions; the protagonist's exploration proceeds at leisure with no clock pressure. The phrase is ornamental metaphor rather than stake-shaping element.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"To find where unused love is stored" is stated (frame 11) and colors the vision interpretation. The motivation shapes thematic framing but is never dramatized as conflicted choice or tested by cost. Told rather than shown through friction between wants and obstacles. Present in middle and ending theme, but no on-page trade-off or forfeiture.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Hushed thunder" appears twice: "hush before thunder" (frame 13) and "hushed thunder of the city's emotions" (frame 24). Tone remains consistently elevated and meditative throughout, neither modulating with pressure nor charging the final image with reversal. The recurring phrase provides lyric continuity but does not reweight stakes or constrain choice. Two-beat presence and closure mention earn mid-band, but static application and lack of cost linkage prevent higher scoring.</comment>
