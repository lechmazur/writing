<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's guilt and profession are stated but never dramatized in choice. Interiority consists largely of abstract reflection ("the weight of unspoken words") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The walk and carving examination produce a "memory that wasn't her own" without clear causality or cost—this moment could anchor a turn but instead dissipates into more reflection. The ending decision to "confront the truth" reads as declared intent rather than a choice that forecloses a visible path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: protagonist role and motive emerge gradually, but spatial anchoring (terrace, then shore, then "back to her client") remains vague. The piece moves through tea-sipping, walking, examining carvings, and a resolve to return, yet no causal link tightens options—each beat could be reordered without loss. The ending offers intent ("she had a truth to uncover") rather than an on-page Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with felt cost. Lens reads as attempted Accumulative/Textural, but no pattern crystallizes or cadence shifts to reweight the stake at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The cobalt terrace and forgotten shore are evoked with some sensory specificity (salt, decay, driftwood), and the watch hand recurs. However, spatial choreography is loose—terrace, table, shore, and return path never cohere into a legible map. The carvings are handled on the page and one (woman's face) triggers memory, meeting the micro-setting threshold. This interaction constrains the protagonist's attention and primes the closure move, lifting the score into the 6-band despite the lack of occupational or world-rule grounding.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"discover the weight of a withheld truth"—is signaled but remains abstract throughout. The walk and carving examination feel like contemplative drift rather than escalation. No live constraint or tightening choice narrows options; the protagonist's agency at the end is a declaration of resolve, not a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost. Coincidence (finding a carving that triggers memory) complicates without forcing a trade-off, and the client's waiting presence never applies on-page pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The concept "sieved hush" is articulated and the carvings are framed as "a manifestation" of it, but this remains thematic claim rather than dramatic demonstration. The watch hand recurs but does not accumulate new meaning at closure. The final image ("the watch hand glinted, a small but potent symbol of the truth that was to come") states future significance rather than reweighting prior material. Theme is present but not earned through specific, on-page consequence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Single-POV narration is stable with a consistent register of melancholy introspection. Perceptual signature (sea as "mournful sigh," carvings as "skeletal fingers") is coherent if somewhat generic. The invented term "sieved hush" and the reflection on false-memory manufacture give voice texture. Distance control is clean, but psychic proximity does not modulate with pressure—the tone remains uniform from tea to resolve. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops recur: "the weight of unspoken words" restated as "the weight of her guilt and the burden of her secrets" and "the weight of a withheld truth." Template cadence ("She stared… She recalled… She picked up… She would follow…") flattens momentum. Filter verbs ("seemed to be," "felt different," "felt a sense of") cluster without voice motivation. Mixed metaphor: driftwood carvings "washed up like skeletal fingers" then "yielded up their secrets" mixes organic decay with treasure-giving. Figurative density ("mournful sigh," "deep blue gloom," "lunar glow," "swallowed her whole") in nearly every paragraph without pattern payoff triggers overwriting deduction. Apply −0.6 for loops and template stems, −0.4 for filter stacks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The premise—black-market genealogist who manufactures false memories—offers conceptual novelty, but execution leans on familiar contemplative-walk and symbolic-object beats without transformation. "Cobalt terrace at dusk" and "driftwood carvings" read as atmospheric placeholders rather than irreplaceable particulars. The turn (a carving triggers a memory "that wasn't her own") echoes many metaphysical-mystery templates. The ending commits to future action rather than present synthesis, leaving the story feeling like setup for a longer work.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The character is introduced in the opening line and her guilt is mentioned repeatedly, but she makes no on-page choice that alters tactics or stakes. The walk and resolve to return are contemplative rather than decisive. Present in setup and ending, but middle development consists of observation without agency, capping the score and preventing higher-band entry.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The watch hand appears once on the table ("a token from a past client") and recurs in the final paragraph ("the watch hand glinted"). It is described but never handled or used; no action involves it. The reprise claims symbolic weight ("a small but potent symbol of the truth that was to come") without dramatizing changed meaning. Two mentions across two beats, but both are static description, trending low under the band guidance.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Sieved hush" is defined explicitly and linked thematically to the carvings ("a manifestation of the sieved hush"), but it does not constrain choice or alter tactics. The concept remains ornamental—a label for atmosphere rather than a narrative pressure. Present in setup and thematically echoed, but missing causal work in middle or ending beats.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>The trait "manufactures false memories" is stated in exposition ("a genealogist who manufactured false memories for a living") and mentioned in reflection, but no on-page action demonstrates it. The memory triggered by the carving is framed as arising unbidden, not as a manufactured artifact. Label-only mention without visible tradeoff or enabling pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Quell" appears once: "To quell the growing sense of unease, she decided to take a walk." This motivates the walk but does not recur or drive a turn. The action is functional—it transitions scenes—but easily swappable (e.g., "dispel," "ease"). Present in one beat with minor causal work, but no development or closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Sifting through driftwood carvings occupies the middle third. The method is signaled, shown on the page, and one carving (woman's face) triggers the memory that primes the protagonist's resolve. The mechanics of sifting ("grooves and ridges worn into the wood") are felt. Present across setup, middle, and ending (carvings "yielded up their secrets"), meeting two-of-three gates and contributing causally to the turn, placing it in the mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The cobalt terrace frames the opening and closing, providing spatial continuity and tonal anchor (dusk → lunar glow). However, it does not constrain choice or supply resources—setting remains postcard description. The shore walk occurs in a vague "forgotten shore" without legible geography. Present in setup and ending with atmospheric function but no tactical pressure, limiting the score to the functional-but-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Under the weight of unspoken words" recurs as phrasing but never as a temporal constraint. The dusk-to-night progression is noted passively ("the sun dipped below the horizon"), yet no clock tightens decisions. The timeframe is thematic mood rather than a live pressure that alters tactics, scoring low for ornamental presence.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"To discover the weight of a withheld truth" is stated and repeated in slight variations. The protagonist recalls a past client's "mixture of desperation and hope" and resolves to "uncover the truth," but friction between desire and cost remains abstract. No on-page moment dramatizes a choice where this motivation forces a trade-off. Told and reiterated without visible conflict, capping the score below 5.0.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Tempered regret" coheres across the piece: melancholy terrace, "guilt-ridden" label, "sense of tempered regret" explicitly named near the end. Tone modulates slightly from unease to resolve, and the final image ("the watch hand glinted") carries wistful anticipation. The tone is consistent, charges the reflective beats, and contributes to the ending's mood, meeting the criteria for mid-6-band integration despite the lack of dramatic pressure shifts.</comment>
