<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The undertaker's motivation is told rather than tested through competing impulses. His "inadvertently stubborn" trait appears only as a label without constraining any on-page choice. The character arc from weariness to peace unfolds through summary and reflection rather than embodied contradiction; the weeks of preparation and years of library work are recounted, not dramatized, leaving no visible cost at the closure moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Drive lens is ambiguous—accumulative texture is signaled by the lyric tone, but the piece also attempts causal escalation (package → journey → reactivation → peace). Orientation anchors arrive within tolerance. However, closure lacks visible cost: the undertaker's peace is asserted in the final paragraphs without a decisive change, renunciation, or reweighted stakes legible on the page. The "years passed" summary evacuates agency from the ending, leaving only atmospheric assertion.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The underwater library is vividly sketched with "dusty tomes," "ornate device," and "luminescent creatures," but these details remain postcard-descriptive. The environment does not constrain a single tactical choice—navigation, object handling, and restoration are all recounted in summary. The broken lens clicks into place without spatial friction, and the "impossible spaces" are occupied off-page.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—giving rest a permanent address—is declared but never tested by a competing cost or narrowed option. The undertaker descends, repairs the lens, and restores the library without facing a single reversal, constraint, or trade-off. Escalation is replaced by summary: "weeks preparing," "years passed," and "task complete" evacuate all pressure from the closure window.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The theme of stillness and rest emerges clearly from imagery and the undertaker's arc, but the final paragraphs state it directly: "giving rest a permanent address" and "the power of stillness." The closing lines moralize rather than resonate through image. The distress signal's transformation from call for help to invitation is elegant but undermined by the explain-everything final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, and the undertaker's perceptual filter—drawn to stillness, attuned to funerary calm—colors the narration. However, the voice flattens under pressure: weeks and years are compressed into identical summary cadences, and the prose does not modulate with urgency. No dialogue appears to test voice distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops proliferate: "weariness lifting, replaced by a sense of purpose" echoes "sense of purpose he hadn't felt in years." Template stems recur ("The undertaker felt," "As he…," "With each…"). Stock metaphors ("shining monument," "beacon") and synonym churn ("stillness," "peace," "rest," "solace") pad the final third. The closure beat is dulled by these artifacts, triggering the elevated deduction and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The core premise—lonely professional finds purpose in a mystical underwater sanctuary—follows a familiar template without fresh specificity. The undertaker's occupation informs imagery but not tactics; the lighthouse lens and library are postcard symbols rather than functional constraints. The transformation test fails: swap "undertaker" for "curator" or "librarian" and the arc remains unchanged.</comment>
