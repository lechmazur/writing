<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The registrar remains an abstraction throughout—"lost in thought," "pondering," "feeling resolve"—with no contradictory impulses or embodied emotion under pressure. The progression from burden to freedom is declared rather than earned through on-page choices that foreclose options with visible cost. Interiority consists of therapy-speak labels ("the weight of honesty," "sense of clarity and purpose") without character-particular texture. The final "she was free" reads as summary rather than a motivated change driven by prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive immediately, satisfying the test. However, no meaningful causal linkage operates: the registrar walks, raises a lens, smiles, and leaves without any because/therefore pressure or motivated ellipsis that narrows options. The "closure" is a declared state ("she was free") rather than a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with visible cost on the page. The piece reads as a single static tableau with synonym churn ("mistrust melting," "transparency," "honesty") rather than escalation under any identifiable lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The crystal forecourt and wet stone appear early and recur, but function as postcard backdrop rather than constraining choice or charging the closure. The lens is handled twice (clutched, raised to eye) yet its mechanics do not alter tactics or outcomes—it "transforms" the view in an abstract claim without spatial or perceptual specificity. Sensory detail defaults to generic (scent of wet stone, resonant hush) without POV filter or urgency modulation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to thaw mistrust with transparency"—is declared but never tested by on-page opposition, reversal, or cost. The registrar encounters no friction, makes no trade-offs, and forfeits nothing; she simply walks and feels resolve accumulate. The concert tickets are picked up and traced but generate no new complication or narrowed option. No meaningful tightening, deepening, or agency-driven escalation occurs before the summary ending.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Freed by honesty" and "transparency" appear as repeated prompt labels rather than emerging from specific events or images. The lens-as-tool-for-truth and the cryptic-doodles motifs are introduced but never constrain a choice or accumulate pressure that reweights prior material at closure. The final paragraph moralizes explicitly: "honesty reigned," "its guardian"—thematic echo in place of earned resonance. No concrete particular anchors the abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. However, diction oscillates between lyric register ("crystal whispering forecourt," "resonant hush") and flat summary ("she felt a sense of resolve," "she knew that she had found"), creating committee voice rather than a singular perceptual signature. Psychic distance is static; no modulation under pressure. No dialogue is present to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade the text: "mistrust and secrecy melting away" / "thaw mistrust with transparency" / "city of secrecy and mistrust became a place of transparency" recur across nine sentences with no added pressure. Template cadence dominates ("She [verb]," "The registrar [verb]," "The lens [verb]") across the entire piece. Synonym churn ("sense of resolve," "sense of peace," "sense of purpose," "sense of resolution") flattens momentum. These artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering the −1.7 floor and disallowing 9+ globally; baseline deduction −1.4 in Q7, escalated to −1.7 for closure contamination.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The premise—truth-seeker deciphering city secrets via projector lens and cryptic doodles—echoes template mystery/revelation arcs without transformation. The lens, doodles, and crystal forecourt are named but not integrated into a non-obvious synthesis; each could be swapped for generic equivalents (magnifying glass, coded notes, glass atrium) without altering the emotional or thematic arc. No bold risk or earned inevitability elevates the familiar material.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The registrar is present throughout but makes no on-page decisions that create key turns; she walks, observes, feels, and leaves. Introduced early (setup gate met), but middle and closure participation are observational only (development and payoff gates missed). Late cap 2.8 applies; ornamental use −0.8; swappability −0.6. Floor at 2.4.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The lens appears early (setup met), is handled in two beats (clutched, raised to eye; development gate met), and is present in the closure paragraph where it is lowered and named again (payoff met, but not causally active—cameo only). Functional involvement +0.9, closure mention +0.3, but no causal pressure or cost connection; late closure participation is piggyback. Swappability −0.5. Score 4.9.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Freed by honesty" is seeded early as backstory ("had freed her"), recurs mid-text, and is declared at closure ("she was free, freed by the honesty"). All three gates technically met, but the concept is told rather than dramatized through choices with cost; no on-page action narrows options via honesty. Label-only trait −0.3; summary-only −0.3; no causal pressure. Score 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Ambiguously clear" modifies the lens glass twice but never constrains or enables action with cost—it is descriptive color only. Setup met (early mention), development and payoff gates missed (no middle choice or closure linkage to the attribute itself). Late cap 2.8, ornamental −0.8, label-only −0.3. Floor 2.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Eavesdropping is mentioned as past habitual action ("had learned to eavesdrop") and a future capacity ("to eavesdrop on the whispers") but never executed on the page as a scene beat that drives a turn. Setup met (early signal), development and payoff gates missed. Summary-only −0.8, swappability −0.6 (could be "decode" or "listen"). Score 3.6.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Concert tickets with cryptic doodles appear early (setup met), are picked up and traced in one middle beat (development met), and are carried at closure but not causally active there (payoff missed as cameo). Two beats +0.9, but the doodles' mechanics are gestured at ("deciphering," "hidden message," "began to make more sense") without on-page demonstration that shapes attempts. Summary-only −0.8. Score 3.8.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The crystal forecourt after rain is named early (setup met), provides spatial anchors for the walk (development met as location), and frames the final departure (payoff met). Present across all three gates, but the setting supplies no constraint or resource that alters outcome—postcard function. Two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.5 (framing), but no causal pressure −1.0. Score 4.7.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>"After words become unnecessary" appears once as a mid-text aside with no before/after boundary, no clock that tightens decisions, and no tracking across beats. Setup missed (not signaled early), development and payoff missed. Ornamental −0.8, label-only −0.3. Floor 2.3.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"To thaw mistrust with transparency" is named early (setup met), motivates the walk and lens-raising (development met as stated goal), and is declared satisfied at closure (payoff met). All gates met, but the motivation is told rather than dramatized through friction between wants and costs; no on-page opposition tests it. Three gates +1.4, but label-only −0.3, no causal pressure −1.0, told-only −0.3. Score 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Resonant hush" and synonyms ("silence almost palpable," "stillness," "holding its breath") recur across the entire piece (setup, development, payoff all met). The tone remains static—a single sustained mood with no modulation under pressure or turn at closure. Three gates +1.4, closure linkage +0.5, but static mood (no escalation or shift) −0.8. Score 5.4.</comment>
