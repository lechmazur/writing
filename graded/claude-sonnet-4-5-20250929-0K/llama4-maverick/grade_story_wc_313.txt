<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The warden remains an abstract observer throughout, with motivation stated ("spin stories into shared meaning") rather than tested through contradictory impulses or difficult choices. Interiority consists largely of stock phrasing—"sense of purpose," "drinking in the details"—without embodied emotion or character-particular contradiction. The sapphire liqueur label is handled once and stored, then merely mentioned; no micro-choices emerge from its presence. Agency is entirely passive: the warden walks, photographs, and reflects, but no decision forecloses a path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who: warden; where: reservoir town; when: twilight after water lowered) arrive within the first 120 words, satisfying the test. However, no on-page closure effect materializes: the warden begins walking to document/heal, walks through the town taking photographs, and ends still walking with the same intention. The trail of photographs is mentioned as leading to "a forgotten memory" but that memory never surfaces, no decision alters tactics, and no cost is paid. The piece reads as a single extended beat of observation without a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Sensory anchors are present—mud, damp earth, decay, creaking street sign—and filtered through the warden's task. The midnight ridgeway and resurfaced streets supply atmospheric specificity. However, setting functions primarily as backdrop: no environmental detail constrains a choice or charges the final image. The wind chime is mentioned twice but remains static metaphor rather than a tactile object that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—to heal the community through narrative—is signaled early but never tested. The warden encounters no opposition, makes no trade-off, and pays no price; the photographs accumulate without friction. No reversal or tightening occurs: the warden's goal and method remain unchanged from first paragraph to last. Under any lens (Causal, Accumulative, Situational), pressure does not escalate; the piece offers atmosphere in place of conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Theme—memory, loss, narrative as healing—is legible and threads through imagery (liqueur label, forgotten toy, wind chime). The "precisely humane" touch and "mirrored hush" recur as atmospheric notes. However, theme is stated rather than earned: "to spin stories into shared meaning" appears as direct assertion multiple times, and the final paragraph ("even in darkness, there is beauty") moralizes without dramatized cost. No on-page epiphany or image reweights prior material; the warden's internal state at the end is identical to the opening.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, focalized through the warden. Diction is controlled and somewhat lyrical ("sapphire-hued," "morbid perfume," "mirrored hush"). However, the perceptual signature is generic: the warden notices what any observer would (toy, street sign, mud), and no character-specific bias shapes selection. Repetitive sentence stems abound—"The warden's thoughts turned," "The warden felt," "As the warden…"—flattening rhythm under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops are pervasive: paragraphs restate the warden's task (documenting, healing, spinning stories) without advancing pressure, and the final third recycles "stories to be told" and "forgotten memory" across multiple lines. Template cadence dominates—"The warden's [noun] [verb]" stems recur across a dozen sentences. Stock metaphors ("beauty in the brokenness," "threads of history") and filter-verb stacks ("felt," "seemed," "turned to") dull immediacy in what should be charged beats. Information density is low; many paragraphs could be cut without altering knowledge or situation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The premise—warden documenting a resurfaced drowned town—offers potential, and the sapphire liqueur label is a specific anchor. However, execution leans on familiar lyric-essay beats: solitary figure, twilight walk, catalogue of ruins, healing-through-narrative theme. The photographs-as-trail method is mentioned but never shown in use; the "forgotten memory" remains an abstraction. No turn or inflection transforms expectation; the piece reads as a static mood study rather than a story with stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The vigilant levee warden is named and present throughout but makes no decision that alters tactics or stakes. Observation without agency; the character is a lens, not a driver.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The sapphire-hued liqueur label appears in one beat (spotted, stored) and is mentioned once more as "seeming to glow." Static description; no evolving use or reweighted meaning at closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Reservoir town resurfacing frames the setting and motivates the warden's task (healing/documentation). It supplies atmosphere but does not constrain choices or shift tactics on the page. Present as premise more than pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.2</grade><comment>"Precisely humane" appears twice as a label ("precisely humane touch," "precisely humane endeavor") but never constrains or enables an on-page action with cost. Descriptor without friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.3</grade><comment>"Expunge" is named as the warden's goal ("to expunge the pain") and mentioned in the final third, but no on-page action demonstrates expunging. Told intent, not dramatized turn.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>A trail of photographs is mentioned as method and stated to lead to a forgotten memory, but the mechanics are never shown: we do not see the warden arrange, follow, or complete the trail. Summary-only use.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Midnight ridgeway at twilight anchors mood and appears in multiple beats (opening walk, final image). It supplies atmosphere but does not constrain a choice or provide a resource that alters outcome. Postcard function.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"After a wind chime falls silent" is invoked once as metaphor for stillness, not as a timeframe that tightens decisions. The narrative clock is vague; twilight stretches without urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"To spin stories into shared meaning" is stated as the warden's motivation and repeated across beats, but never dramatized in a choice with friction or cost. Told desire without conflicted enactment.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Mirrored hush" recurs as a tonal note (twilight, silence, stillness) and coheres through the piece. It modulates slightly with the warden's reflections and charges the atmospheric final image, though it does not shift under pressure or escalate stakes.</comment>
