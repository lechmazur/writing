<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is clear and embodied through actions—building the lattice, conducting movements, walking the riverbank. Interiority shows purposeful specificity ("sorrow cools sharp, but remembrance warms diffuse") and the ferry drowning backstory anchors present choices. However, internal contradiction remains abstract rather than acted simultaneously in scene; the narrator reflects *about* conflict more than *enacting* competing impulses under pressure. The final gesture of pocketing gratitude and carrying the case home reads as Earned Stasis but lacks visible micro-choices that foreclose a live alternative path with felt cost on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece coheres through density increase and pattern repetition (tuning forks, frost, silence) culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise crystallizes in "We are unshaken marvels ourselves, proof that even a capsized world can learn to balance." Orientation anchors arrive cleanly by the conservatory introduction. One meaningful deepening occurs when the protagonist corrects the algorithm by walking the riverbank, reweighting the translation practice. Cost is conceptual and felt (the hush, the drowned choir, the continued effort) but the final image's price reads more affirmed than paid; no on-page option is visibly foreclosed at closure, nudging the Charged Poise toward the softer edge of RR.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The winterglass conservatory pressures choices throughout: ice-limned ferns store atmosphere, sensors map heat, mirrors herd currents, panes respond with "disciplined tides." The tuning fork case and the lattice of mirrors/heaters function as micro-setting tools that constrain the translation method. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through the protagonist's priorities (frost lines, breath clouds, moth glow). The conservatory's architecture and the riverbank anchor both serve the closure image, with the conservatory becoming "an auditorium of light" where marvels are witnessed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translating silence into legible meaning—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the first attempt fails (heat pools, lilies blister) and the protagonist rewrites the algorithm, weighting forks with leaves to modulate flow. Agency is present in the correction and the nightly sessions, but the final performance does not narrow options or force a visible trade-off; the crowd receives warmth and the protagonist pockets gratitude without cost that forecloses a path. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens via pattern deepening, yet the closure moment affirms continuity rather than testing commitment with an on-page price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete images: the tuning forks as silent waypoints, the conservatory as lexicon, "unshaken marvels" repeated with shifting weight. The final line—"We are unshaken marvels ourselves, proof that even a capsized world can learn to balance"—offers a resonant answer to the central question (how to sustain meaning after noise) without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures (the child's moth, the old woman mouthing gratitude, the man touching the pane). Minor slip: "permission to continue" and "reciprocal quiet" edge toward abstract theme statement rather than pure image, and the closing thesis arrives close to explicit declaration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and lyric, with a controlled perceptual signature: "winterglass," "a nation of wrong readings," "a pocket of stars." Psychic distance remains stable in close third, and diction suits the reflective, artistic focalizer. The prose modulates purposefully between memory (ferry psalm) and present action (tracing arcs, weighting forks). One slip: "silently expressive" appears three times in identical phrasing, and "after noise becomes impossible" recurs as a formulaic anchor without variation. Filter verbs ("I glanced," "I learned") are acceptably voice-motivated, and no head-hopping occurs.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: varied syntax, high information density, and purposeful rhythm ("heat gathers where longing knots, cools where fear retreats"). Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly. Minor artifacts: "silently expressive" repeated verbatim across beats; "after noise becomes impossible" functions as a template refrain without evolution; "We live inside a paradox" and "permission to continue" drift toward abstract summary. One paraphrase loop: the explanation of sorrow/remembrance/hope is restated in the leaf-weighting passage. No pervasive template cadence or filter-verb stacks, and figurative language remains coherent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise—translating emotion into visible thermal patterns in a post-sound world—offers a specific, non-obvious synthesis. The winterglass conservatory, heat-mapping sensors, and tuning-fork waypoints feel organic to the protagonist's background and the world's constraints. The piece commits fully to its lyric, accumulative design. Risk-taking in structure (mosaic fragments unified by pattern) heightens thematic resonance without obscuring clarity. One constraint: the emotional arc (survivor grief → sustained practice) follows a familiar template of artist-healer; transformation is present but the moral calculus remains largely affirmed rather than tested with ambiguity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Capsize survivor shapes backstory (ferry drowning, father's choir) and the riverbank correction episode in the middle. The survival motif charges the final "capsized world can learn to balance" image. Present by the second paragraph, returns at closure with reweighted meaning. Two beats (memory, algorithm rewrite). The survivor identity constrains the translation project but does not force a discrete on-page choice that alters tactics at a peak moment; it anchors rather than pivots.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Tuning fork case appears in five beats: unpacking, alignment along rail, father's memory, closing click, carrying home. The case transitions from inert tool to memorial to "lantern" metaphor, reweighted at closure. Setup early, returns in middle and ending. Two functional beats (alignment, closing click) plus lyric reprise. The case is specific and irreplaceable but does not constrain a choice under pressure; its role is primarily atmospheric and thematic anchor rather than causal pivot.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Unshaken marvels" seeds in paragraph five, recurs in the final line as thesis ("We are unshaken marvels ourselves"). The concept frames the dominant stake (witnessing wonder in silence) and the conservatory's function. Present early, returns at closure. Does not alter on-page tactics; functions as thematic frame and title rather than decision constraint. Lyric reprise reweights the premise with visible conceptual cost (endurance in a capsized world) but remains one step abstracted from immediate action pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Silently expressive" appears three times verbatim to describe the protagonist's hands. Label is tied to the translation method (hands trace arcs, sketch instructions) but reads more as trait description than cost-bearing constraint. Present by paragraph four, used in two beats (initial performance, arms conducting). Does not enable or foreclose a discrete choice; the expressiveness is assumed rather than tested against a limit or alternative.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Rectify" appears three times as verb and concept: correcting the algorithm, refusing misread sadness, rectifying posture toward wonder. The action drives the middle turn (rewriting by walking the riverbank, weighting forks with leaves) and anchors closure stance. Setup in first paragraph, developed in the algorithm-correction beat, returned at closure. Two distinct beats where the rectification changes method. Specific to the protagonist's technical and moral task; removal would flatten the arc. Causal pressure evident in the correction episode.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Heat-mapping method introduced in paragraph ten, detailed mechanics (sensors, gradients, temperature flow) shape all performance beats. The protagonist builds the lattice, aligns forks as waypoints, and the sensors draw breath-clouds into light. Setup by first third, drives middle attempts and final session, present at closure via "warmth in bones" and flight sketch. Three beats (initial design, failed attempt, successful performance). Removal would eliminate the story's technical spine. Specific mechanics constrain the translation process and the algorithm rewrite.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Winterglass conservatory anchors all action: glass ribs, frost, light/cold dynamics, aisles for the lattice. The setting supplies resources (mirrors, sensors, panes as canvas) and pressures choices (cold steadies, breath clouds, frost grows new lines). Present in title and paragraph one, used in every beat, shapes closure image ("auditorium of light"). The conservatory is indispensable; the story's logic and closure effect collapse without this exact space. Micro-setting (tuning fork rail, door, panes) alters tactics throughout.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"After noise becomes impossible" recurs as temporal anchor and world rule. The timeframe shapes all stakes (music must become visual) and tactics (sensors replace sound). Present in opening line, repeated throughout, implicit at closure. Does not function as a live countdown or escalating clock; it is a static condition rather than dynamic pressure. The hush enables the translation project but does not tighten decisions within the performance window. Coherent and consistent but not progressively urgent.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Motivation—translating silence into music—is declared in paragraph three, dramatized through building the lattice, correcting the algorithm, conducting sessions. The desire drives setup, middle correction, and final performance. Three beats where translation is enacted. Friction between the desire and the world's constraint (no sound) is present, and the cost (tireless effort, carrying the failed attempt, needing to continue) is visible. The motivation is specific and irreplaceable but lacks a moment where competing wants force a discrete sacrifice on the page.</comment>
