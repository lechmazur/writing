<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Ivo's colorblindness is established early and shapes his perceptual signature ("eyes sort light like gravel, shapes clear but hues guessed"), but his agency is largely observational rather than decisional until the reed moment. The choice to offer his brush and jar of smoke to acquire the reed shows concrete motivation, and the final decision to stay ("tells Mira with basil at the furnace door that he wants to stay") demonstrates earned commitment. However, the stakes feel more thematic than visceral; Ivo's journey from seeking beauty in imperfection to finding it through rhythm doesn't involve enough contradictory impulses or genuine struggle to elevate characterization into high bands. Internal conflict is more declared than dramatized in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its pattern early—plant-based communication, poetic compression, lyric repetition of "after the phoenix rises"—and accumulates meaning through layered images. Orientation anchors (glassblower's courtyard, Ivo, post-phoenix setting) arrive within the first 120 words. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Ivo moves from searching to being found by the imperfect song, a stance crystallization with felt cost (he surrenders the hunt and accepts dwelling in brokenness). The cost is conceptual and embodied in the final plant arrangement and the line "he is no longer searching because the imperfect song finds him." One meaningful deepening occurs when the reed doesn't give him color names but teaches him rhythm, reweighting his stake. The lens holds without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The glassblower's courtyard functions as micro-setting with purposeful constraints: the furnaces, cooling shelves, plant arrangements on sills, and the phoenix-slag gate recur and shape action. The courtyard's physicality pressures Ivo's choices (where to place plants, where to paint) and charges the closure (thyme and basil together, iris blessing). Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered: "smoke by flavor," "cobbles by temperature," "rain on nailheads and evening bread." The environment evolves causally (phoenix rises again in the kiln, bell of broken goblet hangs). The piece meets the 9+ test—environment constrains choices and charges the final image—but spatial choreography occasionally blurs (the booth with awakenings, the central case, the cooling shelf are not clearly mapped in relation to each other).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: Ivo wants to find beauty in imperfection, signaled early. The market of bartered awakenings provides the mechanism for one meaningful tightening: Ivo trades his best brush and a jar of smoke to acquire the reed, a concrete forfeiture. The reed moment deepens the stake by teaching him that "beauty in imperfection is a rhythm" rather than a visual clarity, narrowing his approach and charging his decision to stay. Agency drives the key turn (his choice to whisper colors and wait, then to stay and paint). However, escalation is modest—one trade, one realization, one commitment—and the stakes remain more conceptual than viscerally urgent. The cost is visible (the brush and jar) and felt (he stops searching), meeting the lens requirement for Accumulative design, but pressure doesn't compound through multiple reversals.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—beauty in imperfection as rhythm, brokenness as song—emerges organically from images (cracked city, wavering forms, chips and waves) and the reed's refusal to grant color names. The final image offers a resonant answer: "the imperfect song finds him," inverting the search without moralizing. Subtext operates in plant arrangements and the unspoken exchange between Ivo and Mira. No thesis statements intrude. The piece resists tidy resolution (visitors "trade their old perfection for a lattice of mistakes") and the conceptual question—what does it mean to awaken a sense—is paid off through the reed's effect. Emotional honesty avoids sentimentality. The closing plant message (thyme and basil for gratitude sharpened by purpose) and the phoenix's midday rise create a non-literal closure that reweights prior material. One minor slip: "breakable" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward stating rather than showing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single POV maintained throughout with stable third-person limited focalization. Perceptual signature is distinct and consistent: Ivo reads the world through non-visual senses, temperature, flavor, and guessed hues. Diction is purposeful and voice-motivated ("tilted head," "light like gravel," "breath sharpened by breath"). No dialogue appears; communication through plant arrangements functions as action and subtext. Free indirect style is clean. Psychic distance modulates appropriately (closer during the reed moment, slightly elevated during the final reflective paragraph). One slip: "innocently cunning, because honesty comes easy to him and so does aim" feels like authorial commentary rather than Ivo's self-perception. Prose reflects the focalizer's priorities throughout, and no head-hopping occurs.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully with lyric repetition of "after the phoenix rises" creating structural cadence. Information density is high in most beats. However, several paraphrase loops and near-duplicates appear: "beauty in imperfection" recurs without added pressure across paragraphs 4, 12, and 20; "the courtyard trees lean" and "soft chord slides out" in paragraph 18 restate sensory impressions; "phoenix rises" functions as motif but also as filler in paragraphs 1, 24, and 31. Template cadence emerges in mid-section beats with repeated "He [verb]" stems. Figurative density is high but mostly coherent; one mixed metaphor: "sings with chips and waves" conflates auditory and visual-physical domains without clear bridge. The final image is strong, but line-level momentum sags in the middle third due to synonym churn around "awakening" and "imperfection." Artifact penalty: −0.6 for paraphrase loops and template stems; no closure-beat contamination.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of colorblindness, glassblowing, plant-language communication, and a barter market for awakenings is specific and non-obvious. The core premise—a painter who cannot see color seeking beauty through other senses—avoids the inspiration-porn template by grounding the search in concrete craft (the reed, the brush trade, painting temperature rather than hue). The plant-communication system is inventive and logically consistent. Emotional specificity (the sense of a vase that wishes to collapse) avoids generic uplift. However, the barter-market frame and the phoenix motif feel underexploited; the "market of bartered awakenings" is named but not dramatized beyond one transaction, and the phoenix functions more as atmospheric repetition than as a constraint or thematic engine. Risk-taking in structure (lyric accumulation, minimal plot) serves coherence without gimmickry, earning modest bonus consideration within band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Ivo (colorblind painter) is present from paragraph 2, shapes the middle choice (trading brush and jar for the reed), and drives the closure decision (staying to paint glass while it cools). His trait alters how he perceives and acts ("eyes sort light like gravel," communicates through plants, paints temperature). Two beats: the trade and the stay-decision. Closure linkage: his final plant arrangement (thyme and basil) and his dream of imperfect song embody his transformation. Causal pressure is present but modest; his colorblindness enables rather than complicates. The character is essential but not indispensable—another sensory-impaired artist could serve similar function with edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The concertina reed tongue appears in paragraph 12 (setup), is acquired and used in paragraph 18 (development: "lifts the reed to his lips... whispers the colors"), and recurs in paragraphs 20 and 28 where it replies to doubt and speaks through drafts (payoff with reweighted meaning). It enables the key turn: teaching Ivo that beauty is rhythm rather than color. Three distinct beats, causal pressure (narrows his approach), and closure linkage (the reed's tone "tells them that the world chooses its own edges"). Cost connection: Ivo trades his best brush for it, and the reed's lesson forecloses his search for literal color. Specificity high: its exact function (tuning wind to truth, awakening a failing sense) matters. Not fully indispensable—another sensory tool could serve—but tightly integrated.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The concept of "bartered awakenings" is named in paragraph 3, framing the market where Ivo will trade. It shapes the middle beat (paragraph 16: "Each awakening costs a trade... a kiss for a scar polished to usefulness") and enables the reed acquisition. However, the concept remains more atmospheric than structural; only one barter is dramatized on the page, and the mechanics of how awakenings function beyond metaphor are not tested under pressure. The concept charges theme (visitors trade perfection for mistakes, paragraph 27) but doesn't constrain tactics in multiple beats. Present in closure thematically (paragraph 31: "enough awakenings for everyone willing to barter softness for sight") but not causally active there. Lyric reprise reweights meaning but without mid-scene use. Setup strong, development partial, payoff thematic rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Innocently cunning" is stated in paragraph 11 ("Ivo is innocently cunning, because honesty comes easy to him and so does aim") but functions as label rather than demonstrated trait. No on-page action clearly shows cunning with innocence as simultaneous contradictory impulses. The line feels like authorial assertion. His actions (offering the brush, whispering to the reed) read as earnest and direct, not cunning. The trait does not constrain or enable a choice with visible cost; it's ornamental. No setup, weak development (label-only), no payoff. Swappable: removing the phrase would not alter any beat.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Awaken" is seeded in the market name (paragraph 3), central in the reed's label (paragraph 13: "awaken the sense that keeps failing them"), and enacted in paragraph 18 when Ivo uses the reed and experiences the shift from seeking color to hearing rhythm. It shapes the core turn and drives closure thematically (paragraphs 20, 27, 31: awakenings that visitors can barter). Three beats, causal pressure (the reed's awakening redefines Ivo's goal), closure linkage strong. However, "awaken" could be replaced with "transform" or "reveal" without breaking the structure; the verb is central but not uniquely indispensable. Cost connection present: the awakening costs Ivo his brush and his former search.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plant-based communication is introduced in paragraph 6 ("To speak without speech, he arranges pots of rosemary, fennel, and beet greens"), detailed in paragraphs 7–8 (rosemary = brave entry, fennel = patience, etc.), and used in beats throughout: paragraph 8 (Mira answers with thyme and iris), paragraph 23 (Ivo tells Mira he wants to stay via basil), paragraph 24 (Mira replies with lavender and juniper), paragraph 26 (mint and nettle to visitors), and paragraph 30 (thyme and basil together at closure). The method shapes attempts (how Ivo and Mira negotiate without words), drives multiple beats, and charges the ending (the final arrangement is the closure gesture). Mechanics matter and are taught early. Specificity high: each plant's meaning is consistent. Indispensable: removing this method would collapse the communication structure. Causal pressure, closure linkage, irreplaceability all strong.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The glassblower's courtyard is named in paragraph 2, furnishes the setting for all action, and recurs with functional detail: furnaces (paragraphs 1, 7, 24), the gate with phoenix (paragraph 14), cooling shelf (paragraph 26), the booth (paragraph 10). The courtyard pressures choices (where to place plants, where to paint, the bell hanging) and supplies resources (the furnace as anchor for fennel, the sill for arrangements). Micro-setting elements (body/tool) also appear: Ivo's brush, the reed, the blowpipe. The space is not interchangeable; its glassblowing function matters to the phoenix motif and the cooling/heating rhythm. However, spatial choreography blurs in mid-section (booth, case, cooling shelf not clearly mapped). Setup strong, development solid (multiple beats), payoff present (courtyard holds awakenings, paragraph 31). Causal pressure modest; the space enables more than constrains.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"After the phoenix rises" is the opening phrase, recurs in paragraphs 24 and 31, and establishes the timeframe as post-event cyclical (kiln firings). However, the phoenix's rising functions more as atmospheric motif than as a tightening clock. Time does not pressure decisions; the narrative unfolds in a vague "days later" (paragraph 24) without urgency. The phrase charges tone and theme (rebirth, cycles of heat and cooling) but does not constrain tactics or narrow options. Lyric reprise reweights meaning at closure (phoenix rises "in the midday glaze," suggesting ongoing cycles) but the timeframe remains static rather than dynamic. Setup strong, development weak (no mid-scene time pressure), payoff thematic. Swappable: another cyclical marker could serve.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Ivo's desire "to find beauty in imperfection" is stated in paragraph 4, dramatized through his actions (studying cracks, seeking wavering forms, trading for the reed), and tested in paragraph 19 when the reed teaches him that beauty is rhythm rather than visual clarity. The motivation shapes two key beats (the reed acquisition and the decision to stay) and drives closure (paragraph 29: "he is no longer searching because the imperfect song finds him"). Friction between want and cost: he must surrender his best brush and his former mode of seeking. Internal conflict is present but modest; the want doesn't clash with a competing fear or need on the page. The motivation is essential and charges the final image (thyme and basil, iris blessing, imperfect song). Development and payoff strong; setup clear. Minor swappability: another aesthetic quest could function similarly.</comment>
