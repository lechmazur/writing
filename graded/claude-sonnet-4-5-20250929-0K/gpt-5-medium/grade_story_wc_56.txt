<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is concrete and voice-particular throughout, with sensory perception grounded in canal work ("lantern glass polished by rain"). Internal conflict operates consistently—the desire for "serenely radical correction" versus the weight of family complicity creates genuine tension. The final choice to partner with the engineer is earned by prior causality, though the cost remains more conceptual than visceral. Embodied emotion is present but occasionally drifts toward elevated register ("serenely I stood in upheaval") that edges into label-speak under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph; the canal setting and quest are clear. The piece follows a causal lens: the protagonist retrieves the box, reads the evidence, confronts the engineer, and together they choose a new path—a Decisive Change with visible cost (leaving behind silence for action, forfeiting anonymity). One meaningful tightening occurs when the letters reveal family complicity, narrowing the protagonist's options from abstract justice to personal reckoning. The closure lands on the page with felt cost: "leaving ripples like new lines on a map" signals irrevocable exposure and partnership.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The canal setting is vivid and purposeful: brick arches, lockmaster steps, and warehouse quays guide movement and constrain choices. The sundial functions as micro-setting, warming in the protagonist's palm and offering a "polite witness" that charges the final mood. Sensory detail is selective—"slime-green seal," "breath you could see"—and filtered through the protagonist's professional lens. The box's emergence from the water and the quay meeting both use spatial choreography to pressure decisions, satisfying the 9+ gate for constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding the architecture of lies—is signaled early and drives each beat. One clear tightening occurs when the letters reveal the protagonist's father and aunt in the ledger, converting abstract investigation into personal betrayal. The final decision to partner with the engineer narrows options with visible cost: both men forsake deniability and safety by pushing off together. Agency operates through decision and endurance; coincidence does not resolve. Pressure coheres under the causal lens, though the engineer's conversion feels slightly compressed given the weight of complicity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: floodgate angles, payment notations, and the canal's "truer city" rather than abstract philosophizing. The protagonist's internal arc—from errant seeker to complicit inheritor—is inextricable from the thematic question of institutional deception. The final image ("leaving ripples like new lines on a map") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the metaphor of mapping truth. Hindsight clarity as motif recurs meaningfully, and the ending resists tidy resolution while maintaining thematic coherence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person throughout with consistent narrative distance and a distinct perceptual signature: the protagonist notices canal infrastructure, official seals, and procedural details befitting their background. Diction occasionally elevates beyond plausible lexicon ("serenely radical correction," "thoughtfully clear") in ways that read more authorial than character-specific under pressure. Dialogue is minimal but goal-driven; the engineer's single line carries subtext and advances plot. Psychic distance modulates purposefully, and the prose rhythm supports emotional beats, though filter verbs ("felt," "seemed") appear frequently without always serving voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high; most lines advance multiple jobs. However, figurative language clusters densely in several beats without clear pattern-teaching: "parchment ribbon," "architecture of lies that ribbed our districts like concealed bracing," "tide… lifting everything in me to the same calm level" within close proximity. Minor template cadence appears in repeated "I [verb]" openings across the middle section. The closure beat is clean, and no paraphrase loops obscure causality, but the overwriting in high-pressure moments (retrieval, revelation) applies a −0.6 deduction for density and coherence friction combined.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The premise—salvaging suppressed urban history from a canal lockbox—offers a fresh angle on institutional-deception narratives through specific canal infrastructure and guild mechanics. The protagonist's family complicity transforms the investigation into personal reckoning rather than generic exposé. Emotional specificity (the weight of refusals as a readable map) avoids template arcs. The ending's quiet partnership rather than confrontation or disclosure feels earned and non-obvious, though the "architecture of lies" metaphor and serene-upheaval pairing edge toward familiar conceptual pairings without full transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The errant legend seeker frames expectation early, drives the retrieval action, reads the letters, and makes the closure choice to partner with the engineer. Present in setup, middle beats (salvage, confrontation), and payoff. The seeker role enables the investigation and constrains the approach (lone, nocturnal, methodical). Causal pressure is moderate; the role shapes tactics but could be replaced with "investigator" or "archivist" with minor edits, limiting irreplaceability. Cost connection is present but generic to the investigative role rather than unique to legend-seeking.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The antique pocket sundial appears in three beats: opened at the start (compass needle twitching), warming in the protagonist's palm during retrieval, and reflecting on truth-telling in the penultimate paragraph. Early signal and closure linkage are present, but the sundial does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic under pressure—it observes rather than acts. The final reflection ("polite witness to how even tools of truth must ride with the hour") reweights its symbolic meaning, achieving lyric resonance, but functional involvement remains descriptive. Two-gate model (setup + payoff, missing middle causal use) caps eligibility near 6.0; lyric reprise can reach ~6.3, but ornamental middle use and lack of specificity (any timepiece could substitute) lower the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Hindsight clarity is signaled early ("all my wandering had been a map made of refusals") and shapes the protagonist's stance throughout. The concept drives a key beat: reading the letters produces the clarity that reframes family history and compels the confrontation. It appears in the closure paragraph ("hindsight clarity is not an indictment but a path") and directly shapes the final choice to walk that path with the engineer. Present in setup, development, and payoff with moderate causal pressure. Specificity is moderate—the concept is philosophical and could be restated as "revelation" or "understanding" with minor edits. Cost connection is present: clarity forecloses denial.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Thoughtfully clear" is mentioned twice: "my senses thoughtfully clear" (paragraph 10) and implied in the careful, methodical approach. The trait enables the protagonist's patient salvage work and measured response to revelation, but it functions more as a descriptive label than a constraint with visible cost. No on-page moment shows the trait forcing a tradeoff or limiting options. Setup is present but development and payoff are weak; the trait could be replaced with "patient" or "deliberate" without structural change. Label-only treatment and swappability cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Salvage action is the structural spine: the protagonist salvages the box (inciting physical action), salvages truth from documents (middle revelation), and salvages partnership with the engineer (closure turn). Present in setup, multiple middle beats, and payoff. The action constrains approach (nocturnal, solitary, physical) and shapes tactics under pressure. Removing salvage would require wholesale rewrite of method and stakes. Specificity is high—salvage evokes material recovery and moral reclamation simultaneously. Cost connection is strong: physical risk during retrieval, social risk at closure. Minor deduction for late closure cost being slightly more conceptual than physical.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"By training instincts" is signaled early ("my mind had learned to move by training instincts rather than by orders") and mentioned again at closure ("the old training in my wrists, the instincts calibrated by tides"). The method enables the salvage work and informs the protagonist's rejection of orders/authority, shaping the final partnership choice. Setup and payoff are clear, but middle development is thin—the method is described rather than dramatized in a constrained choice. Mechanics matter thematically (instinct vs. orders) but remain abstract. Swappability is moderate; "experience" or "habit" could substitute. Lyric reprise lifts the score into mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The twilight barge canal is established immediately, guides all movement, and supplies the lockmaster steps (resource for salvage) and warehouse quay (confrontation site). Present in setup, middle, and payoff. The canal's infrastructure (brick arches, locks, basin) constrains approach and timing. The setting enables the core action (underwater retrieval) and charges the closure image ("the canal unfolded a truer city"). Specificity is strong—canal mechanics and guild history are irreplaceable. Minor deduction: the "twilight" descriptor adds atmosphere but does not functionally constrain choices beyond general low-light conditions; "dawn" or "dusk" could substitute the mood element.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The timeframe "by the silence of morning radio" appears in the opening and closing paragraphs, framing the action and signaling the transmitter-sleep window mentioned in the engineer's ledger. Setup and payoff are clear; the silence enables covert movement (middle development). The timeframe tightens tactics by implying a narrow operational window, though the urgency is not dramatized with a ticking clock or consequence for delay. Specificity is high—radio silence is tied to the conspiracy's mechanics. Cost connection is moderate; missing the window is mentioned as a past risk but not tested on the page. Lyric reprise and thematic resonance lift the score, but lack of on-page time pressure caps it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation to understand the architecture of lies is stated early and drives every choice: the salvage quest, the reading of documents, the confrontation, and the closure partnership. Present in setup, development, and payoff with strong causal pressure. The motivation is dramatized through the protagonist's physical and emotional journey, not merely told. Friction emerges when understanding reveals family complicity, raising the cost. Specificity is strong—"architecture of lies" is tied to floodgates and infrastructure. Minor deduction: the phrasing occasionally tilts toward thematic echo rather than lived desire, and the final paragraph's articulation ("to understand") reads slightly expository.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Serene upheaval" is established early ("serenely radical correction") and sustained through the protagonist's calm demeanor during high-stakes retrieval and revelation. The tone modulates purposefully: quiet determination during salvage, reflective gravity during reading, measured partnership at closure. The final image ("leaving ripples like new lines on a map") charges the tone by balancing serene action with upheaval's consequence. Coherence is strong across beats. Minor deduction: "serenely I stood in upheaval" in paragraph 22 edges toward self-conscious articulation of the tone rather than embodying it through action and rhythm, and the pairing occasionally reads as authorial concept more than organic voice.</comment>
