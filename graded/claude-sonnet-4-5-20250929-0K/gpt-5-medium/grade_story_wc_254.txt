<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The poet's interiority remains largely opaque—we see them touch columns and speak but never access contradictory impulses or embodied emotion under pressure. The collective "we" POV dilutes individual agency; no single character makes a high-stakes choice with visible internal cost. The former guard's tear-comma moment gestures toward transformation but is told rather than dramatized through a micro-choice that forecloses a path. Motivation is declared ("to stride through boundaries") but never tested by competing desires or genuine friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (cobalt atrium, frozen lake, post-ban gathering) arrive early. The piece accumulates symbolic density through recurring motifs (humming colonnade, lantern-moth hush, dissolving boundaries) and builds to a Resonant Reconfiguration when the group steps onto the ice, reweighting permission and fear. However, the cost remains atmospheric rather than legible on the page—no concrete forfeiture or consequence is visible in the final image. The RR reads as thematic assertion (boundaries dissolve "responsibly") without dramatized price, weakening closure under the chosen lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The cobalt atrium, frozen lake, and humming quartz colonnade supply vivid spatial anchors and sensory detail (blue light, mineral/ink/snow air, ice cracking). The atrium's architecture constrains the gathering and the colonnade's vibration responds to the poet's touch, shaping one beat. Micro-setting (glass fogging/clearing, ivy-sipping planter) adds texture but does not constrain a choice at closure. The frozen lake charges the final image when the poet steps onto "first safe ice," elevating the setting's role in the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: collective permission to speak and gather after years of enforced silence. The piece signals this early but never narrows options through a meaningful tightening—no competing choice or visible tradeoff emerges. The poet invites synchronized breathing and the group follows onto the ice, but these acts feel ceremonial rather than decision-laden; no live cost or foreclosed path is dramatized. Escalation under the Accumulative lens would require a cadence shift or density break that reweights the stake with felt price; instead, the final image asserts resolution ("boundary dissolves responsibly") without demonstrating what was risked or lost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme of repressive law versus communal meaning-making emerges through concrete images (taped windows, badge in planter, chalk lines) rather than statement. The poet's paraphrase action ("Keep apart, lest meaning spill" reread as "Keep afraid, lest meaning live") offers a non-literal answer to the central question. However, the final paragraph's direct claim ("certainty trembles again, not fragile this time, but fertile") edges toward overt thematic summary. The lantern-moth hush and dissolving boundaries recur with shifted weight, but the ending's resonance is more asserted than earned from prior dramatic cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>First-person plural POV is stable and treated as single collective stance; no head-hopping into individuated interiorities. Voice carries a consistent lyric register (e.g., "tears commas of brine," "diaphragm breathing the boundary porous and kind") with purposeful syntactic patterning. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("ethics of presence," "meaning move like weather across faces") that reads more like thematic essay than lived perception under pressure. Psychic distance remains controlled but the collective "we" limits perceptual signature—no character-specific bias in noticing emerges.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense and often vivid ("lantern-moth hush," "cloud-shadow poet," "ivy sips the metal for courage") but appears in nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering overwriting penalties (−0.5). Register drifts into academic abstraction ("ethics of presence," "Conceptual Repricing") that clashes with the lyric voice in peak beats (−0.4). Paraphrase loops appear: "dissolving boundaries" is restated across multiple lines without added pressure (−0.2). Several lines are decorative rather than propulsive (e.g., "the atrium remembers its purpose" tells rather than shows). Cumulative line-level debt and elevated diction in high-pressure moments lower the score and disallow 9+ globally per the artifact cap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The premise—post-authoritarian gathering to reclaim communal voice through metaphor and song—offers a fresh angle on familiar material (banned art, collective healing). Specifics like the humming quartz colonnade and the badge-in-planter image provide memorable texture. However, the emotional arc (fear → tentative courage → collective stepping-through) follows a recognizable template without a non-obvious moral calculus or turn. The poet's paraphrase action and the final ice-crossing gesture feel thematically coherent but do not surprise in hindsight; the story commits fully to its lyric premise but does not transform the underlying emotional structure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Cloud-shadow poet present early (paragraph 3), touches the column (beat 1), clears throat and paraphrases decree (beat 2), steps between columns to invite synchronized breathing (beat 3), steps onto the ice (closure beat). Functional across four beats but the poet's choices do not narrow options with visible cost—acts feel ceremonial rather than decision-laden. The poet enables the group's movement but does not face competing pressures or make a trade-off. Swappable with a similar facilitator role. Early signal +0.5, four beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.9, but ornamental agency −0.8, swappability −0.6, no cost connection −0.4 = baseline ~4.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Humming quartz colonnade introduced early (paragraph 2), poet touches it and it "tunes itself to the pulse of their wrist" (beat 1), it answers "low and round" during synchronized breathing (beat 2), crescendos during laughter and ice-crack (beat 3), sends a tone that "keeps our balance" as the group crosses onto the ice (closure beat). Object shapes multiple beats and charges the final image with continuous support. Early signal +0.6, four beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.5, but lacks a visible cost tied to its use −0.4, and the mechanics (how humming guides balance) remain vague −0.6 = ~6.7.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"A tremor of certainty" appears when the poet touches the column ("tremor of certainty crosses our skin"), recurs in the final line ("certainty trembles again, not fragile this time, but fertile"). The concept frames the shift from fear to communal resolve but does not constrain a tactical choice on the page—it functions as thematic echo rather than decision lever. Early signal +0.4, lyric reprise +0.8, closure linkage (theme layer) +0.7, but does not narrow options −0.8, ornamental −0.5 = ~5.2. The return reweights the stake (certainty as fertile rather than fragile) with modest conceptual cost, lifting it into the 5.5–6.3 lyric-resonance band, but lack of mid-scene pressure limits it to the lower end.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Aesthetically driven" attributed to the architect in paragraph 6 as backstory; no on-page cost or choice tied to the trait. Mentioned once, does not constrain action or shape a beat. Present but ornamental. Label-only −0.3, late introduction (past first third) −0.3, no beat involvement −0.5, swappable −0.4 = ~3.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Paraphrase" action appears when the poet paraphrases the old decree ("Keep apart, lest meaning spill" becomes "Keep afraid, lest meaning live," paragraph 12–13) and later paraphrases a sacred charter (paragraph 26–27). This action drives the thematic turn and enables the group's shift from fear to movement. Early signal (first paraphrase ~40% mark) +0.3, two distinct beats +0.9, closure linkage (charter paraphrase leads to stepping onto ice) +1.0, specificity (exact rewording matters) +0.5, but the action does not narrow options with visible cost—it facilitates rather than forces a tradeoff −0.6, and could be replaced with "reinterpret" or "reread" with minor edits −0.4 = ~5.9.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>"Through dissolving boundaries" signaled early as the poet's method (paragraph 5: "stride through boundaries once thought sacred," paragraph 14: "move through dissolving boundaries"). The means recurs across multiple beats: poet steps between columns (paragraph 20), invites the group to step across inlaid line (paragraph 28), steps onto ice and the group follows (paragraphs 38–40). Mechanics (gentle touch, collective breath, physical crossing) are dramatized rather than merely declared. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure participation (ice crossing is the final enactment) +1.0, specificity (dissolving vs. shattering) +0.4, but the cost of this method is asserted ("responsibly") rather than shown with a visible price −0.6, and the means could be summarized as "crossing" or "moving through" with minor edits −0.7 = ~5.5.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Cobalt atrium by frozen lake anchors all action; setting introduced in opening line. The atrium's acoustics and architecture shape the synchronized breathing beat (paragraph 22–23), and the frozen lake supplies the ice that the poet tests and the group crosses (paragraphs 38–40), making the boundary-crossing literal. Early signal +0.8, two major beats (breathing, ice crossing) +0.9, closure linkage (ice is the site of final action) +1.3, micro-setting detail (glass fogging, planter) +0.3, but the setting does not impose a constraint that alters tactics—it enables rather than pressures choices −0.5, and "atrium by lake" could be replaced with another ceremonial space and water boundary with moderate edits −0.4 = ~6.4.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"After the ban lifts" frames the entire gathering (opening line, paragraph 8). Timeframe is consistent but does not tighten decisions—no clock pressure or urgency. The "after" context explains why the gathering is newly possible but does not create tactical friction. Early signal +0.7, closure linkage (the crossing is the first post-ban act) +0.8, but vague duration (no live clock) −0.6, does not narrow options −0.7, swappable with "post-curfew" or similar −0.5 = ~4.2.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"To stride through boundaries once thought sacred" stated as the poet's childhood longing (paragraph 18), enacted when poet steps between columns (paragraph 20) and onto ice (paragraph 38). Desire is declared rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost. Early signal (mid-story) +0.3, two beats (column step, ice step) +0.9, closure linkage (ice step is the culmination) +1.0, but motivation is told rather than tested by friction −0.8, no competing desire or tradeoff on the page −0.7, swappable with "to cross thresholds" −0.4 = ~5.3.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Lantern-moth hush" introduced early (paragraph 4), recurs when it "holds, yet inside it, courage wakes" (paragraph 19), and again in the final third: "It is a lantern-moth hush that works, not spectacle" (paragraph 34), and "Under that lantern-moth hush, certainty trembles again" (final line). Tone is coherent across turns and modulates subtly from cautious to fertile. Early signal +0.7, three beats (intro, courage wake, final affirmation) +1.4, closure linkage (charges final image with "fertile" certainty) +1.2, specificity (the quiet-glow metaphor is consistent and voice-driven) +0.6, causal pressure (the hush enables rather than spectacle) +0.8, but the tone does not constrain a choice—it colors rather than shapes decisions −0.5, and "quiet resolve" could replace it with minor metaphor edits −0.4 = ~6.8.</comment>
