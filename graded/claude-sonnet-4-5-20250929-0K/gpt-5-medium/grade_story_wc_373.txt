<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lark's motivation is concrete and her micro-choices under pressure (winding the fob, looping the chain around the cutpurse's wrist, paying for the limes) reveal hierarchy of values. Interior texture is distinct—"curiously steadfast, a young spine grown straight by river winds"—and embodied emotion appears in tactile detail (bare feet on the pier, hand on the fob). The watch fob inheritance and father's maps provide backstory that tilts present stance, but the cutpurse's sudden grab feels slightly convenient rather than earned by prior setup, and Kettle/smuggler remain functional rather than fully individuated.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening lines; the dominant stake (capturing trust breaking) is clear. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: Lark engineers false starts that braid tension until the lime-spill triggers Kettle's reach and the smuggler's recoil, producing the recorded "brittle inhale." Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the sound is captured, the market resumes breathing, and Lark exits with her bottled message—but the cost is primarily atmospheric rather than a visible personal forfeiture on the final beat, keeping this just below 8.5.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The rotting pier, lantern-braided planks, and truce of hush create a tactile, constraining environment. Sensory detail is vivid and selective: "limes rolled bright as moons," "one split with a wet gasp," salt/rot/lullaby under bare feet. The setting directly enables Lark's plan (the hush forbids speech, forcing gesture and implication) and the toppled crate becomes a catalyst. Spatial choreography is clear across all moves, and the dawn seam opening above the river charges the final image, placing this firmly in the high 8s.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>One dominant stake (capture trust breaking) is signaled early and pressure accumulates through Lark's orchestrated false starts until the lime spill forces Kettle's too-fast reach and the smuggler's recoil. The "brittle inhale" is the tightening moment that narrows trust into fracture. Cost is present but diffuse—Lark pays a coin for dignity, the cutpurse fades unpunished, and the hush loosens—rather than a sharp personal forfeiture, and the escalation relies partly on coincidence (the cutpurse's hook) rather than pure protagonist agency, capping this below 8.5.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme (trust as fragile structure, surveillance as inheritance) emerges from concrete particulars: the fob ticking "like a careful conscience," the hush as social contract, the father's maps of "when to listen." The final image—carrying the brittle inhale "like a message in a bottle, a promise to return whenever trust is about to change shape"—reweights the premise without stating a moral. Subtext operates in gesture (Kettle's fingers rehearsing theft, the smuggler's unspoken accusation) and the piece resists tidy resolution, though the thematic echo in the closing promise brushes against direct statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Lark notices tide tables, stains, the pier's breath, "invisible web pull, strand to strand." Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("comforting unease," "tug loyalties different ways without naming the tug"). Free indirect style is clean, psychic distance stable. Minor slips: "human weather" and "deciding to be sand again" edge toward self-conscious lyricism, and the density of metaphor in high-pressure beats (lime "like a warning," glass "deciding") occasionally competes with propulsion, but the overall texture remains coherent and purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, information density is high, and figurative language is mostly controlled. However, near-paraphrase loops appear: "the hush held the words inside" echoes "the hush forbade"; "comforting unease" recurs without reweighting. Template cadence in the middle third ("She would buy and almost buy, promise and almost promise") and filter-verb stacks ("felt the pier breathe," "felt like a warning") dull immediacy. These patterns pervade non-closure beats, triggering accumulation penalties and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact rules.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The premise—field recording trust's fracture in a silent market—offers a fresh synthesis of sensory collection, inherited maps, and forced social silence. The truce-of-hush constraint and Lark's false-start method feel specific and earned. Risk-taking in the lyric register heightens stakes without obscuring causality. However, the moonshine-runner's-daughter + antique-fob combination brushes template Americana, and the final "message in a bottle" metaphor is familiar, preventing entry into the highest band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lark's choices create all key turns: she winds the fob to keep the metronome, loops the chain to thwart the cutpurse, pays for the limes to restore dignity, and waits until sunrise to close the recording. Her agency drives the false-start orchestration and the final decision to exit with the sound. Setup early, developed across multiple beats, causal pressure throughout, and closure linkage place this high.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The watch fob appears in the opening, is assessed by Kettle (who fingers it covetously), is wound by Lark as a metronome, looped around the cutpurse's wrist to thwart theft, and pocketed at closure. It ticks through beats as a "careful conscience" and ties to inheritance. Three distinct beats plus closure participation, but its role is more atmospheric anchor than irreplaceable causal lever—swapping it for another inherited timepiece would not break the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The truce of hush shapes every tactic: vendors trade by nod, the cutpurse hisses without sound, Kettle's eyes speak what his mouth cannot, the smuggler's accusation remains internal, and trust breaks as a "brittle inhale" because speech is forbidden. The concept is introduced immediately, governs all moves, and charges the closure (the hush loosens "thread by thread" at dawn). Indispensable to the story's logic and stakes.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Curiously steadfast" is introduced early and tied to "a young spine grown straight by river winds." It enables Lark's patient orchestration and waiting until sunrise despite the cutpurse's threat and market tension. The attribute constrains her method (she does not flee or escalate) and is reprised in "curiously steadfast patience" near closure. Present across setup, middle patience, and ending, but the cost of steadfastness is not sharply dramatized—removing the exact phrase would not break causality.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Thwarting the cutpurse by looping the watch-fob chain creates the cascade: toppled crate, rolling limes, Kettle's too-fast reach, smuggler's recoil, and the brittle inhale Lark records. The action is causally central and irreplaceable—freezing or fleeing would not trigger the trust fracture. Setup (cutpurse introduced), development (thwart executed), and payoff (recorded sound) are all present. High causal pressure and closure linkage, but the cutpurse's arrival reads slightly convenient.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Through false starts" is signaled early ("Her plan was simple through false starts") and demonstrated across beats: she bargains then changes her mind, promises payment then stops, cites a tide chart only she remembers. The method is the tactical backbone—each near-transaction tugs loyalties and braids tension until the web tears. The mechanics matter throughout and shape the final sound capture. Strong beat involvement and causal pressure, though "false starts" as a phrase is somewhat generic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The pirate market beneath the rotting pier is introduced in the opening line and governs every choice: the hush truce forbids speech, the planks creak and breathe, the crate of limes supplies the catalyst, the tarps fold at dawn. Setting is not backdrop but architecture—Lark's bare feet on the pier, thelantern-braided nerves, the ropes and timbers that "remembered storms" all constrain and enable. The market's "comforting unease" charges the final image. Indispensable across setup, development, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Until sunrise" is signaled early ("a truce of hush held over the planks until sunrise") and tracked throughout: Lark waits, the hush loosens "thread by thread as a gray seam opened above the river," and she shuts off the recorder when "the first gull decided to speak." The timeframe tightens decisions (she must capture the sound before speech is allowed) and the dawn arrival releases tension at closure. Present across all three gates with moderate causal pressure, though the urgency is more atmospheric than a live countdown.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lark's motivation—"to capture the sound of trust breaking, the rarest crack in her collection of human weather"—is introduced early, pursued through orchestrated false starts, and fulfilled on the page when she records the "brittle inhale." The desire is concrete, conflicted (she engineers harm to document it), and costly (she pays for the limes, lets the cutpurse fade, and carries the sound as inheritance). Strong causal pressure, closure linkage, and specificity; the friction between collector's detachment and inherited duty charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Comforting unease" is named in the opening and reprised later ("comforting unease layered like blankets"). The tone modulates with pressure—nerves braided with lantern light, the hush as listening shawl, trust breaking like glass deciding to be sand, quiet returning after trembling. The oxymoron holds through turns and charges the market's resumption of breathing at closure. Coherent and purposeful, with good modulation, though the exact phrase recurs without full reweighting.</comment>
