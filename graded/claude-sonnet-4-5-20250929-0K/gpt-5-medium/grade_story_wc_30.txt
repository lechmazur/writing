<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The titan-gear librarian POV sustains a consistent perceptual signature—mechanical, patient, accretive—and the choices (cataloging, accepting contradictions, shelving paradox) align with the established persona. The woman's shifting names create a relationship beat that forces the librarian to act: she takes the cards, pours words from the creel, and rings the bells. However, interiority remains largely declarative ("My work is to preserve wonder in routine") rather than embodied under pressure, and the transformation at closure (the woman's kelp coat drying into paper) is observed, not dramatically chosen by the protagonist. The final micro-choice—rinsing the creel to "teach them currents"—is deliberate but lacks visible conflict or cost that would elevate the stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a lyric, accretive pattern by the first third (tidal imagery, salt-bright drawers, migrating identities) and sustains it through a single continuous encounter that culminates in the woman's name settling and her coat transforming into chlorophyll. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the woman pins the card to her sleeve, the bells cool to a hush, and the librarian returns to the clerkship of tides, reweighting the ritual with felt finality. Orientation anchors (tidal atrium, titan-gear librarian, wintersun, "after tomorrow disappears") are signaled early and remain stable. The cost is oblique but legible: the woman leaves, the atrium slickens, the bells fall silent—options are reconfigured, not decisively altered. One meaningful tightening occurs when the three library cards resolve into "one true name," narrowing identity flux and charging the final image with ritual acceptance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The tidal atrium is anchored early with vivid, selective detail (glass ribs, salt-flecked panes, foam-bright drawers) filtered through the librarian's occupational lens. Sensory data—smell of iron and sea moss, the hush of low tide, the slick floor at closure—modulates with emotional pressure and constrains the setting's ritual logic (tide cycles, moon phases, bell alcoves). The fisherman's bamboo creel functions as micro-setting: handled in multiple beats (gathering words, pouring them onto bells, rinsing in brine), it supplies the tactile resources that shape the woman's resolution. The final image charges the setting: "the atrium floor slickens, and the bells cool to a hush like frost taking breath," grounding the closure in physical consequence. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout; the metallurgy alcove, stacks, and reference desk track cleanly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: preserve the woman's migrating identity against erasure by tide and moon. The stake is signaled early ("She needs a book that will hold her shape") and accumulates pressure through a single meaningful tightening: the three pulsing library cards migrate, then settle into "one true name" that neither woman nor bells have yet learned to pronounce. The librarian's agency—taking the cards, pouring words from the creel, allowing contradictions to be smelted—drives the turn. Escalation reads as density increase under the Accumulative lens: the bells learn "a migratory pitch," the kelp coat dries into paper and leaves chlorophyll, and the woman breathes into slackwater calm. Cost is felt but subtle: the woman leaves, the bells fall silent, and the librarian returns to solitary routine. No overt antagonist or multiple reversals, but the moon's erasure threat and the tide's amnesia supply coherent opposition throughout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—preserving wonder in routine by accepting contradictions—emerges organically from the librarian's ritual work rather than from stated thesis. The fisherman's creel, migrating identities, and bells that "ring true" by accepting flux function as charged motifs that constrain choice and reweight meaning at closure: "remembering is just wonder doing chores." The woman's question ("what happens when the moon forgets her") and the librarian's answer ground the theme in specific action (the creel will wait, the shelves will remember). The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "keep, keep, keep" answered by "I will, as long as tides turn pages," which reconfigures the opening's "after tomorrow disappears" without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence and gesture (the kelp coat's chlorophyll signature, the bells cooling to frost-breath) and invites reflection on impermanence and care without collapsing into platitude.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Single first-person POV remains stable, with a distinct perceptual signature: mechanical (hinge-hearted, clockwork shoulders), patient, accretive, filtering all detail through tidal and archival metaphor. Psychic distance is close and consistent; the librarian's way of noticing is selective (words as minnows, names as gulls, time as raw ore) and character-specific. Diction is elevated but voice-motivated and legible, with purposeful compression ("by accepting contradictions, the bells learn to ring a note that captures her without pinning her"). The woman's brief dialogue ("I am all of them, but only until the tide turns") carries subtext and contrasts with the librarian's interior lyricism without head-hopping. Syntax and rhythm modulate with emotional beats: shorter pulses during the card-taking, expansive parallelism in reflective passages. No filter-verb stacks or mid-paragraph POV leakage; the prose texture reflects the focalizer's mechanical patience throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high ("the clerkship of tides, stamping dates that have dissolved, and shelving maps that redraw themselves hourly"). However, figurative language saturates nearly every line without clear pattern-teaching or payoff differentiation: "days forget their names," "migrating identities," "minnows of thought," "kelp coat," "wintersun," "slackwater," "raw ore," "frost taking breath"—each evocative, but the unrelenting density blurs hierarchies and occasionally muddles causality (e.g., "the bells know it, and the tide nods" anthropomorphizes without grounding). Several lines loop conceptually: "My work is to preserve wonder in routine" is rephrased as "remembering is just wonder doing chores" and "how routine learns to sing." Minor register drift into abstract philosophizing ("wonder doing chores," "unfinished selves") clashes with the tactile metallurgy and tidal mechanics. Clarity remains above threshold, but momentum drags in the middle third due to over-layered metaphor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of tidal library, migrating identities, and metallurgical ritual feels specific and memorable, avoiding template plots. The librarian's acceptance of contradiction as cataloging method and the creel's transformation from passive basket to active tool for word-gathering offer fresh inflection on archival and identity-preservation themes. The "one true name she has never learned to pronounce" and the bells that "ring a migratory pitch" are non-obvious solutions that grow from prior particulars (tide cycles, moon phases, contradictions as flux). Risk-taking in sustained lyric mode and elliptical causality heightens stakes without obscuring closure legibility. However, the premise (liminal librarian, tide-swept identities, metaphysical objects) leans on fantasy-fiction templates, and the emotional arc (acceptance through ritual) is familiar; transformation arises more from diction and setting specificity than from a surprising moral calculus or structural gambit.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The titan-gear librarian is present throughout and makes key choices: taking the three library cards, leading the woman to the metallurgy alcove, pouring words from the creel onto the bells, and returning to solitary cataloging at closure. These decisions shape two beats (the card-settling and the bell-ringing) and the ending ritual. However, the librarian's agency is more curatorial than transformative—observing the woman's shifts, facilitating rather than confronting—and the final choice (rinsing the creel, winding shoulder gears) is routine rather than a decisive alteration. Early signal is strong; beat involvement is solid; causal pressure and closure linkage are moderate.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The fisherman's bamboo creel appears in three distinct beats: introduced beside the reference desk (setup), used to gather loose words that "shine when frightened" (middle), and poured onto the bells to form titles (closure participation). Its evolving function—passive basket to active word-vessel—reweights its meaning and supplies the tactile resource that enables the woman's resolution. The final beat (rinsing in brine to "teach them currents") charges the creel with ritual continuity. Specificity is high (bamboo, silvered by salt, weave, long patience), and its presence is irreplaceable in the closure logic. Cost connection is oblique but present: without the creel's words, the bells cannot ring the migratory pitch.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Migrating identities frame the woman's arrival (three library cards, each with a different name, each pulsing), create the central problem (she needs a book that will hold her shape), and drive the middle turn (the cards migrate, then settle into one true name). The concept constrains the librarian's method (accepting contradictions) and shapes the closure image (the woman breathes, the kelp coat dries into paper and chlorophyll signature). Early signal, beat involvement across three moments, causal pressure, and closure linkage are all strong. The concept is irreplaceable: swapping it would collapse the tidal metaphor and the bell-ringing resolution.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Fluctuates with moon phases" is signaled early ("Each visitor fluctuates with moon phases, and so does the ink") and the woman's shifting names are implicitly tied to lunar cycles. The trait enables the librarian's acceptance-of-contradictions method and constrains the resolution: the woman's identity is stable only "until the tide turns." However, the moon-phase mechanics are label-only; no on-page action shows the phases changing or forcing a visible tradeoff during the encounter. The woman's question ("what happens when the moon forgets her") invokes the cost conceptually, but it remains told rather than dramatized. Closure linkage is moderate; specificity is mid-range.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Smelt" (metallurgy) anchors the resolution: the librarian leads the woman to the metallurgy alcove "where broken minutes are smelt into bells that ring true," and "time metal glows there like sunset under ice, and it accepts contradictions as flux accepts ore." The action is not performed on the page, but the alcove's smelting logic enables the bell-ringing that captures the woman's migratory pitch. Early setup is implicit in "the metallurgy alcove, a warm corner"; closure participation is strong. However, the smelting itself is described rather than dramatized, and the physics remain metaphorical, reducing causal clarity. Swappability is moderate: another transformation verb (forge, cast) could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"By accepting contradictions" is signaled early ("I do this by accepting contradictions, shelving paradox by subject"), governs the middle turn ("By accepting contradictions, the bells learn to ring a note that captures her without pinning her, a migratory pitch"), and shapes the closure logic: the librarian's method allows the woman's three names to settle into one true name without erasure. The method is irreplaceable and drives the resolution across two beats. Specificity is high (contradictions as flux, paradox shelving, migratory pitch); cost connection is present (acceptance forecloses certainty). Early signal, causal pressure, beat involvement, and closure linkage all qualify.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The tidal atrium anchors all action and constrains choices through its tide-cycle logic: the librarian catalogs "what remains when days forget their names," and the tide "siphons syllables" and "forgets to shelve" words. The atrium's glass ribs, salt-flecked panes, foam-bright drawers, and metallurgy alcove provide the resources (bells, brine, spatial choreography) that enable the woman's resolution. The setting's final beat—"the atrium floor slickens, and the bells cool to a hush"—charges the closure image with physical consequence. Early signal, beat involvement across setup/middle/closure, causal pressure (tide and moon cycles force the identity problem), and irreplaceability are all strong.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After tomorrow disappears" opens the story and signals a liminal, post-linear timeframe. The phrase recurs obliquely at closure ("we are still after tomorrow disappears, in the hush where days become raw ore") and the librarian stamps "dates that have dissolved." However, the timeframe remains atmospheric rather than a live constraint: no on-page clock tightens decisions, and the woman's encounter unfolds without urgency tied to "after tomorrow." The concept shapes tone and setting logic but does not alter tactics or narrow options during the key beats. Closure linkage is moderate; causal pressure is low.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"To preserve wonder in routine" is stated explicitly ("My work is to preserve wonder in routine, to keep the ordinary gleaming as though rinsed in first light") and dramatized through the librarian's ritual cataloging, the creel-rinsing, and the answer to the woman's question ("remembering is just wonder doing chores"). The motivation drives the librarian's acceptance-of-contradictions method and shapes the closure (winding shoulder gears, listening for the bells' "keep, keep, keep"). However, the desire is more articulated than conflicted: no on-page friction between preservation and other competing wants, and no visible cost tied to maintaining wonder. Beat involvement and closure linkage are solid; causal pressure and cost connection are moderate.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Wintersun serenity" is signaled early ("Wintersun serenity pours through the salt-flecked panes, a pale warmth") and sustained through calm, patient diction and rhythm: "hinge-hearted and patient," "the hush where days become raw ore," "bells cool to a hush like frost taking breath." Tone modulates subtly with pressure—denser sensory layering during the card-taking and bell-ringing, expansive calm at closure—and charges the final image with ritual quiet rather than climactic release. Coherence across turns is strong; the serenity never breaks into urgency, which fits the accumulative lens. Specificity (wintersun as pale warmth, iron and sea moss) is high and irreplaceable.</comment>
