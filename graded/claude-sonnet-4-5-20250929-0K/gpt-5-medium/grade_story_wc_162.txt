<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is richly textured and consistently particular—"featherly determined" reads as lived rather than label-only, and the focus on pattern-reading through grain and codes reflects character logic. However, the protagonist remains largely observational; the climactic choice is to "keep the distance" rather than close it, which reads as renunciation but lacks embodied cost or visible foreclosure of an alternative path. Emotional states are poetic but occasionally abstract ("the ache," "articulate love") without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The father exists as backstory and symbol, never pressuring the narrator on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens early: density builds through wood grain, weather codes, and the terrace's prismatic quality, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the narrator chooses to preserve distance as sacred interval. Orientation anchors arrive within the opening lines (terrace, post-butterfly-effect floodplain, corn maze architect's child). The closure unit—"I kept the distance…the threshold become a companion rather than a wall"—reweights the dominant stake (understanding sacred thresholds) with conceptual cost (forgoing reunion to maintain the maze's necessary distance). One escalation beat (codes align with grain, seam opens to reveal the scarecrow-father below) deepens understanding and narrows options to descent or preservation. The cost is felt but oblique; the final image of the postponed welcome and the bench "keeping the pattern for whoever comes next" charges the ending without requiring a decisive physical act.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The drifting prism terrace functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: its facets translate sunlight into unstable color, the bench grain becomes a legible map, and the seam in the floor opens as threshold rather than door. The terrace's tilt and the way it "sighed downward" to reveal the orchard of shadows directly enable the narrator's climactic choice to remain rather than descend. Sensory detail is filtered through the narrator's surveyor-like attention—sap knots, cracks, sugar-glass wind—and the environment evolves causally (seam opens after codes align with grain). Spatial choreography is clear across the single continuous scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to discover why some thresholds feel sacred"—is signaled in the opening third and tightens once when the codes align with the bench grain, opening the seam and forcing a choice between descent (reunion) and preservation (sacred distance). The narrator's agency is renunciation with conceptual cost: keeping the distance makes "the love articulate" but postpones welcome and accepts permanent separation. Under the Accumulative lens, this single deepening suffices; the final image reweights prior material (mazes as intervals, father's belief in necessary distances) and forecloses the reunion path. Pressure coheres but escalation is muted—most beats are observational rather than forcing trade-offs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—sacred thresholds as necessary distances that prevent collapse—emerges organically from the pilot logbook codes, wood grain analysis, and the narrator's final renunciation. The concept integrates tightly: mazes teach the heart to change pace, the father's absence restores an interval, and love requires the fence to sing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing: the terrace sails on, the bench keeps the pattern, and the field postpones its welcome "until I deserved it." Recurrence (codes, distances, breath/pause) reweights meaning at closure rather than ornamenting. No thematic echo or label-speak flattens the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct and sustained: lyric compression, patterned syntax ("row by row," "sap knot to sap knot"), and a perceptual signature that reads weather, wood, and mazes as legible grammars. POV distance is stable first-person; no head-hopping. Purposeful elision (the father's exact vanishing, the butterfly effect's mechanics) is taught early and pays off at closure by keeping mystery alive. Under peak reflection the voice remains coherent—no register drift or filter-verb stacks. Diction occasionally elevates ("articulate," "insists we arrive slowly") but stays within a surveyor-poet's lexicon. No dialogue present to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift across declarative, participial, and prepositional anchors. Information density is high—most lines advance setting, interiority, or thematic layering. Minorループ: "necessary distances" recurs four times across paragraphs without added pressure in two instances (−0.2). Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "color that never settled," "shadows arranged themselves into fields," "compass made of breaths" feel voice-motivated. One strained metaphor: "benches waited like patient animals" then immediately pivots to "wooden, old, and worn by people who were not yet born when the sky cracked"—the temporal claim contradicts the established post-butterfly-effect present (−0.3). No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Propulsion slows in the middle third during extended grain-reading but recovers at the seam-opening turn.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of corn mazes, pilot weather codes, and wood-grain analysis as parallel grammars feels specific and non-obvious. The emotional turn—that love requires distance to remain articulate—transforms familiar reconciliation-quest material through the father's own logic (necessary distances). The terrace as drifting observation deck and the scarecrow-father as logbook pages are fresh images that arise from established pattern. Risk is moderate: lyric density and elliptical causality (the butterfly effect, the terrace's origin) remain legible without hand-holding. One trope strand—absent father, searching child—is archetypal but personalized through the maze architect occupation and the logbook-as-map conceit.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The "corn maze architect's lost child" frames the narrator's identity and rumor-walking status from the opening paragraph (setup). In the middle third, the narrator traces wood grain "the way a surveyor settles a map," applying inherited maze logic to the bench (development beat). At closure, the narrator makes the decisive choice to keep the distance rather than descend, directly enacting the maze architect's principle that "necessary distances" prevent collapse (payoff). The choice forecloses reunion and charges the final image. Causal pressure is moderate—most beats are interpretive rather than forcing immediate trade-offs—but the element is present across all three gates and the final act hinges on the narrator's maze-informed understanding. Early signal +0.5, two distinct beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +1.0, cost connection +0.4; late payoff clarity prevents higher reach.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The "pilot logbook weather code" is introduced early (first third) as the object the narrator carries and as the father's murmured practice while walking furrows (setup). In the middle third, the narrator opens the logbook and aligns each line with the bench grain—BKN matches a lightning scar, VRB matches seasonal lean, calm is distrusted—demonstrating beat involvement and causal use (development across two beats). At closure, the narrator folds the logbook "into my pocket like a compass made of breaths" and the final image references "the codes had tried to say," linking the object to the thematic resolution (payoff). The logbook enables the grain-reading method and charges the ending. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.5; swappability friction −0.5 (could be any symbolic code system with edits).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Necessary distances" is introduced early ("each pause and angle breathes only if space gathers around it") and explicitly named as the concept the father believed the world had lost (setup by end of first third). In the middle third, the narrator discovers that "quiet interval…insists we arrive slowly" and that mazes create that interval "with distance that teaches the heart to change pace" (development beat constraining interpretation). At closure, the narrator's decision to keep the distance rather than descend is the on-page enactment of necessary distances as sacred threshold, and the final line—"measuring my steps so that the world could arrive with me but not too quickly"—directly operationalizes the concept with visible cost (reunion postponed, father unreachable). The concept shapes stakes (why are thresholds sacred?), alters tactics (renunciation over descent), and charges the final image. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.6, cost connection +0.5, irreplaceability +0.7.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Featherly determined" appears twice: once mid-story ("I had been featherly determined since the night the rows closed behind me") as backstory anchor, and once near the end ("I rose, featherly determined again") marking the narrator's resolve to walk the terrace length after the renunciation choice (setup and payoff present, no middle development beat). The trait signals persistence and lightness but does not visibly constrain or enable a choice with cost—it describes the narrator's stance rather than forcing a trade-off. The reprise charges the ending slightly by echoing the opening determination. Early signal +0.4, closure reprise +0.6, cost connection +0.2; missing middle development −0.0 (allowed for lyric reprise), label-only use without visible tradeoff −0.6, swappability −0.4 (could be "quietly determined" or similar with minor edits).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Intuit" is named early as the method applied to wood grain direction ("in those breaths I could intuit direction") and governs the middle third's alignment of codes with grain, leading to the seam discovery (setup and development). The action recurs at closure: "I kept the distance, and in keeping it I felt the threshold become a companion" involves intuitive understanding rather than rational proof (payoff). The intuition drives the central turn—recognizing the seam as threshold and choosing preservation over descent—but the mechanics remain impressionistic (the narrator simply "could intuit") without visible cost or constraint on the intuiting process itself. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.9, closure linkage +1.0; swappability friction −0.6 (could be "sense," "read," "perceive" with minimal edits), no on-page cost tied to the act of intuiting −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Analyzing the grain in wooden furniture" is introduced at the bench in the middle third ("I sat at one bench and began analyzing the grain…tracing rivers and storms") and immediately becomes the method that enables code-alignment and seam discovery (setup and development in one sustained beat). The analysis is described with specificity: "Sap knot to sap knot, the memory of storms spoke in the same grammar as the logbook codes, gust to gust." The method shapes the central turn—aligning BKN with lightning scar, crack pointing to seam—and the seam's opening depends on this prior reading (causal pressure). At closure, the bench "kept the pattern for whoever comes next," referencing the grain-analysis as transferable knowledge (payoff). Early enough signal (by 40%) +0.4, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +0.9, specificity +0.6; no separate cost tied to the method itself −0.3, late first appearance (past first third) −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The "drifting prism terrace" is named in the opening line and anchors the entire scene spatially and tonally (setup). In the middle third, the terrace "accepted me with a tilt, its facets catching sun," and later "sighed downward" to reveal the orchard below—the terrace's physical properties (tilt, facets, seam in the floor) directly enable the code-grain alignment and the choice-forcing view of the scarecrow-father (development beats). At closure, "the terrace sailed on, and I walked its length," and the final image of measuring steps is conducted on the terrace, which has become the platform for sacred distance (payoff). The setting constrains choice (the elevated vantage allows preservation of distance) and charges the final image. Early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.4, irreplaceability +0.7; slight ornamental description ("color that never settled") −0.2, but overall the terrace functions as active setting.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the butterfly effect" appears in the opening paragraph as backstory framing ("when tiny choices elsewhere had grown into weather here and parted old roads") and establishes the fractured world-state (setup). The timeframe does not recur or tighten decisions in the middle third—no live clock or temporal pressure alters the narrator's grain-reading or seam-opening. At closure, the timeframe is absent; the ending does not reference or rely on post-butterfly conditions to charge the final image (missing payoff). The element sets atmospheric context but does not constrain tactics or escalate pressure. Early signal +0.4; missing development and payoff gates cap at 3.4; functional backstory role lifts to mid-4s; ornamental time-setting without pressure friction −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"To discover why some thresholds feel sacred" is stated explicitly in the first third ("To discover why some thresholds feel sacred, I climbed until the clouds turned into panels") and frames the dominant stake (setup). In the middle third, the narrator's grain-reading and code-alignment are goal-directed attempts to answer this question, and the realization "It is not doors that are holy but the measure that keeps them from collapsing" dramatizes the discovery in progress (development beat). At closure, the narrator's choice to keep the distance rather than descend directly enacts the answer: thresholds are sacred when they preserve necessary intervals, and "in keeping it I felt the threshold become a companion rather than a wall" (payoff with cost—reunion foregone). The motivation shapes stakes, drives investigation, and the final act fulfills it with visible renunciation. Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.5, cost connection +0.5; slight tell-heavy phrasing ("to discover why") rather than pure dramatization −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Fractured hush" is named early ("In that fractured hush, I came to find my father") and establishes the tone: quiet but broken, post-rupture stillness (setup). The tone is sustained through the middle third—"silent floodplain," "patient animals," "whisper that knew my name"—and modulates appropriately when the seam opens and the narrator sees the scarecrow-father ("I did not descend; I kept the distance") without melodrama (development coherence). At closure, the tone charges the final image: "the field postponed its welcome until I deserved it" and "measuring my steps so that the world could arrive with me but not too quickly" maintain the fractured hush as deliberate, sacred restraint (payoff). The tone is coherent across turns and integral to the Accumulative lens. Early signal +0.6, coherence across beats +1.0, closure charge +1.3, specificity +0.5; static mood in the middle third (little modulation during grain-reading) −0.5.</comment>
