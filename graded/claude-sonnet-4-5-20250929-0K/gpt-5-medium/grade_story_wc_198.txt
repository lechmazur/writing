<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist shows embodied commitment through repeated micro-choices (adjusting embouchure, feathering breath, sliding registers) that track the prophetic threat and constrain future options. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, anchored in sensory detail and the oath's pressure. Internal conflict registers in the tension between remembering the teacher and the instrument as "amulet against remembering," though the teacher's absence is felt more as texture than as a live contradiction forcing peak-beat choices. The final departure carries earned weight—options are foreclosed, the oath holds—but the cost remains more atmospheric than viscerally forfeited on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The lens reads accumulative/textural: each prophetic line forms, the protagonist intervenes with sound, the sentence stutters or fogs over, and pressure accretes through repetition with cadence shifts ("A second line descends, colder…"). Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration—Earned Stasis: the protagonist leaves with the oath still held and the absence made visible, a refusal that forecloses completion of the prophecy with felt cost (eerie nostalgia persists, memory smells of ash). The cost is legible in the final image of the withdrawn mist and the carried instrument, though the price is oblique rather than viscerally dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The prism atrium constrains every choice—letters pearl on cold panes, facets scatter dawn, and sound climbs glass—anchoring the task spatially and atmospherically. The fog and dewdrops function as micro-setting, enabling and limiting the protagonist's method (fog holds notes, condensation writes the code). The grotto and ridge listeners supply pressure. One recurring constraint charges the closure: the protagonist sees the teacher's reflection in a facet mid-action, and the final brightening grotto makes "the absence" visible. Sensory hierarchy is strong (cold, brightness, taste of iron), though spatial choreography could be sharper in the middle beats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—hush the prophecy before listeners outside read it—is signaled early and held coherently. Escalation under the accumulative lens proceeds through three iterations: first letters, second line, and the final figure, each demanding adjusted technique and deepening urgency. Agency is clear in repeated micro-adjustments (feathering, changing embouchure, sliding registers) that foreclose the prophecy's completion. The cost is legible in the final ring "held open and harmless" and the protagonist's departure carrying the oath. No major reversal occurs, but the textural tightening through repetition with variation is sufficient for this length and lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tension between secrecy/music, past/present, and the vested hush as both garment and oath—all grounded in concrete action (playing to blur code, seeing the teacher's reflection, letting meaning loosen like thread). The eerie nostalgia motif recurs purposefully, charging the opening and closing with the ache of memory held at distance. The final image—"the oath holds"—offers a resonant answer to the question of endurance without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence and gesture (the teacher's unreadable warning, the instrument as amulet). One phrase nears thematic echo: "vested hush because I have sworn it" explicates slightly more than needed, though it stops short of sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>First-person present tense sustains a distinct perceptual signature: "the past has been rinsed and hung up to dry in narrow, trembling ribbons" and "the echoes climb back into my throat tasting of iron and sea." POV distance is stable, and diction remains voice-motivated (elevated but consistent with a ritual specialist's idiom). Psychic distance modulates purposefully, compressing at peak pressure ("I answer by changing embouchure") and expanding for reflection without losing coherence. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy. The compression and lyric patterning are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information density is high; most sentences layer atmosphere, action, and thematic weight. Rhythm varies without mechanical patterning, and figurative language (tide-to-tide, salt in a rainstorm, loosens like thread) is coherent and voice-motivated. Two minor frictions: "the same ache that the rock carries from tide to tide" is a metaphor whose tenor is slightly unclear in context, and the phrase "the nerve of prophecy teased but never gratified" approaches overwriting without payoff. Sentence openings vary well, and the final image propels. No loops or scaffold, and syntactic control remains strong under pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of saxophonist-as-guardian, prophecy-in-condensation, and music-as-anti-speech is specific and non-obvious; removing the fog/dewdrop mechanism or the negative-space method would break the logic. The premise risks fantasy familiarity (secret guardian, mystical task), but the execution transforms it through grounded sensory detail (cold panes, iron taste, ash smell) and the oblique teacher subplot. The vested hush conceit is fresh in its blend of legal/textile/sonic registers. Bold structural risk (accumulative pressure without a reversal beat) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, earning a within-band lift of +0.3.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Present in setup (first paragraph), drives every middle beat (adjusting technique to counter each prophetic line), and shapes closure (leaves carrying the instrument, oath held). Choices narrow options repeatedly and the final departure is earned by the cumulative work. Causal pressure is strong and specificity high.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Introduced in paragraph five, the atrium frames every intervention beat (letters appear on panes, sound climbs facets, teacher's reflection in one facet) and charges the final image (brightening grotto reveals the absence). Used across three beats and essential to closure. High irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Defined early (paragraph four) as garment of stillness, it shapes stakes (preventing the prophecy's completion) and tactics (playing to blur, not silence). Present in mid-action ("the tones… widen into a hush you can wear") and closure logic (oath holds). Strong causal pressure, though slightly abstract as a concept.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Appears in paragraph six to describe the atrium light ("quietly vivid, as if the past has been rinsed"). Enriches atmosphere and supports tone, but does not constrain or enable a key action with cost. Lyric resonance present, beat involvement low.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>First action beat (paragraph seventeen: "I whisper into the bell"), returns in the final lullaby to gulls and trains. Drives the peak closure move that loosens meaning, and the method depends on whisper-level control. Causal role clear, specificity moderate.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Introduced early (paragraph eleven: teacher's instruction "you move through negative space… shape the gaps"), it informs every intervention (feathering breath, placing whispers, leaving gaps between notes). Shapes tactics across beats but remains somewhat abstract; the mechanics are gestured at rather than dramatized with visible constraint. Present in closure logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Established in opening line, the grotto supplies the prophetic threat ("the grotto listens"), atmospheric constraint (mist holds notes), and final image (brightening grotto reveals absence). Active in setup, middle, and closure. Strong spatial presence and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Signaled in paragraph three ("I came as dewdrops form"), tracks the prophetic cycle ("As the lines finish… minute by minute, as dewdrops form and fall and return"), and tightens at closure ("By then the grotto is bright enough… the mist withdraws"). Temporal pressure is legible and shapes the window of action.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stated in paragraph three and dramatized in every beat: each prophetic line triggers a tactical response, cost is clear ("If it slips, the listeners… will come smiling"), and closure hinges on completing the hush. Desire is conflicted (teacher's memory, eerie nostalgia) and friction between duty and loss is palpable. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Introduced in paragraph fourteen ("Eerie nostalgia is the music that rises"), sustained through the teacher's reflection and the instrument as amulet, and returns at closure ("eerie nostalgia" in the final line). Tone modulates with pressure (bright attention, cold naming, final calm) and charges the ending. Coherent and purposeful throughout.</comment>
