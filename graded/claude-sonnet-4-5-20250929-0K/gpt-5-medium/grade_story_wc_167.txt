<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The glazier protagonist has a distinct perceptual signature (seeing the ferry ramp in the architect's sketches, reading ripples as counsel) and embodied gestures (polishing windows, throwing stones). Internal texture shows contradiction between wanting to preserve and accepting change, visible in the decision to sand old ferry boards into benches. The boy's question "can a window hold a family" and the narrator's answer demonstrate micro-choices under pressure. However, the final stance—arguing for the atrium to "breathe like the bay"—feels more declared than dramatized with visible cost on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers pond-stone communion, bay gossip, noctilucent ledger imagery, and the atrium commission into a resonant reconfiguration at closure. Orientation anchors who (glazier), where (Pearl Bay), and when (dawn, before demolition) within the opening lines. The closure unit is Charged Poise: the narrator will "argue for voltage that hums like rain" and "railings polished by hands so no one feels uninvited," crystallizing the stance of rescuing ordinary luminosity within the new structure. Cost is conceptual—the glazier stakes professional credibility on a vision the architect and investor may reject—and the final image ("we were its light first") reweights the atrium as communal memory rather than spectacle. One meaningful deepening occurs when the boy's stone-throw yields the decision to incorporate old ferry boards, shifting tactics from resistance to transformation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Pearl Bay at dawn anchors with sensory specificity: salt, gull cries, tar-and-yeast boat shed, round pond behind the bait shack. The pond functions as micro-setting, constraining the method (stone-throw divination) and charging the closure image (the circles widening, the boy's grin). Spatial choreography is coherent across harbor windows, pond, and boat shed meeting. The noctilucent clouds and mist are filtered through the glazier's occupational lens (debts to wonder, breath becomes window), and the old ferry ramp is both memory and material that will reappear as benches. Environment subtly mirrors the theme: fog bent into colors, ordinary mornings already luminous.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: illuminate value in the mundane before "everything shifts" (cranes, deals, survey flags). The pond scene provides one meaningful tightening—the boy's question and the narrator's realization that the atrium must "rescue what we nearly lost"—which narrows options from abstract opposition to concrete incorporation (ferry boards as benches, tide-map etchings). The decision to argue for railings "polished by hands" at the noon meeting forecloses pure spectacle in favor of communal access. Cost is conceptual and relational: the glazier risks professional standing and must persuade architect and investor. Agency is stance crystallization under Accumulative pressure, consistent with the inferred lens. No antagonist appears, but the investor's lease demand and the mayor's ribbon deadline provide external pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—ordinary luminosity versus imposed spectacle, the cost of preserving communal memory within change—emerges from particulars: the chipped railing already containing the promised view, the boy's father welding, the ferry boards becoming benches. The pond-stone ritual and noctilucent reckonings function as recurring images that shift meaning: debts to wonder are not settled by closing time, and the atrium must hold working hymns learned with boots, not phones. The final line "we were its light first" offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in the boy's question ("can a window hold a family") and the narrator's answer ("a window can hold a day, and a day can hold a promise, if many hands remember"), which carries the piece's moral calculus without stating it. No thematic echo or label-speak intrudes at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: the glazier sees the ferry ramp in bone-and-arrow sketches, reads ripples as stanzas, hears "we will build if we also rescue." Diction is purposeful ("mist is not a nuisance but a choir," "voltage that hums like rain") and remains within the character's craft idiom. The boy's dialogue is natural and goal-driven ("can a window hold a family"), and the narrator's reply carries subtext. Register occasionally lifts ("noctilucent reckonings," "tributaries to the light") in a way that feels slightly elevated for the focalizer under stress, though it remains voice-motivated. Filter verbs ("I see," "I hear") cluster in the final third without obscuring immediacy. Psychic distance is consistent; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally with purposeful compression ("A winter of deals, a spring of survey flags") and lyric patterning (the pond-and-stone ritual, the noctilucent passage). Information density is high: most lines advance theme, character, or atmosphere. However, paraphrase loops appear: "I want to illuminate value in the mundane" is restated as "I want the day to hold, just long enough to show the town that their ordinary mornings were already luminous," and the final two paragraphs recycle the atrium-breathing metaphor without adding pressure. Template cadence in the "I see... I see... I want... I want... I say... He says..." runs across multiple paragraphs. Stock metaphors ("breath becomes window," "edges can speak calmly") appear in peak beats without fresh vehicles. These artifacts touch the closure third but do not obscure causality, so penalties route here. Applying patterned-artifact baseline: −0.8 for loops and template runs, plus −0.3 for stock metaphors = −1.1 total, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The reflective harbor glazier who communes with pond ripples offers a specific synthesis: blue-collar mysticism grounded in craft idiom and coastal particulars. The turn—from resisting demolition to incorporating ferry boards and tide maps—feels earned in hindsight, arising from the boy's question and the pond's counsel. The atrium-as-thinking-lantern and mist-as-choir are fresh inflections on renovation narratives. However, the core premise (artisan preserving communal memory against developer pressure) follows a familiar template, and the specificity of pond-stone divination, while vivid, does not fully transform the arc's predictability. Emotional truth is present (the boy's father will weld, the narrator pockets the missed stone), but the piece does not take bold structural or perspectival risks beyond its lyric voice.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The reflective harbor glazier is present throughout and makes two key choices: to commune with the pond (middle beat) and to argue for breath-like design at the noon meeting (closure beat). The character's perceptual filter (seeing the ferry ramp in sketches, reading ripples) shapes all observations. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. The role is specific (harbor glazier, not generic artisan), and the decisions—incorporate ferry boards, argue for accessible railings—alter tactics from resistance to transformation. Cost is conceptual (professional risk) and relational (must persuade architect and investor). The character's method (pond-stone divination) is unique and irreplaceable. However, the final choice is declared more than dramatized on the page, slightly reducing causal pressure. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.5, cost +0.4; declared stance −0.3; late-scene summary −0.4 = ~6.4.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The prism atrium in mist is introduced as the commission in the opening third and returns with reweighted meaning in the final third: it becomes a "lantern that thinks," a chamber where workers "recognize their own faces softened," and must "breathe like the bay." Setup and payoff gates are met; development is thin—the atrium does not constrain a middle choice but is held as the goal throughout. It appears in multiple beats (commission intro, vision of workers, noon meeting argument, final image) but is not handled or used; it remains an object of contemplation rather than action. The specificity (prism, mist-to-spectra, panes like fish scales) is vivid, and the closure image hinges on its transformation from spectacle to communal vessel. Early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.6, ornamental use −0.7, swappability (could be another public structure) −0.5, lyric-reprise allowance +0.3 = ~5.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Noctilucent reckonings appears once in the penultimate third ("Last night the sky hung thin blue veils of noctilucent reckonings, as if the upper air had kept a ledger"). It functions thematically—debts to wonder are not settled by closing time—but does not shape on-page stakes or tactics. The image is evocative and supports tone, yet removing it would not break the story's logic or alter the glazier's choices. Setup is late (~70% mark), no development beat, no closure participation. Ornamental use −0.8, late intro −0.7, label-only theme claim −0.3, lyric-resonance partial credit +0.5 (the ledger metaphor reweights the glazier's accounting of value) = ~3.2. Missing setup and development gates cap at 3.4; score lands within that neighborhood.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Reads between lines is signaled early ("People say I read between lines, and maybe that is why glass trusts me not to shatter its secrets") and enables the method: reading pond ripples as counsel, seeing the ferry ramp in the architect's sketches. The trait constrains the approach—divination rather than direct confrontation—and charges the ending argument for etched tide maps and polished railings. Setup, development (pond scene), and payoff (the glazier will argue for implicit memory) gates are met. However, the trait is stated more than dramatized in a visible tradeoff; the cost (professional risk) is tied to the overall stance rather than this attribute specifically. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.6, closure linkage +0.8, label-only mention −0.5, generic cost −0.3 = ~5.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Commune is the verb for the pond-stone ritual, which occupies the story's central beat and yields the key insight: "we will build if we also rescue what we nearly lost." The boy's participation ("He wants to throw a stone, so I nod") extends the action and generates the decision to incorporate ferry boards. The action is signaled early as the glazier's method ("Everyone laughs when I say I commune with work like this") and returns at closure ("This is how a reflective harbor glazier keeps faith with work"). Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. The action is specific (pond divination, not generic reflection) and drives the major turn from resistance to transformation. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.7, cost +0.5; summary-only in final third −0.4, swappability (meditation or prayer could substitute with edits) −0.6 = ~6.7. The action redefines options but is not fully indispensable; another contemplative method could produce the same insight with moderate edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The patterns in the rings of a pond after a stone is thrown structure the communion scene: "the first ring says keep your center, the second says regard the ripples that echo others." The method is signaled early ("I listen through the patterns in the rings"), enacted in the middle beat, and referenced at closure ("each ring a stanza, each pause the hinge to a door"). Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. The mechanics matter: the circles widen and cross, the narrator hears counsel, the boy's throw adds a question the pond "accepts without complaint." Specificity is high (concentric ripples as stanzas), and the method constrains approach (divination rather than direct negotiation). However, the method does not face resistance or impose a visible cost; it simply works. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.9, closure linkage +0.8, specificity +0.7, cost absent −0.5, no friction −0.2 = ~6.2.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Pearl Bay at dawn is anchored immediately and supplies the harbor windows, round pond, bait shack, and boat shed—all used in beats. The setting constrains the method (pond divination requires proximity) and pressures choices (cranes beyond the headland, the ferry stopping soon). The dawn light and mist feed the atrium concept (fog bent into colors, "morning keeps being made out of price and freshness"). Setup, development, and payoff gates are met; the bay is present in the closure argument ("our atrium must breathe like the bay"). The setting is not postcard description but a lived-in workspace (salt, gull cries, tar-and-yeast boat shed) that filters through the glazier's occupational lens. Early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.7, micro-setting (pond, body) +0.5, no direct constraint on final choice −0.5 = ~6.9.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Before everything shifts is signaled early ("It is before everything shifts, or so we keep telling one another, though cranes cough beyond the headland") and creates urgency: a winter of deals, a spring of survey flags, the mayor's equinox ribbon deadline, the ferry stopping soon. The timeframe tightens decisions—the glazier must act now to preserve value before demolition—and appears at closure ("When the building opens"). Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. However, the clock is invoked rather than dramatically tracked; no specific countdown alters tactics on the page, and the noon meeting is mentioned but not shown. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.7, closure linkage +0.5, vague tracking −0.5, summary-only −0.3, conceptual urgency rather than live deadline −0.5 = ~5.4.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>To illuminate value in the mundane is stated explicitly ("I want to illuminate value in the mundane, to prove that the chipped railing already contains the promised view") and dramatized through the pond scene (showing the town their ordinary mornings were already luminous), the decision to incorporate ferry boards, and the closure argument for etchings and polished railings. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. The desire conflicts with the architect's spectacle and the investor's leases, creating friction. The cost is professional risk and the need to persuade. However, the motivation is told more than embodied in contradictory impulses; the glazier's want does not fight a competing fear or need on the page. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +0.9, closure linkage +1.1, cost +0.5, told-only declaration −0.6, paraphrase loop (restated across paragraphs) −0.3, friction present but not dramatized as internal conflict −0.4 = ~6.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Clear complexity is coherent throughout: the prose balances lyric compression ("thin blue veils of noctilucent reckonings") with plain craft idiom ("I polish the harbor windows"), embraces ambiguity (the pond's counsel is oblique, the atrium's success uncertain) without confusion, and modulates with pressure (the boy's scene is quieter, the final argument more urgent). The tone charges the final image: "we were its light first" crystallizes the theme without moralizing. Setup is immediate (the opening line's reflective task), development sustains the contemplative-yet-concrete register, and payoff lands cleanly. The tone is not a single static mood but shifts from solitary communion to shared insight to collective stance. Early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.5, modulation under pressure +0.8, coherence +0.7, specificity +0.6, lyric mode without obscurity +0.5 = ~7.3.</comment>
