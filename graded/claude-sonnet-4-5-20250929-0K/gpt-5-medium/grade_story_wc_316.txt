<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to "defeat emotional numbness" is told rather than embodied in contradictory impulses under pressure. Neri and Rae receive vivid sensory tags ("never met a mirror she could not forgive," "laugh had once broken a tyrant") but their choices in the sparring test feel choreographed to demonstrate complementary opposites rather than arising from distinct internal conflicts. The final joint-custody decision registers as thematic assertion—"choosing them together finally gave me a way to defeat emotional numbness"—rather than a choice earned by the narrator wrestling with competing values on the page. Interiority leans toward abstract meditation ("the blade of attention slices through pretense") without micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of wants in friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers images (floating dojo, clouds, bells, the humming jar) and uses recurring phrases ("while history rewrites itself," "slices through pretense") to build toward a final Resonant Reconfiguration when the narrator announces joint custody and feels "the frost inside me drain." Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph without penalty. The closure moment—joint custody as the answer to complementary opposites—carries conceptual cost (neither claimant wins alone, the pattern requires both) but the felt price remains abstract; the narrator's internal shift is declared ("gave me a way to defeat emotional numbness") rather than shown through a forfeited option or visible trade-off on the page, limiting the weight of the RR.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The floating rock dojo, clouds passing beneath, and umber tiles supply vivid spatial anchors and charge the final image when "the dojo drifted on, the clouds paused." The brain-in-jar altar and the sparring floor constrain the custody test choreography, meeting the Q3 9+ gate. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—"little gusts of static to our teeth," "taste of river stones"—and filtered through the narrator's meditative stance. Minor gap: the petitioners' physical movements during the fire/water trade are described but spatial positions and distances remain slightly vague, preventing full choreographic clarity in the climactic beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—who will receive custody and vivify the brain—is signaled early and sustained. The sparring test constitutes one meaningful escalation: Neri and Rae trade elemental roles at the narrator's shout, the jar vibrates consent, and the narrator chooses joint custody. Agency lies with the narrator's final call, which forecloses individual custody and reweights the terms. The escalation reads under the Accumulative lens as a cadence shift and pattern crystallization rather than a causal reversal. Cost is implied (neither claimant wins alone, cooperation is mandatory) but remains conceptual; no on-page forfeiture of a live tactical option or visible sacrifice anchors the price, leaving the tightening legible but not viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—healing through integration of opposites—emerges from the sparring structure, the jar's hum of consent, and the narrator's internal thaw without overt thesis statement. The final image ("the brain in the jar breathed its answer through our teeth, and for a quiet minute the future felt vivified, real, and ours") offers a non-literal answer that reweights complementary opposites as necessary circuit rather than competition. Recurring phrases ("slices through pretense," "while history rewrites itself") accumulate pressure and shift meaning at closure. Minor slip: the narrator's epiphany—"choosing them together finally gave me a way to defeat emotional numbness"—edges toward meta-commentary, slightly diluting the resonance earned by the image work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>First-person POV remains stable with a meditative, lyric register that feels voice-consistent ("the blade of attention slices through pretense," "sick morning scars"). Perceptual signature is selective and biased toward abstract metaphor and sensory synesthesia ("taste and scent and the ache of distant songs"). Psychic distance modulates appropriately—closer during the narrator's night conversation with the jar, wider during the sparring choreography. Register occasionally drifts into elevated diction ("vivify," "complementary opposites," "indivisible") that reads slightly instructional rather than fully embodied in the narrator's crisis state, and recurring syntactic patterns ("who had never met…who spoke," "who laugh had once…whose eyes wove") create mild template cadence in the character introductions.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative density is high ("clouds passed under the sparring floor like slow rivers of breath," "names loosened like threads in seawater"), but several phrases loop or restate without added pressure: "slices through pretense and the mind stops lying to itself" closely paraphrases the earlier "blade of attention slices through pretense," and "while history rewrites itself" recurs four times as atmospheric tag rather than causal driver. Template cadence appears in the Neri/Rae introductions ("First was Neri, who had never…Second was Rae, whose laugh…") and in parallel "both wore…both carried" constructions. Pivotal beats—the jar's vibration, the joint-custody announcement—remain clear, preventing deeper penalties, but the accumulation of figurative restatement and scaffold phrasing flattens momentum in the middle third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The premise—clone custody resolved through martial-arts demonstration of complementary opposites in a reality-bending dojo—offers a fresh synthesis of speculative custody law, embodied philosophy, and ego-death recovery. The joint-custody resolution avoids the binary winner/loser trope and instead commits to interdependence as answer. Execution relies on abstract metaphor and recurring motifs rather than grounded micro-choices, and the "complementary opposites" framework feels slightly didactic, as though illustrating a prompt rather than discovering the pattern through character friction. The piece takes structural risk (lyric accumulation, synesthetic imagery) that heightens tone without obscuring closure, earning modest credit within the band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The ego-death-survivor narrator is present throughout, frames the custody test, and makes the final joint-custody decision that forecloses individual claims. Setup is immediate, middle involvement includes the night conversation with the jar and witnessing the sparring, and the ending choice is the narrator's. The decision alters the outcome but feels more like an interpretive pronouncement ("only together could they keep the mind awake") than a choice with visible personal cost or tactical friction; the narrator's role is primarily observational witness rather than agent under pressure, limiting causal depth.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The brain-in-jar is signaled in paragraph five, sits on the altar during sparring, hums and sends "gusts of static to our teeth," and vibrates consent when Neri and Rae trade roles—appearing in at least four beats. The narrator's night conversation dramatizes its agency through taste/scent/memory, and its final "breath" through the cast's teeth charges the closure image. The jar drives the custody conflict and participates causally in the resolution (its vibration signals the correct pairing). Slight swappability: a different relic or suspended consciousness could fulfill a similar structural role with edits, preventing full indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Clone custody battle is introduced in paragraph five, frames the entire middle action (two petitioners arguing and sparring for guardianship rights), and the joint-custody ruling resolves it at closure. The concept shapes the dominant stake and tactics (sparring to mirror the old mind's patterns) on the page. The custody framing is essential to the plot and drives Neri and Rae's presence, but the "clone" specificity remains backdrop—genealogical connection ("genotype that fit the jar like a key fits a wound") is mentioned but does not constrain choices differently than any inheritance dispute would. The battle itself is indispensable; the clone element is functional but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Slices through pretense" appears three times as Master Lin's teaching and as metaphor for attention's effect, but it does not constrain an on-page tactical choice with cost. The phrase is invoked to describe the training philosophy and the narrator's observation of Neri and Rae's practice ("their practice slices through pretense better than sermons"), yet no character foregoes an easier path or pays a visible price because this trait is active. It functions as thematic label and atmosphere rather than a decision-shaping attribute, remaining ornamental at the causal level.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Vivify" is seeded early (paragraph six: "who would vivify the mind within that glass"), recurs as goal ("to vivify the dormant patterns through complementary opposites"), and the final image declares "the future felt vivified, real, and ours." The action names the victory condition and ties directly to the custody resolution. Middle development shows the narrator understanding the test requires vivification through circuit rather than solo guardianship. The term shapes the conceptual stakes and charges the ending, but on-page dramatization of vivification itself (sensory proof the brain awakens) is limited to the jar's hum and vibration; a more embodied enactment would lift the score higher.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Complementary opposites are introduced in paragraph three (Master Lin's teaching: "soft breath with hard steps, kindness with demand"), demonstrated by Neri and Rae's contrasting styles across multiple beats ("Neri soft where Rae was sharp, Rae swift where Neri endured"), tested when they trade fire/water roles at the narrator's shout, and named as the solution in the custody ruling ("only together could they keep the mind awake, because the pattern required the alternating current of their opposites"). The method is taught, practiced, and validated at closure. Mechanics matter: the role-trade triggers the jar's consent. The method is nearly indispensable, though the piece occasionally tells its importance rather than letting friction emerge from failed attempts before success.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The floating rock dojo is anchored in the opening line, provides the sparring floor with clouds beneath for spatial signature, and recurs at closure ("The dojo drifted on, the clouds paused"). The setting's fantastical physics (floating, bells from the sky, statues rearranging) charge atmosphere and signal the reality-bending context. The umber tiles and altar position the jar during the test. The dojo constrains the custody resolution to performance-based judgment rather than legal argument and supplies the "windroom" frame Master Lin uses. Micro-setting (altar, tiles, sparring floor) shapes choreography, but the floating/rewriting-history aspects remain atmospheric rather than tactically decisive; removing "floating" would not break the plot, lowering irreplaceability slightly.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"While history rewrites itself" recurs as a tag phrase in four paragraphs, signaling temporal instability and tying the dojo's decisions to larger consequence ("every strike we practiced seemed to echo into edits no historian had approved," "statues…rearranged themselves into our future, and the years below braided new dates"). The timeframe is atmospheric and conceptual rather than a live ticking clock. No beat shows a character racing against rewriting history or adapting tactics because time is running out; the phrase decorates rather than pressures. Present as motif, absent as constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to "defeat emotional numbness" is stated in paragraph four ("I trained to defeat emotional numbness, that frost after the void"), recurs when the narrator feels "the old ice crack" watching Neri and Rae practice, and culminates when the joint-custody choice "finally gave me a way to defeat emotional numbness" and "the frost inside me drain[ed]." The motivation frames the narrator's arc and connects to the closure. Friction is limited: the text tells the desire and its satisfaction without dramatizing competing wants or showing the narrator choosing a harder path because this need outweighs another. The motivation is present across beats and tied to ending, but not tested by on-page trade-offs.</comment>
