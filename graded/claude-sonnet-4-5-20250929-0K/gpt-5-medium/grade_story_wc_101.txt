<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara is consistent and her "gently persistent" trait shapes multiple choices (pairing teens with elders, refusing to name donors). Interior access is sparse but the communal "we" POV limits deep contradiction. The teens' arc from "wired on fear and pride" to placing "hunger in the middle and ego at the fringe" offers meaningful change, though it is told more than dramatized. Embodied emotion appears occasionally ("chin high, silence ringing harder than any alarm"), but much interiority remains abstract or summary.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accretes pressure through repeated food runs, patrol encounters, and the bell's evolving meaning, culminating in spring's arrival when "there were fewer lists, fewer boots." Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—the community endures and the bell is polished "until our faces wobbled there," reweighting the opening image with felt cost. The "constellations" framing and midnight-run mechanics provide legible escalation. One orientation issue: the narrator's identity and the exact geography of "hill village" and "ridge" remain vague through the first third, but the communal lens mitigates confusion.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The terra-cotta arbor anchors nearly every key beat (night book, bell hanging, patrol confrontation, final polishing) and its ridge position matters tactically ("tracks dissolved"). Sensory detail is selective: "frost prints," "pad-soft steps," "breath-white arbor" filter through collective attention. The bell as micro-object constrains choice (Mara holds it without ringing after the patrol) and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clear enough, though the larger village layout remains abstract.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: sustaining the community through sanctions without exposing donors. Pressure tightens when the patrol stops "right under the arbor" and Mara declares "They do not exist as persons," forcing visible risk. The teens learning to "place hunger in the middle and ego at the fringe" offers a deepening that narrows their options (no more reckless pride). Spring's arrival with "fewer lists" registers cost and change, though the resolution leans summary. Agency is present in Mara's refusals and the community's coordinated timing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—dignity, anonymity, and care under scarcity—emerges through the bell's function and the constellation naming system rather than statement. The line "scarcity, when braided with care, could become a braid strong enough to lift a season" balances on the edge of platitude but is redeemed by the prior particulars (goats, kerosene jars, grandmother/rapper exchange). The final image of polished faces in the bell offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of collective survival. No overt moralizing in the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>First-person plural ("we") maintains stable collective stance without head-hopping into individuated interiorities. Perceptual signature is consistent: communal attention to "pad-soft steps," "silver glint," "bruised clocks of infants and elders." Diction occasionally elevates beyond communal register ("amplified quiet," "stitched us together without binding our names"), creating mild register drift, but the voice remains coherent. Dialogue is minimal and functional ("They do not exist as persons"). Compression and lyric phrasing are purposeful and legible throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high and occasionally muddy: "rust-red rib cage," "winter lung," "a line drawn through our fear in thin shining metal" cluster without clear causal linkage. Some paraphrase loops appear ("We knew why the secrecy mattered; there were lists somewhere" / "our elders feared raids, our youths feared irrelevance"). Template cadence is mild but present in several "and" chains. Information density is strong in the middle third (food runs, constellation naming), and the final image lands cleanly. No major loops in peak beats, but the opening paragraph's metaphor stack ("brittle with frost and held breath," "rust-red rib cage") slightly obscures spatial grounding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The bell as both signal and bridge, the constellation naming system, and the pairing of teens with elders offer fresh inflections on mutual-aid narratives. The communal "we" POV and accumulative structure feel purposeful rather than default. Emotional specificity (the rapper learning to knit, the widow as Polaris) avoids generic templates. The premise—anonymous donations during sanctions—is familiar but the execution through lyric compression and the bell's evolving charge transforms it. Risk-taking in the dense, metaphor-laden opening and the choice to withhold individual names throughout heighten stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara is present in setup (keeps the night book, hangs the bell), middle (pairs teens with elders, refuses to name donors to the sergeant), and closure (polishes the bell). Her "gently persistent" trait drives the pairing system and her refusal under interrogation. Removing her would collapse the community's organizing logic and the bell's symbolic charge.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The bell appears in setup (hung from the arbor beam), middle (rung once for each donation, held without ringing after the patrol), and closure (taken down, polished, rehung). It constrains Mara's choice (not ringing becomes an act of comfort) and charges the final image ("our faces wobbled there"). Its dented but true voice and evolving use across three distinct beats make it nearly indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Anonymous donations shape the dominant stake from the opening ("gifts arrived unseen") through the patrol confrontation ("asked for the donors") to the ending ("more names without fear attached"). The concept drives the secrecy tactics, the bell's function, and Mara's refusal. It is more than thematic echo; it narrows options and alters the community's methods throughout.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Gently persistent" is signaled in the opening simile ("a tide that returned") and enacted when Mara pairs walkers, holds the bell without ringing, and stands with "chin high" before the patrol. The trait enables her leadership without force but is more demonstrated than tested with visible cost. One additional beat showing the trait's friction or tradeoff would lift this higher.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Declare" appears twice: Mara declares "We will keep their dignity warm" in the first third, and later "Mara said, They do not exist as persons" to the sergeant. The first sets the community's stance; the second crystallizes her refusal under interrogation. Both are pivotal, though the second carries more immediate risk. The action shapes the middle turn but is not the sole driver of closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Midnight food runs" are signaled early ("each night, the arbor filled") and mechanics matter: "alternating routes between cellar doors and prayer halls, timing footsteps with the patrol drum," later "weaving the runs between sleep cycles, by the bruised clocks of infants and elders." The method constrains tactics (checkpoint evasion, pairing strategy) and is present through the ending's shift to "fewer boots." Removing it would collapse the causal chain.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The arbor is present in setup ("terra-cotta arbor on the ridge"), middle (patrol stops "right under the arbor," tracks dissolve on the slope), and closure (bell rehung "where the wind could ring thanks"). Its ridge position enables surveillance evasion and its emptiness "but for frost prints" signals successful secrecy. It pressures choices and supplies tactical advantage across all three beats.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Sanctions period" is named in the opening ("sanctions period that blistered everything") and its effects—rationed gas, brittle borders, fear of lists and raids—shape every tactic. The constraint is felt throughout but not dramatized as a live clock that visibly alters a single decision. The ending's "fewer lists, fewer boots" implies the sanctions easing, though the mechanism is summary rather than scene.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Intergenerational support" is declared ("a promise to build intergenerational support without making speeches") and dramatized through the pairing system: "Mara paired teens with grandparents," teens learn from elders, "a grandmother had told a rapper how to knit, and he had told her how to rhyme." The motivation drives the middle structure and is visible in choices, though internal friction (cost of the pairings, resistance) is light.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Amplified quiet" is signaled in the opening line and sustained through "pad-soft steps," "silence ringing harder than any alarm," "waiting becomes a way of holding." Tone modulates under pressure (the patrol scene tightens to "boots creaking, eyes scanning") and charges the final image ("wind could ring thanks"). The tone is coherent across turns and integral to the piece's lyric method.</comment>
