<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is specific and embodied ("knees knew the room and stayed"), and the motivation to learn from shame is concrete. The reunion with the man whose marriage cracked generates genuine internal conflict, though the decision to stay and listen could have been dramatized with more competing impulses acting simultaneously. The protagonist's transformation from hiding to engaging is earned through the library's structure and the paired reading exercise. Minor: some introspection edges toward label-speak ("enlarged tranquility" recurs as a phrase rather than felt state).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis meets Charged Poise): the protagonist and the man do not reconcile into old shapes but acknowledge the cracked spine of their relationship with visible cost ("that refusal felt like the gentlest truth available"). Orientation anchors cleanly by the stationery shop beat. The meaningful deepening occurs when both stack motives on the table and read Mistake/Wisdom aloud, which reweights the dominant stake. Cost is legible: proximity as medicine is renounced, and both walk away altered but not repaired.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The secret library's spatial choreography (toppled shelf, corridor, paired books) is clear and purposeful. The stationery shop anchor (unsent letters sold) charges the protagonist's arrival and primes the ending by linking past shame to present action. The tea, slate, and paired volumes function as micro-setting tools that constrain the conversation's tone and pace. The fluorescent-to-warm lamp transition reflects the protagonist's shift in perception and supports the "enlarged tranquility" motif, though the effect remains more atmospheric than choice-shaping.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake: unearthing wisdom in the mistake of staying while leaving. The pressure coheres when the man whose marriage cracked appears, forcing a crystallization of stance. The paired reading of Mistake/Wisdom is the key tightening that narrows options: both must choose whether to perform blame or to "stack motives." The protagonist's decision to stay at the table ("my knees knew the room") forecloses flight with felt cost. The ending's refusal to reconcile into old shapes is an earned choice with visible consequence: no repair, but no ongoing rupture.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the library's structure (opposites shelving each other) and the paired reading, not through assertion. The final image—walking home "within arm's reach of midnight" and feeling the city hold without knowing—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of proximity as medicine. The concept of nestled paradoxes drives the thematic payoff: staying/leaving, presence/departure coexist without resolution. Minor: "enlarged tranquility" functions more as tonal label than earned insight; the line "how books rarely return to uncreased spines" slightly tips toward overt moralizing but recovers by framing it as refusal rather than verdict.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and lyric: "absence is my coat and attention my lantern," "syllables were birds that might bruise." Psychic distance is controlled; the protagonist's perceptual signature (framing events through book metaphors, attention to margins and spines) remains consistent. Dialogue is minimal but purposeful: the man's "his voice did not accuse, only arranged the words like chairs in a circle" integrates subtext and action. The register holds steady under pressure, though the phrase "enlarged tranquility" repeats without rhythmic variation. No head-hopping; the single POV is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and propulsion is strong through the library sequence. High information density in beats like "We did not apologize first, which is to say we stacked our motives on the table until their weights explained the slope of our choices." Minor scaffold: the phrase "enlarged tranquility" recurs three times without evolving meaning, and "within arm's reach of midnight" appears twice (invitation, ending) as a frame but not a charged reprise. The line "soothing looked like taking sides" is economical; "his eyes reflected the lamps as if translating light back into flame" is vivid but slightly ornamental. No loops or template cadence in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The library that shelves things in opposites is a fresh organizing principle, and the invitation's promise ("unearth wisdom in a mistake") avoids generic redemption arcs. The dual-protagonist structure (both invited by different edges of the same mistake) synthesizes confession and encounter in a non-obvious way. The paired reading of Mistake/Wisdom as a literal act rather than metaphor is a specific choice. Minor: the secret-library-behind-a-shop premise is familiar; transformation comes through the paired-opposites cataloging system and the refusal to reconcile, which feel earned rather than convenience.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The compassionate recluse trait shapes the protagonist's opening stance (hiding behind books, avoiding doorways) and the decision to accept the invitation. The choice to stay at the table when the man appears is a key turn driven by this character attribute. The ending—walking home feeling the city hold without knowing—reflects the recluse's acceptance of anonymous mercy. Present in setup, middle choice (staying), and closure image.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The crumpled invitation appears in the opening, functions as a passport through the corridor, and frames the timeframe ("within arm's reach of midnight"). It does not return with reweighted meaning at closure; the protagonist does not handle or reference it after entering the library. Two beats (arrival, corridor passage) but no closure participation or charged reprise.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Nestled paradoxes is the library's organizing principle: "We shelve things in their opposites, so they can learn each other." This concept drives the paired reading of Mistake/Wisdom and the ending's refusal to reconcile ("staying while leaving, present but already departed"). The stakes and tactics depend on this structure: both protagonists must hold contradictions without collapse. Present in setup (slate, paired books), middle (reading exercise), and closure (refusing uncreased spines).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Keenly empathetic trait is established ("my keenly empathetic listening became proof of betrayal") and constrains the protagonist's past mistake. It enables the decision to stay at the table and listen to the man's account. The cost is visible: empathy led to the marriage crack. However, the trait is more narrated than dramatized in action; the protagonist listens but the empathy itself is labeled rather than shown through micro-choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Hiding shapes the protagonist's opening stance (behind books, avoiding doorways where voices swell) and is renounced when the protagonist stays at the library table instead of fleeing. The action is signaled early and its reversal (choosing not to hide) is the key turn. Present in setup, tested in the middle (nearly stood to flee), and resolved at closure (walking home without hiding, feeling the city's mercy).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Staying while leaving is the method that caused the original mistake and is the paradox both protagonists must unpack. The man describes it: "like I was staying while leaving, present but already departed, stitching and unstitching trust." The paired reading and final refusal to reconcile into old shapes are tactics that acknowledge this method's cost. Present in backstory setup, dramatized in the middle exchange, and echoed in the closure image (walking home, held without being known).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The secret society library hidden in plain sight (behind a toppled shelf in a stationery shop) is the spatial crucible for the encounter. The library's structure (paired books, opposites shelving each other, Order of Nestled Paradoxes slate) directly shapes the conversation's method and outcome. The setting supplies the tea, the table, and the two volumes that become the resolution tactic. Present throughout; the setting is indispensable to the closure's mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Within arm's reach of midnight appears twice: in the invitation and in the ending line. Time does not tighten decisions or create a live clock that alters tactics; the library encounter unfolds without temporal pressure. The timeframe functions as a lyric frame (early seed, final reprise) but does not constrain choices or escalate stakes in the middle beats.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>To unearth wisdom in a mistake is the protagonist's stated motivation and drives the acceptance of the invitation. The desire is tested when the man appears, and the protagonist must choose between flight and engagement. The paired reading of Mistake/Wisdom dramatizes the motivation's friction: proximity vs. medicine, staying vs. leaving. The ending—"a mistake can be a place, not a verdict"—pays off the motivation with visible cost (no reconciliation, only understanding). Present in setup, pressured in middle, resolved at closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Enlarged tranquility is introduced early ("I read it with enlarged tranquility") and recurs when the paired reading "soothed the room into enlarged tranquility." The tone is coherent through the protagonist's calm interiority and the library's warm lamps. However, the tone does not modulate sharply with pressure; even the moment of potential flight maintains a lyric register. The phrase is more label than felt cadence shift, and the final image (the city's mercy) extends the tone rather than charging it with new pressure.</comment>
