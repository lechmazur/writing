<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The tidal-pool chronicler's interiority is concrete and voice-particular ("I listen the way I catalog reefs, warmly observant"), with embodied hesitation (tilting the jade cicada, holding breath). Internal conflict between staying and going is dramatized through sidelong seeing of multiple futures, each with texture. The final choice ("Yes, I will go inland") feels earned by the weight of prior reflection, though the POV remains slightly passive—decision arrives more from prolonged contemplation than from a moment that forces contradiction to act in scene. Micro-choices (studying barnacles, tilting the cicada) reveal hierarchy but the peak turn could apply more visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who (tidal-pool chronicler), where (ancient grotto), and the relationship stakes early. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through layered reflection, future visions, and the pause itself, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). The narrator's "Yes" at closure reweights the pause from hesitation to hinge, and the final image ("arch had formed, patient, exact, and finally passable") crystallizes the transformation with felt cost (leaving the coast, redefining identity). Cost is legible in "to extend it" and "learning new littorals"—renunciation of the familiar shoreline is clear. One meaningful deepening (the cicada's metaphor applied to the relationship choice) suffices at this length, and the lens holds without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The grotto is vividly anchored (barnacles, slick stone, sea glass light, dripping metronome) and charges the final image ("grotto kept our resolution"). Sensory detail is filtered through the chronicler's observational bias (reefs, tide schedules, foam textures). The jade cicada functions as micro-setting, constraining the choice by embodying transition metaphor. Body and attention (holding breath, tilting the cicada) ground reflection without catalog drift. Spatial choreography is coherent (lantern, palm, ankles touched by ripple). The grotto approves "with a soft breath"—a touch of pathetic fallacy that anthropomorphizes setting but remains voice-consistent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (whether to go inland) is signaled early and sustained. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens through the pause itself, which functions as a container for competing future visions. The narrator's sidelong seeing of three futures (arguments compacted, grotto silting, comfort mistaken for completion) narrows options by making consequences tangible. One meaningful deepening occurs when the narrator recognizes "we needed was naming passage" rather than outcomes, shifting tactics toward shared migration. Cost is legible: leaving the coast, carrying tidepool methods into alien terrain. Agency is renunciation of staying and affirmation of change, forecloses the path of comfort, and the cicada's split-metaphor enables the choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme (transition as molting, threshold as passage) emerges through the jade cicada's larval/split metaphor, the pause as tidepool, and the grotto as hinge. The final image ("arch had formed, patient, exact, and finally passable") answers the central question—how to honor change—without stating a moral. The narrator's insight ("To discover the texture of time, we must touch it while we change") is earned by on-page attention to time's qualities (foam/lace, metronome drips) rather than asserted. Subtext operates in silence, gesture (tilting the cicada), and the partner's smile ("not victory, not surrender, more like a shoreline adjusting"). No thematic echo or sermonic ending; resonance is built from tidal/molting particulars that recur with reweighted meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single-POV first-person with stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature: the chronicler notices via reef-cataloging metaphors ("collecting fringe details that nobody prizes," "sidelong seeing"). Diction is controlled and voice-motivated ("tangential approach, circling truth until it offers passage"). Psychic distance modulates intentionally (close interiority in the pause, slight zoom-out for future visions). Reflection is anchored to present stimuli (the cicada, the dripping grotto) and tilts present stance via micro-choices. The partner's dialogue is absent; their presence is felt through implied question and the narrator's response. Filter verbs ("I thought of my mentor") are voice-consistent and do not dull immediacy. Rhythm varies (short declaratives, longer reflective spirals) without template cadence. Brief lexical elevation ("littorals," "star fed hinges") fits the chronicler's idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence openings vary; rhythm modulates with reflection without sluggishness. Information density is high (most lines advance character stance or charge metaphor). Minor scaffold appears: "You were asking whether I would go inland" summarizes rather than dramatizing the question, and "I wanted you to know I was not delaying, I was listening to time" explains instead of showing. Paraphrase loop in "Tide ebbing, tide turning, you and I poised on the ledge between versions" / "transition periods, the moments when identities trade languages"—the same idea restated. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; one mixed metaphor: "laugh fester" (laughter typically doesn't fester, resentment does). No template cadence or filter-verb stacks. Final line propels without overwriting. Apply −0.6 for scaffold and loop presence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The tidal-pool chronicler's occupational lens (reefs, littorals, transition periods as specimens) freshens the familiar "should we stay or go" premise by making observation method the agent of change. The jade cicada as inherited metaphor and the grotto as both setting and witness offer specific, non-obvious synthesis. The sidelong-seeing method (futures arriving "gull feather soft") is voice-particular. Risk-taking in extended reflection mode (~40% of text) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; the pause itself becomes the narrative container. Transformation test: swapping tidal chronicler for another profession would require rebuilding metaphor and method. One friction: the premise (partner asks, narrator reflects, narrator answers) follows a familiar deliberation arc; the execution personalizes it but does not radically subvert structure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Tidal-pool chronicler present from opening, frames observation method early, and drives the final choice ("Yes, I will go inland" explicitly traces to chronicling identity). The trait constrains tactics (sidelong approach, circling rather than direct answer) and enables the insight that names passage rather than outcomes. Causal: the chronicler's method is why the pause holds meaning and why the partner trusts the hush. Closure: the identity ("I will carry the grotto in my pockets and read puddles in city drains") reweights the profession as portable rather than place-bound. Cost: extending the coast risks losing tidal anchors. Three beats (opening self-identification, middle reflection on method, ending choice) with causal pressure and closure linkage. No ornamental use; decisions alter tactics.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Jade cicada introduced early ("Between us, on my palm, sat the jade cicada"), handled in at least three beats (initial hold, tilting to catch starlight, final kiss for luck), and its metaphor (larval stillness, split, transition seams) directly enables the narrator's choice to "press ourselves gently" through change. The object's meaning deepens: first a memento, then a guide to molting, finally a token of trust ("Your eyes found the cicada, and I felt them trust its stubborn glint"). Closure linkage strong: the narrator tucks it "between notebook and heart" and the partner's gaze charges it. Causal pressure: without the cicada's split metaphor, the narrator's framing of passage vs. outcome would lack concrete anchor. Cost: the cicada's history (mentor's years of molting) primes the stakes. Specificity high (cool, heavy, carved like coastline topography).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Transition periods named explicitly and operationalized throughout: the pause itself is the transition, the cicada models it, the narrator calls such crossings "my specimens," and the resolution commits to "naming passage" rather than outcomes. The concept shapes stakes (whether to honor change or avoid it) and tactics (the narrator's sidelong method of seeing futures). Closure: "we both dared to press" the seam, and the arch forms "finally passable." Cost: transition requires leaving familiar coast and risking identity ("extend it" vs. abandon it). Three beats with causal work: setup (cicada as transition icon), middle (narrator's journals document crossings), ending (the couple chooses the seam). Not merely thematic; the concept changes options by reframing the question from stay/go to how-to-pass.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Warmly observant present as self-descriptor ("I listen the way I catalog reefs, warmly observant") and demonstrated in action (studying barnacles, collecting fringe details, noticing partner's silence). The trait enables the sidelong approach and constrains direct answer (observation rather than immediate declaration). Cost: the partner "perhaps felt abandoned" during prolonged observation. Two beats: opening claim and ending application ("warmly observant even of your silence"). Closure: the narrator's observational patience yields the insight that passage matters more than outcome. One friction: warmth is asserted more than shown—gentleness in the final lines ("gently") aligns, but earlier beats focus on observation without demonstrating warmth in gesture or response to the partner's need. Slightly label-reliant but causal role present.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Foresee introduced early ("Across this pause I could foresee more than either of us dared utter") and operationalized: the narrator sees three futures (inland arguments, silted grotto, drifted comfort) that texture themselves "into touchable threads." The action enables comparison and narrows the choice by making consequences tangible. Closure: seeing "our fear thaw if change arrived honored" informs the yes decision. Cost: foresight includes negative outcomes ("laugh fester," "mistook comfort for completion"). Two beats: initial foresight claim and the specific visions. One friction: the foresight is internally generated reflection rather than dramatized perception under pressure; swapping to "imagined" or "weighed" would change little. Causal role moderate; the visions don't reverse tactics but deepen conviction.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Tangential approach named ("This is my method, through tangential approach, circling truth until it offers passage") and demonstrated: the narrator avoids direct answer, studies barnacles, tilts the cicada, and circles via future visions. The method shapes the pause's duration and the partner's trust ("You knew that, which is why you trusted the hush"). Closure: the circling yields the insight to name passage rather than outcome. Two beats: explicit claim and enacted circling. One friction: the method is more described than mechanically tested—if the narrator had answered directly, closure would still land; the tangential approach extends time but doesn't alter the final choice's substance. Moderate causal pressure; the means matter but aren't indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Ancient grotto under stars anchored early (barnacles, slick stone, sea glass light, dripping metronome, sky pressed close) and active across beats: it holds the pause, provides the lantern's light for examining the cicada, drips "counting mercy," and approves with a soft breath at closure. Setting charges final image ("the grotto kept our resolution") and supplies sensory resources (starlight on cicada wings, ripple at ankles). Spatial choreography clear (lantern, palm, stone). Cost linkage: one future shows "the grotto silting shut" if they stay without change. Three beats with closure participation. Moderate causal pressure: the grotto frames rather than constrains the choice, but its particulars (dripping, breath, starlight) enable the narrator's reflective mode and charge the ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Timeframe (across the pause in a difficult conversation) governs the entire piece: the pause is named in the opening line, functions as container and tidepool, and its duration shapes both the narrator's reflection and the partner's patience. The pause tightens the decision by holding silence until both can breathe bravery. Cost: prolonging the pause risks the partner feeling abandoned. Closure: "Across that single pause, an arch had formed, patient, exact, and finally passable"—the timeframe is reweighted from hesitation to hinge. Causal: without the pause, the narrator's sidelong method and future visions would lack narrative space. The grotto's drip functions as metronome, giving the pause texture. Indispensable; removing the pause collapses structure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Motivation (to discover the texture of time) stated explicitly ("I wanted you to know I was not delaying, I was listening to time") and operationalized: the narrator attends to time's texture (foam/lace, metronome drips, threshold weather) and concludes "To discover the texture of time, we must touch it while we change." The desire shapes the narrator's refusal to rush and choice to honor passage. Closure: the arch forms because time is attended. One friction: the motivation is told more than dramatized through conflicting wants; the narrator's patience serves observation rather than wrestling between fear and desire. Cost implied (partner's wait) but not viscerally felt. Two beats: claim and ending articulation. Moderate causal role.</comment>
