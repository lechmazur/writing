<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The chess tutor's interiority is embodied through concrete choices (touching threads, counting knight's pace) and contradictory impulses—desire to forgive versus tasting "ashes from the kingdom I had burned." The protagonist's professional lens (pattern-reading, pedagogical patience) filters every perception and choice consistently. Minor slip: the memory of the prince pouring wine feels slightly generic compared to the surrounding specificity, but the final choice between releasing "entirely, at once" versus "careful increments, lesson by lesson" is earned and forecloses a path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with causal escalation at closure. Orientation anchors (exiled chess tutor, time-frozen village, fountain square) land cleanly by ~100 words. The piece teaches its lyric-accumulative pattern early and maintains coherent pressure: each thread loosened returns a fraction of time, building density until the protagonist chooses incremental release over brilliant sacrifice. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis hybrid)—the tutor accepts the longer pedagogical method, visible cost paid in rejecting satisfying catharsis. The cost is legible: "I left only the clocktower pigeons still as thoughts, so that I might always remember that some flights must wait for weather." One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The platinum labyrinth fountain appears in three beats (observation, knight placement, overflow at closure) and constrains the protagonist's understanding of trapped time; water "trembled inside its threads of light but did not fall" teaches the problem's mechanics. Spatial choreography (village square, hall, tapestry wall, back to square) remains coherent. The tapestry's frayed border functions as micro-setting, a tool whose threads the tutor must decode to restore motion. The final image—platinum labyrinth overflowing as thunder moves on—charges closure by releasing the constraint that shaped all prior tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: forgiveness/redemption signaled in paragraph six. Pressure escalates through the tutor's method—each right pull returns a gray second, each wrong brush tastes ashes—until the central choice: release the village entirely (satisfying but reminiscent of past destructive lessons) or "careful increments, lesson by lesson." Agency is decision and renunciation; the protagonist rejects the brilliant sacrifice for pedagogical patience, forecloses the cathartic path, and accepts lasting reminder (pigeons frozen). The trade-off is explicit, the cost felt. One meaningful tightening at the tapestry's center suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme (redemption through patient correction versus destructive brilliance) emerges from the tutor's method and final choice without explicit statement. The platinum labyrinth, woven hush, and frozen pigeons recur with reweighted meaning: the labyrinth's overflow signals release, the pigeons remain as "flights must wait for weather," teaching the tutor that some pauses are choices. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—"I began to forgive myself"—earned by the preceding correction of past error (sacrificing villages for victory). The tapestry metaphor (weave holding and breaking decisions) integrates without shouting. No thematic echo or moralizing in the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Single first-person POV held throughout with stable psychic distance and perceptual signature: the tutor filters all observation through chess pedagogy ("knight's pace, L-shaped," "openings come, a quiet check disguised as courtesy"). Diction remains elevated but consistent with the narrator's reflective, exiled register; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. The phrase "fierce repose I needed settled in, steadier than fear, more stubborn than shame" is purpose-driven and supports pressure. Minor: "productivity" in "fidgets productively" dips slightly toward modern self-help idiom but remains plausible for this voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; figurative density is high but mostly coherent ("exile curl tight around my throat," "weave where decisions hold and break"). Slight overwriting in mid-section: "fierce repose," "woven hush became a breathing hush," and "dust rose as if listening" cluster without adding causal pressure, trending toward decorative accumulation (−0.3). The storm "rolled without rolling, a held drumbeat" borders on mixed metaphor but recovers through paradox. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Information density is strong; most lines advance image, memory, or choice. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and reconfigure prior motifs effectively.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of chess pedagogy, time-frozen village, and tapestry-as-puzzle is specific and non-obvious; the tutor's method (decoding frayed threads like chess moves) feels inevitable in hindsight. The final choice—incremental release over brilliant sacrifice—transforms the redemption premise through occupational lens and character flaw. Risk-taking in lyric density and extended metaphor heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The premise (exiled mentor undoing frozen-time catastrophe) is familiar fantasy, but the execution through chess tactics and textile mechanics offers sufficient particularity to avoid derivative penalty.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Exiled chess tutor is signaled early (paragraph four), drives the method (counting knight's pace, reading patterns), and makes the story's pivotal choice at the tapestry's center: incremental release versus satisfying sacrifice. The character's professional training constrains perception and tactics throughout. Appears in three or more beats and is causally active at closure. The specific cost (living with frozen pigeons as reminder) is tied to the tutor's pedagogical identity.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Platinum labyrinth appears in three beats: initial observation (paragraph seven), knight placement (paragraph twelve), and overflow at closure (penultimate paragraph). Its form (mirrored maze whose channels reflected stalled rain) teaches the problem's structure; water trembling but not falling signals trapped time. The overflow at closure marks the village's release. However, the labyrinth does not directly constrain a middle choice—threads do that work. Strong lyric reprise with reweighted meaning, but causal pressure in the middle is indirect.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Woven hush is introduced (paragraph nine), becomes the problem ("what had caged them," paragraph eighteen), and is the target the tutor must "winnow" and "unspool" (paragraphs nineteen–twenty). The concept shapes stakes: stillness must be teased from regret without scattering. It reappears transformed at closure: "woven hush became a breathing hush" (paragraph thirty-eight). The hush's mechanics (threads in tapestry border) dictate the protagonist's method and constrain every choice. Indispensable to plot logic and thematic charge.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Fidgets productively is claimed (paragraph ten), demonstrated once when the tutor draws the travel board and sets a knight (paragraphs eleven–twelve), and implied in the thread-counting method (paragraphs twenty-six onward). The trait enables the protagonist's approach—turning "misfortune into a map"—but does not visibly constrain a choice with trade-off. Present across beats but more label than friction. Reaches two-gate threshold (setup, middle gesture) with modest causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Winnow is announced as goal (paragraph six: "winnow the stillness, teasing the kernel of time from the chaff of regret"), becomes the method (paragraphs nineteen–twenty: "winnowing the woven hush by decoding frayed threads"), and dictates the major turn (paragraphs thirty-six–thirty-seven: choosing incremental winnowing over total release). The action is irreplaceable; substituting a generic "solve" would collapse the story's metaphoric spine and pedagogical logic. Drives at least two beats and shapes closure directly.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Method signaled early (paragraph twenty: "unspool the woven hush by decoding frayed threads in a tapestry's border, reading them like moves in a line"), executed across middle beats (paragraphs twenty-one through thirty-four: touching threads, counting knight's pace, tugging to release dust and water), and culminates in the central choice (paragraph thirty-six: "reached the center of the border, where threads frayed into near-invisibility"). The mechanics matter: right pulls return seconds, wrong brushes taste ashes. Removing this exact method would break plot logic and thematic charge. All three gates, strong causal pressure, closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Time-frozen village frames the entire story (opening line), supplies the central problem (clocktower pigeons, fountain, tapestry figures all frozen), and constrains every choice—the tutor must decode stillness without shattering it. The setting's unique rule (time paused) is the obstacle the protagonist's method addresses. Village details (square, hall, banners, tapestry) provide spatial choreography. At closure, the village inhales and resumes motion incrementally, validating the protagonist's stakes. Essential across beats and ending; removing the freeze removes the plot.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Timeframe "during the lull of distant thunder" is announced (paragraph three) and reprised at closure (paragraph forty: "the thunder sighed and moved on"). The lull provides atmospheric pressure—"storm muttered in sleep," "held drumbeat"—but does not visibly tighten decisions or alter tactics on the page. The tutor works methodically without a racing clock. The thunder's movement signals closure but does not constrain middle choices with urgency. Lyric frame present at setup and payoff; modest development in between.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Motivation to forgive oneself is stated (paragraph six), dramatized through memory friction (paragraphs twenty-three–twenty-four: prince's wine, unfunded hospital), tested in the central choice (paragraphs thirty-five–thirty-seven: reject satisfying catharsis for patient correction), and achieved provisionally at closure (final line: "I began to forgive myself"). The desire conflicts with the cost—living with frozen pigeons as reminder—and the tutor's past preference for brilliant sacrifice. Forgiveness is earned through on-page renunciation of the easier path. All three gates, strong causal and emotional pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fierce repose is claimed explicitly (paragraph twenty-five: "the fierce repose I needed settled in, steadier than fear, more stubborn than shame") and sustained through the tutor's controlled, methodical approach under memory-pressure. Tone modulates: lyric density increases during memory beats, eases during spatial description, tightens at the central choice. The final image—platinum labyrinth overflowing, storm moving on, "I began to forgive myself"—charges closure with earned calm after sustained tension. Coherent through turns, no tonal breaks. The explicit naming is a minor tell but the execution supports it.</comment>
