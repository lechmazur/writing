<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is densely metaphorical but lacks concrete micro-choices that test contradictory impulses in scene. The "charmed skeptic" stance is told and labeled ("I told the child I was a charmed skeptic") rather than dramatized through on-page decisions that reveal internal conflict. The final acceptance ("I would carry it usefully") arrives without visible hesitation or a dramatized trade-off that would ground the change. Embodied emotion is present in scattered images (winter in chest, pressure like weather) but remains abstract rather than tied to specific bodily sensation or action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the narrator becomes an archive, the child disperses, the garden "satisfied"), but the cost is conceptual rather than felt on the page—no visible forfeiture or immediate friction appears in the final beats. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density and cadence accumulate metaphorical weight toward the ending reprise of "translate isolation into independence." Orientation is present early (garden, twilight, fountain) but the shell's mechanics and the transfer's stakes remain vague until midpoint, creating mild disorientation. The "resonance structures" method is invoked but not concretely taught, leaving the middle passage feeling more declarative than causal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The velvet garden, fountain, and twilight-to-dawn frame anchor the single scene and modulate with emotional pressure (shadows "shelving themselves" at closure). Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered ("tragically radiant sky, a bruise of cobalt"), but the garden itself does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics. The shell functions as micro-setting more than the garden proper, yet its physical handling is sparse (pressed to ear, placed against fountain, held to stone) without showing how proximity or material properties shape the outcome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—translate isolation into independence by accepting the quarantined memory—is signaled early and resolves on the page. One meaningful deepening occurs when the child asks the narrator to "archive its winter," tightening the abstract quest into a concrete exchange. However, the escalation lacks visible cost in the moment: the narrator agrees with philosophical ease ("I would carry it usefully"), the transfer completes without friction, and no live option is foreclosed. Agency reads as acceptance rather than renunciation or sacrifice, and the "dizzy" aftermath is the sole bodily marker of price paid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The theme—transforming isolation into independence through chosen burden—emerges from image and action (archive, winter carried as order, lantern unafraid of wind) without stated moral. The final image ("a child sleeps without waves at the door") reweights the premise non-literally and earns resonance from prior particulars (sea syllables, rusted gull cries, foam dispersal). The whispering shell recurs and shifts meaning (humming window → simple counting), meeting the recurring-image test. Slight deduction for one moment of near-moralizing ("So much of life is anteroom and afterthought") that edges toward meta-commentary, though it remains tied to the narrator's present stance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Single-POV first-person is stable; no head-hopping. The perceptual signature is dense and metaphor-heavy ("pulse of the hedges," "bright animal through a corridor of shut doors"), creating a distinct lyric texture. However, under peak pressure (the transfer itself), diction remains elevated and abstract ("resonance structures we shaped the transfer, mapping tones to gestures") without the compression or sensory immediacy that would mark stress. Filter verbs ("I felt," "I knew") appear frequently but fit the reflective voice. The final paragraph's rhythm modulates well ("tragically radiant only when the cold inside me arranged itself into meaning"), supporting closure without flattening.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines layer image, action, and thematic weight. Rhythm varies purposefully, and no paraphrase loops or template cadence runs appear. However, figurative language saturates nearly every sentence in the middle third ("bright animal," "weather pushing against a door," "library of frost"), risking overwriting without a taught pattern to justify the density. The transfer beat ("mapping tones to gestures, breaths to footfalls") tells the mechanism rather than showing it, and "the memory bled like ink" mixes metaphors (sound/ink) without resolving the vehicle. Minor pronoun ambiguity: "its winter" and "it asked" require momentary back-reference to confirm "child/echo."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of memory-as-weather, resonance as method, and archive-as-transformation is specific and non-obvious, avoiding stock ghost-story beats. The "charmed skeptic" frame and the child wearing "a crown of rusted gull cries" offer fresh sensory detail. However, the core move—accepting a burden from a spectral presence to release it—echoes familiar psychopomp and haunting templates without a sharp moral calculus or world-logic twist that would elevate it. The piece commits fully to its lyric premise and follows through to closure, but the emotional arc (narrator encounters ghost, agrees to help, ghost departs) maps cleanly onto common structure. Risk-taking in voice and density is evident, though the plot itself plays safe.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The "charmed skeptic" stance is named in paragraph 1 and returned to when the narrator tells the child "I am a charmed skeptic, blessed with doubt," shaping the decision to carry rather than worship sorrow. However, the skepticism is asserted rather than tested—no on-page moment shows the narrator doubting, questioning the shell's reality, or resisting the exchange before agreeing. The trait enables the final choice but does not constrain it with visible cost or internal friction.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The whispering seashell half appears in beats 3, 9, 13, and 25, evolving from "hummed when pressed to my ear" to "replied in sea syllables" to "spoke only of present waves." It is handled (pressed to ear, placed against fountain, held to stone, listened to again) and its changing voice signals the memory's release. However, the shell's physical properties do not constrain the method—any object could have served as vessel—and the "half" detail is never used. Strong beat involvement and closure reprise, but specificity is limited.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The quarantined memory is named in paragraph 5, dramatized when the child asks to have its winter archived, and resolved when "the memory bled like ink into my keeping." It shapes the central stake and tactic (resonance transfer). However, the mechanics of "quarantine" are vague—what sealed it, why it needed release, and how isolation differs from archive—limiting the concept's constraint on tactics. The concept charges the ending (child sleeps, narrator carries winter) but remains more thematic frame than specific pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Tragically radiant" appears twice: applied to the sky in paragraph 10 and to the narrator in paragraph 30 ("tragically radiant only when the cold inside me arranged itself into meaning"). The attribute does not constrain action or enable a choice with cost; it functions as descriptor. No on-page moment shows the narrator's radiance altering another's reaction or the narrator choosing to display or conceal it. Label-only trait.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Archive" is signaled when the child asks (paragraph 16), enacted in the transfer (paragraph 20: "the memory bled like ink into my keeping"), and confirmed at closure ("I had become a quiet archive," "a bearer of weather"). The action drives the central turn—narrator accepts the burden, child disperses—and redefines the narrator's identity and future role. Removing "archive" in favor of "release" or "absorb" would weaken the thematic specificity (library of frost, instructions for thaw). Strong causal and closure linkage, though the physical act itself is abstract.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Through resonance structures" is named in paragraph 7 ("a third way learned from failed bridges and patient bees") and invoked in the transfer beat ("Through resonance structures we shaped the transfer, mapping tones to gestures"). The method is signaled as distinct from "faithless science" or "surrendering prayer," but its mechanics are told rather than shown. No earlier beat demonstrates tuning, alignment, or failed resonance that would teach the reader how the method works. The phrase appears functional but swappable with "empathy" or "sympathetic connection" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The velvet garden frames the entire piece, from hedged paths in paragraph 1 to "shelving shadows" in paragraph 29. The twilight-to-dawn arc marks time, and the fountain provides a concrete surface for the shell. However, the garden does not constrain choice—the transfer could occur anywhere with water and stone—and no environmental detail (hedge layout, moth behavior, caretaker absence) alters tactics. The setting supplies atmosphere and a lyric anchor but remains backdrop rather than pressure. Early signal and closure presence lift the score, but causal work is limited.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"When the last star fades into morning light" appears in paragraphs 11 and 33, bracketing the transfer and framing the garden's "true letter" timing. The timeframe tightens decision by implying a window (twilight to dawn) and the narrator completes the task within it, but no on-page moment shows the clock pressuring a choice—the narrator is never racing dawn or forced to act before the star fades. The frame is lyric and purposeful, reappearing at closure, but does not escalate tactics. Reprise adds value, but causal pressure is minimal.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"To translate isolation into independence" is stated in paragraph 6, returned to in the decision ("I would carry it usefully"), and resolved in paragraphs 27–28 ("teaching me to listen before I speak… by carrying it cleanly"). The motivation drives the stake and shapes the final stance. However, the narrator's isolation is told rather than shown—no on-page friction dramatizes loneliness or the cost of prior solitude—and the "independence" achieved is conceptual rather than tested by a competing want. The motivation is coherent and charges closure, but lacks embodied conflict in scene.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>"Ghostly resolve" is embodied in the moths drifting "with ghostly resolve" (paragraph 2) and the narrator's final stance ("I move with ghostly resolve," paragraph 34). The tone is coherent—quiet, liminal, determined—and modulates from watching (moths, leaves) to acting (transfer) to moving forward. The reprise charges the ending by mirroring the opening. However, the tone does not shift under peak pressure (the transfer itself remains abstract and calm), missing an opportunity to tighten or crack the resolve before restoring it. Solid integration but static modulation.</comment>
