<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The chaste courtesan's motivation—defying conformity via ritual—is established, but interiority remains abstract and label-driven ("bodily poetic," "alarming serenity" as repeated descriptors rather than embodied contradiction). Micro-choices exist (kneeling, threading, descending) yet lack visible internal conflict or competing impulses acting simultaneously. The final bowl-setting reads as ritual completion without a felt trade-off that forecloses a personal path. Embodied emotion is sparse; the prose tells us she "knew" and "vowed" more than it shows contradictory desires colliding under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening lines. The piece follows an accumulative lens: threads gathered → echoes harvested → looms rethreaded → sleepers wake → bowl returned. One meaningful deepening occurs when the underground looms convert whispers into a counterchant that wakes the city. Cost is conceptual—the city "learns slowly how to refuse and still sing"—but the final image does not make the protagonist's personal price undeniable on the page; the closure reads as thematic repricing without a visible sacrifice or foreclosed option for the courtesan herself.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The silver courtyard, prism sanctuary, and underground looms are vividly rendered with sensory specificity ("lanterns bled tiny suns," "starless tunnels remembered rivers"). The bowl of snow functions as micro-setting, gathering echoes and enabling the underground maneuver. Spatial choreography (courtyard center → grate → tunnels → return) remains coherent. The prism and bowl constrain the ritual's mechanics and charge the final image when the bowl is cupped then set upon the prism, satisfying the 9+ gate for environment shaping closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—defying the palace's lullaby of conformity by freeing trapped voices—is signaled early. One tightening occurs when guards approach and "the window between sigh and smile began to shrink," forcing the courtesan to quicken her knotting. Agency is present (she descends, reweaves threads, times the ritual), yet the guards pause without on-page confrontation and the city's waking feels like an off-stage result rather than a dramatized reversal. Cost to the protagonist is implied ("courage rather than etiquette") but not made visceral; we do not see what she loses or forecloses by this act.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme—freedom from enforced obedience, tongue unlocked from sleep—emerges from the ritual imagery (threads, echoes, looms) rather than direct statement. The final image ("learning slowly how to refuse and still sing") offers a resonant answer to the central question without moralizing. Subtext operates in the prism's "many throats" and the looms anchored to palace tongues. However, recurring phrases ("bodily poetic," "alarming serenity," "between sigh and smile") function more as lyric ornament than motifs that accumulate pressure or reweight meaning across beats, preventing full thematic elevation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable throughout with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present in the metaphoric compression ("breath rose like pale birds," "snow sifted like slow fire"), establishing a consistent lyric register. However, diction frequently drifts into elevated abstraction ("bodily poetic," "chaste courtesan," "harvest of echoes") that reads as imposed rather than character-particular, especially under the pressure of the guard patrol. Free indirect style is clean, but the voice does not modulate convincingly between ritual calm and urgency; the prose maintains uniform density even when the narrative claims she "quickened."</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade the piece: "bodily poetic" appears three times, "alarming serenity" four times, "between sigh and smile" four times, "harvest of echoes" four times, "silver courtyard under snow" three times, "prism sanctuary under starlight" four times, "to defy the lullaby of conformity" three times, "by untangling threads" three times. Synonym churn includes "threads" / "lines," "unlock" / "opened," and near-identical constructions ("She had come," "She knew," "She had learned," "She lifted," "She set," "She cupped"). Figurative language is dense but often mixed: "lanterns bled tiny suns" then "marble veins," "slow fire" for snow, "breath wrote fog" on brick. These artifacts cluster throughout, including the final third, triggering the patterned-artifact penalty pack (−1.4 baseline, −1.7 due to closure-beat presence) and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The premise—chaste courtesan as ritual guardian who harvests whispered vows to wake a city—combines familiar archetypal elements (liminal woman, underground resistance, magic threads) without a decisive transformation. The underground looms and prism mechanics offer specific texture, yet the emotional and thematic arc (conformity vs. freedom, silence vs. voice) follows a well-worn template. The substitution test suggests plot and arc would survive with different proper nouns. Prose ambition is evident, but recurring stock phrases and the lack of a surprising turn or moral calculus beyond the binary keep the piece in mid-band originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The chaste courtesan appears in all three gates: setup (opening paragraph), middle (kneeling, threading, descending), and closure (setting the bowl upon the prism). Her decisions—timing arrival, unlocking the prism, descending to the looms, rethreading lines, returning—drive every beat. Two integration frictions: the trait "chaste" is mentioned once and does not constrain an on-page action with visible cost (label-only, −0.3), and her agency at closure feels ritualized rather than a contested choice that forecloses a personal path (moderate causal pressure). Early signal +0.6, three or more beats +1.4, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +1.0, less label penalty and swappability friction.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary appears in setup (courtyard center, "glass chapel of many throats"), middle (she kneels to unlock its throat), and closure (the prism "rang like a bell" and she sets the bowl upon it). Handled in at least two beats: unlocking and final placement. The object's specific property—catching constellations, bending them into rainbows, having "many throats"—matters to the ritual and charges the final image. Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.6, less minor swappability friction (another ritual vessel could serve with edits, −0.4).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The "harvest of echoes" is present in setup (paragraph four: "promised a harvest of echoes"), middle (gathered into the bowl, rethreaded into looms), and closure (travels up looms, people wake speaking truths). The concept shapes the ritual's stakes and tactics: she must gather whispers before the window closes, then reweave them to wake sleepers. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.0, less phrase-repetition artifact (used four times, treated as ornament in some mentions, −0.5).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Bodily poetic" appears three times as a label for her gait and hand movements ("each toe-writing a measured rune," "a grammar of wrists and knuckles," "bodily poetic restraint an anthem of withheld touch"). Present in setup and middle, but only as descriptive modifier; it does not constrain or enable an on-page choice with visible cost. No closure participation. Two beats (gait, hand threading) +0.9, but ornamental use −0.8, label-only −0.3, no closure −0.6 (missing gate cap 2.8 waived due to lyric mode; scored as label-heavy trait instead).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Unlock" drives the ritual: she unlocks the prism's throat (middle beat), then unlocks the grate beneath the courtyard (second middle beat), and the final image implies the city will "unlock tomorrow by untangling threads." The action is irreplaceable—removing it breaks the ritual's logic. Early signal (implicit in "unlock the crowded vaults" paragraph two) +0.4, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.5, specificity +0.7, less late explicit mention of the word in final paragraph (−0.3) and mild swappability (could be "open" or "release" with edits, −0.5).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"By untangling threads" appears in setup ("to unlock its throat by untangling threads"), is executed in the middle beats (threads glimmer between her fingers, she tugs each, reweaves them into looms), and echoes at closure ("unlock tomorrow by untangling threads of habit"). The method is specific and shapes her tactics under time pressure. Early signal +0.6, two distinct beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.7, closure linkage +0.8, less phrase repetition (used three times as refrain, some uses ornamental, −0.4) and mild summary flavor in the final mention (−0.3).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The "silver courtyard under snow" is present in setup (opening line), middle (she returns to it after the underground work), and closure (final paragraph, the bowl set upon the prism there). The snow and frost supply sensory texture and the courtyard's spatial center anchors the prism and grate. The snow itself becomes a tool (bowl of snow gathers echoes). Early signal +0.8, two beats +0.9, micro-setting (bowl of snow) +0.7, closure linkage +0.9, less phrase repetition (used three times, treated as postcard description in some mentions, −0.6) and moderate swappability (another open space would serve with minor edits, −0.4).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Between sigh and smile" is introduced in paragraph three ("timing her presence to the breathless hinge of night"), repeated when the window begins to shrink as guards approach, and echoed at closure ("Between sigh and smile, she set the bowl upon the prism"). The phrase signals urgency and frames the ritual's narrow temporal window. However, it functions more as lyric motif than a tracked clock; we do not see specific time markers or incremental pressure tightening moment by moment. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, pressure framing +0.6, closure linkage +0.7, less vague tracking (phrase used four times but not dramatized as ticking countdown, −0.7) and ornamental repetition (−0.4).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The motivation "to defy the lullaby of conformity" is stated in paragraph three, reiterated when she refuses panic under guard pressure ("her motive was not survival but to defy the lullaby of conformity"), and implicit at closure when the city learns "how to refuse and still sing." Present across all three gates. The desire drives her choice to perform the forbidden ritual. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, less told-only phrasing (phrase repeated three times as assertion rather than enacted friction, −0.8) and lack of on-page cost to her personally (conceptual outcome for the city, not visible sacrifice for the protagonist, −0.5).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Alarming serenity" appears in the opening, at the courtyard peak moment ("the scene wore alarming serenity"), when she maintains composure under guard threat ("she quickened yet kept alarming serenity"), and at closure ("Alarming serenity endured, but now it trembled"). Present in setup, middle, and closure. The tone labels the mood but does not modulate convincingly; prose density and figurative saturation remain uniform across beats regardless of narrative urgency. Early signal +0.5, three mentions +1.4, closure linkage +0.5, less static application (phrase used four times without tonal shift that tracks pressure changes, −0.9) and label-only ornament (−0.6).</comment>
