<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The negotiator's interiority shows purposeful control—"operatively gentle," restraint without bruising—and micro-choices accumulate (asking children what they want, reframing redemption as shared work). Internal contradiction emerges when the general admits exhaustion with victories-as-funerals, grounded in embodied weariness rather than therapy-speak. The cast is large (two delegations, aide, general, soldier, children) but choreography remains mostly clear and pressure coheres around the singular stake of brokering peace through ritual modesty. No unmotivated leaps; the final promise to "anchor ideals in practice, day after day" follows from prior choices with visible cost (the provisional agreements, the annual return).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who, where, and when by line 2 (negotiator, ancient terrace, midsummer). Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through ritual additions (olive branches, lockpicks, red thread, shell casings, lemon water) and cadence shifts (debate → silence → drafting breathing → final vow). Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the bowl of casings becomes portable memory, agreements breathe provisionally, the forever war "loosens its grip"—a reweighting with felt cost (annual return, feeding tomorrow, judging by how enemies sleep). One meaningful deepening is clear: moving from distrust and razors of syllables to a shared stance by the sea. Cost is conceptual and social but legible in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Terrace stones, fennel, thyme, coastal wind, and shell casings ground the setting early. The bowl of casings functions as micro-setting/object-as-setting: it charges the closure when both sides hold it jointly and vow annual return. Spatial choreography is clear (stairs, table, sea view); sensory detail is selective (lemon-tinted water as caution, lanterns as small moons). The terrace's cracked stones—"flawed beauty"—recur and constrain the final image, fulfilling the 9+ gate (environment charges the final image). No occupational jargon intrudes; the ritual objects (clipboard, casings, olive branches) are purposefully filtered through the negotiator's priorities.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (brokering peace through ritual, not spectacle) is signaled by line 10. One meaningful tightening: the soldier's demand for penalty meets the counterargument about prison, resolved by the negotiator's reframing ("redemption is priced by work shared"). Agency is renunciation and endurance (they sign nothing yet but draft the breathing) with visible cost (provisional agreements, annual vow). Pressure accumulates under the Accumulative lens: each ritual addition (names, casings, facing the sea) deepens commitment. No coincidence resolves; the delegates' shared stance emerges from the negotiator's facilitation and the children's voiced needs. Cost is legible in the final image: the promise to feed tomorrow, to let enemies sleep, to return annually.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme (the price of redemption as shared work, ritual as corridor for fear, patience as armor and debt to the fallen) emerges from concrete action: the bowl of casings, the breathing exercise, the children's wants. No moralizing summary; the final lines offer resonant images—"we will be judged by how well our enemies sleep," "the forever war did not end, but it loosened its grip"—that reweight prior material without stating a moral. Subtext operates in gesture (shaking hands holding the bowl, the child tracing cracks). Earned wisdom arises from the terrace encounter, not platitudes. The negotiator's internal arc (carrying more than paper, lighter yet heavier) is inextricable from the thematic question. One small slip: "operatively gentle" and "flawed beauty" are repeated as labels without always being dramatized in fresh embodiment.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single POV, close third on the negotiator; distance is stable, internal access consistent. Diction ("bristled and broke," "syllables into razors," "our ache, just slightly") is purposeful and rhythmically controlled. Dialogue (soldier vs. woman on penalty/horizon, children on water and streets, general on victories-as-funerals) carries distinct idiom and advances stakes. One weakness: the negotiator's internal voice occasionally slips into elevated abstraction ("Ritual gives nerves a corridor") that reads more like authorial summary than lived thought under pressure. Filter verbs ("I felt," "I told") are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. No head-hopping, no POV leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high: many lines do double work (setting, interiority, theme). Two frictions lower the score: (1) Paraphrase loop—"We began with names, and we stayed with names. Each name was a stone, each grief a hand remembering heat"—restates without new pressure (−0.2). (2) Template cadence in the mid-section: runs of "The [noun] [verb]" and "I [verb]" stems flatten propulsion across 4–5 lines (−0.4). Figurative language is mostly clear ("banners... lifted and sighed," "patient arcs") but "kelp into ordered swales" and "lanterns shook like small moons" verge on mixed vehicles. No severe loops or filter-verb stacks. Grammar and punctuation are clean; tense is consistent. Closure beats are artifact-free.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The premise (ritual peace negotiation on a terrace at midsummer with celestial pacing) offers a fresh synthesis; the choice to focus on breathing exercises, naming, and shared casings rather than treaty language is non-obvious. Emotional specificity (the general's shaking care, the children's inventory before arithmetic) avoids generic templates. One friction: the framing echoes high-literary templates (lyric accumulation, charged objects, elevated diction) without full transformation; phrases like "ritual significance" and "operatively gentle" read as writerly labels rather than lived particulars. Tropes (war-weary negotiator, symbolic objects) are executed at a high level but not radically subverted. Risk-taking (foregrounding process over climax, ending on loosening rather than resolution) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity (+0.3 within band). Transformation test mostly passes: the terrace, clipboard, casings, and ritual sequence feel specific to this story.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The negotiator frames expectation (line 1), shapes multiple beats (arriving, listening, reframing redemption, asking children, conducting the bowl ritual), and decisively participates in closure (holding the bowl, making the annual vow, leaving lighter). Agency is visible: choosing to let argument exhaust, redefining redemption, addressing children openly. Cost is tied to the character's choices (provisional agreements, ongoing commitment). Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.5, cost connection +0.5. Base 3.0 + 5.2 = 8.2, rounded down to 8.1. Minor friction: the negotiator's internal stance is consistent but occasionally didactic (−0.3). Final 7.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The ebony clipboard appears in line 5 (early signal +0.5), is written on when recording offerings (beat 1 +0.4), gains weight as clauses accumulate (beat 2 +0.4), and "sighs with relief" at the end when agreements are clipped (closure linkage +0.9). Specificity (ebony, folded wings, ink bled in past seasons) adds texture (+0.4). Total lifts: +2.6. Base 3.0 + 2.6 = 5.6. One friction: the clipboard is handled but does not constrain a choice or narrow options; it records rather than enables/blocks (−0.3). The sigh is anthropomorphized closure participation, not causal work (mild ornamental note, −0.2). Net 5.1, but the recurring presence and charged reprise (relief) push it to 5.6. Correcting for lyric-resonance allowance and two-beat involvement, final score 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The price of redemption shapes stakes explicitly: the soldier asks about it, the woman counters, the negotiator reframes it as "work shared, not suffering hoarded" (beat 1, causal pressure). This reframing narrows options and enables the breathing exercise and the casings ritual (beat 2). Closure directly invokes it: "We will pay the price of redemption by how we feed tomorrow" and "judged by how well our enemies sleep." Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.6, cost connection +0.5. Base 3.0 + 5.0 = 8.0. Minor friction: the concept is stated more than embodied in micro-action; the negotiator tells rather than shows the price in a specific forfeiture (−0.5). Swappability is low; the exact phrasing matters. Net 7.5, rounded to 7.2 after accounting for one moment of abstraction.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Operatively gentle" is introduced in line 7 as a trained trait. It constrains handling (holding tension without bruising), enables the facilitator role, and recurs at the end ("operatively gentle, carrying more than paper"). Early signal +0.6, two beats (initial handling, final carrying) +0.9, causal pressure (the gentleness shapes the negotiator's method of letting arguments exhaust, reframing without heat) +0.8, closure linkage +0.7. Base 3.0 + 3.0 = 6.0. Frictions: mostly label-only; the trait is told and reprised but not dramatized in a specific costly tradeoff where gentleness blocks a harder move or forces vulnerability (−0.4). Swappability is moderate; "patient" or "restrained" could substitute with minor edits (−0.3). Net 5.3, but the reprise at closure and early setup push it to 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Muster" appears in line 15: "We had to muster courage without drawing swords, resolve without heat." This frames the negotiator's internal challenge and the delegates' task. The action is tested when dissenters wait at the stairs (beat 1) and when the negotiator asks delegates to rise and face the sea, mustering shared stance (beat 2, closure). Early signal +0.4 (not first paragraph but within first fifth), two beats +0.9, causal pressure (courage enables the breathing exercise and final vow) +1.0, closure linkage +1.2. Base 3.0 + 3.5 = 6.5. Friction: "muster" is somewhat abstract; the action could be swapped for "gather" or "summon" without major structural loss (−0.4). The verb shapes but does not uniquely define the turn. Net 6.1, lifted slightly by closure participation to 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Through ritual significance" is signaled in line 12 and taught by ~line 13 ("Ritual gives nerves a corridor"). The method is enacted across multiple beats: naming ritual, breathing exercise, casings ritual, facing the sea. Each ritual step shapes the delegates' progression from distrust to provisional agreement. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (ritual constrains the negotiator's tactics and enables the delegates' softening) +1.5, closure linkage (the bowl ritual and vow are the closure's anchor) +1.7, specificity (the exact mechanics—names, breathing, casings, facing the sea—matter) +0.7. Base 3.0 + 6.0 = 9.0. One friction: the phrase "through ritual significance" is repeated as a label without always showing *why* ritual works beyond assertion (−0.3). The method is demonstrated but occasionally told. Net 8.7, rounded to 8.6. Reconsidering the beat count and closure dependence, the score lifts to 7.6 after conservative re-audit (the method is essential but the label-reliance and mid-story explicitation lower the band slightly).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ancient terrace at midsummer is introduced in line 2 (early signal +0.7). It grounds the setting, supplies resources (table, stones, bowl placement), and its cracked stones ("flawed beauty") charge the final image when the child traces cracks and finds a path forward (closure linkage +1.4). The terrace pressures choices by its ritual/neutral-ground status and by hosting the bowl as witness (causal pressure +1.0). Two beats (arrival setup, closure image) +0.9. Base 3.0 + 4.0 = 7.0. Specificity: midsummer and ancient both matter; the timing and history frame the ritual's weight (+0.5). Minor friction: the terrace is more stage than active constraint; it does not block or enable a specific move beyond hosting (−0.3). Net 7.2, rounded to 7.1.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"During the slow dance of celestial bodies" is introduced in line 3 and reprised in line 56 ("I felt the slow dance of celestial bodies echo in my pulse"). The timeframe establishes patience and cosmic pacing but does not function as a live ticking clock. Early signal +0.6, lyric reprise (first third → late beat) +0.5, thematic linkage (patience as method) +0.3. Base 3.0 + 1.4 = 4.4. Frictions: the celestial dance is ornamental; no choice is tightened by the passage of midsummer hours or star movement (−0.5). Swappable with "over the course of the day" or similar with minor edits (−0.4). The element is present and thematically consonant but does not constrain tactics. Net 3.5, lifted by the reprise and coherence to 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The motivation "to anchor ideals in practice" is stated in line 10 and tested across the story: the negotiator reframes redemption as work, conducts the breathing ritual, drafts agreements, and makes the final vow to "anchor ideals in practice, day after day." Early signal +0.6, three beats (reframing, ritual, vow) +1.4, causal pressure (the motivation narrows the negotiator's method to practical steps over slogans) +1.3, closure linkage (the final vow directly repeats and fulfills the motivation) +1.5. Base 3.0 + 4.8 = 7.8. Friction: the motivation is told more than dramatized in a conflicted micro-choice where ideals and practice clash with visible cost (−0.5). The text asserts the motivation but does not show the negotiator tempted to abandon practice for spectacle. Net 7.3.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Flawed beauty is introduced in line 8 ("cracked stones, their flawed beauty brightened by fennel and thyme") and recurs at closure ("It was not perfect, but the flawed beauty steadied our legs," "the child traced the cracks between stones, finding a path forward"). Tone is coherent: modesty, patience, imperfection as strength. Early signal +0.6, two beats (initial description, closure reweight) +0.9, closure linkage (the child's tracing of cracks is the final charged image) +1.4, specificity (the exact phrase and imagery matter) +0.6. Base 3.0 + 3.5 = 6.5. Friction: flawed beauty is a label that risks cliché; the tone is asserted more than modulated under pressure (the negotiator's voice remains elevated and steady throughout, without much degradation or shift) (−0.3). The final image makes the tone work, lifting the score. Net 6.2, but the closure charge and thematic integration push it to 6.9.</comment>
