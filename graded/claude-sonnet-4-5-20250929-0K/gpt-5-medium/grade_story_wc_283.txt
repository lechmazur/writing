<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is present and voice-consistent, driven by a desire to reshape prophecy through cataloging buttons. However, motivation remains largely declarative rather than tested under pressure—the theft is stated as a vow, the method arrives "the way a moth comes," but no on-page contradiction or cost materializes until the very end when villagers arrive. The final gesture of passing the jar and opening the warehouse feels more like thematic tableau than a choice that forecloses a competing path with visible internal cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (warehouse, hourglass turner, canyon echo jar) arrive early. The piece accumulates density through the button-cataloging sequence and culminates in the warehouse opening and villagers arriving, which reconfigures the prophecy from "lock" to "loom" and the protagonist's role from enforcer to offerer. Cost is conceptual and social (confession without punishment, shared carrying) but remains oblique—no single on-page sentence makes the forfeited path or price undeniable. The closure qualifies as Conceptual Repricing but lacks the sharp cost proof required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The amber warehouse with glass ribs, hourglasses, and cliff proximity is vivid and consistent. The jar, buttons, and ledger table function as micro-setting that enables the cataloging method. The warehouse's opening at the east doors and the villagers' descent down switchbacks provide spatial choreography. However, no environmental constraint meaningfully narrows a choice or charges the final image—setting frames rather than pressures the action, keeping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reshape prophecy from lock to key) is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through the theft, the jar-opening, the button-sorting, and the ledger-matching sequence. The warehouse opening and villager arrival constitute a meaningful tightening under the Accumulative lens, but no live option is visibly foreclosed—no elder confrontation, no risk materialized, no competing path rejected on the page. The cost is conceptual (shared responsibility replaces singular enforcement) but not felt as a trade-off with visible consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme (prophecy as participatory loom vs. imposed script; silence as road vs. room) emerges organically from the button-matching method and the final image of open warehouse and loosened cliff sentences. The piece resists moralizing and allows the conceptual shift to land through image. However, the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary ("the miracle, because it asks all of us to carry") that slightly dilutes resonance. No single non-literal final image crystallizes the question without assistance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, consistent, and texturally distinct ("hourglass turner," "unearthed silence," "vowel laid beside a consonant"). Focalization remains stable, distance controlled. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that strains plausibility for the narrator's embodied moment ("braided memory of many throats," "consensus reality" implied by uniform interpretation). Under peak pressure (jar-opening, villager arrival), syntax does not compress or accelerate, maintaining the same lyric cadence throughout, which flattens the sense of escalation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmically controlled with varied sentence openings and vivid imagery. However, paraphrase loops and template cadence appear: "The hush is not empty; it is unearthed silence" / "not to trap it, but to let it move" / "not as evidence, but as invitations"—three parallelisms in close succession create a pattern that reads more like ornamentation than pressure. Figurative density is high without clear pattern-teaching or payoff tied to closure, and some metaphors ("prophecy soften into clay") lack specificity. These artifacts accumulate to −0.8 to −1.0 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The core synthesis (prophecy unscrambled via lost-button cataloging matched to canyon-echo syllables) is specific and memorable. The button-as-decision metaphor and the jar-as-lantern reprise offer fresh angles. However, the emotional arc (theft → cataloging → opening → communal acceptance) follows a template of forbidden-knowledge-redeemed-by-sharing without friction or complication, and the villagers' uniform positive response ("none of it is a prison") avoids the messy particulars that would elevate originality. The piece reads as a confident execution of a lyric fable rather than a transformation that deepens in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Hourglass turner frames the role and oath-change anchor, but the protagonist's key actions (theft, jar-opening, button-sorting, warehouse-opening) feel more like ritual steps than contested decisions. Present across beats but causally passive—events unfold through the method rather than through choices that narrow options.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Canyon echo jar appears in theft, on the ledger table, opened with breath, matched to buttons, passed hand-to-hand at closure. The jar's voice shapes the cataloging method and becomes the communal lantern. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage, but the jar enables rather than constrains—removing it would require a rewrite, yet no single choice hinges on its specific properties under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Shared wisdom" is named early ("our elders called shared wisdom") and returns at closure as "braided memory of many throats, shared wisdom returned to circulation." The concept shapes the thematic question (locked vs. circulating knowledge) but does not alter on-page tactics—no choice is constrained by competing models of wisdom-sharing. Functions as theme more than stake-driver.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Quietly inspired by the wrong thing" appears once in the opening paragraph and is not dramatized through action or cost. The inspiration leads to theft and method but no on-page friction tests the quiet or wrongness—no confrontation, no doubt scene. Label-only trait without visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Unscramble" drives the middle sequence (button-sorting, pulse-matching) and the ledger-bridge image. The action is specific and causally central, but it unfolds without setback or complication—no failed attempt, no cost to the unscrambling itself. Present in closure effect but could be replaced by similar verbs (decode, translate) with minor edits to surrounding lines.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Cataloging lost buttons" is signaled early, executed across multiple beats (sorting by material/weathering/threads, writing stories, matching to echo pulses, pinning to ledger), and supplies the mechanism for the prophecy transformation. The method shapes the middle and directly enables closure. Strong beat involvement and specificity—removing button-cataloging would break the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Amber warehouse beneath cliffs anchors location, supplies the hourglasses and jars, and provides the east doors for the opening gesture. The cliff's trembling and shadow modulate atmosphere, and the warehouse's opening is the climactic spatial choice. However, no environmental constraint (e.g., cliff instability, rival turners, resource scarcity) pressures the protagonist's decision—setting frames rather than tests.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"As the truth unravels" appears in two lines and gestures toward process rather than deadline. No ticking clock or time-based escalation shapes tactics—the unscrambling sequence proceeds without temporal cost or urgency. Time is metaphorical rather than a pressure mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"To spin a prophecy into raw possibility" is stated early and drives the theft and method choice. The desire is clear and consistent, but no on-page friction (elder opposition, fear, competing loyalty) tests the motivation under pressure. The cost arrives at closure (oath-change, communal responsibility) but is accepted without dramatized trade-off or renunciation scene.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Unearthed silence" is named, elaborated ("silence that remembers it once was thunder"), and reprised at closure ("unearthed silence that is finally allowed to be a road"). Tone is coherent and modulates from solitary theft through methodical cataloging to communal listening. The final image charges the tone-shift, but the tonal palette remains in a narrow lyric register throughout without sharp contrast or tension against the material.</comment>
