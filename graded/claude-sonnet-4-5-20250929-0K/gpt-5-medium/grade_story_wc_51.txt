<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator's commitment to weighing griefs is demonstrated through embodied micro-choices (cradling the widow memory, orienting shoulders with the weaver), but interiority often defaults to abstract labels ("recognition that burdens ask to be named with honesty") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final fear—"that love would demand my departure"—arrives with genuine cost and a visible shift in posture, but the resolution feels more like achieving balance than forfeiting a live option. The weaver remains functional but undercharacterized, a facilitator rather than a source of pressure or relationship friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (bronze grotto, post-snowmelt, narrator with lamp) arrive early and remain stable. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through the catalog of burdens, each reweighting the central task until the narrator's own fear is named and repositioned with visible cost ("the fear found a shelf where it could stand without gnawing"). Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration—the final image of carrying the ledger into thawing streets with "each weight its chosen way to rest" reconfigures the opening vow without negating prior pressure. One meaningful deepening (the personal fear) tightens options and the cost is legible on the page, though the shift could land with sharper forfeiture.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The bronze grotto constrains the scene spatially (ribs, pooled echoes, flat rock for the lamp) and the kerosene burner functions as a micro-setting anchor, its halo buying "a path of glow" that enables the weighing work. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful ("drips, starlight, and my expectant breath"), filtered through the narrator's task-oriented focus. The recurring night-cave environment charges the final transition to "thawing streets" and "shingled hush became song," reweighting interiority against exteriority at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—learning "the grammar of their heaviness" by orienting properly—is signaled early and sustained. Each burden (widow memory, soldier name, mother's dread, narrator's own fear) tests and refines method, creating accumulative pressure rather than a single sharp reversal. The narrator's agency is visible in micro-adjustments (setting pulse to north, angling shoulders, allowing the weaver to turn them), and the final burden forecloses evasion with on-page cost ("for a moment I was boundary-lessly trapped"). The escalation is coherent under the Accumulative lens, though a single decisive trade-off would sharpen the peak.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the particulars of weighing: burdens "ask to be named with honesty," require orientation rather than lessening, and each has "its chosen way to rest." The recurring motifs—shingled hush, kerosene light, fractal threads—reweight across the arc without overt statement. The final image ("each burden had its true weight, and each weight its chosen way to rest") answers the opening vow through enacted discovery rather than thesis. Subtext operates in the weaver's touch that "turned me slightly," showing care without sentimentality, and the fear's repositioning avoids platitude by anchoring it to duty and tidal balance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Voice is consistent and imagistically dense ("echoes clicked as if coins discussing the afterlife of pockets"), with a stable first-person distance that privileges metaphor and compression. Diction remains elevated throughout, which fits the ritualized task but occasionally drifts into decorative register ("boundary-lessly trapped" as unearned coinage). The narrator's perceptual signature—oriented toward gravitational metaphors and material transformation—is coherent. Purposeful compression (the catalog of burdens, the overnight span) is taught by repetition and pays off at closure, though some lines ("a ledger of bone, each line carved with tide marks") lean toward ornamentation without functional payoff.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high and mostly coherent ("the city above wore a shingled hush, roofs of silence overlapping like scales on a dreaming fish"), but several metaphors stack without clarifying action: "boundary-lessly trapped" as both attribute and sensation, "whalebone reverie" as tone descriptor. Template cadence appears in paired constructions ("I lifted it... I wrote its new weight... My hand trembled") without variation. Paraphrase loops surface ("weights would yield willingly" / "how pain stacks or slides" / "how each load wants to rest") across adjacent beats. The closure line is clean and propulsive, but figurative muddle in mid-beats and repetitive stems lower momentum slightly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—weighing metaphysical burdens in a bronze grotto with a Fractal weaver—offers symbolic richness, but the core mechanism (orienting properly, setting breath to north) remains abstract and the burdens catalog predictably (widow, soldier, mother, child, debtor, self). The "shingled hush" image is original and the final transformation from hush to song provides a non-obvious turn. The whalebone-cave-as-workshop setting distinguishes the frame, yet the emotional trajectory (learning to honor weight without lessening) follows a familiar arc of acceptance without sharp counterweight or moral complexity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The Fractal weaver is present across multiple beats (offering burdens, explaining their nature, touching the narrator's shoulder at the climax, folding threads at closure) and enables the protagonist's key turn by "turning me slightly" so the fear can be repositioned. However, the weaver does not make independent choices that create pressure; they facilitate rather than complicate. Present in setup, middle, and ending, but passive role caps higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The kerosene lamp burner anchors the scene spatially (placed on a flat rock, "wick coughing, halo a modest coin") and its light enables the weighing work by buying "a path of glow across the bronze skin of stone." It reappears at closure ("my lamp guttered, satisfied") with reweighted meaning—satisfaction mirroring the completed task. Present in setup and ending with functional middle use, but the object does not constrain a choice or impose cost beyond atmospheric presence.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Shingled hush" appears in the opening third ("the city above wore a shingled hush") and returns transformed at closure ("the city's shingled hush became song"), bracketing the arc with clear tonal reweighting. However, the concept does not shape tactics or choices during the weighing work; it functions as atmospheric framing rather than active constraint. Lyric reprise is purposeful, but lack of middle causal involvement limits the score.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Boundary-lessly trapped" is applied twice: first to the soldier name ("boundary-lessly trapped in unfinished orders") as description, then to the narrator at the climax ("for a moment I was boundary-lessly trapped, a horizon with no shore"). The second use dramatizes the peak cost and triggers the weaver's intervention, altering the narrator's stance. Present in middle and climax with visible effect, but the attribute does not enable an on-page action—it describes a state that must be resolved by external aid.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Calcify" is signaled early as the risk ("would calcify if handled cruelly, crusting over until only ache remained") and returns in the middle catalog ("Some tried to calcify again, but the weaver flicked their fractal fingers and broke the crust back into listening"). The action defines the stakes—improper handling petrifies grief—and the weaver's counter-move demonstrates method. Present in setup and middle with causal weight, though it does not directly shape the closure beat where the narrator's fear is repositioned without calcification threat.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"By orienting properly" is taught early ("by orienting properly, with patience set to the north of the heart, the weights would yield willingly"), applied in two middle beats (cradling the widow memory, angling shoulders for the soldier name), and returns at the climax ("By orienting properly, my breath squared, my knees softened"). The method is the primary tactic that enables each success and its mechanics—posture, breath, alignment—are consistent and visible. Present across all three gates and causally essential to the task's completion.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The bronze grotto anchors every beat spatially, supplies resources (the flat rock for the lamp, the pooled echoes that answer the work), and its whalebone-rib structure reinforces the tone and scale of the task. The setting constrains the narrator to this single underground space where the work can occur, and the final exit into "thawing streets" uses the grotto's enclosure to charge the opening into light and song. Present in setup, middle pressure, and closure transition with irreplaceable atmospheric and logistical function.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"After the first snowmelt" frames the opening and the closing reference to "thawing streets" confirms seasonal continuity, but the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create urgency. The work unfolds "all night" with no clock pressure or cost for delay. Present as context but inert; easily swappable for any post-winter setting without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The vow "to collect the weights of different burdens" drives every beat: the narrator seeks the grotto, requests permission, handles each burden with method, and confronts their own unadmitted fear. Friction surfaces when the final burden—fear of departure—threatens to overwhelm, and the resolution repositions it as "duty" rather than doom. The motivation is dramatized through embodied micro-choices (cradling, orienting, trembling hand) and the closure fulfills the opening vow with visible cost. Present across all gates with clear causal spine.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Whalebone reverie" is invoked explicitly ("The weaver's loom murmured, a whalebone reverie underscoring our work") and the tone—dreamy, submerged, ritualized—remains coherent through the catalog of burdens and modulates at closure when the grotto's reverie gives way to morning birds and song. The tone charges the final image by contrasting interior depth with exterior awakening. Present across the arc with consistent atmospheric control, though the phrase itself is ornamental and the tonal shift at closure is gentle rather than sharp.</comment>
