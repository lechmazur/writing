<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The locksmith's interiority is richly embodied through his craft-specific perception ("like a beat missing in a lock's tumblers under tension") and consistent motivation to harvest wonder. His micro-choices—chalking lines, machining gears, sealing jars—reveal a hierarchy of values without label-speak. The final gesture of leaving the timer under rock shows renunciation with felt cost. Minor slip: the mentor's belief ("time kept only what sound first taught it") edges toward abstract philosophizing without dramatized friction in the present.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds throughout: the locksmith's repeated acts of mapping, repairing, whispering, and harvesting create a meaningful density increase that culminates in his choice to leave the timer behind and return to town with sealed jars. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): he completes the harvest and accepts the constraint that "some keys should stay where they learn," foreclosing possession with visible cost. Orientation anchors arrive early (marble cavern, dawn, valley road repairs). One small friction: the transition from cavern work to town cellar compresses several days in a single paragraph, slightly softening the escalation curve before the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The marble cavern constrains his method throughout: reflection angles, echo returns, stalactites, and the hollow behind the veined column all shape his tactical choices. Sensory detail is POV-filtered (chalk lines on "white ribs," water drip as metronome, bats skirting ceiling) and advances action rather than cataloging. The timer mechanism functions as micro-setting, handled across multiple beats and charging the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear across the four-day sequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: to harvest echoes using the repaired timer. Pressure tightens through the escalating repair (disassembly, machining replacements, testing), installation, and whisper-harvest sequence. Agency is visible in his choice to remain until the jars hum and in his final renunciation (leaving the timer, stacking jars in the cellar for future need). The flood-damaged valley and road repairs add ambient pressure but remain secondary. One micro-turn: the cave answers "with his earlier story, softer, deeper," deepening the harvest's success before he seals it away.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the locksmith's actions: locks as "agreements between patience and pressure," echoes as a compact between duration and decay, and wonder stored "not like a miracle, but like a mechanism remembered." The final image—jars stacked in the cellar, waiting for a future need—offers a resonant answer without stating a moral. The repaired timer left under rock and the cave keeping "one echo of his laugh" layer meaning without abstract summation. No thematic echo in the final paragraph; the image does all the work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV is single and stable, with a distinct perceptual signature: "peripherally focused, noticing sidelong glints" filters all observation through craft habit. Diction remains character-particular ("chalking lines on the white ribs," "feeding filings to a jar like powder from moons"). Narrative distance is consistent; no head-hopping. Minor friction: a few elevated constructions ("some keys should stay where they learn") approach aphorism but stay anchored in his trade idiom. No dialogue present; interior voice coheres under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high with minimal scaffold. The figurative language ("spring uncoiled like a memory refusing chronology," "words would ricocade and soften, like fruit ripening in shade") is consistently voice-motivated and fits the reflective locksmith's idiom. Small deductions: a few adjacent lines restate without added pressure ("He wanted to store wonder...and unlock it when needed" immediately after the harvest-of-echoes setup). Template cadence appears in the day-by-day beats ("At morning...At noon...Evening") but reads intentional. One paraphrase loop in the final third: "not to own it, but to test the safekeeping" echoes the earlier harvest intent without clear escalation. Apply −0.4 for loops.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—locksmith as echo-harvester, timer as key to sound storage, reflection angles as mapping tool—feels specific and non-obvious. The transformation of the timer from broken heirloom to installed instrument and the final choice to leave it behind resist template resolutions. Risk-taking is measured: the accumulative structure and peripheral-focus filter heighten coherence without obscuring clarity. The premise avoids prompt-template patterns through lived craft detail (hand lathe, tumblers, brass prisms). Minor limitation: the mentor's aphorism and the flood-bruised orchards add thematic texture but remain somewhat ornamental to the central arc.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Reflective locksmith is signaled immediately and drives key turns: he chooses to map by reflection angles, repair the timer, install it in the hollow, whisper stories, and finally leave it behind. His craft habit ("peripherally focused") filters all perception and constrains his method. The closure hinges on his decision to walk out without the timer, accepting that "some keys should stay where they learn." Essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Broken timer mechanism appears in beat one (drawn from satchel, "spring uncoiled like a memory"), undergoes repair across multiple beats (disassembly, machining, testing), is installed and used to harvest echoes, and is left behind at closure to charge the final renunciation. Its evolving state alters tactics and the ending would fail without this exact object. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Harvest of echoes shapes stakes and tactics throughout: he maps the cavern for echo behavior, repairs the timer to "ration resonance," whispers stories into plates, releases the catch to retrieve stored sound, and seals jars for future use. The concept drives his method, his four-day stay, and the closure choice. Essential across beats; closure depends on the harvested jars stacked in the cellar.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Peripherally focused is signaled early ("noticing sidelong glints") and constrains his method: he catches "only what tried to escape," places brass prisms "to remind himself of angles," and lets his gaze stay indirect. It enables his discovery of the hollow and shapes his perceptual signature across beats. Cost is implicit in the slower, oblique observation method. Strong middle and setup; lighter closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Reverse-engineer is the core action: he studies the timer's wrongness, disassembles gears, machines replacements, and "paired it to the cavern so sound could be harvested." The action drives the repair sequence and enables the harvest. Swapping it for "repair" would lose the specific craft logic and the echo-pairing innovation. Essential to middle beats and harvest success; not directly invoked at closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Studying reflection angles at different times is signaled early ("he mapped the chamber by studying reflection angles") and executed across three named times (morning, noon, evening) that yield different echo behaviors. The method determines where he installs the timer and which stories he can retrieve. Mechanics matter: angles guide placement, timing guides harvest. Essential to setup and middle; shapes the harvest that closure depends on.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marble cavern pressures every choice: reflection angles constrain his mapping method, stalactites ring "like thin glass," the hollow behind the veined column becomes the installation site, water drip serves as metronome, and the cave's acoustics enable the entire harvest. The setting is not postcard but engine: it supplies the resource (echo behavior) and the constraint (specific angles and times). Removing the cavern would collapse the story. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Across the lull of a wounded season is signaled in the opening (floods, road repairs, birds testing voices) and subtly pressures his timing: he comes "during repairs" and remains "until the road crews packed mud into ruts." The season's wound adds ambient urgency and thematic texture. Middle development is light; the four-day span is tracked but not tightened into a clock. The timeframe shapes atmosphere and permits his stay but does not drive a decisive turn. Functional and thematic, not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>To store wonder in the cellar of reason, for later is stated early and dramatized through his entire sequence: he harvests echoes, labels jars, seals them, and carries them to his cellar "away from sunlight and haste" for a future need ("some late year, he would need courage"). The motivation drives his four-day effort and the final image of stacked jars waiting. Friction between craft (reason/mechanism) and wonder is visible in his choice to leave the timer behind. Essential across beats and closure.</comment>
