<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The archivist's interior voice is distinct and their motivation ("to mentor resilience quietly") drives micro-choices across multiple beats—pouring tea, annotating margins, pacing backwards under stress. Embodied emotion appears in "the heat in my chest," and the child's arc from silence to reading aloud earns the ending's stance crystallization. Minor deduction: the council members remain functional pressure without individuated interiority, and some figurative language ("bruise remembering light") risks obscuring embodied reaction in peak beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the council grants a "stay stamped with reluctant faith," the child hears themselves "returning, not suddenly brave, but mentored into resilience," and the final line reweights "keeping" versus "hoarding" with conceptual cost legible on the page. Causal lens holds: tea-leaf geometry → council unsettlement → reversal of decree. Orientation anchors (archivist, library, dusk) arrive early. One meaningful tightening occurs when the council's measuring-tape audit confronts the shadow corridor and the pattern of reversible exile crystallizes into policy reversal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The library's stacks, floorboards, courtyard window, and cracked mirrors constrain the archivist's backwards pacing and frame the council's arrival. The bottled shadow spills onto the floor to form a corridor—micro-setting charges the climax. Sensory detail is selective: "steam rising like faint script," "chipped porcelain that have learned to hold." Spatial choreography remains clear across moves. Does not quite reach 8+ because environment enables rather than decisively narrows options at closure; the trial could occur without the shadow corridor's literal presence if argument alone sufficed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—proving reversible exile is not hoarding—is signaled early and tested when the council demands proof. Escalation: letter fails → trial prepared → tea ceremony → shadow corridor demonstration → council sees "the same steps unwalked, a return path" and grants stay. Agency rests with the archivist's choices (unstopper bottle, serve tea, annotate margins), and the child's reading aloud deepens pressure. Visible cost: "trembling," backwards pacing rehearsing "retreat to defend presence," and the corked portion of dusk saved for the child. Enters high 7s because the tightening is legible and cost is felt, though the council's reversal hinges partly on a shown vision rather than a trade-off the archivist must forfeit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme—exile, memory, and care as retention versus hoarding—emerges through tea-leaf geometry, annotated margins, and the bottled afternoon shadow without thesis statement. "Combative tenderness" is dramatized in pouring tea with "questions sharp enough to hold gently," and the council leader's question ("what holds these recipes together") receives an embodied answer. The final image ("keeping is not hoarding when what is kept is the path to rejoining") reweights the premise through specific prior events: war, river, love, recipes. No thematic echo penalty; the story trusts particulars to carry meaning. Reaches 8+ because the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with conceptual cost (the library's survival now depends on "reluctant faith").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Single-POV first-person with stable focalization and a distinct perceptual signature: "dust instructs light to fold," "afternoon shadow caught in glass," "bruise remembering light." Diction is purposefully elevated and lyric, consistent with an archivist's idiom. Dialogue is minimal; the child and council leader each speak once, advancing plot without voice convergence. Compression and elision are pattern-taught ("reversible because loss should not be a one-way gate; exile because some stories need distance"). Minor deduction: some metaphors risk opacity under pressure ("ellipses that point to where sorrow refuses to be a wall"), and a few filter verbs ("I watch their mouth learn") slightly dull immediacy in a peak beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift across beats. Information density is high: most lines do multiple jobs ("War took a surname, a river swallowed a neighborhood, love burned the tongue"). No paraphrase loops or synonym churn detected. Minor issues: occasional stacked metaphors ("corridor like a bruise remembering light," "dust instructs light to fold") create figurative density in high-pressure beats without clear payoff, risking slight opacity. The phrase "combative tenderness laid bare like a ledger open to audit" mixes vehicles (tenderness/ledger/audit) in the climax, triggering a small coherence deduction. No template cadence or filter-verb stacks. Solid mid-7s with figurative muddle the only drag.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of archivist-as-guardian, reversible exile, and tea-leaf divination feels specific and non-obvious. The backwards-walking trait and bottled shadow transform familiar "librarian saves knowledge" templates through concrete sensory choices. The council trial avoids courtroom cliché by staging it as a tea ceremony where perception shifts through reflection in cracked mirrors. Risk-taking in lyric compression and metaphor density heightens stakes without obscuring the causal spine. The ending—granting a "stay stamped with reluctant faith"—offers an earned, non-tidy closure that resists simplistic victory. Slight deduction: the "forgotten library under threat" frame echoes widely used templates; transformation through specificity (tea leaves, shadow bottles) restores most range.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The shard-mirror archivist appears in the opening, drives all major beats (annotating margins, pouring tea, unstoppering the bottle, pacing backwards, serving tea again), and their choices at closure (corking the corridor, shelving the kettle, sweeping nothing away) crystallize the library's survival and the child's mentored resilience. Causal pressure is high; the archivist's decisions enable the council's reversal. Visible cost: trembling, backwards retreat, and emotional exposure ("combative tenderness laid bare"). Introduced early, active across three distinct beats, and indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The afternoon shadow caught in glass is introduced early (courtyard window, brought by the child), unstoppered at dusk to spill onto the floor and form a corridor, used to demonstrate reversible exile to the council, then corked again to save "a portion of dusk" for the child. It appears in at least three beats, directly enables the council's shift ("sees itself walking away... then sees again the same steps unwalked"), and charges the closure image. Removing it would break the demonstration's logic. High irreplaceability and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Reversible exile is named in the first paragraph, defines the archivist's practice ("some stories need distance before they can return"), becomes the council's challenge ("demand proof that exile can be returned"), and is demonstrated through the shadow corridor ("a return path") and the child's arc (hearing themselves "returning"). It shapes the dominant stake and the ending's conceptual repricing ("keeping is not hoarding when what is kept is the path to rejoining"). Causal pressure is strong; the concept narrows the council's options and charges the resolution. Visible cost: the library's survival depends on proving the concept.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The backwards-walking trait is introduced early ("I walk backwards when nervous and the floorboards test every retreat") and returns in the trial beat ("I pace the aisles in reverse, because my body walks backwards when nervous, rehearsing retreat to defend presence"). It enables a tactic (drawing the shadow corridor along to underline dates and margins) and embodies cost (trembling, defensive posture). Two distinct beats; middle development and closure participation are present. Does not quite reach 7.0 because the tactic of underlining margins could occur through forward pacing with minor edits; the trait adds texture but is not indispensable to the plot turn.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Annotate" appears in multiple beats: "annotate the margins of their silence with questions," "margins where I annotate what people salvaged when they left," and the backwards pacing that draws the shadow corridor "to underline dates, names, and margins." The action defines the archivist's method, enables the council's understanding ("recipes of remaining human"), and charges the final shelving of the ledger. Causal pressure is strong; annotation is how the archivist practices reversible exile. Visible cost: the labor of "questions sharp enough to hold gently." High beat involvement and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Tea-leaf geometry is introduced early ("I work by analyzing the geometry of tea leaves, steam rising like faint script"), becomes the archivist's method during the trial ("I serve tea and turn the cups so the leaves find their edges," "the pattern speaks in angles and drift"), and enables the council's shift ("the leaves insist on unsolved triangles that lean toward home"). The method appears in at least three beats, constrains tactics (pouring, waiting, reading), and directly shapes the council's decision. Removing it would break the trial's logic. High causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The forgotten library frames all action, supplies the stacks the archivist walks through, the floorboards that test retreat, the window where the shadow waits, the tables and kettle for the trial, and the ledger that is shelved at closure. It provides the contested resource (the library's survival is the dominant stake) and the spatial choreography for all moves. The setting constrains the archivist's choices (defending the library from closure) and charges the final image ("the forgotten library is still, awaiting the next knock"). High beat involvement and closure linkage; indispensable to stakes.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The timeframe ("at the hush as an empty playground swing drifts in the breeze") anchors the opening and returns in the ending ("The swing outside slows to listening"). "Dusk" marks the child's return and the unstoppering of the bottle. The hush and swing create atmosphere and frame the child's arc (metronome for missing parents → hearing themselves returning). Two touches; lyric reprise reweights the child's stake. Does not quite reach 6.5 because the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create a live clock; the trial could occur at any hour without altering tactics. Functional but not indispensable to escalation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to mentor resilience quietly" is stated early, dramatized through pouring tea, annotating margins, and the archivist's refusal to surrender the library ("so that courage grows without noticing itself"). The trial tests the motivation: the archivist must prove reversible exile to mentor the child and preserve the library. The child's final moment ("mentored into resilience without fanfare") realizes the motivation on the page. Causal pressure is strong; the motivation shapes all tactics. Visible cost: trembling, emotional exposure, and the library's survival now dependent on "reluctant faith." Three beats; closure participation is clear.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Combative tenderness" is named as the mentor's teaching, dramatized in "questions sharp enough to hold gently," the tea ceremony that confronts the council without punching, and the archivist's stance "laid bare like a ledger open to audit." The tone modulates with pressure (from quiet annotation to trembling defense to the council's unsettlement) and charges the final image (sweeping nothing away, awaiting the next knock). Coherent through turns; the tone is the archivist's method and the story's emotional signature. High specificity and closure linkage.</comment>
