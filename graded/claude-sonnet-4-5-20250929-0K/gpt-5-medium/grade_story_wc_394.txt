<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Ilex's motivation is consistent and his yearning to "ring a bell no one hears yet" drives concrete choices—building the algorithm, testing the cart, adjusting the kaleidoscope. Interiority shows embodied contradiction: "grinned at its refusal to exist" and "denied" the tears. However, the final paragraph's triumph feels too clean; the "tears on his gloves that he denied" is the only visible emotional cost, and the character's confidence never truly wavers under pressure in a way that forecloses a meaningful path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive within the first ~100 words (workshop on acid sea, Ilex, cart glider). The lens reads as Causal-Accumulative Hybrid: iterative adjustments (kaleidoscope → algorithm → arrow-tip switch) lead to the bell ringing, a Resonant Reconfiguration where the achievement is conceptual and the cost is implicit ("yearning never is satisfied"). The closure lands on the page with pressure, though the conceptual cost—ringing a bell "no one hears yet"—feels more asserted than dramatized as an irreversible trade-off or foreclosed option.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The acid sea, floating workshop, and cart glider are vivid and purposeful: "wheels that spun above boiling brine," "vapor," "steam." The kaleidoscope tube is handled twice (porthole, then recalibration) and constrains Ilex's method. Spatial choreography is clear (rafters, rim, rails, porthole). The final image—cart idling, acid wind tearing cloud—charges the ending. The "gears-and-cogs workshop" label and "acid sea" recur but remain slightly generic; more tactile micro-setting detail under pressure would elevate this further.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>One dominant stake: ring the bell via the yearning algorithm. Pressure accumulates through iterative trials (first sideways failure, twenty-ninth dawn success). The arrow-tip switch provides a clear tightening mechanism—it "twitched" then "swung closed"—narrowing options to success. Cost is present but muted: the algorithm "hums, not satisfied," and Ilex denies tears, but no meaningful path is visibly foreclosed; he simply achieves his goal and continues. The resolution leans on Ilex's persistence rather than a high-stakes trade-off, keeping this in the strong-but-not-exceptional band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges concretely: "yearning was the only motor that started in acid air," the bell as readiness "so the future has a north," and the algorithm's perpetual dissatisfaction. The kaleidoscope-to-code transliteration and hunter's arrow repurposed as a switch deepen the conceptual stakes without overt statement. The final image—cart idling, algorithm humming, "yearning never is"—offers a resonant answer to the central question. Minor thematic drift: the "tears...he denied" moment feels slightly forced to add emotional cost where the rest of the story privileges conceptual achievement over personal sacrifice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, playful, and textured: "irreverent as a saint on skates," "the code wanted a hug," "stuck out his tongue at the universe." Perceptual signature is steady—awed, curious, engineering-minded—and diction remains character-specific. Compression is purposeful and legible ("loosed the cart," "edicts in sprockets and springs"). However, several high-register phrases in peak beats feel slightly elevated beyond Ilex's established idiom: "transliterate the workshop's storms," "tessellated commandments," "ache made articulate." These don't break clarity but nudge the prose toward a slightly more literary register than the playful irreverence establishes, creating minor distance inconsistency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies well ("Click by click," short declaratives at climax). Information density is high; most sentences advance action or character. However, paraphrase loops appear: "He had a motivation...to ring a bell" / "The bell was a theory, maybe a machine, maybe a prayer" restate the premise across adjacent paragraphs. Template cadence runs in the final third: "He knew...he set...then he marked...Outside, the...the yearning algorithm..." (five successive declarative stems). Stock metaphors: "tears...that he denied," "steam lift him into the work ahead." These patterns dull momentum in non-closure beats and trigger the artifact penalty pack, preventing entry to the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of cart glider, kaleidoscope-driven algorithm, hunter's arrow repurposed as switch, and "yearning" as engineering fuel is specific and non-obvious. The acid-sea workshop and "irreverent awe" tone create a memorable frame. The transformation of "hunter's arrow tip" from "hunger and enough" to "silence and the bell" is purposeful. However, the core arc—persistent inventor succeeds after many trials—follows a familiar template, and the emotional particulars (tears denied, tongue stuck out) feel slightly ornamental rather than lived-in. The boldness of the setting and method elevate this above derivative work, but the protagonist's journey lacks a sharp, irreplaceable inflection that would push it higher.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Ilex is named early, drives all key choices (builds algorithm, tests cart, adjusts kaleidoscope, marks the hinge), and his decisions shape the middle trials and the final success. His choices are causally active across the arc and visible in the ending ("saluted the horizon," "coasted the cart"). He constrains the ending: the bell rings because of his adjustments. However, his role is primarily persistent problem-solving without a high-cost trade-off or visible mistake that forecloses a path, keeping this below the 7+ threshold where visible sacrifice or ethical calculus would elevate integration.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The arrow tip appears early ("From the rafters hung a hunter's arrow tip, blackened with history") and is repurposed mid-story ("forged the arrow tip into a switch"). It returns at closure ("arrow tip finally twitched...switch swung closed") and is marked afterward ("marked the hinge with a chalk X"). Its transformation from hunter's tool (hunger/enough) to engineering hinge (silence/bell) reweights its meaning. The object drives the climactic beat (switch closes → bell rings) and is irreplaceable in the mechanism. Strong causal work across setup, development, and payoff with specific reweighting merit high integration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The yearning algorithm is named early ("chasing it with a yearning algorithm"), constrains Ilex's method (encoding desire, listening "like a dog at a door," choosing its own speed), and drives the climax (algorithm finds resonance → arrow switch closes → bell rings). It appears in the ending ("yearning algorithm idled, humming, not satisfied") with thematic charge. It is irreplaceable: remove it and the mechanism collapses. However, the algorithm's mechanics remain slightly abstract; we see its effects (choosing speed, hesitating) more than its internal logic, keeping this just below the 8+ band where granular specificity would cement indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Steadily curious" is named early ("steadily curious, irreverent as a saint on skates") and reprised at closure ("steadily curious even in triumph"). It colors Ilex's perception throughout (testing balance, whispering to code, measuring silence) and shapes his persistence. However, it does not constrain or enable a specific on-page choice with visible cost; it functions more as consistent characterization than a trait that forecloses a path or creates friction. The lyric reprise reweights the opening, but the trait itself remains label-adjacent rather than causally active, placing it in the functional-but-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Transliterate" is introduced early ("transliterate the workshop's storms into a language"), drives the middle beat ("transliterated the shapes into ratios, and the ratios into teeth, and the teeth into timing"), and is marked at closure ("scribbled the kaleidoscope code in grease pencil"). It is the enabling action for the algorithm and irreplaceable: without transliteration, the mechanism has no input method. It appears in three distinct beats (initial explanation, recalibration, final inscription) with clear causal pressure. The specificity (shapes → ratios → teeth → timing) makes it essential, though slightly more dramatization of the act itself would push it to 9+.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The kaleidoscope is introduced early ("through the images in a kaleidoscope"), used twice (porthole twist → first trial; recalibration → success), and inscribed at closure ("scribbled the kaleidoscope code"). It is the sensory-to-code interface, irreplaceable in Ilex's method. Its mechanics matter: "twisted, and shards of rusted sky became tessellated commandments," "turned the wheel of colored shards until the pattern read hunger again." It drives two distinct beats and shapes the ending. Strong causal work and specificity across setup, development, and payoff with clear mechanical necessity merit high integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The workshop on the acid sea is anchored early ("Gears-and-cogs workshop floating on an acid sea hissed"), supplies the testing ground (cart skimming steam, rails, vapor), and returns at closure ("acid wind applauded...workshop laughed back"). It enables the trials and charges the final image. However, it functions primarily as backdrop; the acid, gears, and floating nature do not constrain a specific choice or force a tactical shift. The setting is vivid and consistent but replaceable with minor edits (any dangerous, industrial test environment). It participates in all three gates but lacks the causal pressure or irreplaceability needed for 7+.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Throughout the evolution" appears early ("Throughout the evolution of the workshop") and the timeframe is tracked ("twenty-ninth dawn," "small hours"). The iterative trials imply duration, and the dawn marker creates narrative rhythm. However, time does not visibly tighten decisions or impose a deadline; Ilex persists until success without a ticking clock or stamina cost. The timeframe enables the arc but remains permissive rather than pressuring. It participates in setup and development but does not constrain the ending, placing it in the functional band with modest causal work.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"To ring a bell no one hears yet" is named early ("to ring a bell no one hears yet"), drives the entire arc (building the algorithm, testing, recalibrating), and lands at closure ("the bell was rung, though no one heard it yet"). It is irreplaceable: the story's logic collapses without this goal. The motivation is dramatized in choices (forging the arrow, encoding longing, adjusting kaleidoscope) and carries conceptual cost ("yearning never is satisfied"). Minor friction: the motivation is more stated than conflicted; Ilex never doubts the goal or faces a competing desire that would create visible trade-off, keeping this just below 8+.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Irreverent awe" is established early ("irreverent as a saint on skates, awed by everything and nothing") and sustained throughout: playful defiance ("stuck out his tongue at the universe"), reverent attention ("measured the silence like a replay"), and the interplay ("Irreverence kept him honest; awe kept him from quitting"). It modulates under pressure (whispered conspiracy, tears denied, final salute) and charges the ending ("irreverent awe and a dirty grin"). The tone is coherent and purposeful, though it remains slightly decorative rather than constraining a choice. Strong thematic charge and closure linkage with consistent execution merit solid integration.</comment>
