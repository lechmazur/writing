<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is vivid and embodied through specificity ("thorned halo," "numbers lived in my throat"), and micro-choices under pressure are legible (teaching the boy about the nut, coaxing doorways from absence). Internal contradiction operates subtly—dutiful yet resentful—and the final choice to stay after guiding them out carries visible cost ("the orchard loosened its hold, just a little"). One small slip: the woman and boy remain functional vessels rather than individuated presences, though this fits the short scope and single-POV lens.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Orientation anchors clearly by line 9 (caretaker, orchard, cliff). The piece teaches its lyric compression early and sustains it; the closure unit is Earned Stasis—the narrator returns to the rows after obeying the bargain, foreclosing escape with felt cost ("the orchard loosened its hold, just a little"). The cost is legible on the page in the final image of returning to trace absent streets and await the next pair of boots. One meaningful deepening occurs when the boy's nut unlocks the wall, reweighting the orchard's geometry and allowing passage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The cliffside labyrinth, mechanical birds, and orchard geometry constrain every choice: "we must be out before the night frost forms" creates spatial and temporal pressure, the lichen map guides navigation, and the split trunk serves as a clock. The boy's nut interacts causally with the wall crack, and the narrator's non-touching movement is a learned constraint. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("apples study gravity and peaches rehearse seduction"). The final image of the cliffs holding their breath charges the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: guide the travelers out before frost. Pressure coheres through the ticking clock (shadow reaching the split trunk, horn note announcing patrol change, north wind tasting frost) and escalates when the boy's nut unlocks the passage, narrowing the window. The narrator's agency is constrained endurance—obeying the orchard's bargain forecloses any path to freedom. The cost is visible: another pair of boots will test the path, and the cycle renews. One tightening suffices for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: duty as binding contract, memory as architecture, and the impossible choice between flight and obligation. The forgotten blueprint motif recurs with reweighted meaning—first the lost city plans, then the lichen map, finally the narrator tracing absent streets in the closing image. The ending offers a resonant non-literal answer: "graceless and beautiful, and the cliffs hold their breath" reconfigures the opening metaphor without moralizing. No thematic echo or prompt-label intrusion; the final image earns its conceptual repricing through accumulated specificity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout: "apples turned inside out and showed their wooden bones," "voice sounded offhandedly exact, as if numbers lived in my throat," "looked like someone praying and drowning at once." Psychic distance and diction remain stable under pressure; the elevated register ("assemble ourselves into a single set of traces") is voice-motivated and consistent. Purposeful compression and patterned syntax are taught early and sustained. No head-hopping; focalization is clean. Dialogue is sparse but goal-driven and carries subtext ("Only if you teach it the right shapes").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "He placed it on his tongue and let it learn our breathing" advances plot, characterization, and world logic). Rhythm varies purposefully, and opening/closing lines charge the frame. Minor deductions: a few near-paraphrase pairs ("I moved my hands through the air, leaving impressions without touching" echoes an earlier construction without added pressure) and two runs of similar sentence openings in the middle third ("We slipped," "We stepped," "We waited") create brief template cadence. No loops touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of cursed orchard, mechanical patrol birds, forgotten city blueprint, and the non-touching navigation method feels specific and non-obvious; no single element is swappable. The "offhandedly exact" voice and the boy's seed-as-key moment transform familiar tropes through grounded particulars. The final image—tracing absent streets with hands, the orchard loosening "just a little"—offers a fresh angle on cyclical obligation. Risk-taking in the lyric compression and the non-causal, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Slight deduction for the mechanical birds remaining ornamental after the opening.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Present from line 3, drives the guiding action throughout, and the final decision to return to the rows is causally tied to the bargain. The caretaker role constrains every tactic and shapes the closure unit (Earned Stasis). Cost is visible: the orchard loosens "just a little," and the cycle renews.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Introduced at midpoint, the nut appears in three beats: boy shows it, places it on tongue, presses it to the wall crack where it unlocks passage. The final beat is causal—the nut enables escape—and the boy's promise to plant it safely charges the parting. Setup is late (−0.3), but causal pressure and closure linkage elevate the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Signaled early ("There was a blueprint to the place once"), the concept recurs as the lichen map and the narrator's embodied navigation ("I carry it in my body the way a compass carries north"). It constrains tactics (tracing absent streets, coaxing doorways from absence) and the final image directly invokes it. Causal pressure is moderate; the blueprint is more atmospheric scaffold than pivot.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Present in one key beat ("My voice sounded offhandedly exact, as if numbers lived in my throat") and subtly reflected in the narrator's calm instruction under pressure. The trait enables clear guidance but does not constrain a choice with visible cost. Lyric reprise in "offhandedly exact" at line 13 reweights tone but lacks causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The action of assembling (selves into traces, doorways from absence, the blueprint from breaths) recurs across four beats and drives the escape. The narrator "assembles" the group into a single set of traces to evade the orchard, then coaxes the passage, and finally returns to trace streets. The concept shapes tactics and charges the closure image. Specificity and irreplaceability are high.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Introduced early ("I began to walk without touching the ground, leaving impressions without touching anything at all"), the method is taught as a trick to avoid waking curses, recurs when the narrator moves hands through air to coax doorways, and frames the final act of tracing streets. It constrains the guiding action and charges the closure. Causal pressure is moderate; the cost is implicit.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The cliffside labyrinth and mechanical birds are present from the opening and constrain every choice: the shifting geometry forces reliance on the lichen map, the birds mark patrol arcs and trigger urgency, the trench and pear limbs impede passage, and the cliff face serves as the final threshold. The setting is indispensable to escalation and closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Introduced in line 12, the frost deadline tightens decisions across multiple beats: shadow of the cliff as clock, horn note announcing patrol change, north wind tasting frost, and the narrator's final warning. The timeframe drives urgency and shapes the escape sequence. Early signal and closure linkage are strong; cost is implicit in the renewed cycle.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The motivation is dramatized in the opening ("My task was not to prune, nor harvest, but to guide lost travelers") and drives every beat: the narrator instructs, navigates, and coaxes passage under the orchard's bargain. Friction is visible—the duty is a "thorned halo" and the orchard's roots tighten each season. The final return enacts the cost of obeying. Setup, causal pressure, and closure linkage are all strong.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Tone is signaled early ("thorned halo," "shifting geometry") and sustained through lyric compression, elevated diction, and contradictory images ("praying and drowning at once," "apples study gravity"). The phrase "graceless beauty" appears twice—once mid-story when the woman names the narrator's movement, once in the final line to charge the closure image. Coherence under pressure and closure charge are both strong.</comment>
