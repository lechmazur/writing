<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The chronicle keeper's interiority is dominated by lyric description rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. We see declaration of an oath ("sworn to witness change without judgment") and sensory immersion, but no on-page moment where competing desires force a difficult micro-choice with visible cost. The narrator remains observational throughout; the final lines restate the passive stance without dramatizing a path foreclosed. Embodied emotion is present in atmospheric texture but never tests the keeper's stated neutrality against a specific pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of image accumulation and cadence modulation by the second paragraph. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the keeper renews the oath to witness without gripping, tethered by regenerative silence. Cost is conceptual—continuation of crumbling peace, isolation, floating reality—but the final image ("renews me as it repairs the fragile world") makes the price of endurance legible. Orientation anchors (who, where) arrive early enough. One meaningful deepening occurs when the flood forces retreat and the obsidian room "mends" the keeper, shifting the stakes from passive observation to active partnership with silence. The lens holds, but causality is thin; events accumulate rather than narrowing options in a causal chain.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setting is vivid, purposeful, and charged: moss-veined aisles, dripping stone, the obsidian refuge, and the origami swan all function as micro-settings that constrain movement and choice. The swan's folds guide navigation ("counted seven pleats, and the wall sighed"), and the obsidian room provides shelter with regenerative properties that enable the keeper's survival. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the keeper's priorities (ink fermentation, stalactite ticks, gravel cadence). The catacombs' physicality shapes the keeper's tactics during the flood, and the final image of the swan "softened by oil from countless consultations" charges closure. Environment actively participates in pressure and resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: preservation of the chronicles and the keeper's witnessing role under environmental threat (rising river, decay). One tightening occurs when the flood forces the keeper to burrow through a bricked niche, narrowing options and introducing the obsidian refuge as a regenerative resource. Agency is present but limited to endurance and spatial navigation rather than decision that forecloses competing paths. The keeper's choices are reactive (retreat, wait, record) rather than transformative. Cost is conceptual—continued isolation, acceptance of crumbling peace—but not viscerally tested against a competing desire on the page. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens but does not escalate dramatically; the flood complicates, then recedes without forcing a trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme—witnessing without judgment, regenerative patience, the interplay of decay and renewal—emerges organically from image and action rather than statement. The mushroom alphabet rearrangement and the keeper's non-protest embody the theme without preaching. The final image ("the regenerative silence renews me as it repairs the fragile world") offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how to survive change without control. Subtext operates in the swan's creases, the obsidian room's "hotter than any kiln" patience, and the keeper's loosened grip on reality. Minor thematic echo: "I did not protest; I recorded the new order" comes close to articulating the thesis, but it remains grounded in specific event. No overt moralizing in the final beat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single-POV with a distinct perceptual signature: the keeper notices through the lens of archival duty and ecological attention ("roots argue with ladders," "letters crawl, then burrow"). Diction is controlled, lyric, and voice-particular with consistent metaphorical density. Psychic distance remains stable; no head-hopping. Purposeful compression and patterned syntax ("stone drips, ink ferments," "Sometimes the swan unfurls...Sometimes it tightens") teach the reader a cadence that supports the Accumulative lens. Register is consistent—archival, patient, slightly formal—without unmotivated shifts. Free indirect style is clean. Minor density concern: figurative language appears in most sentences, but the pattern is taught early and voice-motivated, so no overwriting penalty applies. No dialogue to judge.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high but mostly coherent and voice-motivated; however, several lines approach metaphor muddle ("silence is not absence but compost," "change whispers, and I call every whisper a tide"). Template cadence appears in the "Sometimes...Sometimes" parallel structure (lines 16–17), but it reads as purposeful rhythm rather than artifact. A few paraphrase loops: "I grip reality loosely" (line 6) echoes in "I do not grip decisions anymore" (line 37), and "crumbling peace" recurs without added pressure (lines 3, 19). Information density is moderate; some lines do double duty (the swan as map and metaphor), but others linger in description without advancing situation. Propulsion is steady but not urgent; the prose breathes rather than accelerates. No grammar errors or clarity breaks. Artifact deduction: −0.4 for paraphrase loop and template stems that dull momentum in non-closure beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—archive keeper in decaying catacombs guided by origami swan—offers a fresh synthesis of fantastical and archival elements. Specific details (obsidian refuge, mushroom alphabet, stalactite metronomes) are particular and non-generic. The emotional arc, however, is static; the keeper begins and ends in the same witnessing stance without transformation, which limits ingenuity. The flood-and-retreat sequence is functional but does not surprise; the keeper's response is competent endurance rather than a choice that redefines the premise. The swan and obsidian room are inventive anchors, and the regenerative silence concept is developed beyond a label. Risk-taking is moderate: the lyric mode and Accumulative lens are unconventional but safely executed without bold stakes or moral calculus. No close echoes of famous work detected. Transformation test: the emotional truth is muted by the keeper's unchanging posture.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Chronicle keeper is present throughout as focalizer and enactor of the witnessing oath. The keeper makes spatial choices (retreat to the obsidian room, burrowing through the niche, waiting out the flood) but these are reactive rather than transformative. No on-page moment where the keeper's decision alters the dominant stake or forecloses a competing path with visible cost. The keeper observes, records, and endures but does not pivot. Present in closure ("I witness, and the regenerative silence renews me") but the role is restatement rather than evolution. Functional but limited agency; two gates (setup, closure mention) but weak development.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Obsidian refuge is introduced early (line 8), used functionally in the flood sequence (lines 26–28: "the wall sighed into a tunnel...leading to the obsidian room"), and referenced at closure in the sense that the regenerative silence originates there and the keeper returns to witnessing afterward. It shapes one key turn (the flood escape) and provides a resource that enables survival. The refuge's properties (polished cellar of night, regenerative silence, books mending like skin) are specific and irreplaceable. However, it does not constrain a choice with cost or return with reweighted meaning in the final image; the swan remains the more charged object at closure. Three gates present; causal pressure in one major beat. Strong middle integration; closure linkage is indirect.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Regenerative silence is introduced early (line 10: "regenerative silence"), developed in the obsidian room sequence (lines 28–30: "silence so complete it became glue"), and named again at closure (line 40: "regenerative silence renews me"). It functions as both setting property and thematic lens. It enables the keeper's survival and renewal, shaping the stakes (preservation through patience rather than action). However, it does not constrain a tactical choice with visible cost on the page; the keeper never struggles against or tests the silence. Closure linkage is strong (final line), but the concept remains more thematic than causal. Three gates; one key turn (the flood retreat where silence "repairs"); closure participation via final image. Mid-band: shapes stakes but not tactics under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Grips reality loosely is signaled early (line 6: "I grip reality loosely, like wet paper rescued from rain") and echoed at closure (line 37: "I do not grip decisions anymore, only the pen"). It characterizes the keeper's stance and appears in two beats. However, it does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with cost; it remains a metaphorical descriptor rather than a trait that forces a trade-off. The keeper's loose grip allows endurance of ambiguity (letters crawling, reality floating) but does not create friction or narrow options in a dramatized moment. Two gates (setup, closure echo); no middle development beat where the trait alters tactics. Lyric reprise without causal pressure. Caps at ~4.6 for missing middle gate; minor lift for closure echo.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Burrow is signaled (line 13: "the swan taught me the pathways"), used decisively in the flood sequence (line 25: "I pressed my shoulder to mortar...the wall sighed into a tunnel"), and enables the major turn (escape to the obsidian refuge). The action is specific, irreplaceable (the keeper must physically breach the bricked niche), and tied to cost (effort, risk, reliance on the swan's guidance). It shapes one key beat and is essential to the keeper's survival. Present in three gates (setup via swan's instruction, development in the flood beat, indirect closure participation as the act that preserves the keeper). Strong causal pressure; the burrowing redefines options from passive waiting to active escape. High integration; one major turn depends on this action.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Origami swan is introduced early (line 13), used in multiple beats (lines 13–17: teaching pathways; line 24: advising the burrow; line 33: advising another fold; line 35: set back on its saucer), and present at closure (lines 36–37: "well-worn...I trust its creases" and implicitly in the final witnessing act it enables). The swan's mechanics matter: its folds function as map and decision aid, constraining the keeper's navigation choices. It enables the burrowing action and shapes the keeper's survival tactics. Specificity is high (creases as coordinates, edges softened by oil). The swan is indispensable to the flood escape and charged at closure as the keeper's most trusted tool. Four beats; three gates; strong causal pressure and closure linkage. Essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Overgrown library in catacombs is established early (lines 2–3) and provides the physical environment throughout. It supplies resources (archives, the obsidian refuge accessed via a bricked niche, the swan) and pressures (decay, flooding river). The setting constrains movement (collapsed corridors, silted histories) and the keeper's choices (retreat, recording). The catacombs' physicality enables the burrowing escape and houses the regenerative silence. However, the setting does not force a trade-off or charge the final image directly; the swan and silence are more decisive. Three gates; strong setup and development; the library frames all action but does not appear in the closure beat as a reweighted element. Essential to the story's logic but not indispensable to the final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Timeframe "across the drift of untold seasons" (line 5) is declared early and reinforced (line 36: "more seasons than calendars dare count"). However, the passage of time does not tighten decisions or alter tactics on the page; the keeper's endurance is timeless rather than time-bound. The flood is seasonal ("last winter," line 24) but does not impose a countdown. Time functions as atmospheric texture rather than constraint. The vague, vast timeframe is thematically consistent with the keeper's patient witnessing but does not create urgency or narrow options. Two gates (setup, closure echo via the swan's age); no middle development where time pressure alters a choice. Swappable with "long ages" or "eons" without structural impact. Functional but replaceable; static mood rather than escalating constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Motivation to witness without judgment is stated early (line 4: "sworn to witness change without judgment, no gavel, no verdict, only seeing") and reaffirmed at closure (lines 18, 40: "I keep my oath," "Whatever arrives, I witness"). It frames the keeper's stance and is consistent across beats. However, it is never dramatized as conflicted; the keeper does not face a moment where judgment tempts or witnessing costs something personal on the page. The mushroom alphabet beat (lines 22–23: "I did not protest; I recorded") enacts the motivation but without friction or visible sacrifice. Two gates (setup, closure restatement); no middle beat where the desire conflicts with another want or fear. Told and consistent but not tested under pressure. Mid-band: shapes stance but lacks friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Crumbling peace is signaled early (line 3) and modulates through the flood sequence (lines 19–20: "peace that shelters me crumbles even as it shelters"). Tone is coherent—elegiac, patient, textured with decay and patience—and adjusts with pressure (the flood brings urgency; the obsidian room restores calm). The final image ("regenerative silence renews me as it repairs the fragile world") sustains the tone and charges it with the cost of ongoing dissolution. Tone does not shift dramatically but deepens through accumulation. Three gates (setup, development during flood, closure charge); the crumbling quality is essential to the story's emotional texture and thematic resonance. Strong lyric reprise; tone inseparable from the keeper's endurance and the world's decay. Tonal coherence across beats elevates; lack of stark modulation slightly limits range.</comment>
