<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's contradictory impulses—arriving to die yet learning to listen for life—are embodied through concrete micro-choices: using the parasol tip to sound ice, asking for delays, moving before panic. Interior texture is specific ("my mind wakes now like a gull on a shifting rail") and emotion is contradictory without therapy-speak. The transformation from suicidal tourist to edge-listener is earned through on-page events (the child rescue, Erland's rope wisdom) with visible cost (the appointment remains, unfilled). Minor deduction: some interiority late in the piece drifts toward abstract philosophizing ("vanishing teaches little unless you learn its preface first") that edges close to diagnostic distance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orientation is immediate (drift-ice marina, post-change state, volunteer role). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered listening imagery, the parasol tip as sounding tool, rope memory, the child rescue, storm readiness, until the final beat reweights the opening suicidal intent into "a way home... the sound of endings arriving and passing." Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the narrator refuses the appointment again, choosing continued listening with felt cost (the buoy still blinks, the future "coming without hurry"). One meaningful deepening is clear—rescue to storm to delay—narrowing options from oblivion toward mercy. Cost is legible: the appointment persists, the narrator remains a tourist wandering edges, and home is redefined as sound rather than place.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina is vividly anchored (boats knocking like knuckles, pontoons groaning, eels and frost after the storm) and constrains choices: ice weakness must be sounded, the child falls through a hollow, the storm forces clearing of plankways. The parasol tip functions as micro-setting/tool, charging the final salute. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through the narrator's listening obsession. Minor limit: occupational detail (disaster relief volunteering, harbor clinic) is named but not textured with procedural specificity that would push this into the 8.5+ band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—learning to recognize endings without surrendering—is signaled early and tightens through the child rescue (tap finding hollows, rope remembering hitches) and storm preparation (the buoy line snapping, clearing the plankways). Agency is renunciation with cost: each clinic delay forecloses the original appointment while binding the narrator to edge-listening. The rescue and storm are meaningful escalations driven by the narrator's learned skill (the parasol tip, patience as instrument). Score held below 8.0 because the escalation is more deepening than turn-based; the narrator's stance crystallizes rather than reversing, fitting the Accumulative lens but lacking a second discrete pressure peak.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—living by refusing an ending until it learns respect, patience as counter-offer to oblivion—emerges from concrete particulars: the parasol tip sounding ice, rope memory, the child's whistle that stays silent. The final image (two figures tracing the margin of mercy, home as sound) reweights the opening suicidal intent without stating a moral. Subtext operates in gesture (Erland's tea, the mother folding around her child) and the lexicon of edges is dramatized, not declared. No thematic echo in the final paragraph; the closing lines are imagistic and earn resonance. One brief slip: "vanishing teaches little unless you learn its preface first" edges toward aphorism, but it's framed as Erland's speech, not authorial thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature: the narrator notices edges, seams, vowels in water, breath as gift. Diction is consistently lyric-compressed ("windborne solace brushing ribs from within," "a fold in patience laid open") and voice-motivated. Erland's dialogue carries idiom ("rope keeps ships alive by remembering where not to strain") that distinguishes him from the narrator's interior texture. Deduction for mild register drift: phrases like "cognitive architecture" do not appear, but "a queue toward oblivion, measured in bookings and forms" and "my counter-offer to oblivion, my delay letter to the clinic" tilt toward abstract bureaucratic framing that slightly undercuts embodied immediacy in peak reflection beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift; figurative density is high but mostly coherent. Information density is strong: most lines do multiple jobs (the parasol tip is heirloom, tool, and closure image). Minor pattern artifact: several lines open with "I [verb]" in the middle third, creating a brief template cadence ("I volunteer," "I learned to trawl," "I tap and listen," "I tell them," "I say"). One paraphrase loop: "Patience used to be a queue toward oblivion" is immediately restated as "Now it is the careful press I make against each creak." These do not obscure causality but dull momentum slightly. No filter-verb stacks in high-pressure beats; the child rescue and storm are concretely rendered.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—euthanasia tourism transformed into edge-listening via disaster relief and an heirloom tool—is specific and non-obvious. The parasol tip as ice-sounding instrument and the "fold in patience" as tactile method feel fresh. Erland's rope wisdom and the child's silent whistle add unexpected angles. Score held below 8.0 because the emotional arc (suicidal intent softened by human connection and purpose) follows a familiar redemption template; the lived detail and setting choices elevate it, but the core shape is recognizable. The marina setting and ice-sounding mechanics provide the strongest originality; the moral calculus (learn endings' prefaces, refuse until respect) is more poetic rephrasing than transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The euthanasia tourist is present from the opening line and drives the entire arc: arriving to die, stalling after the siren failure, volunteering, learning to listen, asking for appointment delays. Every major choice traces to this identity under transformation. The character's renunciation (continued delays) creates the closure with visible cost (the appointment remains). Specific decisions—using the parasol tip, moving before panic during the rescue, asking for another delay—are causally active and alter tactics. High integration: setup immediate, middle choices driven by this role's evolution, closure hinges on the final delay request.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The heirloom lace parasol tip appears early (kept from grandmother's wreck), is used in at least three beats (sounding ice seams, finding hollows during the child rescue, the final salute), and charges the closure image ("I held the parasol tip high, as if saluting someone still arriving"). Its specific property—ivory, fits the palm, sounds seams—constrains the narrator's listening method. The element is irreplaceable: no generic tool would carry the heirloom weight or the specificity of "an ivory thorn for sounding." Cost linkage is present: the parasol tip is the instrument of the narrator's delay, making the appointment-refusal legible. Slight deduction: while used across beats, the middle development could be more causally intense; the tip enables rather than narrows options in the rescue.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"A fold in patience" is signaled early, used as tactical description ("the careful press I make against each creak"), and returns at closure ("the wind braided our silence into patience, and patience into a way home"). It shapes the narrator's method—waiting, listening, pressing—and redefines what patience means (not a queue to oblivion, but active attention). However, the concept functions more as thematic gloss than on-page constraint; it does not narrow a live choice or impose a visible cost the way the parasol tip or listening skill does. Lyric reprise is strong, but middle development as choice-driver is thin.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Grips reality loosely" is present in the opening ("My mind wakes now like a gull on a shifting rail. It grips reality loosely, and yet clutches at echoes that feel true"). The trait is implied in the narrator's ability to hear "old vowels" in water and to perceive edges others miss, and it arguably enables the listening work. However, the attribute is never explicitly shown constraining or complicating an action with visible cost; it reads more as metaphorical self-description than a functional trait with on-page friction. No moment dramatizes a tradeoff or error caused by loose grip. Present and thematically coherent, but swappable with "sensitive to nuance" or "attuned to subtle signals" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Trawl" is introduced early ("I learned to trawl the shallows for voices and objects the ice swallowed") and defines the narrator's method: searching, listening, recovering. The child rescue is the clearest on-page instance of trawling (finding hollows, bringing her up), and the storm preparation involves a version of trawling (clearing, warning). The action recurs and drives key turns. Slight cap: the verb could be replaced with "search," "sound," or "scan" without breaking story logic; the maritime idiom fits the setting but is not mechanically unique. Strong integration overall, but not fully indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Through disaster relief volunteering" is signaled early ("I volunteer at the harbor clinic through disaster relief volunteering each uncertain dawn") and contextualizes the narrator's presence and authority. The means shapes the narrator's access (clinic role, legitimacy to sound ice and warn) and recurs (the clinic phones to confirm the appointment). However, the mechanics of disaster relief are not detailed or tested; the phrase functions as backdrop rather than active method. If the narrator were simply "a volunteer" or "harbor worker," most beats would remain identical. Functional but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina is introduced in the opening line and pressures every choice: the ice's instability demands sounding, the child falls through a hollow, boats knock together, pontoons groan, the storm threatens the plankways. The setting supplies the resources (ice seams, rope, buoy line) and constraints (frost, winter weakness, brine) that define the narrator's work. The final image (two figures tracing the ridgeline of ice) is inseparable from the setting. Micro-setting elements (the parasol tip against ice, the cot where the narrator listens) also constrain and charge. The setting is indispensable: no other location would support this exact closure or method.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"After waking up changed" anchors the timeframe in the opening line and establishes a before/after that primes the transformation arc. However, the phrase is vague—"changed" by what, when exactly?—and the time element does not tighten decisions. The "night the sirens failed" is mentioned as the pivot, but no clock or urgency tied to elapsed time shapes the narrator's choices. The timeframe is present and establishes the post-transformation mode, but it is replaceable with "after the storm" or "since I arrived" without loss. Functional setup, weak development and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The motivation "to learn the sound of approaching endings without surrendering to them" is stated explicitly and dramatized across beats: sounding ice, the child rescue, storm readiness, asking for delays. The desire is in friction with the original suicidal intent and with the persistent appointment. The narrator's choices—pressing against creaks, writing a lexicon of edges—are driven by this motivation, and the closure pays it off ("I kept listening, and the marina kept living, and both of us learned"). Cost is visible: the appointment remains, the narrator is still a tourist, home is redefined but not resolved. High integration; slight cap because one phrase ("to learn the sound of approaching endings") is abstract and borders on theme-statement rather than embodied want.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Windborne solace" is present in the opening line ("Wind carried a hush that felt like windborne solace brushing ribs from within") and recurs in modulated forms: the wind braiding silence into patience, the wind translating the narrator to permission. Tone is coherent—calm, attentive, elegiac—and modulates under pressure (the storm "came kindly," the child's eyes "dilated like moons under ice"). The final image is charged with this tone: "The wind braided our silence into patience, and patience into a way home." The tone supports the accumulative lens and the transformation from despair to mercy. Minor deduction: the solace is pervasive and consistent, but does not sharply tension the darker material (suicidal intent, child nearly drowning); a slightly more austere or dissonant note in peak beats would elevate to 8.5+.</comment>
