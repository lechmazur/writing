<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The architect's discipline and project are clear, and his choices (anchoring the thread, drawing lines, circling the curator) drive the forward motion. Interiority remains abstract—"weaving patterns of attention," "felt anger erupt quietly"—rather than rooted in embodied sensation or contradiction acting in scene. The curator's arc is muted; she observes and asks questions but undergoes no visible shift or cost. The final exchange ("habits are artifacts worn on the inside") reads as mutual epiphany without prior struggle to earn it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land within the first 120 words. The piece teaches a pattern of charged lines and room transformations that accumulate pressure; the ending reconfigures the architect's project from artifact-building to habit-installation with modest conceptual cost ("leave no artifacts, only habits"). The curator's acceptance and the visitor's participation form a triangle that holds—a Charged Poise moment—but the cost remains implied rather than dramatized with visible forfeiture or foreclosed option. One meaningful deepening is present, sufficient for this length under the Accumulative lens, though the final image could have sharpened the price paid.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The gallery is vivid and purposeful: "arches that did not agree with their shadows," tiles that brighten and darken with footsteps, walls that inhale and exhale. The sinew thread functions as micro-setting, anchoring choices (the architect nails and circles it, the visitor holds one end) and charging the closure when they step beneath the faint arch. Spatial choreography is clean across three distinct chambers. The recurring thread and the dust "like considerate snow" tie environment directly to the architect's method and the final triangle, satisfying the 9+ gate for Q3.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering "the texture of connection" through rational enchantment—is signaled early and pursued in each chamber. The architect's choices (anchoring thread, circling the curator, forming the triangle) tighten incrementally, and the visitor's arrival adds a third point that crystallizes the experiment. However, no live option is visibly foreclosed; the resolution lands as collaborative success without a counterpressure or trade-off made legible on the page. The piece stays in coherent pressure but lacks a felt cost at closure to enter the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme (connection as deliberate structure, enchantment as repeatable proof) emerges from the architect's method and the room transformations rather than assertion. The final exchange—"habits are artifacts worn on the inside"—offers a resonant answer to the architect's aim without stating a moral, and the visitor's smile signals invisible change. The bridge metaphor ("Why trust a bridge that appears only when crossed") and the thread's function as "weak gravity between strangers" charge the ending image. Minor slip: "rational enchantment" and "texture of connection" border on prompt echo in the architect's dialogue, reducing organic emergence slightly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited on the architect throughout; no head-hopping. The prose carries a lyric, contemplative texture—"light were a question," "memories alter what rooms remember"—that matches the unsettling-calm tone and the architect's profession. Dialogue feels purposeful and goal-driven: the curator's skepticism ("What proof does a dream yield") and the architect's replies ("proof is the habit of returning") advance the thematic argument without exposition. Perceptual signature is consistent (the architect "measuring a room without stable edges," "felt anger erupt quietly") and the visitor's brief participation is cleanly handled. One minor register drift: "ethically provable through repeated steadiness" reads slightly academic mid-scene but does not break voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("mirrors leaned inward like listeners," "dust fell like considerate snow"). Information density is high; nearly every line advances the architect's method or the room's response. Two frictions: (1) Paraphrase loop in paragraph 2–3: "Night had thinned to an unsettling calm" / "He came to the optical illusion gallery" / "He said he was there to discover the texture of connection"—three summary lines restate arrival without new pressure (−0.2). (2) Template cadence in the middle third: "He [verb]" opens five consecutive sentences ("He traced," "He anchored," "He drew," "He whispered," "He said"), creating drumbeat rhythm (−0.4). No loops touch the closure beat, so penalties remain non-closure adjustments.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of optical illusion gallery + embodied thread practice + "rational enchantment" as repeatable structure feels specific and non-obvious. The architect's profession and the sinew thread are memorable particulars, and the visitor's participation transforms the demonstration from solo performance to triangulated proof. The piece avoids stock epiphany by ending on collaborative restraint rather than individual revelation. Minor deduction: the curator's role remains reactive throughout, and the "habits are artifacts" exchange, while resonant, lands slightly too neatly without friction or contradiction to test the premise. Risk-taking in structure (lyric accumulation without causal reversal) is purposeful and heightens coherence (+0.3 within band).</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Present from the title and first paragraph. Drives at least three beats: arrives with sketches, anchors and draws the thread in the first chamber, forms the triangle with the curator and visitor. His choices (nailing the thread, circling, instructing "hold it without intention") alter the rooms and crystallize the experiment at closure. The architect's decision to "leave no artifacts, only habits" and his promise to return tie directly to the ending's charge. Specific cost: he confesses debt and accepts that his architecture "lived where measurements hesitate," a renunciation of permanence with conceptual price. Irreplaceability: the story hinges on his unique discipline.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Introduced early ("coil of sinew thread wrapped around his wrist"). Used across four beats: described as inherited and living, anchored to a nail, drawn across the room to still the walls, gathered light "the way ivy finds corners," tied dust into a seam, formed the arch at closure. The thread's properties (color, never cut, gathered light) are specific and irreplaceable. Closure linkage: the architect and curator step beneath the faint arch made by the thread while the visitor holds the third point; the bridge "held because they stayed long enough to recognize it." Visible cost: the thread is unhooked and "let the rooms keep their changes," marking impermanence. Strong causal pressure and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Signaled early ("He whispered of rational enchantment, spells that behave like proofs"). Shapes two beats: the architect explains it as "proof is the habit of returning to the same door," and at closure it is "manifest, ethically provable through repeated steadiness." The concept frames the architect's method and the triangle formation, but the mechanics remain abstract; the piece does not show how enchantment differs from ordinary collaboration or what "ethically provable" entails on the page. It functions more as thematic claim than on-page constraint. Moderate integration: the concept is present throughout and named at closure, but swapping it for "intentional connection" or "calibrated presence" would not break the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Introduced in paragraph 5 ("restlessness hiding under his careful, realistically imaginary poise"). The trait is label-only; no on-page action demonstrates how "realistically imaginary" constrains or enables a choice. The architect's sketches and thread work are concrete, but the attribute itself never manifests as a visible tradeoff or limit. It appears once more implicitly when he describes "maps of thresholds" and "houses that teach silence," but these remain summary claims. The trait colors characterization but does not shape tactics or cost. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Appears once in the ladder-hall chamber: "He felt anger erupt quietly, a volcano under water singing compliance." The eruption is internalized and does not alter his next move; he immediately confesses debt and continues the work. The action is poetic but ornamental—removing it would not change the story's logic, stakes, or closure. No causal consequence flows from the eruption, and it is not reprised or reweighted at the ending. Present and thematically consistent, but swappable with another internal reaction.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Signaled early ("by weaving patterns with thread") and used throughout: the architect traces variations "by weaving patterns," instructs the visitor to "hold it without intention, by weaving patterns of attention," and ties dust into the line "making a faint seam." The method appears in at least three beats and shapes the mechanics of his enchantment. Closure linkage: the final triangle and arch are formed by this exact method. Specificity: "weaving patterns" is concrete and irreplaceable; the architect's discipline depends on it. Moderate cost: the method requires time and the visitor's cooperation, and the result is temporary ("unhooked the thread"). Strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Introduced in paragraph 3 ("optical illusion gallery"). The gallery's properties—calibrated tricks, arches disagreeing with shadows, mirrors as listeners, walls that bend, tiles that brighten/darken—pressure every beat. The architect uses the gallery's instability to test his thread method, and the rooms "studied visitors more than visitors studied rooms," adding reciprocal constraint. Closure linkage: the rooms "keep their changes" after the thread is unhooked, and the visitor exits "smiling at nothing anyone else could see," showing the gallery's lasting effect. The setting is not postcard description; it shapes tactics and charges the final image. Irreplaceable: swap the gallery for a neutral space and the architect's experiment loses its crucible.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The phrase appears once ("They moved onward as memories alter what rooms remember of them") and frames the passage through chambers as a temporal process. The opening notes "Night had thinned" and the ending "morning hurried up the glass," bracketing the session, but no live clock tightens decisions or tactics. The architect's work is iterative and patient; he does not race against a deadline. Time serves as ambient texture rather than constraint. Lyric reprise: the "memories alter" phrasing reappears implicitly at closure when the rooms "keep their changes," a modest reweighting. Functional but not essential; the story could proceed identically with explicit clock markers.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Introduced in paragraph 4 ("He said he was there to discover the texture of connection"). The motivation drives his choices: bringing sketches, asking questions, anchoring the thread, forming the triangle. Friction: the curator warns "the rooms studied visitors more than visitors studied rooms," and the architect "felt anger erupt quietly" before confessing debt, suggesting internal cost. Closure: the architect achieves connection (the triangle holds, the visitor smiles) but renounces artifacts, accepting impermanence as the price of his aim. The desire is dramatized across beats and tested by the gallery's reciprocal scrutiny. Cost is conceptual (no permanence) rather than visceral loss, preventing higher score.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Established in the opening line ("Night had thinned to an unsettling calm") and sustained throughout: polished floors, mirrors as listeners, walls that inhale, "quiet force like a held breath," dust "like considerate snow." The tone modulates subtly—skepticism, collaborative focus, restlessness, acceptance—without breaking the calm surface. Closure linkage: the final paragraph maintains the tone ("morning hurried up the glass like a careful tide," "smiling at nothing anyone else could see") and charges the ending with poised ambiguity rather than resolution. The tone is not static; it accumulates unease and wonder in equal measure, then crystallizes in the visitor's inexplicable smile. Coherent through turns and integral to the final image.</comment>
