<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The frugal astronomer's voice is particular and consistent—"Frugality is a lens; it keeps only what you can see by the sky's grace"—with embodied priorities (counting oil, spare pencils, patient hours) that constrain on-page choices. Interior contradictions surface when the narrator mocks burnt-grain rites yet counts angles like a penitent, and the final vow to "repair pins, replace wires" crystallizes a hierarchy of values with visible cost (oil when spare, hours when kinder than coin). Minor diagnostic slip: the reflective mode occasionally drifts toward thesis ("Attention is a currency dearer than silver") without always anchoring in micro-choice within two lines, but the ending choice remains earned and the voice never collapses into generic register.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the narrator writes their name in faint strokes, pledges scarce resources, and accepts stewardship "without grandeur," forecloses spectacle with visible cost. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural—density increases through overlaid schematics, converging arcs, wire alignments, water channels—and the cadence shift at "The room exhaled" reweights the dominant stake (to seal a covenant with maintenance, not power). Orientation anchors arrive promptly (dusk, courtyards, palace reimagined as observatory) and causality holds under the accumulative lens; the final pledge is motivated by prior particulars (the tile, the alcove, the disk). One hairline concern: the urn-and-disk sequence introduces multiple nested objects in quick succession, risking slight reader lag, but each step is motivated and the closure image ("thrift…keeps its end of quiet") charges prior material cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The palace functions as micro-setting that constrains choices: cracked drains yield the tile, bronze pins anchor wires, alcove plaster buckles, and Saturn's clearing becomes a tactical clock for wire alignment. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered—"air hummed against my teeth," "coolness that smelled of reeds"—and the final wire-singing recurs with changed meaning. The setting charges the closure image (wires as the covenant's embodiment) and tools (wires, cistern water, bitumen thread) are handled across multiple beats. No occupation-depth penalty applies; the astronomical framing is germane and plausible without exhaustive system detail.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—seal a covenant with the unknown through maintenance—is signaled early ("I was the frugal astronomer…paying attention instead of rents") and tightens when the tile's sums converge on the alcove. Agency is renunciation and endurance: the narrator pledges "oil when oil was spare," explicitly forgoing power for stewardship, and the price (scarcity, patient hours, erasure of grandeur) is legible on the page. One meaningful deepening occurs when the disk unscrolls the map requesting "a steward who could promise nothing except maintenance," narrowing options to a vow the narrator can afford. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens through layered particulars (tile, arcs, urn, disk, thread) without requiring a set-piece reversal; the final act—writing the name and pledging resources—forecloses spectacle with felt cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: encrypted devotion as arithmetic and stone, maintenance as faithfulness, frugality as a lens that survives regime change. The final image—"the unknown will note my thrift and keep its end of quiet"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting "devotion" as patient repair rather than spectacle. Subtext operates in gesture (brushing footprints backward, writing a name so faint it reads as sums) and the recurring motif of wires charges the closure without token mentions. One phrase near the end—"empirically ironic in a palace of myths"—edges toward meta-commentary, but remains anchored in the narrator's voice and does not flatten the beat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout: the narrator notices angles, sums, and resource scarcity ("counting breaths to spare lamp oil") in character-specific idiom that modulates under pressure without losing texture. POV is stable first-person with consistent psychic distance; diction stays within the focalizer's lexicon (pencils, wires, bitumen, plaster) without unmotivated register shifts. Rhythmic control heightens at closure: "I swore to repair pins, replace wires, and keep the frugal record of the stars" uses triplet cadence to charge the vow. One minor note: "dusky harmony like violet silk torn to ribbons" is vivid but slightly elevated compared to the surrounding concrete diction; it does not break voice but nudges the boundary.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High information density with most sentences doing double work (e.g., "Numbers became corridors, and corridors became a vow" advances both the tile's function and thematic charge). Sentence openings vary naturally and rhythm modulates with pressure: short declaratives at the vow ("I pledged oil…hours…"), longer accretive syntax during exploration. Two minor line-level frictions: "a dusky harmony like violet silk torn to ribbons" stacks modifiers in a way that slightly risks opacity, and "Attention is a currency dearer than silver, yet it costs a patient body to pay" reads as aphoristic scaffold that could be tightened. No loops, scaffold runs, or filter-verb stacks; clarity remains high throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis—frugal astronomer as covenantal steward in a palace between regimes, devotion encoded in arithmetic and maintenance rather than sacrifice—feels specific and non-obvious. The transformation test holds: swapping names and places would require rewriting the tile logic, wire mechanics, and scarcity-as-virtue stakes. Risk-taking (accumulative structure, lyric cadence, quiet ending that refuses spectacle) heightens coherence without obscuring clarity. The premise avoids writing-template patterns (no chosen-one arc, no external antagonist, no tidy epiphany) and commits fully to its logic: survival through patient record-keeping and frugal repair.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Character present early (frugal astronomer tallying oil and chalk, paying attention instead of rents). Choices drive at least three beats: prying the tile, aligning wires when Saturn clears, pouring water to test the urn, writing the name and pledging scarce resources. Final vow—"to repair pins, replace wires, and keep the frugal record"—is causally active at closure and forecloses power for maintenance with visible cost (oil, hours). All three gates met; causal pressure and closure linkage strong.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Object present by end of first paragraph (pried from cracked drain), used in at least three beats: initial discovery and transcription, overlay onto schematics to find converging arcs, grooves around the urn match the square, and the disk inside repeats the square in minuscule script. Returns with reweighted meaning at closure when the narrator writes their name "within the square, in strokes so faint they read as sums." Specificity high (sums totaling the same, mapping doorways and niches); irreplaceability strong (removal would break the tile-to-urn-to-disk causality). Cost tied directly: decoding the tile requires oil and hours, and the final vow is encoded within its structure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Concept signaled early ("It felt like encrypted devotion, expressed not in incense but in arithmetic and stone") and shapes tactics: the narrator decodes the tile rather than performing rites, uses schematic overlay and water channels, and pledges maintenance rather than spectacle. Middle beat: the disk's map asks for a steward "without grandeur," narrowing options under the concept. Closure: writing the name in faint strokes and pledging sparse resources is the enacted covenant. Cost legible (oil when spare, hours when kinder than coin). Not merely thematic echo; alters on-page options.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Attribute mentioned twice on the page ("empirically ironic and unashamed," "empirically ironic in a palace of myths") but primarily as thematic label. One on-page action arguably embodies it: mocking rites yet counting angles like a penitent shows ironic self-awareness. Constraint is modest—acknowledging the irony does not materially narrow options—and cost is not directly visible tied to the attribute itself. Setup and closure presence weak; middle beat reads as thematic commentary rather than dramatized tension. Swappability moderate.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Action present in middle-to-late beat: "I breathed out to uncloak what lay behind, as the wires sang their hushed chord." Causally active—the breath causes plaster to fall and reveals the recess with the urn. Shapes the major turn from searching to finding and enables the subsequent disk discovery and vow. Not easily swappable; removing this action would leave the alcove unopened. Cost visible (patience, lamp oil spent waiting for Saturn). Setup modest (action not foreshadowed early); closure linkage indirect (the uncloaking enables the vow but does not reappear in the final image).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Method signaled early ("I copied the tile onto papyrus through schematic representations, overlaying courtyards with the numeral script") and mechanics matter: the overlay reveals three arcs converging on the alcove, directing the search. Used again when grooves around the urn match the square's channels. Shapes two distinct beats and enables the central discovery. Specificity moderate (schematic overlay is clear but not unique to this story's logic); swappability low-to-moderate (a map or direct observation could substitute with edits). Cost tied loosely (time and papyrus).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Setting present immediately (ancient Babylonian palace reimagined as observatory) and pressures choices across multiple beats: cracked drain yields the tile, bronze pins anchor wires for planetary risings, alcove plaster buckles to reveal the recess, Saturn's clearing becomes the tactical clock for wire alignment. Resources from setting (cistern water, bitumen, wires) alter tactics on the page. Closure: wires will sing when planets round the corner, embedding the covenant in the architecture. Irreplaceability high—removing the palace structure would collapse the tile logic, wire mechanics, and regime-survival stakes.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Timeframe signaled early (first and last lines: "Between regimes, we kept the place breathing"; "When regimes change again, the tile will be taken for a puzzle") and tightens one choice: the need to encode the vow so it survives political upheaval motivates the faint writing and disguised maintenance pledge. Middle beat implicit (frugality is necessary because institutional support is absent). Closure: the covenant must outlast the next regime shift. Cost visible (scarcity, the vow must be invisible). Not a live ticking clock within the scene, but a structural constraint that shapes the protagonist's strategy.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation dramatized early (astronomer paying attention instead of rents, seeking stewardship "without grandeur") and conflicted across beats: the narrator mocks burnt-grain rites yet counts angles like a penitent, revealing internal friction between empirical stance and devotional impulse. Middle beat: the disk's request for a steward "who could promise nothing except maintenance" crystallizes the motivation as renunciation of power. Closure: writing the name and pledging scarce resources enacts the covenant with visible cost (oil, hours). Friction between want (to seal the covenant) and cost (scarcity, erasure of spectacle) is legible throughout.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Tone established early ("Dusk clung to the courtyards"; "a dusky harmony like violet silk torn to ribbons") and modulates with pressure: reflective and measured during the tile study, charged during the uncloaking and disk reveal, calm and resolute at the vow. Coherent through turns without static flatness. Charges the final image: "dusky harmony" as the unnamed god's answer, and "between regimes" as the ongoing temporal texture. One phrase—"violet silk torn to ribbons"—is vivid but slightly ornate compared to the surrounding concrete idiom, nudging but not breaking tonal coherence.</comment>
