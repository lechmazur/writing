<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is concrete and voice-particular ("I rub the gear before I sing the clicks, feeling the cold faith of metal"), with embodied contradiction between holding tight and practicing loosening. The protagonist's agency operates through teaching and guiding rather than decisive choice-under-pressure; travelers learn, but the narrator's own stance crystallizes without visible internal conflict. Micro-choices (placing the gear in the child's palm, triggering the petal rain) advance the tutorial without foreclosing a path with felt cost. The piece maintains perceptual consistency but lacks a protagonist arc that alters under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens inferred: Accumulative/Textural. The piece patterns around echoes, petals, and the sonar method, then deepens via the child's counted prayers and the captain's recognition. Orientation anchors quickly (nebula garden, falling petals, first-person keeper). Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the narrator will repeat the cycle ("when the next descendants arrive, I will touch the gear and begin the sonar pinging once more"), honoring the pattern without repeating its wound. Cost is conceptual—eternal repetition as mercy—and legible in the final lines. One meaningful deepening (travelers switch off their burn and receive lamps) meets the 600–800 word gate, though the cost is more philosophical than visceral.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The nebula garden is vivid and specific: petals as quivering lanterns charged by sonar, orchard of nebulas where each cloud remembers shaping hands. The setting constrains the central teaching (no flame, only resonance) and supplies the sonar medium that enables the transit. The calculating-machine gear functions as micro-setting, warm brass that once turned futures, and it charges the child's palm in the pivotal beat. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through the otherworldly sentimentalist's lens without catalog excess. Environment and recurring object together meet the 9+ gate by shaping tactics and charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: share light without fire, break the inherited cycle of scorch and fear. One meaningful tightening occurs when travelers arrive exhaling heat and the narrator must tell "a longer story with the garden itself," triggering the petal rain and switching off the ships' burn. The choice to place the gear in the child's palm narrows options (generational handoff) and the captain's head-lowering signals acceptance. However, escalation is illustrative rather than agonistic—the travelers comply without true resistance, and the cost (eternal repetition for the narrator) is felt philosophically rather than pressed on the page as a trade-off. Agency is present but not tested under competing pressures.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: sonar as non-devouring sight, the gear as heirloom counting mercy, petals as lanterns without shadow. The central question—how to break generational patterns of flame and fear—is answered non-literally by the final image of the narrator touching the gear to begin again, "bearing witness across the quiet sigh of falling petals." The piece resists tidy morals; the narrator fears being "only an heirloom pretending to be alive" yet continues, and the garden's troubling serenity holds both ache and structure. Motifs (echoes, gear, petals, infinity) constrain choices and charge closure without checklist convenience. Minor thematic echo: "This is how I honor the pattern without repeating its wound" states the thesis overtly in the penultimate paragraph, reducing earned resonance by ~0.3.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout: "I am an otherworldly sentimentalist, keeper of remnants and resonances"; diction stays elevated yet consistent ("moonmilk," "heirs inherit the wound first," "troubling serenity"). Purposeful compression and patterned repetition (echoes, clicks, falling petals) are taught early and paid off at closure. POV distance is stable first-person; no head-hopping. Dialogue is minimal and functional ("Do not feed this place flame," "Count the sounds"), goal-driven and brief. Rhythmic control holds under pressure without register drift. Filter verbs ("I hear the repeating notes," "I know they are descendants") are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. The perceptual lens (sonar, resonance, counting) is character-specific and shapes every beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines layer world, character, and theme. Rhythm varies purposefully with paragraph length and sentence structure. Minor paraphrase loops appear: "echoes return like birds who know the window" and later "I collect the echoes they leave, kin to the first I cast" restate the sonar concept without added pressure (−0.2). Template cadence in mid-section: "They think... I know..." / "They expect... I offer..." runs across adjacent beats (−0.4). Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "moonmilk" and "veined maps" work, though "orchard of nebulas" stretches spatial logic slightly. No scaffold or stock metaphor strings in peak beats. Propulsion is steady; the final paragraph's recursion serves closure rather than stalling momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of sonar-as-teaching, calculating-machine heirloom, and nebula garden as anti-flame pedagogy feels specific and non-obvious. The premise transforms the mentor-traveler template through the narrator's fear of being "only an heirloom pretending to be alive" and the philosophical cost of eternal repetition. Emotional specificity (ancestors who "loved too hard, held too tight"; the narrator practicing loosening) avoids generic abstraction. The core tension—sharing light without fire—is executed through world logic (sonar, petals as lanterns) rather than assertion. Risk-taking in tone (troubling serenity, perpetual cycle without triumphalism) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Transformation test passes: swap names/places and the emotional arc collapses because the otherworldly sentimentalist voice is integral. Within-band risk distinction applies: +0.3 for the non-obvious infinite-cycle resolution that charges theme without false closure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character present throughout. Early signal (first line). Drives beats: triggers petal rain, places gear in child's palm, guides transit. Shapes closure: will repeat the cycle ("when the next descendants arrive"). Cost connection: eternal repetition as mercy. Moderate causal pressure; the narrator teaches more than chooses under duress. Three gates met, two beats, closure linkage present. Swappability moderate; "otherworldly" and "sentimentalist" flavor but do not constrain action uniquely (−0.4). Setup +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure +1.0, causal pressure +0.7, cost +0.4; swappability −0.4; late-ornamental −0; base 3.0 + 3.1 = 6.1, round to 6.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Object present in three beats: narrator rubs it before singing clicks, it hangs on neck with backstory, placed in child's palm. Early signal (paragraph 10). Causal pressure: the gear's history (ancestor saved numbers, choices might change) primes the child's counting and the captain's recognition. Closure linkage: final paragraph "I will touch the gear and begin the sonar pinging once more" charges the recursive image. Specificity high: toothworn brass, calculating machine, warm now. Visible cost tied to heirloom fear ("only an heirloom pretending to be alive"). Three gates, three beats, strong closure linkage. Setup +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure +1.4, specificity +0.6, cost +0.5; base 3.0 + 5.7 = 8.7, cap at gear's actual closure presence = 7.8 because the final touch is brief and the child's use is the peak (round down).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Concept present throughout. Early signal ("flame births smoke and fear, and these branches of vapor remember, passing scars along their veins in generational patterns"). Shapes stakes: narrator's motive is to break the inheritance of fire-fear. Causal pressure: travelers repeat "the same fearful arithmetic of survival"; narrator triggers petal rain to teach a longer story; child admits father taught fear of dark; captain recalls torching a field. Cost connection: narrator must practice loosening to avoid repeating the wound. Closure linkage: "This is how I honor the pattern without repeating its wound" and the recursive final image. Three gates, multiple beats, strong closure linkage. Setup +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.3, closure +1.5, cost +0.5, specificity +0.4; base 3.0 + 5.8 = 8.8, but "honor the pattern without repeating its wound" is near-label-only thematic echo (−0.6) and concept is theme-claimed more than mechanically constraining choices (−0.5 swappability); 8.8 −1.1 = 7.7, but strong closure linkage rescues to 7.1 after rounding adjustments.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Attribute present in multiple beats: "drawing lines that approximate infinity without ever closing the loop," "a tide that approximates infinity as it thins but never ends," "infinity is only patience practiced across the heart." Early signal (paragraph 7). Causal pressure moderate: the non-closure of the echo loops enables the transit path and the lamps' perpetual glow without scorch. Closure linkage: "because infinity is only patience practiced across the heart" and "the echoes never end" charge the recursive final image. Cost connection: infinity as eternal labor, conceptual price. Three gates met. Setup +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.8, closure +1.0, cost +0.4, specificity +0.4; swappability −0.5 (could swap for "endless" with minor edits); base 3.0 + 3.5 = 6.5, round to 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Action present throughout. Early signal: "From those lines I weave corridors of perception, a transit path for wanderers." Drives beats: travelers arrive, narrator triggers petal rain, guides them through the orchard, they depart with lamps. Shapes closure: "The transit completes itself without ceremony" and the next descendants will arrive. Causal pressure: transit is the enacted solution to the generational pattern. Cost connection: transit as teaching requires eternal repetition. Three gates, multiple beats, closure linkage strong. Setup +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure +1.3, cost +0.5; swappability −0.6 (journey/passage could substitute); base 3.0 + 4.4 = 7.4, but "transit completes itself" is slightly passive; adjust to 7.6 for strong prior involvement.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Method present in multiple beats: "I release sonar pinging through the starlit mist, soft clicks that map hollows and roots," petals become "quivering lantern charged by our sonar," child counts ping after ping. Early signal (paragraph 6). Mechanics matter: sonar creates the resonance that avoids flame, enables light without burn. Causal pressure high: sonar is the means of teaching, the alternative to fire. Closure linkage: "I will touch the gear and begin the sonar pinging once more." Cost connection: sonar requires eternal labor, counting, patience. Three gates, three beats, strong closure linkage, high specificity. Setup +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.4, closure +1.4, specificity +0.7, cost +0.5; base 3.0 + 6.1 = 9.1, but mid-section use is illustrative rather than tactically tested (−0.6); adjust to 8.5, further to 7.9 for swappability (echolocation could substitute with minor re-wording, −0.6).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setting present throughout. Early signal (first line: "nebula garden where petals fall"). Shapes tactics: garden's no-flame rule constrains the teaching method; petals become lanterns charged by sonar; orchard structure guides the transit. Causal pressure high: setting supplies the medium (nebula clouds, petals) and the constraint (no fire). Closure linkage: "among the falling petals, counting again" and "bearing witness across the quiet sigh of falling petals." Visible cost: narrator remains bound to the garden's cycle. Three gates, multiple beats, strong closure linkage, high specificity. Setup +0.8, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.4, closure +1.6, specificity +0.7, cost +0.5; base 3.0 + 6.4 = 9.4, but setting is somewhat decorative in middle beats (petals sigh, ships bruise air) without sharp tactical constraint (−0.6); adjust to 8.8, further to 8.2 for partial swappability (garden-of-light could substitute with edits, −0.6).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Timeframe phrase appears in final sentence ("bearing witness across the quiet sigh of falling petals") and is implicit throughout (petals fall continuously). Lyric reprise: petals sigh in opening and close the final line. Does not tighten decisions on a ticking clock; functions as atmosphere and recursive marker. Closure linkage strong: the phrase charges the eternal-cycle image. Cost connection: the sigh of petals marks the passage of time the narrator endures. Two gates (setup, closure), one closure-focused beat. Setup +0.4 (implied early), closure +1.2, cost +0.4, lyric reprise +0.5; swappability −0.7 (any slow atmospheric timer could substitute); base 3.0 + 1.8 = 4.8, but strong lyric reprise and closure linkage lift to 5.8 under the lyric-resonance allowance.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation stated early (paragraph 3: "to share light without using fire, to teach glow that does not devour") and dramatized throughout. Drives beats: narrator offers resonance not torches, triggers petal rain as teaching tool, places gear to pass non-flame method forward. Shapes closure: "how I share light without using fire, how the garden keeps its troubling serenity." Cost connection: eternal repetition and fear of being "only an heirloom." Three gates, multiple beats, strong closure linkage. Setup +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.3, closure +1.5, cost +0.5; label-only in final third (−0.3 for stating "how I share light without using fire" in penultimate paragraph); base 3.0 + 5.4 −0.3 = 8.1.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Tone phrase "troubling serenity" appears explicitly twice: paragraph 2 ("the garden answers in its troubling serenity") and near-end ("how the garden keeps its troubling serenity"). Tone coheres throughout: calm diction layered with ache, patience threaded with fear, soft clicks that map darkness. Modulates under pressure: when travelers exhale heat the tone tightens briefly, then returns to quiet resolve. Charges closure: final image of beginning again "across the quiet sigh of falling petals" embodies troubling serenity as eternal labor. Three gates, pervasive presence, strong closure linkage. Setup +0.6, pervasive (three+ beats) +1.4, closure +1.4, cost +0.5, specificity +0.5; label-only use in final third (−0.3); base 3.0 + 4.4 −0.3 = 7.1, but tonal coherence and modulation lift to 7.7.</comment>
