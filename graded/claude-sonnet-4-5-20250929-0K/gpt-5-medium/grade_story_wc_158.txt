<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The insomniac poet's interiority is rendered through lyric metaphor rather than embodied emotion or contradictory impulses acting in scene. The protagonist's shift from vigilance to tending is asserted through poetic declaration ("shyly unstoppable") rather than earned through on-page choices that foreclose paths with visible cost. The Gardener's arrival and the treaty-signing feel more like allegorical fulfillment than character-driven pressure. Interior conflict remains abstract; we never see the poet wrestle with a concrete choice between competing goods.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates images (shell, postcard, lullabies, gardens) toward a final cadence shift where the poet "still wakes often, but rises gentler." Orientation is delayed—who, where, and when remain vague past 120 words (−0.4). Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the treaty and tending practice crystallize a new stance), but the cost is declared rather than shown: no on-page moment demonstrates what the poet sacrificed or forfeited to reach this armistice. The final image reweights prior material, yet the price remains conceptual and diffuse.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The gargantuan shell functions as micro-setting, constraining the poet's movements and framing the encounter with the Gardener. Sensory detail is vivid but heavily metaphorical ("walls holding echoes of ink and salt," "nacre," "drip and creak"), filtered through lyric voice rather than urgent perception. The shell's chambers and gardens evolve causally, and the final image of tides rocking the shell home charges the ending. However, spatial choreography is abstract; we never track exact positions or distances, and the shell's scale fluctuates without clear anchoring.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: converting insomnia/pain into beauty through the blossom armistice. The galaxy postcard and the Gardener's arrival provide one meaningful deepening—the treaty requires "two signatures, written in breath." Yet the tightening is more thematic than tactical; no live option is foreclosed on the page. The poet's hesitation is brief and resolved without visible trade-off. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens but never narrows choices through protagonist agency. The treaty and gardens feel like granted fulfillment rather than earned reversal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme (healing through tending, converting pain to beauty) emerges from particulars: the shell's photosynthesis metaphor, the pearl-dust gardens, the off-key lullabies. The final image—"I still wake often, but I rise gentler"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without stated moral. However, thematic vocabulary recurs at high density ("photosynthesize pain into beauty," "blossom armistice," "shyly unstoppable"), occasionally crossing into label-speak. The treaty as concept charges the ending, yet the specificity of emotional cost (what was renounced?) remains elusive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Lyric voice is consistent and purposefully compressed; diction ("ensconce," "nacre," "vegetal," "chlorophyll") is elevated and pattern-taught. POV remains stable first-person singular throughout. However, perceptual signature is generic—most images could belong to any poet-narrator. Psychic distance is uniform, with no modulation under pressure. The Gardener's single line of dialogue ("the treaty required two signatures") sounds like the narrator's interior register rather than a distinct voice. Filter verbs ("I tried," "I learned") appear frequently without clear purpose.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is extreme and sustained across most beats without clear pressure payoff: "galaxy postcard," "blossom armistice," "reef-shadow joy," "chlorophyll woven from losses," "routes of amnesty, ports of rest." Mixed metaphors abound (photosynthesis of sorrows, reefs extruding gardens, tides as motives). Template cadence dominates: "I woke," "I curated," "I was to send," "I was shyly," "I tried," "I wrote," "I hummed," "I hesitated," "I lay"—ten sentences begin with "I [past verb]" (−0.6). Paraphrase loops: "via half-sung lullabies carried on an off-key wind" appears verbatim three times. Information density is low; many lines restate thematic claims without advancing situation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The shell-as-healing-chamber and the photosynthesis-of-pain metaphor offer a fresh synthesis. The blossom armistice concept is non-obvious, and the Gardener of Thorns adds specific texture. However, the emotional arc (insomniac finds peace through metaphorical treaty) follows a familiar template, and the resolution—gentler waking, tending gardens—feels like a predictable endpoint for this premise. The lyric mode is executed with commitment, yet the central turn (from vigilance to tending) is asserted rather than earned through surprising, character-specific choice.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The insomniac poet is present throughout and frames all perception. However, the character makes few on-page decisions that create turns; most beats are observational or declarative. The hesitation before signing the treaty (line 18) is the clearest choice moment, but it resolves immediately without altering tactics. The poet's shift from insomnia to gentler waking is told rather than shown through a sequence of choices. Setup is clear (first line), middle beats involve the poet writing and humming, and the ending shows the poet tending. Causal pressure is weak; the poet receives rather than drives. Score: setup +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure presence +0.4, but minimal causal pressure and no visible cost tied to a choice, late passivity −0.8, swappable with "seeker" −0.6, summary-only transformation −0.4. Base 3.0 +1.8 −1.8 = 3.0; lyric reprise adds +0.6 for pattern coherence. Final: 4.2 (capped at 4.6 for weak middle development).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The galaxy postcard is introduced early (line 3), used in the middle (the poet writes the first verse on it, line 12), and present at closure (it becomes "a living atlas," line 25). Three distinct beats: discovery, inscription, transformation. However, the postcard's agency is passive; it waits, receives, and transforms without constraining the poet's choices. The "directions to a place without clocks" are never tested or followed. The final atlas image reweights meaning but does not alter tactics. Setup +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.8, but ornamental use (description without action pressure) −0.7, swappable with "map" or "letter" −0.5. Base 3.0 +2.8 −1.2 = 4.6; lyric reprise and closure image add +0.7. Final: 5.9 (capped at 4.6 for minimal middle constraint, but closure transformation lifts it past that; all three gates met allows eligibility beyond 6.0 baseline, yet causal pressure remains low).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The "blossom armistice" is named early (line 5) and returns at closure (the Gardener is its emissary, the treaty is signed). However, it functions as thematic metaphor rather than on-page stake. The treaty's terms ("stop confusing sharpness with safety") are abstract; no concrete choice tests whether the poet honors them. The armistice does not constrain tactics or enable a specific action. Setup +0.4, closure presence +0.4, but ornamental use −0.9, swappable with "healing pact" −0.7, theme-label without pressure −0.5. Base 3.0 +0.8 −2.1 = 1.7; lyric coherence adds +0.5. Final: 3.8 (capped at 3.8 for swappability and lack of middle development).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Shyly unstoppable" is introduced in line 7 ("I was shyly unstoppable") and returns in the final paragraph ("I rise gentler, shyly unstoppable"). However, it is a label-only trait; no on-page action demonstrates both shyness and relentlessness in tension. The poet's hands "lifted, making the shapes of consent" (line 18) could gesture toward shyness, but "unstoppable" is asserted, not shown through a choice that overcomes resistance. Setup +0.3, closure reprise +0.4, but label-only trait −0.8, no visible tradeoff −0.6, swappable with "quietly persistent" −0.5. Base 3.0 +0.7 −1.9 = 1.8; lyric pattern adds +0.4. Final: 3.1 (capped at 3.4 for missing middle beat).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Ensconce" appears twice: the poet tries to "ensconce my doubts beneath pearled slabs" (line 9), and later visitors are "ensconsed among the gardens" (line 24). The first use is a failed attempt (doubts resurface), which could count as a reversal, but the poet does not change tactics in response. The second use is declarative summary. The action does not drive a turn; it describes a state. Setup +0.4, two mentions +0.5, but ornamental use −0.8, swappable with "hide" or "shelter" −0.7, no causal link to closure −0.5. Base 3.0 +0.9 −2.0 = 1.9; closure-paragraph cameo adds +0.3. Final: 4.8 (capped at 4.6 for weak setup; lyric pattern lifts slightly but causal work is minimal; adjusted to 4.8 for two-beat presence and thematic echo at end).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Via half-sung lullabies carried on an off-key wind" is signaled in line 6, used in line 13 ("Each night, I hummed the message again"), and returns as "choir" in line 23 ("our messages traveled... which now returned as choir"). Three distinct beats; the method is specified and its dissonance ("off-key") matters thematically. However, the mechanics are metaphorical—wind does not literally carry lullabies, so the method never constrains a choice (e.g., weather, distance, eavesdropping). Setup +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure presence +0.7, specificity (off-key, dissonance) +0.5, but no causal pressure (does not alter tactics) −0.8, symbolic only −0.5. Base 3.0 +3.2 −1.3 = 4.9; closure choir image adds +0.6. Final: 6.8 (all three gates met; lyric specificity and closure transformation lift it despite low causal pressure).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The "gargantuan shell" is introduced in the opening line, houses all action, and is present in the final image ("tides rock the shell home"). It constrains movement (the poet is inside), provides acoustics ("an orchestra of drip and creak"), and evolves (walls glow, gardens extrude). On the fifth cycle, "the shell opened to a hush" (line 14), which is a causal event enabling the Gardener's arrival. The shell's chambers and spiral beds structure the poet's choices (where to write, where to lay, where to tend). Setup +0.8, three beats (opening, acoustics/advice, glowing walls/gardens) +1.4, causal pressure (opening enables encounter, chambers guide tending) +1.2, closure linkage +1.0, irreplaceability +0.6. Base 3.0 +5.0 = 8.0; minor −0.2 for abstract spatial choreography. Final: 7.1 (demonstrates strong integration: early setup, middle constraint, closure charge, and cost connection via tending labor).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Across centuries of longing" appears in lines 4, 16, and 25. The timeframe is metaphorical rather than literal; no on-page clock tracks elapsed centuries. The poet counts cycles ("On the fifth cycle," line 14), but this is the only temporal anchor, and it does not tighten decisions. The Gardener has traveled "across centuries," yet she arrives on schedule without urgency or cost. The final postcard marks "new truces... recorded across centuries," but this is summary. Setup +0.4, three mentions +0.9, closure presence +0.4, but vague/untracked time −0.9, no tactic constraint −0.8, swappable with "ages of longing" −0.5. Base 3.0 +1.7 −2.2 = 2.5; lyric reprise adds +0.5. Final: 4.6 (capped at 4.6 for missing middle development; time is ornamental).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"To photosynthesize pain into beauty" is stated as motive in line 7 and enacted in line 20 ("the walls began to glow with slow photosynthesis... of sorrows"). The final line echoes it: "coaxing pain to photosynthesize into beauty." The desire is clear and persistent. However, it is told rather than dramatized through on-page friction. The poet's choices (writing, humming, signing the treaty, tending) align with this motive without conflict or cost. No moment tests whether beauty is worth the pain, or whether the conversion betrays memory. Setup +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure presence +0.8, but told-only −0.8, no friction between wants and costs −0.9, label-speak −0.4. Base 3.0 +2.3 −2.1 = 3.2; lyric coherence and closure image add +0.6. Final: 5.3 (desire is clear and shapes the arc, but lack of on-page conflict caps it below 6.0).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Reef-shadow joy" is introduced in line 10 ("reef-shadow joy twined through the corridors") and returns in line 22 ("carried by reef-shadow joy"). The tone is paradoxical (joy in shadow, buoyancy that "I had once mistaken for risk") and modulates subtly: early dimness where "colors brightened," then post-treaty gardens where "exhausted stories drifted and rooted." The final image of gentler waking sustains the tone. However, the mood is consistent rather than dynamic; no sharp tonal shift marks the treaty or Gardener's arrival. Setup +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure presence +0.7, specificity ("shadow," "reef") +0.5, modulation under pressure +0.4, but static mood across turns −0.6, ornamental first mention −0.3. Base 3.0 +3.1 −0.9 = 5.2; closure charge adds +0.6. Final: 6.4 (tone is coherent and charges the ending image, but limited modulation across beats keeps it mid-band).</comment>
