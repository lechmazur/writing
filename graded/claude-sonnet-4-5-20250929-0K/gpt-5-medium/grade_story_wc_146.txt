<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The bell tuner's motivation is coherent and embodied through ritual action rather than introspection. His infinitely patient trait is claimed but not tested with meaningful cost—he works for two days with no visible struggle or sacrifice. The townspeople who return lack individuated voices or contradictory impulses; the mother's wariness dissolves without friction. Internal conflict is absent; the tuner's calm certainty never wavers under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece builds through layered ritual gestures and a widening circle of participation, culminating in the bell's ringing and the community's tentative agreement to continue. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the town commits to "the unglamorous rhythm of return" with the cost legible in the conditional phrasing ("perhaps a winter") and the refusal of victory. Orientation is delayed but functional; the archway and town are anchored by ~10% with purposeful lyric compression. One minor causality slip: the bell "spoke" and "reached into kitchens...uncurled the smell of thyme" without prior setup of how sound triggers olfactory memory in this world.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The archway, cobblestones, and square are used to constrain the tuner's method and charge the ending image ("beneath the archway...the town answered with feet"). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered—"wild hush," "dust," "thyme"—and integrates action without catalog. The cistern's "breath that was almost a chord" and the crack in the bronze bell supply tactile constraint. Spatial choreography is clean across the square, church, and farm road.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: restore communal balance through shared rhythm. The piece tightens once—from solitary pacing to collective footwork—and the mother's tentative return supplies a micro-reversal that opens the town. The tuner's agency is ritual action rather than decision under duress, and no live option is foreclosed with visible personal cost; he asks for time and they grant it without friction. The bell's repair and the community's agreement to practice together constitute a deepening, not a dramatic turn, fitting the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: balance as practice, listening as precondition for return, and rhythm as social covenant. The ebony fork and footsteps function as motifs that constrain method and charge closure without overt symbolism. The final image—"the town answered with feet"—offers a non-literal answer to the central question of how a fractured community reconstitutes. No thematic echo or moralizing mars the ending, and the "unglamorous rhythm of return" resists tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on the tuner with controlled psychic distance. Voice is lyric and compressed with purposeful parallelism ("He struck...He set...He paced") and figurative density ("drank the dusk like a narrow chalice," "urgency played his ribs like strings"). Register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("the fray between neighbors who no longer shared air") that feels imposed rather than character-rooted. Dialogue is spare, goal-driven, and carries subtext in the mother's wariness and the tuner's conditional offer. Perceptual signature is consistent—sound, rhythm, breath—anchored in the tuner's craft.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout with some mixed vehicles: "dark tongue wavered like a blackbird testing wind" (fork as tongue/bird), "tail writing cursive in the dust" (charming but ornamental). Template cadence appears in the middle third: "He struck...He set...He paced...He closed...He would be...He passed...He lifted...He told...He said...He asked...He felt...He led...He whispered...He asked...He dreamt." This stem repetition flattens momentum across ~15 lines. Information density is strong in the opening and closing thirds. No paraphrase loops or scaffolding, but the overwriting in peak beats (bell-ringing moment) adds texture without propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise—acoustic tuning as social repair—is fresh and specific, avoiding generic redemption templates. The ebony tuning fork, cobblestone rhythm, and community pacing synthesize craft detail with metaphor in a way that feels earned rather than allegorical. Risk: the lyric compression and ritual pacing resist conventional plot escalation, trusting pattern over confrontation. The piece does not retreat from its commitment to slowness and collective rather than heroic agency, which elevates originality within the Accumulative mode.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Present early; drives the pacing method, fork use, and ending agreement. His choices (striking the fork, matching the cistern, leading the townspeople to the church) shape three distinct beats. Closure participation is strong—he asks for continuation and they agree. Causal pressure is present but soft; his agency is ritual enactment rather than hard decision under duress. Cost is implied (seasons of work) but not dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Introduced in the opening beat, struck against the archway, used to match the cistern, warmed by collective rhythm, and present at closure ("at his heart"). Appears in four beats with evolving function. The fork's properties (ebony, dark tongue, warmth) matter to the method and charge the final image. Slightly shy of indispensable—another tuning instrument could substitute with minor edits—but its recurrence and sensory specificity anchor the ritual.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Signaled in paragraph four and sustained as the dominant stake. Shapes tactics: footstep pacing, communal walking, bell repair. Closure directly enacts revival through the town's agreement to practice and the opening windows. The concept redefines the genre expectation of "revival" from construction to acoustic and social restoration, which elevates integration. The mechanics of how sound rebuilds social fabric remain abstract, preventing top-band scoring.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Claimed early ("infinitely patient") and restated ("it made no difference"). Enables the two-day timeline and the open-ended commitment at closure. However, the attribute is never tested with meaningful friction—no impatience surfaces, no cost is paid for waiting. The trait functions as character flavor rather than a dramatized constraint that narrows options or forces a visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The action spans the entire arc: pacing cobblestones, coaxing shutters, mapping the town, walking the square with townspeople, repairing the bell, and the closing agreement to continue. Every major beat enacts "rebuild" through ritual and collective rhythm. Removal would collapse the plot. The specificity—rebuild via acoustic alignment rather than physical construction—is essential to closure and theme.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Introduced at the structural center ("the method he trusted most"), detailed across multiple beats (pacing, the children counting stones, twenty feet braiding pathways), and supplies the counting that enables bell repair. The method shapes the tuner's tactics, constrains the townspeople's participation, and charges the final line ("the town answered with feet"). Mechanics are legible and causally active. Irreplaceable—no other method would preserve the story's logic or thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Present in the opening line, used as the tuning site (fork struck against it), revisited at dawn when "the air pressed him," and anchors the sleeping location at closure. The archway functions as threshold and witness, charging three beats. However, its role is largely symbolic; the archway does not constrain choice or supply a resource that alters outcome. Micro-setting is present but not indispensable—a church door or town gate could substitute.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mentioned once in backstory ("Long ago, before the collapse") to establish the town's prior harmony and the cause of abandonment (warped bells, hardened arguments). Does not tighten present decisions or tactics; the tuner's work unfolds over two days with no pressure from the past encroaching. The timeframe provides context but remains inert—removing it would not alter the plot or closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Signaled early ("to restore shared balance"), embodied in his method (tuning, pacing, coaxing collective rhythm), tested in the mother's return and the community's tentative commitment, and crystallized in the closing agreement to practice. The motivation drives every beat and shapes the ending's charge. Friction is present in the mother's wariness and the town's initial absence, though the tuner's certainty never wavers. Cost is implied (seasons of work) rather than paid on the page, preventing top-band scoring.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Established in the opening line, sustained through "private vow," "silence sparkled," the bell's hand-offering tone, and "the unglamorous rhythm of return." Tone modulates from solitary ritual to communal tentative hope without breaking coherence. The oxymoron ("wild hush") charges the final image—sparrow song answered by feet—and unifies the lyric compression with the story's stakes. Tone is indispensable to the piece's effect and closure resonance.</comment>
