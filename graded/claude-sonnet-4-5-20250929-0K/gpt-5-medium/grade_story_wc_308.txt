<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is vivid and voice-particular ("let it ricochet sound from bone to bone"), with embodied perception that narrows under pressure. The apprenticeship and reverence motives ground the character's expertise, and the final choice to leave stones for "the next listener" carries visible cost—foregoing tools and accepting emptiness. However, the reflective density dominates most beats, and the protagonist's physical micro-choices remain sparse; the shift from active skimming to stillness is thematically clear but emotionally underdramatized, limiting the felt weight of renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through layered sensory anchors (bone towers, black mirror, bird patterns) and a cadence shift at closure when the protagonist casts the arrowhead and achieves navigational address without moving. The closure effect is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the world redrawn inside the protagonist, distances folding, and the pulse less alone—cost is felt as the empty cord and stones left behind. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (canyon, ledge, protagonist role by ~10% mark), and the accumulation tightens once through the arrowhead's introduction and its final use. Minor weakness: the "wandering pulse" remains abstract and its exact constraint on tactics is oblique, reducing causal precision within the accumulative frame.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The towers of bone, shale pools, and weathered bench function as micro-setting that constrains the protagonist's stillness and listening method, and the black mirror seep anchors the arrowhead's climactic fall. Sensory detail is filtered through the protagonist's craft idiom ("ribs leaning," "wind had carved a bench for patience"), and the canyon's spatial logic remains coherent across moves. The arrowhead and cord charge the final image by constraining the choice to cast rather than skip. The setting surpasses vivid description by enabling the closure tactic (casting into the mirror to strike "the exact rib"), meeting the 9+ test for environment shaping choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—learning to navigate without moving—is signaled early and tested once through the protagonist's shift from active skimming to stillness, tuning breath to birds and pulse. The arrowhead's introduction and final casting constitute a meaningful tightening: the protagonist must choose to release a tool to achieve navigational address, foreclosing the option to retain the skipping stones. The cost is legible (empty cord, stones left for others) and the agency is renunciation, fitting Accumulative pressure. However, the escalation is thin—no reversal or complication resists the protagonist's method—and the "wandering pulse" remains a cooperative atmosphere rather than an antagonistic force, limiting the felt difficulty of the accomplishment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the interplay of stillness, listening, and historical reverence: the canyon's grammar teaches that navigation is agreement rather than motion, and the protagonist inherits and extends a lineage of patient attunement. The final image—empty cord, stones left as lesson, pulse "less alone for having been heard"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without overt moralizing. The arrowhead's shift from tool to prayer deepens the thematic texture, and the birds function as both literal and conceptual mediators. Minor weakness: the "vow" shared with ancestors and strangers is asserted rather than dramatized, and the phrase "appraise not where you are but how you are heard" flirts with thematic echo, though it remains integrated enough to avoid heavy penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistent, with a lyric-meditative register ("brittle ribs leaning into a sky that forgot how to be blue") that remains within the protagonist's craft idiom and historical reverence. Psychic distance is stable, and the compression in late beats ("I hold still, and I travel as the birds travel") heightens pressure without obscuring the lens. No dialogue is present to evaluate. Minor slips: a few lines approach elevated abstraction ("distances fold like paper boats") that edges toward decorative rather than embodied perception, and the phrase "arm's speak" reads as a purposeful coinage but risks opacity without payoff.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language is dense but mostly legible ("pulse left wandering… pretending to be stone," "channels lined with memories like resin"). Information density is high; nearly every line advances the accumulative pressure or the navigational method. However, several lines loop conceptually: "I do not move" appears three times in similar phrasing, and "the canyon answers / shifts / says" recurs without fresh specificity. The phrase "arm's speak" and "historically reverent" (used twice) read as template insertions. Template cadence is present in the "I + verb" stems across multiple beats. Cumulative artifact penalty applies: paraphrase loops (−0.2), template stems (−0.4), elevated register drift in peak beats (−0.3), total −0.9, lowering from ~7.8 to 6.9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of harmonic stone skimming, bone-tower canyon acoustics, and navigational listening through bird-pattern grammar is specific and non-obvious, avoiding stock quest or discovery templates. The protagonist's occupation and method feel fresh, and the final reconfiguration (navigating by stillness, leaving tools behind) grows inevitably from the established craft logic. The "pulse left wandering" as a rhythm untethered from any heart is a memorable conceit. Minor weaknesses: the overall structure follows a familiar arc (seeker arrives, learns, achieves insight, departs transformed), and the lyric density occasionally substitutes ornamentation for surprise. Risk-taking in compression and patterned diction elevates within band (+0.3).</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Setup: protagonist identified as harmonic stone skimmer in opening paragraph. Development: the skimmer's choice to rest hands and shift from active skimming to stillness constrains the middle method. Closure: the decision to leave stones for the next listener and keep the cord empty is a direct outcome of the skimmer's craft values and historical reverence. The role drives the navigational logic and the final renunciation. Three gates satisfied; causal pressure +1.2; closure linkage +1.0; irreplaceability +0.6; early signal +0.5. Base 3.0 + 3.3 = 6.3, rounded down to 6.7 after assessing two distinct beat involvements.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setup: arrowhead introduced on the ledge, appraised by fingertip in paragraph ~20%. Development: tied to cord, becomes "a weight for breath," and trembles, constraining the protagonist's tuning method. Closure: cast into the mirror, strikes "the exact rib," and its echo returns the scent of lichen, directly shaping the navigational address. Three gates satisfied; two distinct beats +0.9; causal pressure +1.0; closure linkage +1.5; specificity (flaked style, burr of use) +0.6; cost connection (releasing it to achieve navigation) +0.5. Base 3.0 + 4.5 = 7.5, rounded to 7.8 for strong irreplaceability and closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Setup: mentioned in opening paragraph as story lore, signaled early. Development: the protagonist listens for it, hears it "stuttering across stratified echoes," and tunes breath to allow its path. Closure: the pulse "settles toward the heart of that vessel," and the protagonist senses it choose a path through them, enabling the navigational shift; the pulse goes on "less alone for having been heard." Three gates satisfied; two beats +0.9; causal enabler (allows navigation by stillness) +0.8; closure linkage +1.0; early signal +0.5. Base 3.0 + 3.2 = 6.2, lowered to 5.9 because the pulse remains abstract and does not impose a visible tradeoff or cost—it cooperates rather than resists.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Setup: "historically reverent, apprenticed to echoes older than my grandmother's myths" appears in opening third. Development: the protagonist appraises the arrowhead "in the style of people who read shadows like scriptures" and imagines the hands that knapped it, but this reverence is reflected, not enacted in a constrained choice. Closure: the trait is not visibly active in the final image or decision. Two gates (setup, thematic presence); lyric reprise without mid-scene constraint. Early signal +0.5; thematic coloring +0.3. Base 3.0 + 0.8 = 3.8, lifted to 4.8 for strong early anchoring and consistent voice coloring, but capped by ornamental use (no on-page cost or tradeoff tied to reverence).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setup: protagonist appraises arrowhead edges by fingertip early, establishing tactile evaluation. Development: the appraisal reveals "a burr of use, as if long ago it trimmed silence itself," shaping the decision to tie it to the cord. Closure: the protagonist uses the appraisal skill to "test the map by closing my eyes and picturing the canyon as a vessel," but the action itself is not uniquely tied to appraisal—closing eyes and listening would function identically. Three gates; one distinct beat +0.4; causal enabler (appraisal informs tying) +0.6; early signal +0.5; swappability (could be "examine," "sense," "feel") −0.6. Base 3.0 + 1.5 – 0.6 = 3.9, lifted to 6.4 for strong early anchoring and the fingertip detail's specificity, but capped by replaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setup: method declared explicitly mid-story ("This is my method: through the patterns in a flock of birds in flight, I hear the grammar of the air"). Development: protagonist tunes breath to the birds, counts "the beats that refuse me and the beats that allow," and presses thumbs to arrowhead while watching bird arcs. Closure: birds "knot over" the pulse's heart, and the protagonist travels "as the birds travel… by agreement." Three gates satisfied; two beats +0.9; causal pressure (birds mediate the navigational address) +1.0; closure linkage +1.2; specificity (wingbeats as pressure ripples, dish of light) +0.6; late first appearance (mid-story ~40%) −0.4. Base 3.0 + 3.7 – 0.4 = 6.3, lifted to 7.1 for indispensable mechanics and closure charge despite late signal.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setup: "towers of bone" and "canyon of endless echoes" anchored in opening lines. Development: the ledge provides a bench for patience, the seep gathers into a black mirror, and the bones function as tuning forks that return bird wingbeats as pressure ripples—shaping the protagonist's listening method. Closure: casting the arrowhead into the mirror strikes "the exact rib," and the echo returns lichen scent, directly enabling the navigational address; distances fold and far walls "lean until they are within arm's speak." Three gates; three beats +1.4; causal pressure (environment enables and constrains method) +1.4; closure linkage +1.6; irreplaceability (bone acoustics are unique) +0.7; early signal +0.6. Base 3.0 + 5.7 = 8.7, rounded to 8.1 after conservative judgment of minor abstraction in "far walls lean."</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Setup: "centuries of layered dust" mentioned in first third, establishing deep time. Development: the arrowhead is "flaked in the style of people who read shadows like scriptures," and the protagonist imagines ancestral listeners, but this time depth is atmospheric, not a live constraint on present action. Closure: the echo "returns wearing the scent of lichen, a reminder that time is a spiral winding around bone," but this is thematic assertion, not tactical pressure. Two gates (setup, thematic closure mention); no middle constraint. Early signal +0.5; thematic mention +0.2; ornamental (no on-page cost or urgency) −0.8. Base 3.0 + 0.7 – 0.8 = 2.9, lifted to 4.2 for consistent atmospheric presence and the "spiral" image's closure participation, but capped by lack of causal pressure or live ticking clock.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setup: motivation declared explicitly in opening third ("I have come to learn to navigate without moving"). Development: the protagonist tests this goal by resting hands, tuning breath, and listening rather than skimming stones—renouncing active motion to achieve stillness-based navigation. Closure: "I hold still, and I travel as the birds travel, not by feet but by agreement"—the final image confirms the goal's achievement and the cost (empty cord, stones left behind). Three gates satisfied; two beats +0.9; causal driver (motivation shapes all middle tactics) +1.3; closure linkage +1.4; cost connection (renunciation of tools, forfeiture of motion) +0.5; early signal +0.6. Base 3.0 + 4.7 = 7.7, rounded to 7.6 for slight abstraction in "agreement" that dilutes the visceral cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Setup: "weathered resolve" in opening line establishes a patient, enduring stance. Development: tone remains consistent through stillness ("I do not rise, but the canyon shifts") and the protagonist's steady breath-tuning, modulating slightly as pressure accumulates ("the arrowhead trembles… wanting to fall"). Closure: resolve culminates in the decision to cast the arrowhead and leave stones behind—"I hold still, and the world will carry you"—charging the final image with earned composure and the cost of renunciation. Three gates; coherence across beats +0.8; modulation under pressure +0.6; closure charge +1.2; early signal +0.7. Base 3.0 + 3.3 = 6.3, lifted to 7.2 for strong thematic integration and the tone's active shaping of the ending image, though the single-note quality (no sharp tonal pivot) limits upward movement.</comment>
