<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The violinist remains more symbol than character; interior life is sparse and decisions feel pre-determined rather than hard-won. The gathering of children and elders creates relational pressure, but their presence doesn't force the protagonist into contradictory impulses or visible struggle. The final action—lifting the bowl to "hear a map drawing itself"—registers as conceptual assertion rather than embodied choice with felt cost. Lark's questions provide some external friction, but the protagonist's answers arrive fully formed without hesitation or internal conflict.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; the piece braids images (bowl, orchard, shipwrecks, music) toward a final cadence shift where communal practice replaces solitary playing. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. The closure registers as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the bowl fills, the group decides to "visit the halves and the almosts," and footprints remain as "a song that refuses to be done." Cost is conceptual—the chronic hush "loosens one more braid" rather than vanishes—but the final image reweights the opening stake legibly under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The sunken orchard greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks functions as micro-setting that constrains the gathering and charges the final image: tide "drifts the greenhouse doors ajar," the orchard breathes "a patient bellows in the ribs of glass," and receding water leaves footprints on the steps. Sensory detail is vivid and selective ("roots drinking brackish light," "barnacles hold their breath"), filtered through the violinist's acoustic perception. The wrecks "keep watch" and their "keel timbers...loosen" under the music, converting setting into active presence rather than backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—unbinding the chronic hush—is signaled early and tightens once when the solitary act becomes communal practice. The bowl fills with "things we do not throw away," and the group commits to "visit the halves and the almosts," a meaningful deepening under the accumulative lens. Agency reads as attention and endurance rather than decisive reversal; the hush "loosens one more braid" rather than breaks, and the cost is the quiet acceptance that repair is incomplete. No antagonist or sharp reversal, but pressure coheres and the final commitment forecloses pure withdrawal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme—beauty in the unfinished—emerges through particulars: the bowl collecting fragments, songs that "never finish" but "keep walking with you," the orchard that "forgot its label." The final image (footprints, "a song that refuses to be done") answers the thematic question without stating a moral. Subtext operates in Lark's question about mending hulls and the protagonist's reply ("not with glue, but with direction"), which layers practical and metaphorical meaning. No heavy-handed summation; the chronic hush as patient accumulation rather than absence resonates without sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV distance is stable; first-person narration anchors perception in the violinist's acoustic sensitivity ("my ears are acoustically perceptive, trained by breakwater murmurs"). Voice carries distinct texture: "rosin draws a voice from maple," "fruit deciding whether to be sweet again." Dialogue with Lark feels purposeful and advances theme without exposition dumps. Minor register drift: "magnificent simplicity" in the penultimate paragraph reads slightly elevated for the moment, but the perceptual signature (sound-focused, patient, elegiac) holds through turns. No head-hopping; internal texture consistent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("chronic hush begins to braid itself," "apples bloom white scars"). Overwriting penalty: metaphoric density is high across most beats without clear pattern-teaching, and some vehicles mix ("hush braids," "bow nods like a patient bird," "hull learns to forgive the current"). Minor paraphrase loop: "magnificent simplicity" appears as both concept and direct phrase near the end. Propulsion slows mid-piece when exposition about the mother and tradition interrupts the greenhouse scene. No major clarity breaks, but the figurative load in a ~1,400-word piece nudges toward ornament over function.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise—post-apocalyptic musician healing a drowned orchard through ritual—combines familiar dystopia with specific local detail (shipwrecks as hedges, brackish light, barnacles). The choice to make repair incomplete and communal rather than heroic offers a non-obvious stance. Risk-taking in tone and structure (accumulative, lyric) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Some template echoes: the mendicant's bowl collecting tokens, the wise elder remembering "when it was hilltop," feel recognizable. Transformation is present but not radical; the piece earns its band through synthesis rather than bold departure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The echo-harbor violinist frames the entire piece and makes two key choices: to play unfinished songs and to shift from solitary performance to communal gathering. Present in setup, middle (dialogue with Lark), and ending (lifting the bowl, deciding to "visit the halves"). Causal role is softer than decisive—observations accumulate rather than reversals pivot—but the final group commitment ("we decide") is enabled by the violinist's prior framing. Swappable with "musician" or "keeper" with minor edits, limiting irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The mendicant's bowl appears in setup (carried on back, inherited from mother), middle (set among the group, fills with marble/seed/coin/shell), and ending (lifted to "hear a map drawing itself"). Handled physically and its contents drive the group's decision to "visit the halves." Meaning reweights from alms-carrier to communal repository. Cost connection: the bowl's filling forecloses solitary mourning and commits the group to ongoing, incomplete work. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage; would approach 8.0+ if its mechanics had shaped an earlier tactical choice.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Chronic hush is named in the opening line ("the world still listened to a chronic hush") and returns at closure ("the hush loosens one more braid"). It shapes the violinist's goal ("I came to unbind the silence settling over the trees") and reweights at the end as patient accumulation rather than absence. Middle development is thematic rather than tactical—the hush "begins to braid itself around the notes" but doesn't alter a choice. Lyric reprise pattern reweights the stake, earning mid-band, but it remains more atmospheric frame than on-page constraint.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Acoustically perceptive is stated early ("My ears are acoustically perceptive, trained by breakwater murmurs") and colors narration (barnacles hold breath, apples bloom scars). No on-page moment where this trait enables a choice or imposes a tradeoff; it flavors voice without constraining action. Functional but swappable with "musically trained" or "sound-sensitive." No cost tied to the attribute; no beat where heightened hearing creates friction or revelation that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Unbind appears early as stated goal ("I came to unbind the silence"), returns mid-piece ("I let the song unbind them...so wood can remember its tree"), and at closure ("the hush loosens one more braid"). The action drives the gathering and the communal commitment to "tend" fragments with music. Swappability concern: "heal," "release," or "mend" would work with minor edits. One major turn—shift from solitary to communal—traces to this action, but the mechanics of unbinding remain metaphorical rather than specific, limiting causal grip.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Family tradition of storytelling around a bonfire is introduced in setup (mother's teaching), practiced in the middle ("We tell our stories after the playing, keeping the tradition without fire"), and implicitly present at closure (the group's pockets "full of beginnings"). The method shapes the gathering's structure and the decision to continue communal practice. Cost: fire is "far and wrong," so the tradition adapts to lantern light. Two-beat involvement with closure participation, but the mechanics of storytelling itself don't constrain a choice—stories are recounted in summary rather than dramatized as pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sunken orchard greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks anchors the entire piece: setup ("stood...beyond the quay"), middle (the group gathers "between trunks part fruit and part driftwood," wrecks "keep watch"), and ending (tide "drifts the greenhouse doors ajar," footprints on the steps). The setting pressures choices—brackish water limits growth, wrecks create shelter, tide times the departure—and charges the final image. Irreplaceability high; the drowned-orchard logic drives the stake (finding beauty in the unfinished). Strong causal and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>After the rainforest burns is named in the opening ("It was after the rainforest burns, when the smoke learned to sink") and colors backstory ("after the rainforest burns, when endings fell like ash"). The timeframe establishes the chronic hush but doesn't tighten decisions on the page—no live clock, no tide deadline that narrows options within the scene. The past disaster frames tone and motive but remains backdrop. Functional setup without middle or closure grip; the piece could unfold identically in any post-catastrophe window.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>To find beauty in the unfinished is stated mid-piece in dialogue with Lark ("Because I am trying to find beauty in the unfinished") and enacted at closure (the group decides to "visit the halves and the almosts," song "refuses to be done"). The motivation drives the violinist's choice to play unfinished songs and the communal commitment to "tend" fragments. Friction: the temptation to finish or give up is implied but not dramatized as internal conflict. Two-beat involvement with closure participation, but the want is declared rather than tested through contradictory impulses on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Magnificent simplicity coheres through diction ("simple" lemon scent, "small circle of lantern light," the bowl's minimal contents) and modulates under accumulative pressure—early restraint ("the sound of patient things") deepens to charged quietness at closure ("our pockets full of beginnings"). The final agreement to "practice magnificent simplicity" names the tone explicitly but earns it through prior images (marble, seed, coin, shell; footprints as song). Tone charges the final image and reflects the accumulative lens; no static mood. Minor penalty for overt naming in the penultimate paragraph, but the tone work across beats is strong.</comment>
