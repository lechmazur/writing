<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The scavenger's interiority is densely lyric but remains abstract—"motives are simple and unbearable" is asserted, not dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. The ghost negotiation involves stated verbs (admit, forgive, rebuild, stay) that feel like a checklist rather than embodied struggle. Micro-choices exist (washing the sack, cataloging ambitions) but carry minimal visible cost that would foreclose a path. The protagonist's agency reads more as allegory than as a character in pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens is evident: the piece builds through patterned recursion (carousel, lagoon, ghost, camera wheel) and achieves Resonant Reconfiguration at closure when the ghost "fades not from absence but from agreement, leaving tools in my hands." Cost is conceptual—the protagonist accepts restarted habits over plundered futures—and the final image reweights ambition as "sand good for gardens." Orientation is delayed (kinetic lagoon, scavenger role) but purposeful compression coheres by midpoint. One meaningful deepening (ghost materializes, truce negotiated) tightens the stake sufficiently for this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon, carousel skeleton, and turbine raft provide charged micro-setting that constrains the negotiation spatially. Sensory detail is vivid and POV-filtered ("muffled clinks," "turbine sighs measure minutes"). The camera wheel and salvaged bolts function as tactile anchors that ground the lyric mode. However, the lagoon's physics (swells, churns, lifts waves) remain atmospheric rather than mechanically legible, and the "above the clouds" frame lacks sufficient spatial grounding to prevent occasional white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—negotiating with one's ghost to resolve misfiled time and eroded ambitions—is signaled early and tightens through the bridge of murmurs, the camera wheel truce, and the ghost's verb demands. One clear deepening occurs when the protagonist admits, forgives, promises, and stays, foreclosing the option to flee. Cost is conceptual (regret "sinks with a relieved shudder," ambitions reframed as sand) but remains abstract rather than viscerally felt. Under the Accumulative lens, the tightening is sufficient; pressure coheres without requiring causal reversals.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the negotiation: time as currency, ambition as erosion, forgiveness as craft. The camera wheel's clicks "align with the lagoon's percussion, a syncopation of possible days" offers a resonant non-literal answer. Regret functions as paradoxical currency without didactic summary. The final image—"breath becomes a craft"—reweights the opening "world remembers how to hold its breath" with earned conceptual cost. Minor slip: "turbine becomes a kettle; a hinge becomes a book's quiet vertebra" feels like illustrative catalog rather than dramatized particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single-POV stability maintained; lyric compression and patterned elision are taught early and paid off at closure. Perceptual signature is consistent ("fractured stillness stitched with ripples," "hinges and promises jangling") and vocabulary remains character-particular throughout. Distance is controlled; no head-hopping. Free indirect style ("My ghost hates bargains that smell rehearsed") is clean. Purposeful non-standard syntax ("It is chronologically confused too") serves voice. Minor deduction: some filter verbs stack ("I tell it rest now") in peak beats without clear voice motivation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; metaphoric density is high but largely coherent ("rope of murmurs," "click our truce into place"). Information density is strong—most lines do multiple jobs (image, pressure, theme). However, paraphrase loops appear: "I am chronologically confused, or maybe the hours are" echoes "It is chronologically confused too" without added pressure. Template cadence runs: "I admit... I forgive... I promise... I stay" reads like checklist phrasing. Some register drift ("syncopation of possible days") elevates diction past the scavenger's grounded voice. Figurative saturation in the middle third ("barnacles," "turbine sighs," "translucent leaves") risks overwriting without pattern-teaching.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of scavenger-as-negotiator, kinetic lagoon, disposable camera wheel as temporal tool, and ghost-as-mirror offers a non-obvious frame. The "carousel halts → climb → negotiate → rebuild" arc avoids template plotting. Eroded ambitions reframed as "sand good for gardens" is a fresh inflection earned by prior particulars. Risk-taking in lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring the closure effect. Minor proximity concern: "negotiate with my own ghost" and "translucent leaves" echo recent literary trends, but transformation through the lagoon-turbine mechanics and the camera wheel's tactile presence restores specificity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Scavenger role is signaled early, drives the climb and negotiation, and frames the ending's toolwork. Present in setup, middle (collecting stories, offering the wheel), and closure (cataloging salvaged promises, washing the sack). However, decisions feel allegorical rather than tactically constrained—no live fork where scavenging competes with another impulse. Two beats + closure linkage elevate; lack of causal pressure and visible cost limit further.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Camera wheel introduced early ("disposable camera wheel"), handled in the middle ("thumb it backward," "hear faint clicks"), and shapes the truce negotiation ("asking it to click our truce into place"). Ghost "sets it turning, not forward, not back" at closure, and the clicks "align with the lagoon's percussion." Three beats with distinct use; charged closure participation. Strong irreplaceability (its temporal mechanics matter). Cost is conceptual but legible. Nears indispensability but remains one step short of full causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Eroded ambitions introduced early ("ambition... has eroded into sludge"), materialize mid-story ("eroded ambitions sink in the lagoon"), and are explicitly cataloged at closure ("I catalog my eroded ambitions and find they are sand good for gardens"). The concept constrains the negotiation (protagonist must admit and forgive erosion) and reweights the ending's tactics. Three gates met with closure transformation. Causal pressure is conceptual but clear; cost is felt in the reframing.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Chronologically confused stated early ("I am chronologically confused") and shared with the ghost ("It is chronologically confused too"). The trait enables the negotiation (misfiled time as stake) but does not visibly constrain on-page choices—no moment where confusion blocks a tactic or forces a tradeoff. Present in setup and middle; closure links via "restarted habits" but the trait itself does not charge the final image. Functional but largely ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Regret introduced early ("bargaining chip I both hoard and spend"), drives the ghost's materialization ("I regret aloud the years"), and sinks "with a relieved shudder" at closure, altering the protagonist's stance. The action shapes the truce negotiation (ghost demands "admit, forgive") and redefines options (regret as currency spent). Three beats with causal pressure; closure linkage is strong. Cost is conceptual but undeniable. Nears indispensability; minor deduction for slight swappability (grief could substitute with edits).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Method signaled mid-story ("I ascend by collecting fragments of overheard stories, knotting them into rope") and used to build the bridge of murmurs ("By collecting fragments... I bait my ghost"). Appears in two beats (rope for crossing, bridge for ghost). Enables the negotiation spatially but does not constrain a choice with visible cost—the stories function as access key rather than tactical pressure. Present in middle and closure frame; causal role is moderate. Lyric compression keeps it from full irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Kinetic lagoon introduced in the opening ("kinetic lagoon swells and subsides"), provides spatial platform for negotiation (raft of turbines, water-memory mechanics), and charges the ending ("lagoon approves, lifting small waves"). Present in all three gates; setting enables the truce and supplies turbine-sigh time measurement. However, the lagoon's mechanics remain atmospheric—its churning does not constrain a live choice or force a tactical fork. Strong closure linkage but lacks the causal pressure to become indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Timeframe stated in opening ("After the carousel halts") and closing ("After the carousel halts, the world exhales"). The halt frames the entire negotiation as post-motion, but the timeframe does not tighten tactics—no live clock or urgency that narrows options. The carousel's status (halted, skeleton, dreaming) brackets the story lyrically but does not pressure the middle beats. Early seed and final reprise reweight the stake moderately; lack of causal involvement in middle caps score.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation stated early ("to negotiate with my own ghost"), dramatized through the bridge encounter, verb demands, and truce, and resolved at closure ("ghost fades... from agreement"). Desire is conflicted (ghost "hates bargains that smell rehearsed," protagonist hoards and spends regret) and shapes all major beats. Three gates met with strong causal pressure; cost is conceptual (restarted habits, misfiled time acknowledged) but legible. Minor deduction: the negotiation feels more allegorical than tactically fraught—no moment where the ghost's counter-offer tempts a reversal.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Fractured stillness introduced early ("fractured stillness stitched with ripples and air," "gentle and decisive") and sustained through lyric compression, the ghost's "weightless and heavy" paradox, and the "overlapping silences like translucent leaves." Tone modulates with pressure (eroded ambitions, "relieved shudder," final exhale) and charges the closure image ("breath becomes a craft"). Coherent across all beats; cadence shift at ending reweights. Strong closure charge; lacks overt constraint on choice to reach indispensability.</comment>
