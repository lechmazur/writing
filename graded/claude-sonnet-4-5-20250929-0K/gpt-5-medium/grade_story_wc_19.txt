<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's claustrophobia and hunger for "intangibly tangible" quiet drive consistent, particular choices—climbing monthly, collecting silences in the doll, seeking one her father could understand. The final moment where father tastes the gilded hush and asks to redraw entrances shows earned change rooted in prior causality. Internal contradiction appears embodied: she fears doorlessness yet craves escape from walls. Minor slip: the phrase "I am made of exits" edges toward self-diagnostic articulation, though the surrounding embodied detail mostly sustains voice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—the piece gathers varieties of silence through a catalogue structure, then deepens when the protagonist shares one with her father, reweighting safety from "blast doors" to "home." Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image of redrawing entrances together, with the doll cooling as "a small heart learning new beats," reconfigures the father's bunker logic and the daughter's understanding of openings. Orientation anchors early (bunker builder's child, monthly gravity inversion, trellis). The cost is conceptual and relational—the protagonist risks her own safety ("too much gilded hush and I stop wanting doors") and bridges her father's concrete world with her own sensory one, visible in his softened blueprints and the collaborative redesign.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The xenial trellis is vividly particular—"rooms with no corners," "seating that adjusts to your fears," cloudgrass teacups—and constrains the protagonist's collection method (she must limit exposure or lose desire for doors). The monthly gravity inversion provides spatial logic for the climb, and the bells, ribbons of air, and widening landing guide descent choreography. The doll functions as micro-setting/tool, storing breath samples and serving as a porcelain vessel that matters at closure when opened "like a locket." The father's workshop anchors the ending with blueprints on plywood, grounding the conceptual shift in tactile redrawing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: finding a silence the father could understand, braided with the risk that too much gilded hush will erase her need for exits. Pressure coheres across the catalogue (citrus-ache laughter-silence, rain-copper apology-silence) and tightens when she catches the rarest one by limiting exposure, then deepens when she shares it with her father—his recognition ("tastes safe... like stepping into a room you have never left") forecloses her solitary hoarding and opens collaborative redesign. The cost is visible: she risks her own dissolution and succeeds in altering his bunker logic, with the final image of sprouting openings together showing the trade-off between solitary collection and shared creation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: silence as texture versus the father's "measurable, concrete" safety, doorlessness versus exits, isolation versus xenial welcome. The gilded hush that "tastes like honey strained through linen, gold without weight" contrasts with the father's "stale bread" bunker silence, and the final shared moment—"safe like stepping into a room you have never left... the word he means is home"—answers the thematic question without stating a moral. The doll, cracked and hollow, carries the central metaphor of fragile receptivity. No overt thesis; the ending's collaborative redrawing reweights safety and openness through image and gesture.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and lyric—"walls make my pulse burr like a trapped moth," "quiet sprout," "bones... dusted with pollen"—with purposeful compression and metaphoric density taught early and sustained. POV remains stable first-person throughout with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is selective and sensory (tastes of silence, tactile doll, spatial awareness). Minor deduction: occasional elevated diction ("intangibly tangible," "xenial") risks register drift, though the surrounding texture mostly sustains the narrator's particular idiom. Dialogue is minimal (father's single line "This... tastes safe") but carries subtext and advances the closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with vivid, specific images—"bells loosen from steeples and float past like dandelion seeds," "silence that hovers before a kiss, which tastes of mint left in pockets." Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or the collection catalogue. Two text-pattern issues reduce the score: (1) repeated "there is the silence" stems across the catalogue middle (functional parallelism but edges toward template cadence), and (2) phrase "limiting exposure" appears twice within three paragraphs without reweighting. Opening and closing lines are strong anchors. No paraphrase loops or major clarity breaks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of tactile silence-collection, gravity inversion as monthly ritual, porcelain doll as breath-vessel, and the xenial trellis creates a non-obvious premise with specific world logic. The metaphor of silence-as-flavor is not new, but the piece transforms it through embodied particulars (copper-rain apology, citrus-ache laughter, honey-strained gilded hush) and grounds the collection in the daughter-father tension between concrete safety and intangible welcome. The ending's collaborative redrawing of entrances feels inevitable in hindsight, arising from prior particulars rather than late invention. Risk-taking in the lyric catalogue structure and speculative gravity-inversion frame heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Character drives key turns: the monthly climb, the choice to collect and limit exposure, the decision to share the gilded hush with her father, and the collaborative redesign of entrances. Appears in setup (opening lines), middle (trellis choices), and ending (asks father to taste, then redraws plans together). Claustrophobia and hunger for intangible safety shape every beat and the final reconfiguration of the father's bunker logic hinges on her agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Object appears in three distinct beats: introduced early as "cracked at the shoulder and hollow enough to store a breath," used mid-story to collect samples by limiting exposure, and opened at closure "like a locket" to release gilded hush into the father's shop. The doll's porcelain cavity is mechanically necessary (stores breath that evaporates otherwise) and its final cooling as "a small heart learning new beats" charges the ending. Irreplaceability is high; no generic container would carry the mother's legacy or the fragility/receptivity metaphor.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Concept shapes stakes throughout: the protagonist climbs monthly to taste different silences, risks losing her desire for doors if she consumes too much, and the rarest gilded hush becomes the bridge to her father's understanding. It appears in setup (described as goal), middle (catalogue of silence-tastes and the careful collection by limiting exposure), and ending (shared with father, who recognizes it as home-safety, prompting the redesign). The concept is irreplaceable; swapping it would collapse the father-daughter tension and the thematic arc from concrete to intangible safety.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Attribute mentioned once in setup ("I am greedy for something intangibly tangible, something that meets the tongue without hardening the room") and implicitly realized in the gilded hush's honey-linen texture and the father's final recognition. It frames the quest but does not visibly constrain a mid-story choice with cost. The ending validates it thematically (the shared silence is both felt and conceptual) but the trait itself remains more label than lever. Lyric resonance is present but causal pressure is limited.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Action drives two beats: literal sprouting of new trellis paths when rungs bloom during the hour, and the collaborative sprouting of openings in the father's blueprints at closure ("to sprout openings here"). The verb recurs with reweighted meaning—first as upward escape, then as earthbound creation. Setup in the trellis climb, payoff in the final redesign. Not strictly irreplaceable (other verbs could serve) but the organic/architectural pairing charges the ending and ties to the xenial welcome theme.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Method appears in setup (implicit in the monthly ritual and the doll's purpose) and middle ("I catch it by limiting exposure, letting only a thread of that quiet touch my tongue while the rest curls into the doll") and shapes the peak choice when she releases "a curl of gilded hush... careful again by limiting exposure, careful for both our sakes." The constraint is mechanically necessary (too much gilded hush erases desire for doors) and the protagonist's discipline enables the father's safe encounter. Present in all three gates with visible cost tied to self-preservation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Setting provides the spatial and conceptual frame: the trellis is xenial (welcomes anyone who can climb), offers alcoves with different silence-tastes, adjusts seating to fears, and supplies the gilded hush that charges closure. It appears in setup (described as destination), middle (catalogue of alcoves and the collection mechanics), and ending (implicitly invoked when the protagonist plans to return but chooses tonight to work with her father). The trellis's hospitality logic contrasts with the father's blast-door bunkers and enables the thematic shift. Removing it would collapse the story's spatial and emotional architecture.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Timeframe anchors the ritual (monthly climb when gravity inverts for an hour) and appears in setup and middle (bells float, trellis blooms, "as the hour thins"). The constraint is present but not tightly tracked—no on-page clock or urgency test when the hour ends, just the passive "gravity remembers itself." The inversion supplies world logic and allows the climb, but the protagonist's choices within the hour are not visibly shaped by dwindling time. Functional but not indispensable; a different access condition could serve.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation is dramatized across all beats: the opening establishes the desire to "collect the flavors of different silences," the middle shows the catalogue and the careful collection by limiting exposure, and the ending pivots when she seeks "the silence I climb for... rarer, a gilded hush" that her father could understand. The friction between wanting intangible safety and fearing doorlessness creates visible cost. The final collaborative redesign fulfills the motivation by finding a silence the father recognizes, closing the gap between his concrete world and her sensory one.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Tone is introduced in the premise ("every minute stretches and contracts, stretching contracted like a lung exercising itself") and modulates with pressure: expansive lyric catalogue in the trellis, cautious limiting exposure at the peak, tender and grounded in the father's shop. The contradiction between expansion and contraction charges the ending when collaboration replaces solitary collection. The phrase "stretching contracted" recurs implicitly in the widening entrances and the doll cooling as a second heart. Coherent through turns; the final image of sprouting openings embodies the tone's resolution without flattening it.</comment>
