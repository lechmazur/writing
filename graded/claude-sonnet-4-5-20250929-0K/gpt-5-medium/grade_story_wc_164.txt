<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The sea-foam recollectionist functions as a lens rather than a character who makes contested choices under pressure. Interior life is present but largely contemplative; the protagonist observes, listens, and interprets without facing meaningful internal conflict or a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost. The shepherd's prior choice is dramatized in vision, but the recollectionist's own agency remains interpretive rather than transformative. Embodied emotion and micro-choices are minimal; the piece relies on atmospheric interiority that describes states rather than enacting contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers images and interpretive beats toward a thematic conclusion. Closure offers a Conceptual Repricing—paths close "because the earth was blinking," trust is "the secret architecture under every useful disappearance"—but the cost remains conceptual and oblique, never felt or foregrounded on the page. Orientation is delayed (cave interior, tools, and task clarify gradually over the first third), and the causal spine is thin: the recollectionist receives a task, listens to glass, follows seeds, sees a vision, and returns with an explanation. No meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; the ending restates the premise rather than reweighting prior material through on-page pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The iridescent cave, crater glass, pool, and migrating bird create vivid, distinct anchors. Sensory detail is selective and poetic—"Light moves like patient fish," "seeds settle into a map"—and filtered through the recollectionist's idiom. Spatial choreography is coherent across moves (kneeling, stepping deeper, pausing at the pool, scattering seeds). The setting does not meaningfully constrain a choice or alter tactics; it functions as a stage for contemplation rather than pressure, capping the score below high-band entry.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering why paths disappear—is signaled early but never tested. The recollectionist encounters no obstacle, makes no trade-off, and faces no reversal; the bird appears on cue, the vision arrives without cost, and the solution is delivered intact. Pressure remains static across beats; the protagonist's interpretive walk through the cave does not escalate or deepen options. The ending recounts the planned tea-and-explanation without showing the villagers' reaction or any friction, leaving the stake abstract and the resolution unearned.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme—disappearance as care, revision as courtesy—emerges from images and the shepherd's vision rather than direct statement. The final lines ("trust, the secret architecture under every useful disappearance") offer a resonant reframing of the premise, and the recurring cheerful-gloom idiom lends tonal coherence. However, the thematic answer arrives without friction or cost on the page; the recollectionist never doubts, struggles, or pays a price for the insight, reducing the ending's charge. The piece invites reflection but avoids ambiguity or counter-readings, settling into a tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, poetic, and controlled: "Deadlines are sandglasses held by polite ghosts," "vowels weep," "a newborn sentence of the mountain." Focalization is stable (single POV, no head-hopping), and perceptual signature is character-specific—synesthetic, whimsical, interpretive. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated lyricism that slows momentum ("transliterate emotions rather than translate") but remains coherent. No dialogue appears. Distance and tense are consistent; the voice modulates minimally across beats, maintaining a steady contemplative register without escalating under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Line-level craft is competent with poetic compression and varied syntax: "Heat hums in a key between sorrow and laughter," "We respect the revision and walk a footnote that becomes a poem." Figurative density is high and largely coherent, though some vehicles stretch plausibility ("path that once glittered with footsteps like minnows," "cheerful gloom"). Paraphrase loops appear in adjacent lines (e.g., "The path is not stolen; it has edited itself" / "the path closed its eyes because the earth was blinking"). Filter verbs and interpretive scaffolding recur ("I see," "I know now," "I feel"), dulling immediacy in a few beats. Information density is moderate; several sentences restate thematic points without advancing situation or choice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—sea-foam recollectionist, transliterating emotions, paths that self-edit—is inventive and non-generic. However, the execution leans on lyric ornamentation over structural surprise; the protagonist's walk is linear, the bird and vision arrive without complication, and the ending restates the opening conceit. Emotional truth is present but abstract; the recollectionist's cheerful gloom and interpretive stance remain static, never tested by doubt or cost. The piece offers a fresh idiom but a predictable arc; transformation is conceptual rather than earned through character friction.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The sea-foam recollectionist is named, active across beats (listens to glass, follows seeds, sees vision, returns), and frames the narrative. However, the character's choices do not create turns; observation and interpretation dominate. The role is functional but could be replaced with another contemplative figure-type without altering the arc. Present in setup, middle, and ending, but agency is minimal.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Crater glass appears in three beats: held on lap, hummed, pressed to pool to trigger vision. It remembers fire and hums caution, enabling the shepherd vision that explains the path's closure. The object is handled and returns with reweighted meaning (from memory of impact to accent of caution). However, its mechanics are vague, and it does not constrain a choice or impose cost; the recollectionist uses it successfully without friction. Early signal, middle use, closure linkage via the final "lesson to the crater glass" commit, but causal pressure is modest.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Missing pieces appear as "gaps that feel like teeth deliberately removed from a key" and the path's self-editing. The concept frames the problem but does not shape tactics; the recollectionist does not struggle with incomplete information or face a choice constrained by what is absent. The vision fills the gap cleanly. Present thematically and in one middle image, but ornamental rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Transliterates emotions rather than translate, preserving grammar even when vowels weep" is stated early and echoed in the final letter that "keeps the grammar of relief while exchanging dialects with responsibility." The trait characterizes the recollectionist's idiom but does not constrain or enable an on-page action with cost. It functions as voice flavor and thematic echo, not as a causal lever. Label-only mention without visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Conjecture appears once: "I conjecture, letting hypotheses perch like birds on my shoulder. / What danger teaches a road to close its eyes." The moment frames the interpretive stance but does not create a turn; the vision that follows supplies the answer directly. The action is swappable with "wonder" or "theorize" without structural change. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Scattered seeds dropped by the migrating bird are introduced early ("It drops scattered seeds, a trail that spells a direction only feelings can read") and used in two beats: followed as a map, then scattered along an alternate corridor where they sprout to guide travelers. The method is signaled, its mechanics matter (seeds "settle into a map," "tell travelers where to walk"), and it enables the solution. However, the bird arrives on cue without friction, and the seeds function smoothly without constraint or cost. Two-gate presence (middle + ending) with causal involvement, but no price paid.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The iridescent cave inside a crystal geode is named early, supplies vivid anchors (light, gloom, vein of crater glass, pool), and stages the entire narrative. However, it does not pressure choices or supply contested resources; the recollectionist moves freely, and the environment enables rather than constrains. Postcard-level description without tactical friction. Present in setup and across beats, but ornamental rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Before memory fades" is mentioned twice: in the opening ("a deadline before memory fades") and before the ending ("Before memory fades, I commit the lesson to the crater glass"). The timeframe is declared but never tracked or tightened; no ticking clock alters decisions or tactics. The recollectionist's contemplative walk proceeds without urgency, and the deadline is retrospectively satisfied off-page. Label-only presence without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The motivation to discover why paths disappear is stated early, drives the task (elders send the recollectionist), and shapes the interpretive walk through the cave. The vision of the shepherd and the sleeping fault delivers the answer, which is then prepared for the elders. However, the desire is never conflicted or tested; the recollectionist does not doubt, struggle, or pay a cost for the discovery. Functional across beats with closure participation, but no friction between want and cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Cheerful gloom is named early ("The gloom here smiles"), recurs in the middle ("Cheerful gloom suits me; it keeps the world honest but not cruel"), and charges the final beat ("my cheerful gloom, which holds hands with gratitude in the dark"). The tone is coherent and modulates subtly across beats (whimsy, interpretive patience, quiet satisfaction). It colors the narrative voice and reweights the ending image. Present in setup, middle, and ending with tonal consistency and a charged reprise, but static register limits band ceiling.</comment>
