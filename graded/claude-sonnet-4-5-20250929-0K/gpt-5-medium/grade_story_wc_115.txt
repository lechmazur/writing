<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's contradictory impulses act in scene: religiously skeptical yet tracking patterns through psychic calls, pursuing truth while denying belief. Interiority is embodied through physical sensation—"my palms intelligent," "weight does not lie when your hands tremble"—and micro-choices (turning the wheel, opening the valve) carry visible cost. The father's death backstory is extensive (~20% of text) but anchors present action through the valve wheel and constrains the final choice to forgive and open the line. Minor deduction for diagnostic phrasing "drowsy alertness, a poised fatigue" that approaches label-speak, though it's offset by the physical grounding.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred: the piece builds pressure through layered reflection, radio fragments, and the protagonist's gradual engagement with the valve wheel, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant—forgiveness of the wheel, not the people, with the act of opening the valve). The closure is clean: "I forgave the wheel, and I set it back to open, and the sigh unknotted" forecloses vengeance or blame with a visible physical act and felt cost. Orientation is anchored early (tunnel, alone, valve wheel, radio). One meaningful deepening occurs when the narrator turns the wheel and imagines the quota day, reweighting the stake from ghost-hunting to confronting complicity. Cost is legible in the refusal to forgive human actors and the choice to correct the mechanical wrong.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The tunnel's cold, dripping arch, and the valve wheel as micro-setting constrain the protagonist's actions and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the narrator's engineer bias: "beads of condensation ringed it like a rosary," "droplets quivered like verdicts." The radio and metronome of dripping water anchor the narrator's focus and modulate with pressure. The valve wheel itself becomes the setting's fulcrum, and opening it is both spatial act and thematic resolution. Spatial choreography is clear throughout; the tunnel's acoustic properties (echoes, hush) intensify the atmosphere and reflect the protagonist's internal reckoning.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding "the weight of a swallowed truth"—is signaled early and tightened when the narrator engages the valve wheel, imagining the quota day and his father's death. The act of turning the wheel narrows options: the protagonist could leave it closed (preserving mystery) or open it (correcting the wrong). Turning it a quarter, then setting it to open, forecloses the path of passive investigation and commits to a stance. The cost is felt in the refusal to forgive human actors and in the deliberate correction of the mechanical state. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens: each fragment (calls, echoes, valve wheel handling) deepens engagement until the final act reweights the stake from passive appraisal to corrective forgiveness of the tool itself.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—truth's weight, the distinction between human complicity and mechanical fact, forgiveness as selective and embodied—emerges through the valve wheel's dual role as relic and active agent. The protagonist's refusal to forgive people ("I did not forgive the caller or the partner, or even my father") while forgiving the wheel is a non-literal answer to the central question, charged by the final image of opening the valve and the "sigh unknotted." Subtext operates in the radio psychic's banal consolation ("a female ancestor forgave everything") contrasted with the protagonist's precise, limited forgiveness. The piece resists moralizing: the narrator's stance is partial, tool-focused, and bound by trade logic ("belief kept its distance"). Recurring images—beads, pressure, weight, breath—accumulate meaning without overt symbolic declaration. The ending reconfigures the ghost-shift premise as a habit of intention rather than supernatural presence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single-POV, stable first-person voice with a distinct perceptual signature: the narrator filters all sensation through engineering idiom ("pressure means work," "threads like rosary sorrow," "hands got me out"). Diction is controlled and voice-particular, balancing lyric compression ("cold dripped from the arch in slow beads") with trade-specific clarity ("valve wheel unscrewed from a side pipe"). Psychic distance is consistent; the narrator's interiority is embodied and bounded by what can be known. No dialogue, so no dialogue assessment. Internal monologue under peak stress (turning the wheel, imagining the quota day) remains syntactically coherent and voice-consistent. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy. The prose modulates with pressure: short clauses tighten during the valve-turning beat, then lengthen in the denouement.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally; information density is high with most lines doing double duty (e.g., "Beads of condensation ringed it like a rosary, and grease made the beads shine" anchors setting, motif, and tactile focus). No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Minor deduction for near-synonym repetition in tight sequence: "hush," "quiet," "silent" appear within the opening three beats without functional variation, and "weight" recurs six times in the final third, some instances nearing redundancy ("weight of a swallowed truth," "weight does not lie," "weight arrived in my arms," "memory of the weight"). Figurative language is generally coherent, though "drowsy alertness, a poised fatigue" edges toward contradictory abstraction. Syntax is purposeful; the prose breathes in step with scene pressure. Clarity and propulsion are strong; no line-level opacity or scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—factory ghost as habit of intention, forgiveness directed at a tool rather than people, truth's weight as tactile appraisal—is specific and non-obvious. The piece avoids the ghost-story template by reframing haunting as pattern and pressure rather than spectral presence. The protagonist's engineer lens and radio-psychic triangulation method are fresh angles. The valve wheel's dual role (relic and active agent) and the selective forgiveness (wheel, not partner) feel earned in hindsight. Minor deduction for the ghost-shift premise itself being a familiar trope (industrial haunting, unresolved death) and the protagonist's arc (skeptic confronts mystery, finds human failure) trending toward recognizable territory. The piece transforms these through the engineer's idiom and the tool-focused resolution, but the core frame is not radically original.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The reckless abandoned-mill explorer drives key beats: entering alone, tracking psychic calls to the tunnel, handling the valve wheel, and turning it despite uncertainty. The trait is established early ("I had come alone, reckless as ever") and shapes the climactic choice to turn the wheel and open the valve. The cost is visible in the refusal to leave the mystery untouched and in the physical engagement with pressure. The character's decisions alter tactics and foreclose the path of passive observation. Minor deduction: the recklessness is asserted more than it is tested on the page; no moment where the protagonist weighs safety against investigation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The beaded valve wheel appears in setup ("valve wheel unscrewed from a side pipe"), is handled and described multiple times (beads, condensation, grease, rosary imagery), drives the climactic choice (turning it, counting threads, setting it to open), and charges the final image ("I forgave the wheel, and I set it back to open"). The object's evolving use—from relic to active agent—reweights the stake and forecloses the path of passive appraisal. The wheel's specific mechanics (threads, pressure, sigh) are irreplaceable; swapping it for another artifact would break the story's logic. Cost is legible in the act of opening the valve and the refusal to forgive human actors while forgiving the tool.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The factory ghost shift is introduced early ("the factory ghost shift behind"), shapes the protagonist's investigation (tracking calls, mapping panic, following the trail), and reappears in the tunnel ("I heard the ghost shift anyway"). The concept is reframed at closure as a "habit of force" rather than supernatural presence, and the protagonist distinguishes between the town's fear-driven hearing and his own "metronome" of practical reckoning. The shift premise enables the investigation but does not constrain the final choice; the protagonist could reach the same valve-wheel decision without the ghost frame. Moderately essential but not indispensable to the closure effect.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Religiously skeptical constrains the protagonist's stance throughout: "I swore at theories and at heaven, because belief never tightened a bolt properly," yet the narrator tracks patterns through psychic calls, a contradiction that drives the method and shapes the final stance ("belief kept its distance"). The trait enables the investigation (skepticism allows pattern-tracking without credulity) and informs the ending's refusal to forgive human actors or accept the psychic's easy consolation. Visible cost: the protagonist cannot access the emotional comfort the callers seek and must rely on mechanical correction ("I forgave the wheel"). Minor deduction: the trait is articulated more than it is tested in a discrete choice; no beat where belief and skepticism directly compete.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Appraise drives the investigation (the protagonist came "to appraise more than scrap, though, more than salvageable weight") and the climactic engagement with the valve wheel ("I lifted the beaded valve wheel and felt the cold make my palms intelligent"). The action shapes the method (weighing truth as tactile assessment) and the final choice (opening the valve as corrective appraisal). The verb is specific to the engineer's idiom and irreplaceable; swapping it for "investigate" or "measure" would reduce the tactile, trade-focused texture. Cost is legible in the physical engagement and the refusal to abstract the truth. Minor deduction: the appraisal is continuous rather than discrete, so it's harder to trace major turns to a single appraisal beat.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interpreting frantic calls to talk-radio psychics is signaled early and its mechanics matter: the protagonist maps timestamps, tracks panic surges, marks intersections, and follows the trail like a surveyor. The method shapes the investigation and establishes the protagonist's pattern-driven approach. It reappears in the tunnel when the radio delivers a new caller and the psychic's banal answer contrasts with the protagonist's tool-focused forgiveness. Minor deduction: the method enables the setup but does not constrain the final choice; the protagonist could open the valve without the radio-call method. The mechanics are purposeful but replaceable with another pattern-tracking device.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The abandoned train tunnel pressures choices throughout: it isolates the protagonist, provides the valve wheel and pipe, supplies acoustic properties (echoes, hush, metronome drip) that modulate with pressure, and serves as the spatial anchor for the climactic turning of the wheel. The tunnel's cold and condensation are embodied in the protagonist's perception and charge the final image. The setting's constraint is indispensable; removing the tunnel and relocating the valve wheel elsewhere would break the story's logic and atmosphere. The tunnel is both macro-setting (location) and micro-setting (the valve and pipe) that enable the corrective act.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The timeframe—during the hush that follows a sudden confession—is introduced in the opening line and recurs as a motif ("the hush returned, not empty but complete"). The hush shapes the protagonist's perceptual stance (listening, waiting) and modulates with pressure (radio cracks, then silence; echoes drift; metronome of drops). The timeframe is lyric and atmospheric rather than a live clock; it does not tighten decisions through urgency or countdown. The hush charges the final image ("When the hush thinned, I stepped into the cold morning") but does not constrain tactics. Moderately purposeful but replaceable with another time-marker without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The motivation to find the weight of a swallowed truth drives the investigation, the engagement with the valve wheel, and the final choice to open it. The desire is dramatized through action (tracking calls, descending into the tunnel, handling the wheel) and conflicted (the protagonist seeks truth but refuses belief, wants weight but not guilt). Friction between the want (to measure the truth) and the cost (confronting his father's death and the partner's complicity) is legible on the page. The motivation forecloses the path of passive grief and commits to corrective forgiveness. The stake is internalized and specific to the protagonist's engineer idiom.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Drowsy alertness is articulated explicitly ("It kept me in drowsy alertness, a poised fatigue, a focus born of denial and need") and modulates with pressure: the protagonist is alert enough to track echoes and turn the wheel but drowsy enough to imagine his father and let reflection layer. The tone supports the Accumulative lens by balancing vigilance with drift. It charges the final image when the protagonist steps into the morning "like a man leaving a shift," carrying the tone's duality forward. Minor deduction: the tone is asserted more than it is embodied in sentence rhythm or perceptual breakdown; the prose remains lucid and controlled throughout without syntactic drowsiness or attentional lapse.</comment>
