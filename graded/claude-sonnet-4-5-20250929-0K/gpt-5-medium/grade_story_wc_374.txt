<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interior voice is distinctive and specific ("luminous skeptic," taste-navigation), with clear contradictory impulses (glows with borrowed power yet questions). The arc from doubt to companionship is earned through on-page micro-choices (agreeing to walk with Mirelle, accepting the story). Mirelle's entrance and dialogue reveal character under pressure, though her storm-bearer trait remains somewhat abstract. The ending choice to "carry your story" forecloses solitary skepticism with felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds through sensory density, motif accumulation (taste, weather, elections), and a cadence shift when the narrator moves from observation to accompaniment. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (the ring's taste shifts from direction to pronoun "us," the narrator accepts Mirelle's story); the cost is legible in the line "which is to say I will let it carry me when the taste of alone returns." Orientation anchors cleanly in the opening paragraph (bluff, aurora, narrator's sensors). One meaningful deepening occurs when the narrator joins Mirelle at the weatherbearer gathering and witnesses restraint over spectacle.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lavender bluff under aurora provides concrete spatial grounding and charges the final image ("we walked back over the lavender bluff"). The tin compass ring's taste-navigation creates micro-setting specificity (pennies, unripe pear, honey, ash) that constrains choices at the meadow fork. Sensory detail is filtered through the narrator's professional priorities (sensors, taste-based navigation) and shifts under pressure (taste changes from direction to pronoun). The forest elections function as both atmosphere and constraint, shaping the timeframe and the weatherbearers' convergence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: to learn why some people carry weather. The piece tightens when the narrator moves from passive observation to active participation (walking beside Mirelle during the final count). Agency is expressed through the decision to walk with Mirelle and to carry her story, forecloses solitary skepticism with visible cost. The fork in the meadow where "companionship was the shortest path" narrows options under accumulative pressure. Mirelle's storm and the weatherbearer gathering apply external pressure that tests the narrator's skepticism.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: weather as unfinished debate, forests electing custodians, the compass ring shifting from direction to pronoun. The ending offers a resonant answer to the central question without stating a moral: "So no one loses the debate to their own reflection... so the sky can remember it belongs to the ground." Subtext operates through taste (the narrator's sensory navigation implicitly parallels emotional orientation). The final image reweights prior material: the narrator's skepticism transforms into a willingness to be carried by another's story when alone returns.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The narrator's perceptual signature is distinctive and consistent: taste-navigation, borrowed power imagery, sensor-mediated perception. POV distance is stable; interior access remains first-person throughout. Dialogue is minimal but goal-driven: Mirelle's lines advance the weatherbearer logic and press the narrator's skepticism. Diction is purposefully elevated and consistent with the narrator's voice ("terrestrially cosmic," "violet breath that tasted like elders telling a joke"). Psychic distance compresses appropriately during the walk to the weatherbearer gathering.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high: most lines advance character (taste-navigation), setting (lavender bluff, aurora), or theme (weather as custodianship). However, several beats carry figurative density that slows momentum without pattern-teaching: "as if gravity were reciting her biography," "smiled like lightning reframed as etiquette," "aurora crackled, loud as vinyl." These metaphors are coherent individually but accumulate without clear payoff at closure. The final paragraph partially recovers with concrete images ("over the lavender bluff while the forests finished elections").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of taste-navigation, forest elections, and weatherbearers is specific and non-obvious. The tin compass ring that points via flavor is a fresh inflection on navigation/guidance tropes. The piece commits fully to its premise (sensing through taste, weather as democratic custodianship) and follows the implications to closure. However, the futuristic-nostalgia frame (sensors, archive footage, history turning into circuitry) remains somewhat ornamental; these elements are mentioned but do not constrain choices or shape the ending as tightly as the taste-navigation does.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Present by opening line ("luminous skeptic"). The narrator's skepticism shapes the encounter with Mirelle (questioning the ring's validity, asking why she carries weather). The decision to walk with Mirelle during the final count and to carry her story are key turns. The character is signaled early, involved in two major beats (questioning Mirelle, joining the walk), and participates in closure (accepting the story to be carried). However, the skepticism trait is somewhat told rather than tested through on-page pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Present in opening third ("tin compass ring on my thumb"). Used in multiple beats: initial description (needle as flavor), Mirelle touching it (metallic spring unfurls), meadow fork (taste of honey guiding companionship), weatherbearer gathering (softened to vanilla, fern, thunderhead sugar). Returns with reweighted meaning at closure: the taste shifts from direction to pronoun "us." The ring's evolving flavors constrain navigation choices and charge the final image. Specific mechanics (taste-based guidance) are irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Introduced early ("emergent compass, a quiet federation of cues"). The concept shapes tactics: the narrator navigates by taste rather than visual cues, and the ring's guidance is tested at the meadow fork. Mirelle's line "You have an emergent compass... but not the story that makes it honest" reframes the concept and drives the decision to walk with her. The concept participates in closure when the taste shifts from direction to pronoun, reweighting the stake from individual navigation to collective orientation.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Mentioned twice ("terrestrially cosmic logic of the weatherwalkers," "terrestrially cosmic and small"). The phrase appears in the narrator's stated goal and in a reflective moment, but it does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action. The attribute functions more as thematic coloring than as a trait that shapes choices. No visible tradeoff or cost is tied to being "terrestrially cosmic."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Present in the middle third ("storms converge to be counted instead of to conquer") and at the weatherbearer gathering. The action of converging drives the final count and the restraint of the storm. The narrator's decision to walk beside Mirelle is motivated by the need to witness this convergence. The action shapes the ending: "every gust bowed, and every cloud counted itself aloud." Removing "converge" would require substantial rewriting of the weatherbearer logic and the closure effect.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Introduced early ("Its needle was a flavor... navigate by sensing through taste changes"). The method is used across multiple beats: pennies/unripe pear (directional guidance), rain cut with violets and tin (warning of Mirelle's arrival), honey (companionship at the fork), citrus/ash (straying near impatience/memory), vanilla/fern/thunderhead sugar (final count completion). The method constrains navigation choices and shapes the ending when taste shifts from direction to pronoun. Mechanics are specific and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Present from the opening line ("lavender bluff under aurora"). The setting provides spatial grounding and atmosphere (aurora crackling, violet breath). The bluff is revisited at closure ("walked back over the lavender bluff"). The lavender petals voting "into the air like confetti" links the setting to the forest elections timeframe. However, the setting does not constrain choices as tightly as the taste-navigation or the tin ring; it functions more as backdrop than as a pressure that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Mentioned in the opening third ("the hour while forests hold elections") and revisited at closure ("while the forests finished elections"). The timeframe provides urgency and frames the weatherbearer gathering ("final count"), but it does not create a live clock that tightens decisions beat-by-beat. The forests' election is more atmospheric constraint than tactical pressure. The narrator's choices are shaped more by Mirelle's presence and the ring's guidance than by the election timeline.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stated early ("I had come to learn why some people carry weather with them"). The motivation drives the encounter with Mirelle (asking why she carries weather, questioning the ring's validity). The desire is tested through on-page choices: agreeing to walk with Mirelle, witnessing the weatherbearer gathering. The friction between skepticism and the need to learn creates pressure. The motivation is resolved at closure when Mirelle provides the answer and the narrator accepts the story, foreclosing solitary inquiry with felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Tone is established through imagery: sensors and archive footage suggest a future, while "old kind of democracy the new world finally noticed" and "aurora crackled, loud as vinyl" evoke nostalgia. The tone modulates subtly as the narrator moves from observation to companionship. However, the futuristic elements (sensors, circuitry, archive footage) remain somewhat ornamental; they are mentioned but do not pressure the closure image as strongly as the taste-navigation or the weatherbearer logic. The tone charges the final image moderately ("the future found quorum") but could be stronger.</comment>
