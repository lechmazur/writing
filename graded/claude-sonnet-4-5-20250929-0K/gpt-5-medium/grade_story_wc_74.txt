<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lina's motivation (proving strangers remember kindness) is established early and her nightly painting ritual shows consistent character logic. However, her interior life relies heavily on poetic abstraction rather than embodied contradiction—"methodically hopeful heart" and "insomnia cooled" tell more than they dramatize. The neighbor's return provides a mild test, but Lina's response (brewing tea, speaking without words) feels like arrival rather than a choice that forecloses a path. Interiority often uses elevated register ("coaxing pictures that were more memory than plan") that reads more authorial than character-bound.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through the pattern of painting faces and receiving offerings, culminating in the neighbor's return with the map and closure in shared tea. Orientation anchors (Lina, greenhouse, waxing moon) arrive within the first paragraph. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the neighbor confirms the kindness loop, the final gold dot is placed, and the piece crystalizes its premise without a decisive external change. Cost is implied (years of insomnia, anonymous labor) but not sharpened in the final beat; the tea-brewing feels more affirming than foreclusive. One meaningful deepening occurs when the neighbor presents the map, reweighting Lina's solitary ritual into a shared practice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The rooftop greenhouse is vividly anchored with sensory specifics—saffron quiet, peppery tomato vines, smog-choked city—and recurs across beats (lemon trees, wilted basil, camping stove). The brush and its moon-tipped properties constrain Lina's method, and the greenhouse functions as both workspace and shrine, shaping the atmosphere of the ending. Spatial choreography is clean; the box, canvas, and stove are handled on the page. Minor: some description tilts toward catalog ("fern and netted cucumber") without immediate pressure use, but the setting charges the final image when "the greenhouse became a small republic."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: proving strangers remember kindness. The piece accumulates evidence (folded notes, coins, moth, orange, weeping strangers) and the neighbor's arrival provides a tightening when he shows his paint-marked palms and reveals he has continued the message. However, the escalation is more confirmation than complication—Lina never doubts or confronts a counter-pressure that tests her commitment. The resolution (brewing tea, speaking without words) feels like validation rather than a choice with visible cost. One meaningful deepening occurs, satisfying the accumulative lens, but agency at closure is muted.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—kindness as a lost language that strangers can still speak—emerges organically from the portrait trail and is embodied in the calligrapher's brush, the gold dots, and the neighbor's return. The final image (tea over mint that remembered rain, strangers adjusting burdens) offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Minor slip: "old grammar of decency" and "Not a miracle...just the old grammar" edge toward direct statement. The market daydream (vendors speaking lost languages, prices sung, blessings painted in steam) is vivid and integrates the core concept without becoming allegorical.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited on Lina; no head-hopping. Voice carries a distinct lyric texture with purposeful compression ("saffron quiet," "moon parceled its light into thin, forgiving coins"). Psychic distance is controlled, though some lines drift into elevated register that feels more authorial than character-bound ("syllables falling like beads, reshaping the air"). Dialogue is absent, appropriately so for this solitary, contemplative mode. The neighbor's arrival introduces a second presence but interaction remains non-verbal, maintaining voice coherence. Filter verbs are few; free indirect style is clean when used.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. However, several beats show overwriting: "The rooftop greenhouse breathed a saffron quiet" stacks metaphor and synaesthesia; "syllables falling like beads, reshaping the air around their wares" mixes vehicles. Template cadence appears in the middle third: "She painted a courier...a nurse...a boy" (list structure), and synonym loops recur ("lost languages" mentioned three times without functional shift, "saffron quiet" bookends without reweighting). Clarity remains high, but the elevated diction and figurative density in nearly every sentence of high-stakes beats (neighbor's arrival, final tea) trigger the overwriting deduction. No major scaffolding or pronoun drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of lost languages, anonymous street art, and kindness-as-currency is specific and non-obvious. The calligrapher's brush as heirloom traded for a portrait, moon-tipped and light-drinking, transforms the familiar "magical object" trope through grounded particulars. The greenhouse as shrine and the neighbor's return with a map close the loop without formula. Minor: the "strangers remember kindness" premise echoes common writing-prompt templates; transformation is present but not radical. Risk-taking in lyric compression and non-verbal closure elevates without obscuring stakes. No close echoes of famous lines detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lina is present throughout and her choices (unlatching the door, lifting the brush, placing the final dot, brewing tea) shape each beat. Early signal strong; beats: greenhouse entry, painting ritual, neighbor interaction, final tea = four touches. However, her agency at closure (brewing tea, speaking without words) is passive reception rather than a decision that narrows options. Causal pressure moderate; closure linkage present but soft. Swappability low (insomniac painter is specific). Cost connection weak—insomnia mentioned but not dramatized as a trade-off in the ending.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The brush appears in the silk box (early signal), drinks moonlight, is dipped in moonlit water to write sounds as strokes (middle development), and rests "full, as if the moon had written them too" in the closure beat. Three distinct beats; causal pressure strong (enables the painting method); closure linkage clear. Specificity high: moon-tipped, calligrapher's heirloom, traded for a portrait. Cost connection moderate (years of use imply sacrifice but not dramatized on-page). Gate test: setup ✓, development ✓, payoff ✓. Minor: the final mention is descriptive rather than causally active.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lost languages frame the core concept: the market daydream where vendors speak them, prices are sung, and Lina writes "those sounds as strokes, not letters." The neighbor's legend reads "the language they have not forgotten." Early signal via title implications and daydream; middle development in the painting method; closure participation when "they spoke without words, fluent at last." Two gates clearly met. However, the concept shapes mood and theme more than it constrains tactics—Lina's painting process could function without the linguistic frame. Causal pressure moderate; swappability moderate (could be "forgotten gestures" or "old kindness").</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Methodically hopeful" appears as a label in paragraph 3 ("methodically hopeful despite nights stitched with relentless wakefulness") and again in paragraph 29 ("her methodically hopeful heart answered with measured gratitude"). Two mentions, both summary rather than embodied action. No on-page scene shows Lina choosing hope over despair with visible cost; the trait is told, not dramatized. Setup ✓, but middle development and payoff gates missed. Swappability high (could be "stubbornly hopeful" or "quietly persistent").</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Rouse" appears in the opening goal ("to rouse her stalled canvas and her doubting heart") and the neighbor's map legend ("rouse the quiet"). Early signal strong. The action is the painting ritual itself, which drives the middle beats and connects to the final gold dot. However, the verb "rouse" is more thematic echo than irreplaceable action—Lina paints, writes, and places dots; "rouse" could be swapped for "awaken" or "revive" with minor tonal shift. Causal pressure moderate; closure linkage present but the term itself is not causally load-bearing in the final image. Two beats; swappability moderate.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The method is signaled early ("learned to paint via daydreams sparked by moonlight") and demonstrated in the market daydream where Lina sees vendors speaking lost languages and translates them into strokes. The waxing moon "parceled its light into thin, forgiving coins," the brush "drank moonlight," and Lina dips it in "moonlit water." Three beats; causal pressure strong (the method enables the painting process); closure linkage moderate (moon holds its breath in the final third). Specificity high; swappability low. Gate test: setup ✓, development ✓, payoff moderate (moon mentioned but not causally active in the tea scene).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The rooftop greenhouse is anchored in the opening line and recurs across beats: box among lemon trees and basil, heat during painting, leaves attentive, camping stove for tea. Setting pressures choices by providing the workspace, shrine, and final refuge. Micro-setting elements (box, stove, mint) alter tactics and charge the closure ("the greenhouse became a small republic"). Early signal strong; four beats; causal pressure moderate to strong; closure linkage strong. Specificity high (rooftop, smog-choked city, glass panes). Cost connection moderate (greenhouse as sanctuary implies years of use but not dramatized trade-off).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The waxing moon appears in the opening, its light is described as "thin, forgiving coins," the brush drinks moonlight, and the moon "held its breath" near closure. Time of night ("waxing moon's glow") frames the scene but does not tighten decisions—Lina could paint under any moon phase. No on-page urgency tied to the moon's state; it functions more as atmosphere than clock. Setup ✓; development weak (moonlight enables the method but waxing vs. waning distinction does not alter tactics); payoff moderate (moon mentioned at closure but not causally decisive). Swappability moderate (could be "full moon" or "crescent moon" with minor adjustments).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Lina's motive is stated explicitly ("to prove that strangers remember kindness") and drives her nightly ritual of painting faces and leaving them on alley walls. The offerings she receives (notes, coins, moth, orange, weeping strangers) dramatize the motive's effect. The neighbor's return with the map and paint-marked palms validates the motive. Early signal strong; three beats; causal pressure strong. However, no on-page friction between want and cost—Lina's insomnia is mentioned but not shown as a trade-off in the moment of painting. The closure affirms rather than tests the motive. Gate test: setup ✓, development ✓, payoff ✓ but soft.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Saffron quiet" opens the piece and recurs in paragraph 19 ("the saffron quiet spread through fern and netted cucumber") and paragraph 30 ("the scene steeped in a deeper saffron quiet"). Tone is coherent and modulates subtly: opening establishes contemplative stillness, middle beat deepens during painting, final beat intensifies ("deeper") as the neighbor and Lina share tea. The tone charges the final image when the greenhouse becomes a "small republic" and Lina "dream[s] awake." Early signal strong; three beats; closure linkage strong. Specificity high; swappability low. Cost connection moderate (tone reflects earned stillness but not a visible price paid in the ending).</comment>
