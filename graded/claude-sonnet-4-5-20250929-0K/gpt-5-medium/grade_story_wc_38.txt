<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator and Mara are established through poetic interiority and embodied movement ("toes sketch treble clefs," "pivot, as a slip to the left"), but their motivation arrives primarily through reflection rather than dramatized micro-choices under immediate pressure. The "calm defiance" is declared repeatedly rather than tested in conflicting impulses. The final moment ("a breath that was almost a laugh") offers release but lacks a visible forfeiture or internal contradiction that would earn the shift. Mara's agency is strong in mid-beats (rolling dice, dancing cipher), but the narrator remains primarily observational.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of coded movement and marginal inscription that builds toward the liberation of drowned names; the closure lands when "the bridge carried the names back into our mouths" and the rigging hums with traffic. Orientation anchors (sunken lab, narrator + Mara, present tense) arrive clearly. One meaningful deepening occurs when doubt enters the lung and water withdraws from cabinets, reweighting the dominant stake. Cost is implied (the Warden's surveillance, the risk of discovery) but not shown as a forfeiture or visible consequence on the page. The lens holds, but the cost-proof test shows only conceptual repricing rather than felt loss.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The sunken laboratory is vividly particular ("rust sighed in the beams," "glass tablets etched by corrosion," "blue warning through the corridors") and constrains the protagonists' methods: they must use dance and coded journals because speech would trip alarms, and the floor is "the only page left to write on." The Warden Current functions as spatial pressure, narrowing their tactics. The hangman's dice and glass tablets are handled across multiple beats, charging the final image when the rigging hums. Sensory selection is purposeful and filtered through urgency. Minor deduction for occasional drift into abstraction ("barometric weight of the drowned names").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (liberating the drowned names) is signaled early and sustained. Pressure tightens when the Warden pulses a blue warning, forcing the protagonists to answer "in the negative space" and use doubt as the key that opens the vent. The middle turn (doubt entering the lung, water withdrawing) narrows options and changes knowledge. Agency is shared between Mara's choreographed cipher and the narrator's transcription. The resolution is earned by their method, but the cost remains conceptual (the risk, the patience) rather than a visible forfeiture or trade-off on the page. One meaningful tightening under the Accumulative lens suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme (encoding vulnerability as strength, making "what hurt into what held") emerges organically from the protagonists' method: they embed revolt within harmless drift, teach locks a new grammar, and use hesitation as cipher. The final image—"the knot deciding it had been a bow all along"—resonates without stating a moral. Subtext operates in gesture ("uncertainty was the solvent we carried") and the dance as encrypted language. Minor thematic echo in "to encrypt vulnerability as strength" risks labeling the core question, but the piece mostly dramatizes rather than declares. The question (doubt as key) reweights the closure without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single-POV first-person with stable focalization and a distinct lyrical texture ("rust sighed," "fish stitched between consoles like cursive annotations"). Diction is elevated but consistent, voice-motivated, and legible. No dialogue appears, so dialogue bullets are not evaluated. Psychic distance is controlled; the narrator's perceptual signature (reading the environment as code, translating Mara's movement into text) is character-specific. Minor density concern: occasional runs of figurative language in adjacent sentences ("treble clefs in the silt," "creak of cables above like weather") without pattern-teaching, but coherence holds and no filter-verb stacks appear. The prose reflects the focalizer's interpretive stance throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are distinct; information density is high (lines often do double duty as world-building and character revelation). Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; one mixed metaphor ("spider of the rigging had finished its web" after "we measured the timeframe as a spider spins") reuses the spider image without clear linkage. Occasional elevated register ("barometric weight," "lyrical code breaker") edges toward overwriting but remains legible. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; clarity and propulsion are maintained. Minor deduction for density near the threshold in high-pressure beats, but no closure-harming artifacts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of coded dance, marginal journal entries, and underwater setting feels specific and non-obvious; the premise (liberating names via choreography and doubt as solvent) is fresh. The story commits fully to its logic without retreat. Emotional truth (the protagonists' "old scar and fresh promise") grounds the conceptual premise. The hangman's dice as both metronome and cipher seed, and the use of hesitation as encoded polarity, show ingenuity. Minor deduction: the "calm defiance" and "mysterious familiarity" labels risk prompt-echo, but the execution transforms them through particular action. Risk-taking in structure and voice heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mara is present by the opening, drives the cipher through dance across multiple beats (rolling dice, circling pillar, pivoting), and her final breath charges the closure. Her choices (incorporating slips, using movement as explanation) alter tactics. She meets setup, development, and closure gates. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (dance constrains method) +0.8, closure linkage (her breath, the rigging's hum) +0.9, cost connection (her calm defiance tested by the Warden) +0.4. Observed action rather than narrator decision trends slightly lower.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Hangman's dice appear early (introduced ~20%), are used in two distinct beats (Mara rolls them, they click at closure), and their mechanics (letters and noose, remembering hesitation as number) shape the cipher method. They meet setup, development, and payoff gates. Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, causal pressure (dictate pen hesitation and polarity) +1.2, closure linkage (final click accompanies release) +1.0, specificity (noose motif, engineer's legacy) +0.6. Minus swappability −0.4 (another randomizer could function). Total adjustments yield high-7s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Calm defiance" is named early (present by ~15%), shapes Mara's stance across beats (refusing to correct slips, answering the Warden in negative space), and the final breath embodies it. It constrains tactics (they use patience and subtle revolt rather than force) and charges the ending. Setup, development, and payoff gates met. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure (shapes method) +0.8, closure linkage (breath, release) +0.8. Minus label-only mentions −0.3 (declared more than tested in conflicting choices). Trends mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Explains through dance" is demonstrated across multiple beats: Mara's toes sketch treble clefs, she circles the pillar, pivots and slips to convey the pattern, and touch conveys the next instruction. The trait is signaled early (~10%), constrains communication (speech would trip alarms), and shapes the cipher. Setup, development, and payoff gates met. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (dance as necessary code) +1.3, closure linkage (final gesture before release) +0.9, cost (requires physical proximity, Warden surveillance risk) +0.4. Minus slight swappability −0.5 (gesture-based code could vary). Total adjustments yield low-7s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Liberate" is the dominant stake, named early (~12%) and sustained: the protagonists free the drowned names pinned by the Warden. The action drives the middle turn (doubt opens the vent, water withdraws) and the closure (voices cross the rigging). Setup, development, and payoff gates met. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure (entire plot hinges on this goal) +1.4, closure linkage (names carried back, rigging hums) +1.3, irreplaceability (specific to the stake) +0.7. Minor swappability −0.3 (could be "rescue" or "release" with edits). Total adjustments yield high-6s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Coded journal entries" appear early (~18%), shape the method across beats (narrator writes entries as Mara dances, embedding revolt in maintenance notes), and the closure involves adding entries to the builders' journals. Setup, development, and payoff gates met. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure (journals as the medium of liberation) +1.0, closure linkage (entries become the bridge) +0.9, specificity (margins the Warden never watched) +0.5. Minus swappability −0.6 (another coded medium could function). Total adjustments yield mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The sunken laboratory is anchored early (opening line), constrains choices throughout (flooded tiles as the only page, alarms triggered by speech, Warden surveillance via corridors), and the rigging provides the closure image. Setup, development, and payoff gates met. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (environment forces cipher method) +1.3, closure linkage (rigging hums, web completed) +1.2, irreplaceability (underwater setting essential to logic) +0.8. No major frictions. Total adjustments yield mid-7s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"As a spider spins its web" is named early (~25%) as the timeframe metaphor and the rigging/web image returns at closure. It functions lyrically but does not tighten decisions on the page (no live clock or countdown). Setup and payoff gates met; middle development is weak (time does not narrow options mid-scene). Early signal +0.4, closure linkage (rigging web hums) +0.8, lyric reprise +0.5. Minus ornamental use (metaphor, not clock) −0.8, missing middle development (cap 3.4 waived by lyric exception, but pressure is low) −0.3. Total adjustments yield high-4s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"To encrypt vulnerability as strength" is stated mid-text (~35%) and reflected in the method (embedding revolt in drift, using hesitation as cipher). It drives the middle turn (doubt as key) and shapes the closure (knot becoming bow). Setup is late, but development and payoff gates are met. Late signal −0.3, two beats +0.9, causal pressure (motivation shapes tactics) +0.9, closure linkage (transformation motif) +0.8. Minus label-only phrasing −0.3 (stated rather than fully dramatized in conflicting wants). Total adjustments yield mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Mysterious familiarity" is invoked in the opening line and sustained through the narrator's recognition of the lab, the lyrical opacity of the prose, and the final release. Tone modulates with pressure (calm patience giving way to the Warden's warning, then release). Setup, development, and payoff gates met. Early signal +0.7, tone shifts with pressure +0.6, closure linkage (breath, release) +0.9, coherence across beats +0.5. Minus static stretches (tone does not vary sharply mid-scene) −0.3. Total adjustments yield mid-6s.</comment>
