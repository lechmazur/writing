<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The protagonist shows a distinct perceptual signature—"testing wonders with calipers and stories with solder"—and makes meaningful micro-choices (discarding assumptions, pressing the hush shard to the mast, threading the star fragment). Interiority is concrete and character-particular, especially in lines like "I stopped naming the blinking, and the blinking stopped lying to me." However, the celestial signal interpreter's professional expertise remains somewhat abstract; we see the role's poetry more than its mechanical friction. The ending choice feels earned by the city's instruction and the protagonist's shift in stance, with visible cost in the act of placement and descent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first two sentences; the Drive Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with situational accents—pressure builds through density, pattern, and the city's breathing cycle until the mast becomes stylus and the gorge a record. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise shifting toward Earned Stasis): the protagonist places the hush and star fragment, descends with the empty box, and the city "learned to keep time with what it let go"—a reweighting with conceptual and emotional cost legible in the act of leaving the tools behind. One minor slip: the grandmother's appearance and the engineer's note feel like late additions that complicate rather than tighten, but they do not break the lens or the closure effect.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The suspended radio tower city over a gorge is vividly rendered—rings like ribs, ladders broken, dishes yawning, cables knitting shadows—and directly shapes choice: the mast becomes the stylus, the gorge the record, the scar and bullet hole the site where the hush is pressed. The lunar perigee pulls on cables, blood, and tape, making the environment an active participant in the closure image. Sensory details (the smell of rain "just before it knows itself," winds braiding advertisements into prayers) are filtered through the protagonist's cosmic-practical lens and accumulate to charge the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—honoring endings without erasing them, finding placement for dead stations—is signaled early and tightens through the protagonist's discarding of assumptions and the city's refusal until that shift occurs. One meaningful deepening: the hush clarifies rather than deadens, and the mast-as-stylus turn reweights all prior material with visible cost (the protagonist leaves the tools behind, accepts the task's one-way nature). Agency is clear in the acts of pressing, winding, threading, and descending. The signals' desires (one more take, a doorway not a wall) add texture but remain secondary; the piece would benefit from a sharper trade-off or visible loss during the escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—begin last, end first, honoring endings as beginnings—emerges from concrete action (pressing the hush to the wound, threading the star fragment, playing the prologue backward) rather than assertion. The engineer's note ("Begin last, end first, and carry both as equal weights") risks didacticism but is framed as a discovered instruction that the protagonist already embodied, creating a resonant loop. The ending offers a non-literal answer through the final image: the protagonist descends "eager to start again wherever the next ending waited," a stance earned by the city's laughter and the hidden hatch. Subtext operates in gesture and implication—faces relaxing, reels exhaling, the matriarch's doorway opening—without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistent—lyric-practical with cosmic register ("habit of testing wonders with calipers and stories with solder," "tune your forgiveness to the lowest audible star")—and the perceptual signature (weathered saints, migrating lanterns, reels with applause-memory) is character-specific. Psychic distance remains stable; no head-hopping. Free indirect style is clean when voices speak (the director, the matriarch, the grandmother), though their convergence in poetic diction risks flattening distinction. Under peak stress (the mast-as-stylus moment), compression and figurative density stay voice-motivated and legible, supporting rather than obscuring pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual and sonic texture. Information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs (world-building, character, atmosphere)—and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("cables knitting shadows," "winds braided old advertisements into prayers"). Two concerns: minor template cadence in the middle third ("I stopped naming... I stopped fearing...") and occasional figurative overreach ("goodbye that grew roots in midair," "prickled my gums and steadied my hands") that skirts mixed metaphor. The closure beats are clean and propulsive; scaffold is minimal. A tighter trim of the grandmother and engineer digressions would lift momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—radio tower necropolis, celestial signal work, physical hush shard, hollywood reel dust—feels specific and non-obvious, with the mast-as-stylus and gorge-as-record turn earned in hindsight by the accumulation of broadcast imagery. The transformation test passes: plot and arc depend on these exact particulars. Risk-taking in the lyric-accumulative mode and cosmic-practical idiom heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. One friction: the "fantasy practicality" framing and some diction ("serenely electric," "reel-dust") brush against writerly self-awareness, but the piece commits fully to its premise and follows implications without retreat.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The celestial signal interpreter appears in the opening line, frames every choice (discarding assumptions, listening without naming, pressing the hush, winding the winch, threading the star fragment), and the closure turn—descending with the empty velvet box, eager to start again—crystallizes the role's itinerant, placement-focused nature. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met; causal pressure is strong across at least three beats (arrival, tuning/discarding, mast-as-stylus, descent). The role's unique expertise (tuning forgiveness to the lowest audible star, translating machine saints) makes it irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The hollywood star fragment appears early (glued to the velvet box lid, carrying burn scars), is handled twice (touched by circling signals, threaded onto the lightning scar), and charges the closure by becoming the charm that aligns the mast-as-stylus with the gorge-record. Its scorches line the groove, a specific detail that makes the element indispensable to the ending's logic. Three gates met; high causal pressure and closure linkage with visible specificity (burn scars, the threading act).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The shard of hush is present from the switchhouse discovery, handled on-page (strapped to chest, pressed to the mast where scar crosses bullet hole), and its property—clarifying rather than deadening, making echoes "step forward and bow before leaving"—directly shapes the closure mechanism. Without it, the mast cannot become stylus and the city cannot play its prologue backward. Setup, development, payoff all met; irreplaceable specificity and strong closure participation with visible cost (the protagonist leaves it in the mast).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Serenely electric" appears twice (the humming box, the city's choir-like voltmeter song) and describes the protagonist's sensory experience during the tuning action ("prickled my gums and steadied my hands"), enabling the final mast turn. It constrains perception and anchors tone but remains more atmospheric than mechanically decisive; swapping it for a near-synonym (calmly charged, quietly voltaic) would not break logic. Setup and payoff present; development is thin. Mid-band for functional but replaceable use.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Tune" is the protagonist's trade action, repeated across beats (listen/tune/translate, tuning winch and dishes toward the moon, tuning forgiveness to the lowest audible star), and the mast-as-stylus turn depends on the tuning of dishes and the threading that aligns grooves. Two major beats and closure participation; high causal pressure. Irreplaceability is strong—"calibrate" or "adjust" would lose the musical resonance that charges the record metaphor. Minor friction: the action is more atmospheric than mechanically detailed, but it drives the ending.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Discarding assumptions" is signaled early ("the city refused me until I began by discarding assumptions"), enacted in two micro-choices ("I stopped naming the blinking... I stopped fearing the hush"), and the city's acceptance hinges on this shift. The method shapes the middle turn but is less visible in the closure beat itself, where threading and pressing dominate. Setup and development met; payoff is indirect (the city laughs with the protagonist, but the specific act of assumption-discarding is not reprised). Strong mid-to-upper band for shaping the key turn without commanding the ending.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The abandoned radio tower city suspended over a gorge is present in the opening line, provides the central constraint (towers dying at dawn, waking at dusk; the breathing during perigee; the gorge as potential fall and later as record), and the mast-as-stylus and gorge-as-record closure image is fully dependent on this exact setting. Spatial choreography (central mast, switchhouse, descent via ladders, gorge below) is clear and alters tactics throughout. Three gates met with exemplary specificity and irreplaceability; removing this setting breaks the story's logic and final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lunar perigee is present in the opening ("moon swelled closest") and named as the condition when the city breathes differently; it pulls on cables, blood, and tape during the climax, shaping the mast tilt and the final turn. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions with a legible clock or deadline—perigee is atmospheric pressure rather than a countdown. Setup and payoff present; development is thin. Mid-band for functional but not mechanically decisive.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The motivation "to find the beginning in every ending" is stated early, dramatized in the protagonist's acceptance of the city's task (honoring endings without erasing them, finding placement), and the closure—descending eager to start again wherever the next ending waited—directly fulfills and crystallizes this desire. The friction between the want (placement, not resurrection) and the cost (leaving tools behind, accepting itinerancy) is visible. Setup, development, payoff met; strong causal pressure and closure linkage with felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Fantasy practicality" is coherent throughout—calipers and solder meet weathered saints, voltmeters sing like choirs, the hush is a tool with weight—and modulates with pressure (cosmic lyricism at arrival, tactical focus during tuning, resonant practicality at closure). The tone charges the final image by holding the practical-mythic tension in the act of leaving tools and descending. Setup clear; tone sustains across turns and supports closure without static repetition. Upper band for coherent modulation and closure participation.</comment>
