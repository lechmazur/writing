<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrator's claustrophobic compulsion is embodied through concrete sensory choices—"belly against rock, breath rationed"—and internal contradiction drives the journey (fear versus compulsion to Return). The final renunciation of the gold fleck is earned through the archive moment where she sees her own name and the note "Return when you can bear the room," creating a visible cost. Minor tension: the phrase "tracks invisible things" edges toward a label when it could be more deeply woven into micro-choices earlier, but the escalation through the facility and the choice to leave the fleck ground the arc solidly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the protagonist powers down the terminal, leaves the fleck, and exits—foreclosing her claim and honoring the unremembered with felt cost (she "laughed, and it sounded wrong"). The inferred lens is Causal with Accumulative texture: each beat (cave entry, door unsealing via fleck, terminal wake, reading names, finding her own note, leaving fleck) tightens options and the ending image reweights the theft. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words (cave mouth, tidal window, narrator identity). One micro turn (discovering her own name) sets up the final renunciation without fragmenting the drive.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting constrains every choice: the tidal window creates urgency, the entrance squeeze embodies claustrophobia, the door's phase-transition lock requires the fleck's heat-and-cold mechanics, and the terminal's location in the "intake room" with "brine-wet racks tilted like pews" charges the ritual tone. Body-as-setting is vivid: "pressed my face to granite and measured the air seam with my lips." The ice-knitting seal at exit provides a final spatial constraint that mirrors the opening breath-hold, and sensory selection reflects the narrator's priorities (cold pull of ocean, magnetic itch of buried wire).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Return what I took and stand by the unremembered—is signaled early and tightens through escalation: cave squeeze tests resolve, door unlocking via fleck raises cost, terminal scroll forces public witness, and discovering her own name reframes the act from restitution to self-recognition. Agency is layered: the protagonist chooses to speak names aloud, chooses to leave the fleck (renunciation with visible cost), and exits before the tide closes the window. The pressure coheres under the Causal lens with Accumulative texture; coincidence (tidal window, the archived note) complicates but does not solve—the resolution is her decision to leave the fleck and the closure carries undeniable cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—being noticed by the world versus remaining invisible—emerges from concrete particulars: the intern "good at not being noticed," the theft of a fleck that should have stayed soldered, the facility erased by bureaucracy, and the final discovery of her own archived note. The ending reweights the premise non-literally: leaving the fleck answers the thematic question (she has borne the room and been seen) without moralizing. The recurring motif "tracks invisible things" and "the world will notice me back" accumulates pressure and the closure image—fog on the seam, slip through while solid deciding—resonates as stance crystallization. No prompt-label intrusion; subtext operates through image (pews, communion, saintly gold) and the phrase "Return when you can bear the room" lands with earned poignancy.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Single POV with a distinct perceptual signature: "magnetic itch of buried wire," "air seams whispering from rock," "pressed my face to granite and measured the air seam with my lips." Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close interiority during panic ("counted drips"), slight withdrawal during list-reading ("coordinates, depth, and a footnote of failure written in numbers"). Diction remains within the focalizer's technical-poetic lexicon; purposeful compression ("unlipped with a tired sigh") and sentence fragments ("A codex margin illuminant...") serve voice without obscuring clarity. Free indirect style is clean, no head-hopping, and rhythm tightens under stress (short clauses during squeeze, longer cadences in the archive moment).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with vivid particulars: "the entrance squeeze pinched my ribs like a hand I owed money," "ice bridged the broken gap," "frost lacquered it delicate." Information density is high—most sentences advance setting, character stakes, or thematic texture. Minor loop: "crashing hush" appears three times across the story; while it serves as a motif, the third use ("inside, the crashing hush became a constant pressure") edges toward paraphrase of the opening anchor without adding new pressure. A few filter verbs ("I felt the cold pull") are present but voice-motivated. Figurative language is purposeful and consistent; no template cadence or synonym churn, and the final image ("evening metal," "sea took a long breath") recharges the opening without explaining.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—claustrophobic spelunker returning a monastic gold fleck to an undersea facility via phase-transition locks within a tidal window—is specific and non-obvious. The story transforms the "return stolen object" template through embodied claustrophobia, technical constraint (brine conductivity, thermal seals), and the archive twist (her own name in the log). Risk-taking is evident in the compressed temporal structure, the interleaving of sensory tracking with bureaucratic erasure, and the refusal to resolve the larger fate of the facility—closure rests on personal renunciation. The fleck's dual role (luck charm, sensor component, communion token) and the final choice to leave it feel inevitable in hindsight. Within-band bonus: unconventional pressure sources (phase transitions, undersea cable whispers) heighten stakes without gimmickry.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Claustrophobic spelunker present in setup (cave entry under pressure), drives middle choices (navigating squeeze, pressing face to granite, tracking air seams), and executes the closure (leaving the fleck, exiting before the tide). The trait creates both obstacle and expertise: claustrophobia forces rationed breath and panic management, while spelunking skill enables navigation. The final renunciation—leaving the fleck—grows from the character's arc (intern to witness). High irreplaceability: remove the claustrophobia and the physical pressure collapses; remove the spelunking and access is implausible. Cost is visible: "belly against rock, breath rationed," "panic hummed," and the rush to exit before drowning.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Gold fleck appears in setup (theft years ago), is handled in two causal beats (pressed to door contact to unfreeze lock, inserted into terminal to power system), and is left at closure with reweighted meaning (no longer luck, now communion/restitution). Each use is mechanically distinct: first as thermal bridge via breath-frost, second as circuit closer, third as renunciation. Specificity matters: "codex margin illuminant" ties to monastic history and "soldered to a sensor board" ties to brine conductivity; a generic key or token could not bridge ice or sweeten conductivity. The hesitation at the end ("hesitated, then set it on the contact pad and left it") foregrounds the cost. Closure participation is decisive: the act of leaving it completes the Return and answers the archived note.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Undersea cables shape the facility's purpose (listening to fault currents and shipwreck crosstalk), provide the sensory texture ("cables spoke in thermal groans and attic whispers"), and create the condition for the machine to wake ("cables slack and sing low"). Present in setup (tracking invisible things points to the cables), middle (cables as the facility's ear), and closure (the terminal answers via cable data). Causal pressure: the cables' slack state between tidal changes enables the terminal to function, thus gating the entire mission window. Moderate irreplaceability: the concept could be swapped for another signal network (seismic, satellite) with edits, but the undersea/brine specificity integrates tightly with the phase-transition door and the tidal timeframe.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Tracks invisible things" appears early as self-description, enables navigation (air seams, magnetic itch of buried wire, cold pull of ocean), and explains both her original intern role and her return capability. The trait constrains on-page action: she must press her face to granite to measure the air seam, must feel the magnetic itch to locate the door, must count drips to manage panic. Cost is implicit but visible: hyper-sensitivity to invisible currents is survival skill and compulsion ("guided less by courage than by compulsion"). Closure linkage: the final line about breathing and slipping through while "solid was still deciding" echoes the tracking skill. Slight swappability: "hyper-aware" could replace it with minor edits, lowering irreplaceability slightly.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Return is the stated mission, frames every beat (cave entry, door approach, terminal interaction, speaking names, leaving fleck, exit), and defines the closure (she completes the Return and leaves). The action encompasses both physical return (to the facility) and restitution (of the fleck and witness to the names). Major turns trace directly to Return: unlocking the door to Return inside, pressing RETURN key to finish the program, deciding to leave the fleck as final Return. High irreplaceability: swap "Return" for "retrieve," "explore," or "sabotage" and the thematic weight and closure logic collapse. Cost is undeniable: she risks drowning, confronts her theft, and renounces her luck charm. The archived note "Return when you can bear the room" charges the action with meta-textual weight.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Phase transitions appear early (door seals "worked through phase transitions, brine freezing where heat skipped"), are used mechanically in the key middle beat (breathing on the fleck to create ice bridge, then heat turning "the boundary into a decision point"), and close the story (ice knitting again at exit, "slip through while solid was still deciding"). The method is specific and irreplaceable: heat/cold cycle via breath, fleck conductivity, and brine freezing are tightly braided. Causal pressure: phase transitions gate both entry and exit within the tidal window. Closure linkage: the final image of fogging the seam and slipping through mirrors the door-opening beat. The mechanics are signaled, demonstrated, and paid off, meeting all three gates with high specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Forgotten research facility supplies the mission target, houses the terminal and archive, and provides spatial constraints (corroded door, narrow corridors, intake room with tilted racks). Present in setup (tracking points to "the forgotten research facility no one admits existed"), structures middle action (navigating corridors, reaching terminal), and anchors closure (powering down, leaving fleck, exiting). The setting's history (listened to undersea cables, mapped for a war, funding vanished) charges the thematic stakes (bureaucratic erasure, unremembered workers). Micro-setting strength: the terminal's RETURN key and the pew-like racks create ritual tone. Moderate irreplaceability: a different abandoned facility type (lab, bunker) could work with edits, but the undersea/cable specificity and tidal access are tightly integrated.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tidal changes gate the entire mission: opening line establishes "between tidal changes, the cave mouth opened," middle beats track urgency ("the tide would turn soon, and the tunnel would drown its air"), and exit is a race against closure ("by the door I felt the chill where ice was knitting again"). The timeframe is live and tracked: entrance during slack, work at the terminal while cables sing low, exit before the cave floods. Cost is immediate: miss the window and drown. Causal pressure: the tidal clock forces the decision to leave the fleck rather than linger, and the final image ("the sea took a long breath") mirrors the opening held-breath metaphor. High irreplaceability: remove the tidal constraint and urgency collapses; no other timeframe integrates as tightly with phase transitions and undersea cables.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation—to stand by the unremembered—is stated early, dramatized through the act of speaking names aloud ("I spoke them aloud, one by one, my voice cracking like ice"), and tested when she discovers her own name in the archive. Friction arises between the desire to honor the dead and the impulse to keep the fleck (luck, self-preservation). The closure choice—leaving the fleck—enacts the motivation with visible cost (she renounces her talisman). The motivation is layered: restitution for theft, witness for the erased, and self-recognition. Slight tell-reliance: "I came to Return what I took, and to stand by the unremembered" is declaration rather than discovery, but the archive beat and final choice dramatize it fully.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Crashing hush appears in setup ("I waited for the crashing hush to deepen"), recurs in the facility ("inside, the crashing hush became a constant pressure"), and implicitly frames the exit (returning to tidal breath). The tone—suspended violence, muted intensity—modulates with pressure: claustrophobic squeeze tightens it, archive moment deepens it, and the laugh that "sounded wrong in the crashing hush" charges the dissonance. Coherent through turns: the oxymoron sustains tension between silence and oceanic force. The final image ("the sea took a long breath") reprises the tone without naming it. Closure linkage: tone shapes the ending's restraint and the choice to exit quietly. High specificity: "crashing hush" is distinct and irreplaceable; "eerie silence" or "oppressive quiet" would lose the oceanic paradox.</comment>
