<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrator's face blindness is established early and shapes their investigative method—reading postures rather than faces, methodical observation. Interior texture is distinct ("I draw the way riverbeds remember water"), though the final revelation from the woman's letter arrives off-page, reducing the protagonist's agency at closure. Embodied perception is strong (threading the ribbon, feeling its memory of a bow), but the core choice to "paint both" harm and help feels more conceptual than viscerally tested in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates evidence fragments—ribbon, phone case, vial—building a pattern that reweights Mara's disappearance from vanishing victim to willing sacrifice. Closure lands via Conceptual Repricing: the painting and subsequent letter reframe the night as "fear met gentleness...and both stepped back." Orientation anchors early (quarry, mist, narrator's condition). One meaningful deepening occurs when the blue ribbon contradicts the file's red fox mask, forcing a tactical shift in the narrator's theory. Cost is conceptual and felt in the final image of forgiveness, though the letter mechanism distances the reader from witnessing the turn.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The quarry setting constrains method (lancing silt, walking the lip) and charges the final image—mist as the medium of both concealment and the ribbon-bridge metaphor. Sensory detail is filtered through the narrator's methodical attention: "glitter bruised to a dull bruise," perfume vial, kink in the ribbon. The body and tools (rebar spear, notebook) are handled across beats and pressure choices. Spatial choreography remains clear; the setting evolves from physical site to painted absence, mirroring the case itself.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: reconstructing Mara's fate when evidence is gone. The narrator's agency drives the search; finding the wrong-color ribbon forces a theory revision that narrows options (Mara traded identities, was displaced rather than simply vanished). Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens: each fragment—ribbon, case, vial—tightens the emotional and investigative picture. Cost is legible in the painting's ambiguity and the narrator's admission "I do not know who harmed her," though the resolution via letter rather than on-page choice mutes the protagonist's final turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—empathy as unifying opposites, harm and help staged together—emerges from the narrator's method and the case particulars without overt thesis. The blue ribbon's wrongness becomes the thematic hinge: offering kindness to cruelty, the masquerade as a site where identities blur to enable both. The painting (fox without mask, mask without face, ribbon-bridge) reweights prior material with resonance. "Awakening dormant empathy" is enacted through the woman's letter and the families' responses, avoiding direct moralizing. Subtext operates in the narrator's choice to paint both possibilities rather than solve, allowing ambiguity as thematic stance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: "I draw the way riverbeds remember water," sensory attention shaped by prosopagnosia. Diction is lyric and controlled ("breath held by stone," "grief also rises when pierced, slow and sulfurous"), though occasional elevated register ("unifying opposites") tilts slightly abstract under peak pressure. Focalization is clean; no head-hopping. The narrator's voice modulates with investigative focus and reflective pauses without slipping into therapy-speak or diagnostic flatness. Rhythmic control is strong, with varied syntax supporting momentum.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout ("canvases stacked like unslept nights," "laughter and cheap velvet," "ribbon...held a kink like a memory"), occasionally bordering on overwriting in mid-pressure beats where clarity would serve better. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; sentence openings vary. Information density is strong—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or evidence. Minor register drift into abstraction ("by unifying opposites" appears multiple times as a method-label without full dramatization) and some metaphors strain under lyric weight. The closure image is vivid, but the figurative load in the quarry search occasionally slows momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The combination of prosopagnosia and cold-case portraiture offers a fresh angle; the method of reading postures rather than faces is specific and integral. The twist—Mara traded places, offering her identity to someone trying on kindness—feels earned in hindsight by the blue ribbon clue. The masquerade setting and the narrator's painting as investigative tool avoid template plotting. The piece takes risk with its lyric compression and the choice to leave the case open, trusting ambiguity and the painting's dual staging. Emotional specificity (shelter dogs, fear met by gentleness) anchors the premise. The "unifying opposites" frame is stated more than fully dramatized in action, keeping the piece just shy of the highest originality band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Present early (first paragraph) and shapes method throughout: the narrator cannot trust quick recognition, so they trace physical evidence and postures. The condition enables the investigative lens (postures over faces) and the final choice to paint without solving. Appears in at least three beats: establishing method, interpreting the ribbon, creating the painting. Causally active: without prosopagnosia, the methodical object-focus and the decision to paint ambiguity (rather than identify a suspect) lose their necessity. The condition is not merely ornamental; it constrains tactics and charges the closure by making the painting's facelessness thematically resonant.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Introduced early (fourth paragraph fragment) and handled across multiple beats: found, threaded through fingers, compared to the file's red ribbon, interpreted as evidence of identity-trade, and reappears in the final painting as the "blue ribbon...like a bridge." The color discrepancy (blue vs. red) drives the theory revision—Mara's displacement rather than simple vanishing. The object's "kink like a memory" and its return in the painted image create a charged reprise. Removing it would weaken the causal turn and the closure's visual metaphor. The ribbon is specific, irreplaceable, and carries visible cost in the narrator's realization.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Signaled early ("Cold cases are the rooms where echoes go to practice speech") and frames the entire investigation: evidence is gone, only "weather and sorrow" remain. The concept shapes stakes (reconstruction without files) and tactics (methodical object-lancing, painting instead of solving). Present in the closure through the painting sent to families and the letter response. The timeframe "after the evidence disappears" reinforces the concept across beats. Removing "cold case" would require minimal edits—an unsolved mystery could replace it—but the specific constraint (no chain of custody, time-eroded clues) tightens the narrator's method and the decision to leave the case open.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Established early ("very methodical, because I cannot trust quick recognition") and demonstrated on-page: walking the quarry lip, lancing systematically, threading the ribbon, cataloging fragments. The trait enables the investigative approach and constrains the narrator to slow, evidence-based reasoning rather than intuitive leaps. Visible cost: the methodical pace means the case remains unsolved in traditional terms, leading to the ambiguous painting. The attribute is causal—without it, the narrator's prosopagnosia would feel like a label rather than a lived constraint. However, the trait operates more as a consistent filter than as a source of pivotal friction or tradeoff in a single high-stakes beat.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Introduced in the second paragraph ("Lance the silt...and see what bubbles") and executed twice on-page: first surfacing the phone case, second the perfume vial. The action is specific, physical, and discovery-driven; it unearths the wrong-color evidence that forces the theory revision (identity-trade). The lancing is not easily swappable—digging or searching lack the same tactile specificity and the deputy's metaphor ("grief also rises when pierced"). Present in the closure indirectly: the painting shows what was lanced free. Removing this action would require restructuring the evidence-gathering beats. The action shapes two distinct turns and is tied to the narrator's methodical character.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Signaled early ("by unifying opposites, tension with slack, pull with permission") and invoked at key moments: interpreting the ribbon, imagining Mara's kindness meeting cruelty, painting harm and help together. The method is thematic and shapes the final image (fox without mask, mask without face, ribbon-bridge). However, it operates more as a conceptual frame than a mechanical tactic with visible cost. The narrator states the method but does not demonstrate a moment where unifying opposites constrains a choice or fails and requires adjustment. Present in closure (painting both possibilities) but the mechanics remain abstract. Functional but somewhat ornamental; a different interpretive lens could substitute without breaking the plot.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Present from the opening line ("shadowed quarry lay in mist") and constrains method: the narrator walks the lip, lances the silt, navigates soft ground where "the party would have become a tide against the cliff." The mist recurs in the closure ("leaving only mist," "the way the mist allowed the ribbon to draw a horizon"). The setting supplies resources (rebar, silt, the rust ladder) and atmospheric pressure (sound "went quiet to a furrowed hush"). Spatial choreography is clear. The quarry is painted without people, and the mist charges the final image as both concealer and revealer. Removing the quarry would collapse the investigation's physicality and the thematic link between concealment and empathy.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Established early ("after the evidence disappears") and frames the entire investigation: no files, no chain of custody, only time-eroded fragments remain. The timeframe shapes tactics—the narrator must work with what survives ("soaked, rinsed, and dried by season")—and the decision to paint rather than solve. Present in the closure through the families' delayed responses and the woman's letter. The constraint is felt: without it, the narrator could pursue conventional forensics. However, the timeframe does not create a live clock or escalating urgency within the single scene; it operates as a static condition rather than a dynamic pressure. Functional and causal, but not tightly wound across beats.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Stated as the ending phrase ("To awaken dormant empathy") and dramatized through the narrator's choices: painting harm and help together, sending the work to families, the woman's letter response ("fear met gentleness...and both stepped back"). The motivation is implicit in the narrator's empathy-teaching backstory (Mara at the shelter, coaxing dogs to uncoil) and the final painting's dual staging. However, the desire is told more than tested under friction. The narrator does not face a competing want or cost that challenges the empathy goal on-page; the motivation guides the ending but does not create internal conflict or a high-stakes tradeoff. Present in closure, functional, but not deeply conflicted or constrained.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Established in the opening paragraph ("furrowed hush that made every step seem trespass") and sustained through imagery: "breath held by stone," "grief...slow and sulfurous," "mist allowed the ribbon to draw a horizon." The tone modulates with investigative focus (concrete object-handling) and reflective pauses (imagining Mara's choice) without breaking into sentimentality or mechanic exposition. Present in the closure: the painting without faces, the families' letters, the final mist image. The tone charges the final beat by maintaining restraint and ambiguity. Coherent across turns, purposeful in its quiet pressure, and integral to the story's emotional register. Removing the tone would flatten the piece into procedural or overt sentiment.</comment>
