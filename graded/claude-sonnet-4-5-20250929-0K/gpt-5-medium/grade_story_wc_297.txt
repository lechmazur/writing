<comment>The narrator's interiority is present throughout with embodied detail ("questions in my ribs," "anxious elation... jittering but firm"), and the choice to heed the leaves and offer a new vow demonstrates agency under pressure. However, the protagonist's emotional arc is more texture-driven than causally motivated; the grafted state reads as metaphor more than a constraint that drives micro-choices. The woman's scar-sharing method introduces a relationship crucible, but her arrival feels convenient rather than earned from prior causality. Motivations are vivid but not always contradictory in scene—closer to poetic stance than embodied internal conflict.</comment>

<comment>The piece operates under a Hybrid lens (Accumulative/Textural with Situational pressure) and teaches its pattern early: lyric compression, future-arrived-early time logic, and scar-linking as the method of navigation. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (specifically Charged Poise): the new vow "recorded in cambium" and the mirrored crossroads reconfigure the covenant with conceptual cost (the gardeners lower their shears, time becomes conditional "sometimes"). The orientation is adequate by ~120 words (narrator grafted to mapletree, cobalt glade at dusk, post-eclipse), though "after the future arrives early" remains abstract until the woman's arrival clarifies it. Escalation proceeds through the scar-linking, maze-walking, and final confrontation with the gardeners, but the causal pressure is softer than the texture; many beats accumulate atmosphere rather than narrowing options with visible trade-offs.</comment>

<comment>The cobalt glade, grafted ankles, maze topiary clipping, and hedge corridors supply vivid micro-setting that charges several beats. The clipping's transformation on the pool and the hedge-doors that "demanded answers" constrain the protagonists' path, and the final sundial that "agreed to tell time again, sometimes" charges the closure image. Sensory selection is purposeful and filtered through the narrator's heightened, visionary register. However, spatial choreography occasionally blurs—how the woman and narrator physically move from tree to pool to floating maze is more lyric than legible, and the "figures in ceremonial pruning aprons" appear without prior spatial setup.</comment>

<comment>The dominant stake—renegotiating the eclipsed covenant and heeding the garden's voice—is signaled early and coheres through to the ending. One meaningful tightening occurs when the narrator and woman press scars to see the hidden corridor and gardeners, forcing the choice to enter the maze. The ending negotiation ("we told them no") and new vow reconfigure the covenant with conceptual cost (the gardeners' authority is diluted, time becomes conditional). However, the escalation is textural rather than causal: the woman's arrival, the maze-seed's acceptance, and the gardeners' capitulation feel like unfolding revelations rather than choices under pressure that narrow options or exact visible trade-offs on the page.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: the eclipsed covenant as broken promise, the maze as grammar for saying "yes without erasing no," the garden and people as "lines seeking a shared vertex." The final image—crossroads where dreams overlap, maze as grammar, sundial telling time "sometimes"—reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext operates in the scar-linking method (memory as bridge), the clipping's dissolution into entrances/exits, and the gardeners' pruning aprons softening into capes. No thematic echo or sermon; the piece earns its conceptual payoff through image and action. The recurring maze motif accumulates pressure and charges closure without becoming a checklist token.</comment>

<comment>Single first-person POV with stable focalization throughout; no head-hopping. Voice is consistent, poetic, and purposefully compressed ("root-bound visionary," "promises bloom and which wither under that rush of unreal time"), with syntax and rhythm reflecting the narrator's heightened, visionary register. Psychic distance remains close; perceptual signature is selective and metaphor-heavy. The woman's dialogue is minimal but distinct ("When skin remembers... it makes bridges that light can cross"). However, the prose occasionally leans into elevated diction that risks register drift ("cambium," "pruning aprons," "cambium") without always grounding in embodied perception. The compression is taught and legible, but some readers may find the metaphor density fatiguing in peak beats.</comment>

<comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, with short declaratives ("We told them no") punctuating longer lyric sentences. Figurative language is dense and mostly coherent ("corridor of hedges bending to form a question mark," "ribbon pulled from a mouth"), but some vehicles strain: "blue hour" is mentioned without prior setup, "cambium" appears twice in close proximity, and "pilgrims pin" is a minor malapropism (pilgrim's badge?). Information density is high, but several lines paraphrase without advancing pressure: "They had not expected the future to arrive early, and they certainly had not expected the garden to start thinking for itself" restates the premise. The metaphor stack in the opening paragraph ("leaf-veins lit with residual lightning from tomorrow," "root-bound visionary," "vow made at noon and unmade at shadow") borders on overwriting. No template cadence, but the compression occasionally obscures causal sequencing (how does the maze "accept our weight" and "reconfigure").</comment>

<comment>The synthesis of eclipsed covenant, scar-linking as method, maze topiary clipping as living diagram, and the garden-as-thinking-entity offers a fresh, non-obvious angle on broken-promise narratives. The final image—crossroads where dreams overlap, maze as grammar, sundial conditional—feels earned in hindsight by the accumulation of particulars. The piece commits fully to its lyric-situational premise and follows its implications without retreat. However, the "scar-linking" method and the maze-seed's transformation feel slightly convenient as late-stage solutions; the woman's arrival and expertise arrive exactly when needed. The piece takes bold risks with compression and metaphor density, heightening stakes without obscuring clarity—though some beats lean toward ornament over action.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>The root-bound visionary (narrator) is present throughout and makes the key choices: to heed the leaves, lay the clipping on the pool, step onto the floating maze, and offer the new vow. However, the grafted state functions more as metaphor than physical constraint; it does not alter tactics or impose visible cost. The narrator's choices are reactive rather than proactive—the woman arrives, the maze unfolds, the gardeners capitulate. Two beats (heeding the leaves, offering the new vow) involve decisions, but neither is causally forced by the root-bound condition itself.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>The maze topiary clipping is handled in three beats: carried behind the ear, laid on the water, and its dissolution into the floating maze. It shifts meaning from "blueprint for escaping the garden by walking it" to "living diagram of maybe" and enables the final confrontation. Its presence charges the closure (the maze as grammar), and its specificity (nested labyrinth within chlorophyll) is irreplaceable. However, its mechanics are somewhat opaque—why does it root on water, and why does the maze accept their weight?—and its use feels slightly convenient as the solution to a problem it did not help create.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>The eclipsed covenant is the dominant stake: the sun went black, the oath slipped loose, and the narrator remains grafted to examine "the shape of the breach." It frames the conflict (renegotiating the covenant) and the ending (new vow "not circular but braided"). However, the covenant's original terms and stakes are abstract—what was promised, and to whom?—and its eclipse is told rather than dramatized. It shapes tactics (scar-linking to see the hidden gardeners, offering a new vow) but does not impose visible constraints or trade-offs on the page.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>5.4</grade>
<comment>"Purposefully curious about the shape of the breach" is present as a label in the opening and implicit in the narrator's choice to heed the leaves and explore the maze. However, curiosity is not dramatized as a trait that constrains or enables action with visible cost. The narrator's curiosity does not conflict with another value (e.g., safety, loyalty) in a way that forces a trade-off. It reads more as baseline stance than an attribute that alters tactics under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>"Heed" appears twice as the pivotal action: "the leaves whispered instructions I could almost heed" (setup) and "this time I chose to heed" (turn). The second instance drives the decision to step onto the floating maze, which leads to the final confrontation and new vow. The action is specific and irreplaceable in the text's logic. However, "heeding" is somewhat passive—listening and following rather than initiating—and the cost of heeding (what is risked or foreclosed?) is not made explicit on the page.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>"Linking through scars" is signaled early ("a way to share maps now... by linking through scars"), demonstrated in two beats (wrist to bark, palms to mapletree at closure), and its mechanics matter: scars as bridges enable seeing the hidden corridor and gardeners, borrowing courage from other timelines, and sealing the new vow. It shapes the middle choice (entering the maze) and closure (recording the vow in cambium). Its specificity (skin memory, healed storm) is irreplaceable. However, the method's logic is slightly opaque—how do scars from different timelines exist, and why does this particular linking work?</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>6.1</grade>
<comment>The cobalt glade at dusk is present in the opening and closing lines, framing the piece with a charged reprise ("still dusk," "border of waking and dreaming blurred"). The glade supplies the mapletree (grafting site), the humming atmosphere, and the dusk light. However, the setting does not constrain choices or alter tactics—the action could occur in any liminal, vegetated space. The glade is vivid and atmospheric but does not supply resources or obstacles that shape the outcome.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>5.9</grade>
<comment>"After the future arrives early" is present throughout: the premise of the eclipse, the passengers with "burns in the shape of hours," and the gardeners' surprise. It shapes the stakes (renegotiating a covenant disrupted by premature future) and the tone (temporal dislocation). However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or impose a live clock. Time is abstract and fluid ("still dusk" at the end) rather than a countdown that alters moves. The early-arrived future is more conceptual backdrop than active pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>6.3</grade>
<comment>"To find the intersection of dreams" is stated ("they wanted what I wanted, to find the intersection of dreams") and the ending delivers: "crossroads where two dreams met and overlapped." The motivation drives the middle choice (following the scar-ribbon, entering the maze) and shapes closure. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through micro-choices that reveal friction between wants and costs. The "intersection" is achieved without visible sacrifice or trade-off on the page—what did the narrator give up to reach it?</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>"Anxious elation" is named once ("the anxious elation of a nearly answered question made me brave and foolish") and embodied throughout: the humming glade, the "jittering but firm" paradox, the choice to step onto the floating maze. Tone modulates with pressure—nervous anticipation in the opening, heightened tension during scar-linking, charged resolution at the new vow. The final lines ("border of waking and dreaming blurred") sustain the tone without flattening it. However, the tone is announced rather than purely enacted, and the single explicit label slightly reduces its earned quality.</comment>
