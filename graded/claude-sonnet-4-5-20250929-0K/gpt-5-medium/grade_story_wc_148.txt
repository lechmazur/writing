<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is vivid and embodied through metaphor ("the cry wolf boy who cried wolf's son"), with micro-choices visible in carrying the lattice, climbing the stairs, and positioning it over the drain. However, the protagonist's motivations remain abstract—"chasing hush" and "threading a labyrinth with my own story"—without grounding in concrete wants or fears that face a visible trade-off. The final act (setting the lattice over the drain to let "the muffled thing beneath surrender") reads as symbolic rather than a credible choice with felt cost, weakening the sense of a path foreclosed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with lyric design. The piece teaches its pattern early (metaphor-dense, image-driven) and accumulates pressure through spatial ascent and tightening focus on the drain. Closure arrives when the lattice is placed over the drain and "the muffled thing beneath it surrendered," but the cost remains oblique—no clear before/after in options or knowledge. The Orientation Test is narrowly satisfied by ~120 words (lighthouse prison, reef, narrator rowing, carrying lattice), though "before they find the bodies" introduces a time frame that never tightens tactics on the page, reducing urgency.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lighthouse prison is richly particular: "copperlight repose," "metal stairs warm as coins," "salt turned the locks green," "porthole shaped like a keyhole." The setting constrains movement (narrow door, spiraling stairs, lantern room) and the lattice interacts with architecture (speaking tube, lantern room, drain) to charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clear from pier to corridors to cell to roof to drain, and the reef's "teeth ready" signals threat without cluttering the frame.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to thread a labyrinth with my own story before anyone closed it off"—is signaled early but remains abstract. The piece accumulates pressure through spatial ascent and the approach of "a boat with questions," yet no on-page reversal narrows options or forces a visible trade-off. The final act (placing the lattice over the drain) reads as symbolic preparation rather than a choice with legible cost, and the time constraint ("before they find the bodies") never alters tactics in scene.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges concretely from the lattice (confession without faces), the lighthouse (impossibilities sustained "briefly, tenderly"), and the shift from "false alarms" to "a truer bell." The final image—lattice over drain, "the muffled thing beneath it surrendered without words"—offers a resonant answer to the premise without stating a moral. However, the narrator's direct articulation of theme ("I am trying to become the echo that stops screaming") and the second-person slip ("thread a labyrinth with your own story") veer toward thematic statement rather than pure dramatization.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice is distinctive and lyric: "the hush I was chasing felt like something I could cup in my hands without spilling," "the lighthouse sustains impossibilities the way a jar keeps a firefly." Metaphor density remains high but consistent, fitting the narrator's voice. The second-person slip in the penultimate paragraph ("thread a labyrinth with your own story") breaks focalization without clear purpose, and the line "under the stairs a drain held answers that were not yet bodies but were practicing the stiffness of being found" strains register with "practicing the stiffness."</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense but largely coherent ("the lighthouse sustains impossibilities the way a jar keeps a firefly," "the guards let me wander because I said I was cataloging the corrosion"). A few lines overreach: "gulls learned to laugh like they were practicing a verdict" mixes trial and rehearsal metaphors awkwardly, and "if I kept silent, I could steer the current of what came next" introduces nautical control that doesn't match the lighthouse-as-jar or lattice-as-confession logic established earlier. Information density is high; minimal loops or scaffolding appear, though the final third revisits "hush," "lattice," and "doors" without new pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of lighthouse-prison, confessional lattice, and "cry wolf boy's son" is specific and non-generic. The image of setting a salvaged lattice over a drain to let something "surrender without words" feels earned in hindsight by the pattern of hush-seeking and voices thinned through squares. However, the core premise—protagonist preparing to control a narrative before authorities arrive—echoes familiar unreliable-narrator templates, and the final turn (steering the boat's inquiry through measured disclosure) remains abstract rather than an on-page risk with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The narrator ("cry wolf boy who cried wolf's son") drives the spatial journey (rowing, entering, climbing, placing the lattice) and the final decision to set the lattice over the drain. The identity is signaled early and reprised in dialogue with the woman, shaping the narrator's motivation to trade "false alarms for a truer bell." However, the character's choices do not create a visible reversal or narrow options on the page; the final act reads as symbolic preparation rather than a decision with felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The lattice appears in at least four beats: carried from the pier, pressed to the speaking tube, set across the lantern room, and finally placed over the drain. Its properties (wood scratched by breath, squares that thin voices) enable the narrator's interactions with the architecture and charge the final image. Removing it would weaken the closure, though the lattice's function as a tool for "letting voices meet without faces" remains more thematic than causally indispensable to the plot.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Chasing hush" is named early, defines the narrator's goal throughout (seeking "the place where sound surrenders to listening"), and the final image shows hush gathered "like a soft animal in a trap made of listening." The concept shapes spatial choices (entering the prison, climbing to the lantern room) and the final placement of the lattice. However, "hush" operates primarily as atmosphere and theme rather than a tactic that alters live options under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Sustains impossibilities" is attributed to the lighthouse in a single metaphor ("the way a jar keeps a firefly: briefly, tenderly, and never without the ache of the lid"). It enriches tone but does not constrain or enable an on-page action with visible cost. The attribute remains ornamental—label-only—rather than a trait that shapes a choice or tactic.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Hover" appears once in the setup ("every prisoner could hover at a window and see what they were not touching") as description of the prison's design, not as an action the narrator performs. No major turn traces to hovering; the narrator's key actions are climbing, pressing the lattice to surfaces, and placing it over the drain. The element is present but functionally inert.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The "narrow door left ajar for decades" is the method of entry, signaled early and used ("I entered through the scuffs...reading the rubbed arcs like tide lines of hands that had tried to leave"). Its mechanics—open for decades, marked by prior attempts—add texture and support the lighthouse's theme of sustained impossibilities. However, the door does not constrain later choices or return with reweighted meaning; it is functional setup but not causally indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The lighthouse prison is signaled in the opening line, pressures the narrator's movements (narrow door, corridors, cell, spiraling stairs, lantern room, drain), and its architecture (speaking tube, porthole, copper roof) enables the lattice's use at multiple beats. The setting's details—salt-green locks, warm metal stairs, the reef's teeth—constrain choices and charge the final image. Removing this exact setting would break the story's spatial logic and thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Before they find the bodies" is named early and reprised ("A boat was coming with questions"), establishing a time constraint. However, the timeframe never tightens the narrator's tactics on the page—no clock forces faster movement or alters the sequence of exploration, conversation, and lattice placement. The phrase adds urgency in declaration but not in dramatized pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"To thread a labyrinth with my own story" is stated early and drives the narrator's journey (entering the prison, seeking hush, positioning the lattice to "steer the current of what came next"). The motivation shapes the spatial arc and the final act of placing the lattice over the drain. However, the desire remains abstract—no on-page friction between want and cost tests the commitment, and the final image reads as symbolic rather than a choice with visible sacrifice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Copperlight repose" is introduced in the third line ("this one nested in copperlight repose, the metal stairs warm as coins") and sustained through "copper roof pressing heat into the air." The tone—quiet, warm, suspended—remains coherent through the narrator's exploration and modulates slightly when "a boat was coming with questions," though the shift is mild. The tone charges the final image of hush gathered and the lattice placed, making the ending's stillness feel earned rather than imposed.</comment>
