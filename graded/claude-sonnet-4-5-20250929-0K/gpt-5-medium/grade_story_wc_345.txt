<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The collective "we" POV lacks individual interiority or contradictory impulses; the narrator remains a uniform chorus throughout. Lio's altruism is declared but never tested by competing motives or cost. The arch-rescue crisis compels orchestrated effort, but no micro-choices reveal hierarchies of value or character-specific embodiment. The final launch reads as group consensus without visible individual sacrifice or renunciation that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: who (beyond collective "we"), where (orchard planet), and when (post-storm integration) emerge gradually but anchor by ~15% without fatal confusion. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through gift-giving, chalk messages, the arch crisis, then the launch toward the nebula. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the nebula corridor unveiling, bell rung as oath, mist as benediction), but the cost remains conceptual and diffuse—no legible forfeiture or tactical narrowing on the page. The before/after hinges on collective motion, not a decisive turn with visible price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The floating arches, moss-path sidewalks, and butterfly garden anchor setting with vivid particularity. The fractured arch during rescue supplies spatial constraint and urgency. However, much description (orchard shadows, hammock settlements, nebula color) remains postcard-vivid without altering a choice or shaping the closure image. The bell and rope become tactile at the rescue but do not charge the final launch beat beyond symbolic presence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is collective survival/trust-building; the arch crisis provides one meaningful tightening (twelve families stranded). Agency is distributed across the "we," obscuring individual trade-offs. The bell's braided alarm and chalk instructions orchestrate the rescue, but the resolution (all saved, feast, then launch) lacks visible cost—no one is left behind, no resource exhausted, no renunciation dramatized. The nebula's unveiling feels granted rather than earned through protagonist sacrifice under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme of collective resilience and trust emerges through particulars: bell patterns, chalk guidance, shared labor. The "tired together rather than tired alone" line articulates the theme overtly, bordering on sermonizing. The nebula as "respite" for communal effort is resonant, but the ending dissolves into benediction without ambiguity or trade-off. No counter-reading is invited; the moral arc is tidy and declarative, reducing thematic complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>First-person plural ("we") maintains stable collective focalization without head-hopping into individuated interiorities. Perceptual signature is lyric and stylized ("bell sprayed mist," "light was not blinding but kind") but lacks character-specific bias. Diction is elevated and uniform across emotional peaks, reducing voice distinction. No dialogue on the page to evaluate naturalism or subtext. The prose reads as purposeful lyricism, but the collective stance homogenizes perception under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout: "sound threaded the arches like a humble comet," "hope here is brambled," "nebula of respite," "dissolving ring that felt like rain inside our ribs," "row by breath, not by muscle." Mixed metaphors and vehicles that violate logic (fingers are wind, bell sprays mist, air flows as river) muddle clarity in peak beats. Paraphrase loops ("reexamine" appears twice; "tired together rather than tired alone" echoes "strangers become family"). Template cadence in rescue sequence: "lifted…kept talking…by sunset…we feasted…that night…in the morning." Cumulative artifact debt reaches −1.2 in Q7; some vehicles confuse rather than sharpen.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The orchard-planet-with-arches setting and ghost-as-altruistic-guide premise are specific but resemble familiar SFF/lyric templates (invisible helper, collective journey to transcendence). The bell and chalk as communication methods add texture. The arch-rescue beat is conventional disaster-response plotting. The nebula as reward for communal effort reads as an anticipated payoff rather than a non-obvious synthesis. Execution is competent but risk-averse; no bold structural or perspectival choice elevates beyond the prompt's checklist.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Lio is present throughout: rings bell, leaves gifts, chalks messages, guides rescue via rope, speaks during launch. He participates in all three gates (setup, middle crisis, ending). However, his choices are facilitative rather than conflicted; no on-page decision by Lio alters tactics or forecloses a path. He is strangely trustworthy without friction. His involvement is functional but not causal in the closure—he sighs approval as the group rows. Late −0.5 for lack of cost tied to his agency; his altruism is uncontested.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The bell appears in multiple beats: introduced early ("humble comet" ring), kept in butterfly garden with rope, rings braided alarm during arch crisis (orchestrating rescue), rang as oath at the ending (mist rains down). Crosses all three gates with clear reprise. Its pattern of rings governs rhythm and coordinates collective effort. The final use charges the closure image with mist and oath. Strong integration; only minor swappability (another signal device could serve) keeps it below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The nebula is mentioned midpoint ("beyond the arches"), reappears as stars lean low ("smear of color"), and unveils a corridor at the ending. Present in setup (Lio's promise) and closure (corridor and light). However, it remains destination and reward rather than constraint or tactic-shaping element. Its properties do not narrow options or impose cost; it simply appears when the group qualifies. Functional but largely ornamental until the final paragraph; no middle beat where its logic alters a choice.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Strangely trustworthy" is declared early and acknowledged ("He was strangely trustworthy, though he owned no body"). The trait enables the group's reliance on his guidance. However, it is label-only; no on-page moment dramatizes the strangeness or tests the trust with friction or cost. The attribute does not constrain or complicate a beat—his trustworthiness is accepted without skepticism or trade-off. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Reexamine" appears twice: "asked us to reexamine our habits" (chalk messages mid-story) and "we reexamine the quarrels" (during the launch). The action is thematic rather than plot-driving; the group's reexamination of habits and quarrels is told, not dramatized through a conflicted choice. It shapes the ethos of the journey but does not redefine options at a key turn. Present in setup and closure, but swappable with "reflect" or "reconsider" without structural loss. Lyric reprise lifts it to mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Chalk messages on moss-path "sidewalks" appear early (method introduced) and recur: instructions during arch crisis ("unfurled across the moss paths like map vines"), and "string the chalk along our rails" during launch. The method is specific and used across beats to coordinate collective action. It shapes tactics (rescue orchestration) and is referenced at closure. Crosses all three gates. Only modest causal pressure (messages guide but do not impose cost or constrain alternatives) keeps it from higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Orchard planet with floating arches is established immediately and frames all action. Arches thread the bell sound, house settlements, and one unmoors to create the rescue crisis (middle beat). The setting supplies both beauty and danger. The launch occurs "into a river of air that flows between arches." Present in setup, crisis, and closure. The unmoored arch is the story's central complication. Strong integration; only minor genre-template feel (SFF exotic locale) and the fact that a different hazard could substitute for the arch in the rescue keeps it below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"After strangers become family" is stated as backstory context ("We met him after strangers become family, because the storms had leveled our labels"). It establishes the social starting condition but does not tighten decisions on the page—no live clock or countdown. Time passes (dawn, noon, sunset, morning) to structure beats, but the timeframe itself does not impose urgency or cost. Present in setup as framing, but not active in middle or closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The desire to orchestrate collective effort is dramatized throughout: Lio's chalk instructions, the rescue coordination ("pairing climbers with splicers, knotters with watchers"), and the launch procession. It is the story's spine. However, the motivation is collective and uncontested; no friction between individual wants and group needs is shown. The "we argued, because hope here is brambled" is summary without embodied conflict. Present across beats and at closure, but the lack of on-page cost or competing impulse limits score.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Brambled hope" is explicitly named ("hope here is brambled, and every stem hides a thorn that remembers a name we lost") and modulates through the story: fear during crisis, relief and laughter at rescue, awe at nebula. The tone coheres as cautious optimism under pressure. The final image ("mist rained down…Lio sighed like a tree that had found its grove again") charges the tone with earned solace. However, the bramble metaphor is stated rather than sustained through tactical friction; the story remains hopeful throughout without tonal jeopardy. Present and coherent, but static mood trends mid-band.</comment>
