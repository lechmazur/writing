<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The keeper's interiority is sustained through concrete sensory choices ("warm despite her winter," "pricked me awake without drawing blood") and micro-decisions under the ghost bride's coaching. The ghost bride's motivation—repaying a river rescue—arrives late and is told rather than dramatized, weakening causal grounding. Internal contradiction appears when the keeper promises "like a fool" yet the vow feels "older than my breath," a tension that enriches rather than muddles. The final renunciation (ghosting the trader's knock) enacts a value hierarchy with visible cost, meeting the length's closure demand.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The orchard's gradual awakening—bead drop, chime sway, sap bottling—builds pressure through density and cadence until the ghost bride dissolves and the keeper hangs the bead, reweighting the premise with felt cost (loss and completion in "mournful elation"). Orientation anchors who (keeper), where (greenhouse), and what (night orchard) by line six. The backstory ("Once you carried me from a river") arrives past midpoint and is exposition-heavy, but it primes the closure image of debt repaid. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length; the closure's Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: the orchard learns to warm its own dark, the keeper keeps her vow) lands on the page with emotional cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The greenhouse—glass arterial with vines, shrouded in endless night—constrains the keeper's entire practice: chimes, grafts, night harvest. The carved stone bead "chimed without moving, summoning silence," a micro-object that acts as setting anchor and charges the closure when hung in the doorway. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("wet linen and unrung bells," "steam wrote names on the panes"), and the winter-cracked fields frame the night-orchard's refusal of dawn. The setting presses every choice and the final image—"the orchard learned to warm its own dark"—is inseparable from the established environment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: waking the orchard without the heart key. The ghost bride's arrival supplies the carved bead and coaching, tightening options ("Do not hack… press and release like a vow you will keep"). The keeper's promise not to wake grief forecloses selfish use with visible cost: ghosting the trader denies a lucrative sale. The final six-syllable cadence wakes the youngest saplings, a protagonist-driven deepening that earns the orchard's self-sustaining warmth. The escalation is accumulative rather than plot-reversing, fitting the inferred lens, though the river-rescue backstory is late and summarized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of reciprocal debt and tending ("You married the fields, you married work") emerges through image: the bead as ferry, sap as river, grafted marriages. The ghost bride's instruction—"the answer is the orchard waking to sing"—risks overt statement but is dramatized in the keeper's six-syllable chant and the saplings' heartening. The closing image, "my nights kept their vow, and I kept hers," offers a non-literal answer to the debt question without moralizing. Recurrence of "vow" accumulates pressure and charges the final beat; the mournful elation tone unifies loss and completion without false equivalence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyric-accumulative, with POV-particular diction ("lovingly venomous," "heartened and uncurled," "mournful elation") and rhythmic control that tightens under coaching beats. Psychic distance is stable first-person-reflective; the keeper's perceptual signature filters through alchemical work (flask vapor, pruning strokes). Ghost bride dialogue—"you tune the bells but not the longing they must answer"—carries distinct cadence and subtext. Minor filter-verb clusters ("I asked," "she said") appear in dialogue tags but remain voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. No head-hopping; tense and stance are consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Figurative density is high ("glass arterial with vines," "cinders fell like confetti that remembered the burn") and mostly coherent, though "breath like a vow" recurs three times without pattern payoff. Sentence openings vary; rhythm modulates from reflective openings to clipped coaching beats. One paraphrase loop: "ephemeral cameo appearances" is repeated verbatim across two paragraphs without reweighting, triggering −0.2. Information density is strong; nearly every line advances atmosphere or coaching. The closing beat—"correcting my gratitude to action"—lands without scaffold. No major opacity or template cadence at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—alchemical orchard × ghost-bride pedagogy × debt-across-lifetimes—feels specific and non-obvious. The carved bead as both ferry and tuning key, the sap-as-river metaphor made literal through bottling, and the orchard's self-warming dark transform familiar ghost-story and mentor tropes. Risk: lyric density and backward-looking debt could flatten present stakes, yet the coaching beats and trader-refusal choice ground the frame. The river-rescue backstory is late but irreplaceable; removing it would collapse the debt's particularity. Tone of mournful elation is uncommon and sustained without hedging.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ashen-veil ghost bride teaches cadence, corrects pruning, hands the bead, and traces names on panes—at least four distinct beats. Her choices (dropping the bead, teaching the six syllables) drive the orchard's awakening and her dissolution is the closure's felt cost. Early signal (line six), causal pressure across middle beats, and closure linkage (vanishes "as a note disappears") all present. High irreplaceability: her specific debt and pedagogy are indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Carved stone bead is handed, dropped into soil (triggering graft-scar quiver), threaded on silver root (chiming without moving), and hung in doorway (making travelers pause)—four beats spanning setup, middle, and closure. Its warmth "despite her winter" and "pitted with thumb history" are specific properties that matter. Causal pressure: the bead is the key replacement, ferry, and tuning mechanism. Closure linkage: hung in doorway, it becomes the orchard's threshold charm. Cost: the bead is her wrist-memory, released to repay the debt.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Resonant awakenings appear in title position (line four), are enacted when the bead strikes soil ("every graft scar quivered," "the orchard made a sound of recognition"), and recur at closure ("orchard waking to sing," saplings "heartened and uncurled"). The concept shapes the keeper's dominant stake and the ghost bride's coaching method. It constrains tactics: chimes alone fail without the cadence that "must answer." Lyric reprise reweights the premise at the end. Two gates plus thematic coherence lift the score; full causal indispensability would require more mid-beat tightening.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lovingly venomous appears twice: "her voice carried a lovingly venomous humor that pricked me awake without drawing blood" (line nine) and "lovingly venomous and tender, correcting my gratitude to action" (final line). The trait colors the ghost bride's pedagogy—sharp but nurturing—yet does not constrain an on-page choice with visible cost. It is descriptive and thematically consistent but functionally swappable with "sharp tenderness" or similar. Lyric reprise in the final line provides closure linkage but no middle beat involvement or tactical consequence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Ghost(ing) is the action throughout: the bride ghosts along trellises (line eight), the keeper ghosts the trader's knocking (line thirty-eight), and she vanishes "without receding" (line forty-eight). The verb shapes two key choices—her ephemeral pedagogy and his refusal of commerce—and charges the closure when "she vanished without receding, as a note disappears by becoming the ears that heed it." Early signal, two beats with stakes (trader refusal has visible cost), and closure metaphor. High irreplaceability: the action unifies character, plot, and tone.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Ephemeral cameo appearances is signaled early (line six: "she arrived through ephemeral cameo appearances") and demonstrated in four teaching beats: smudge in flask, rippled silhouette on wet slate, fingertip tracing names, touching the keeper's mouth with six syllables. The method enables her ghostly pedagogy and constrains interaction—she cannot act continuously, only appear and dissolve. It shapes the middle coaching sequence and primes the closure's vanishing metaphor. Causal pressure moderate; specificity high (the method is irreplaceable for this ghost-bride frame).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Alchemical orchard greenhouse shrouded in endless night appears in line two, frames every beat (chimes, grafts, night harvest, bottling), and the closure turns on "the orchard learned to warm its own dark." The setting supplies the central constraint (no dawn, trees hold breath) and resources (chimes, graft scars, sap). Early signal, beat involvement across five segments, causal pressure (the keeper's entire practice depends on night-orchard rules), and closure linkage (self-warming dark is the resolution image). High irreplaceability: removing the night-orchard breaks logic and stakes.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Over the hush of winter-cracked fields opens and closes the piece, establishing seasonal frame and atmospheric continuity. Winter is mentioned once mid-text ("warm despite her winter"). The timeframe does not tighten decisions or impose a clock; coaching and awakening unfold without temporal pressure. The reprise provides lyric closure linkage but no middle development or tactical constraint. Functional but replaceable: another season or timeframe could serve without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>To repay a debt across lifetimes is stated at line thirteen ("To repay a debt across lifetimes, she said, I will hand you your key") and elaborated at line twenty-eight ("Once you carried me from a river… To repay the crossing, I will cross your trees"). The motivation drives her arrival, bead-gift, coaching, and dissolution—three beats with causal pressure. It is dramatized through the bead's descent (her wrist-memory), her teaching labor, and the closure cost (vanishing as completion). Late first elaboration (past midpoint) and the river-rescue is told rather than shown, capping slightly, but the debt is indispensable and charges the final vow-keeping image.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Mournful elation is named explicitly at line forty-six ("We stood in mournful elation, completing something and losing something") and operationalized throughout: "slow cinders fell like confetti that remembered the burn," the bead's warmth despite winter, "veil curled to the floor with relief," and the closing "lovingly venomous and tender." The tone unifies loss (her dissolution) and gain (orchard awakening) without false balance, modulates with pressure (quiet opening, charged coaching, tender vanishing), and charges the final image. High coherence and closure linkage; the tone is irreplaceable for this story's emotional architecture.</comment>
