<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is specific and embodied—"the luminescent ache that guards a coastline better than iron"—with genuine contradictions between stated preference ("I tell the harbor I prefer the bunk below") and actual behavior. The motivation to protect and pass along safety is rendered through concrete micro-choices: lighting the candle, stacking five stones, reading letters aloud. Minor slip: the previous keeper's drowning and the myth around it feel slightly told rather than fully dramatized as constraint on present choice, but the cost at closure (building stones "for the keeper who never arrives") earns the stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of anonymous exchange and stacked-stone semiotics early, then deepens through the lamp's death and the discovery of sea glass. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final stacking of five stones "where waves could almost reach them" and the bottling metaphor crystallize the ache with visible cost—the narrator's solitary vigil and the absent keeper. Orientation is clear by the first few lines (lighthouse keeper, lantern room, after lamp dies). One meaningful tightening occurs when the skipper arrives early and the exchange of letters and stones reweights the anonymous chain with the narrator's declaration "We are still here."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The haunted lantern room, the pedestal, the crook of the stairs, and the sill all constrain action: the narrator lights a candle when the lamp dies, finds sea glass by the pedestal, places letters in the stair crook, and sets the glass on the sill where "the candle brightened as if gratified." The stacked stones and the physical acts of folding letters "small as shells" and tucking them into stone cairns create tactile, lived-in space. The body and small objects (candle, sea glass, stones) function as micro-setting that charges the final image. Scope fits: the single-location pressure and the objects' recurrence across beats elevate this into the 7+ band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: to protect "the tender hush that arrives after weather" and pass along the bottled feeling of safety. The lamp's death and the haunted visitation create immediate pressure; the narrator responds by lighting the candle, finding the sea glass, writing "We are still here," and stacking five stones. One meaningful tightening: the skipper's early arrival and wordless exchange reweights the anonymous letter chain with urgency and mutual recognition. The final act—stacking stones "where waves could almost reach them"—narrows options (the keeper will not return) and the cost is legible: solitary endurance and the ache that "guards a coastline better than iron." Agency is clear, escalation coheres under the Accumulative lens, and the price is felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: the anonymous letter chain, the stone-stacking semiotics, the sea glass worn thin by "years of being almost broken," and the luminescent ache. The final image—five stones and the line "If safety could be bottled, it would taste like candle smoke, salt, and softened paper in hands"—offers a non-literal answer to the central question (how to protect the tender hush) without stating a moral. The recurring sea glass and the bottling metaphor accumulate pressure and reweight prior material. Minor friction: the line "Safety is not the absence of loss; it is the ache that shines enough to guide" borders on thematic statement, but it's anchored in the candle beat and the discovery of the glass, so it reads earned rather than sermonic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, precise, and sustains a distinct perceptual signature: "the reticent lighthouse supply skipper brings flour, oil, and silence every Wednesday at slack tide" and "We speak in pieces, the way gulls trade cries between gusts." POV remains stable (single first-person throughout); focalization is tight. The dialogue snippet ("They are, I said") is minimal but purposeful. Free indirect style is clean; diction matches the narrator's register (nautical, elegiac). One minor slip: occasional elevated phrasing ("the luminescent ache," "the gravity of a beach at low tide") risks slight register drift under peak stress, but the internal texture remains consistent and the effect supports the accumulative pressure, so the slip does not materially harm voice coherence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high with lines often doing double duty (e.g., "He saw the stones, looked toward the sleeping mainland, and took the letter without a word" advances action, spatial choreography, and emotional subtext). No paraphrase loops or major scaffold. Minor deductions: a few lines border on overwriting—"Wings brushed the glass where fog swirled like breath around a sleeping child" stacks metaphor in a high-pressure beat, and "the luminescent ache that guards a coastline better than iron" risks slight abstraction. The figurative load is purposeful and pattern-taught (the piece is lyric-accumulative), but the density in a couple of beats nudges this below 8.0. Overall propulsion is strong, and the final image lands cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The anonymous letter chain paired with the stone-stacking semiotics and the haunted lantern room offers a fresh synthesis. The emotional specificity—"the luminescent ache," the sea glass as harbor light, the bottling metaphor—avoids generic templates. The skipper's reticent warmth and the narrator's solitary vigil feel particular to this voice and setting. Minor friction: the trope of the isolated lighthouse keeper and the ghost of a drowned predecessor is familiar; the story transforms it through the letter-chain and the stone code, but the core frame remains recognizable. The risk-taking (lyric accumulation, elided causality, stone semiotics) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, earning a modest +0.2 within-band bonus.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The skipper appears in two beats: bringing supplies mid-story and arriving early near the end. His observation ("a glance that asked if the hauntings were kind tonight") and his reading of the stone stacks without moving them demonstrate the "warmly observant" trait. His early arrival and wordless exchange of letter and look enable the narrator's final stone-stacking and charge the closure image. He does not make a decisive choice that alters the plot, but his presence constrains the narrator's tactics (the letter must be ready, the stones must be stacked) and his recognition validates the anonymous chain. Setup: second beat (~mid-story). Development: his reading of stones. Payoff: present in the penultimate beat, shaping the narrator's final act. Two gates plus causal enabling → 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The sea glass is discovered by the pedestal after the lamp dies, held to the candle where "the ghosts clung to the edges like salt," pressed into the narrator's palm, placed on the sill where "the candle brightened as if gratified," and referenced in the final third ("Keep the glass"). Three distinct beats: discovery, candle test, and sill placement. Its green color ("green as a harbor light") and worn thinness ("years of being almost broken") are specific and irreplaceable. It shapes the narrator's stance (a tangible anchor for the ache) and charges the ending. Setup: late first third. Development: candle test and ghost moment. Payoff: sill placement and letter referencing it. All three gates, causal pressure, closure linkage, specificity → 7.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The anonymous letter chain is signaled in the first third ("Between us runs an anonymous letter chain, older than the rust beneath the ladder"), drives the middle (the widow's letter, the diver's map, the schoolchild's confession, the narrator's responses), and shapes the climax (the narrator writes "We are still here" and the skipper collects it). The chain defines the dominant stake: to protect and pass along safety. It constrains tactics (folding letters small, tucking them in the stair crook, reading them aloud) and is indispensable to the closure image (the final packet stitched with fishline, the recipe, the boy's courage, the instruction to keep the glass). Setup: early. Development: multiple beats. Payoff: closure unit. High causal pressure, irreplaceability, cost connection → 8.6.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The trait "warmly observant" is applied to the skipper in one line ("He is warmly observant, like a tidepool holding sunlight without saying what it reflects") and demonstrated through his glance and his reading of the stone stacks. It does not constrain an on-page action with visible cost; rather, it colors his presence. The trait is specific and apt, but it remains largely descriptive. Setup: early mention. Development: glance and stone-reading are consistent with the trait but do not hinge on it. Payoff: absent. One gate (setup) plus minor beat involvement → 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The action "protect" anchors the narrator's motivation ("All I have ever wanted is to protect the tender hush that arrives after weather") and drives key choices: lighting the candle when the lamp dies, stacking stones for love and for the absent keeper, writing "We are still here," placing the sea glass on the sill, and reading the letters aloud "because the letters prefer to be heard." The final stone-stacking ("I left five stones where waves could almost reach them") is a protective act that crystallizes the ache and charges the closure. The action is irreplaceable—removing "protect" would collapse the thematic spine and the narrator's stance. Setup: explicit by mid-first-third. Development: candle, stones, letters, glass. Payoff: final stone stack and bottling metaphor. High causal pressure, closure linkage, cost connection → 8.3.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The stone-stacking semiotics are introduced early ("We fold the letters small as shells and tuck them behind a way of stacking stones as messages. Three stones means danger, four means soup, five means the one you love is still waiting"). The mechanics matter: the skipper "reads the stacks like scripture and never moves them except to protect the message," and the narrator builds five stones for love and one shell for the absent keeper. The method shapes the narrator's final choice and is irreplaceable. Setup: early first third. Development: skipper reads stones mid-story. Payoff: narrator builds five stones at closure. All three gates, causal pressure, specificity, closure linkage → 7.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The haunted lantern room is the primary setting, named in the opening ("the lantern room keeps glowing with what it cannot forget") and revisited ("I sleep there sometimes"). It supplies the pedestal where the sea glass is found, the candle that reveals the ghosts, and the glass that the birds brush. The haunting pressures the narrator's emotional state and the discovery of the sea glass. The room does not physically constrain a choice (the narrator could leave), but its atmosphere and the objects within it (pedestal, candle, glass) alter tactics and charge the ending. Setup: opening lines. Development: candle and ghost beat. Payoff: the room "lost its birds, but not its listening." All three gates, moderate causal pressure → 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the lamp flickers out" is established in the second line ("After the lamp flickers out, the lantern room keeps glowing") and anchors the opening crisis. The lamp's death triggers the candle-lighting, the discovery of the sea glass, and the haunted visitation. The timeframe does not tighten decisions in a live-clock sense (the story unfolds over one night and the next morning without urgency), but it defines the before/after and shapes the narrator's stance. Setup: second line. Development: candle and ghost beats. Payoff: "When dawn finally shrugged into the windows, the room lost its birds." Two gates (setup, payoff), moderate pressure → 5.2.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The motivation "to bottle the feeling of safety" is stated mid-story ("We do this to bottle the feeling of safety and pass it hand to hand unseen") and dramatized through the narrator's actions: writing letters, stacking stones, reading the packet aloud, placing the sea glass on the sill, and the final bottling metaphor ("If safety could be bottled, it would taste like candle smoke, salt, and softened paper in hands"). The desire is conflicted (the narrator cannot save the drowned keeper, cannot stop the hauntings, cannot guarantee the letters reach their targets) and the cost is visible: solitary endurance, the ache, the vigil. Setup: mid-first-third. Development: letter-reading, stone-stacking. Payoff: final bottling image. High causal pressure, closure linkage, cost connection → 8.1.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The tone "luminescent ache" is established early ("the luminescent ache that guards a coastline better than iron") and sustained through diction ("tender hush," "ghosts clung to the edges like salt," "the gravity of a beach at low tide") and rhythm (long, elegiac sentences). The tone modulates under pressure: the lamp's death and the ghost visitation intensify the ache, and the skipper's arrival and the final stone-stacking crystallize it. The tone charges the final image ("the luminescent ache," "candle smoke, salt, and softened paper") and is indispensable to the closure effect. Setup: early. Development: modulates across beats. Payoff: final bottling line. Coherence, modulation, closure charge → 7.8.</comment>
