<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's internal contradiction—between fearing vanity in prophecy fulfillment and orchestrating safety—acts throughout the piece and shapes her stance at closure. Embodied emotion is sparse; most affect appears in labels ("prickle of embarrassment") or generic states. The decision to free the lightning bugs carries conceptual cost but minimal visible struggle on the page. Secondary characters (fisherman, volcanologist, child) apply pressure but remain functional archetypes without distinct interior friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural with Situational pressure. The piece teaches a mosaic pattern early (bottle-by-bottle accumulation) and delivers Conceptual Repricing at closure: Mara's "texture of transformation" is reweighted as evacuation-as-ritual, with the cost felt in her disavowal of heroism and the elders' prophecy claim she cannot escape. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive cleanly in the opening lines. One meaningful deepening occurs when the mountain exhales and the rehearsed choreography proves its worth, narrowing options retroactively and validating the orchestrated coincidence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The black sand, basalt shelf, and volcano constrain Mara's placement choices and charge the final image (freed fireflies as "revised stars"). Sensory selection is purposeful: "gritty shore," "wet shone," "tremor beneath the speechless surf." The beach functions as micro-setting, with spatial choreography (skiff, lava path, ridge) remaining clear across the mosaic beats. Time and celestial movement (moon, Mars) modulate atmosphere and guide the evacuation's rhythm without overwhelming the narrative.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: orchestrate safe evacuation without spectacle or myth-making. Pressure coheres through accumulative placement of bottles and arrivals, then tightens when the mountain exhales. The fisherman's prophecy mention and Mara's embarrassment add a secondary friction (vanity vs. utility) that inflects but does not split the core conflict. Agency is decision (bottle placement, freeing fireflies) and renunciation (disavowing heroism). Cost is conceptual and relational: she cannot escape being named in the elders' thanks, foreclosing her wish for anonymity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—transformation as texture, not spectacle—emerges from particulars: bottles as breadcrumbs, fireflies as "revised stars," evacuation sung softly rather than sirened. The final image (freed bugs drifting upward, "practicing new steps") reweights the premise without stating a moral. Mara's refusal of heroism and the elders' counter-narrative create productive tension. No thematic echo mars the closure; the story resists tidy resolution by embedding cost (her name in their thanks) within the image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>POV distance is stable third-limited; perceptual signature filters through Mara's aversion to spectacle and myth. Diction is character-specific ("destitute philanthropist," "useful kindness," "texture of transformation") and remains consistent under pressure. Dialogue (fisherman's prophecy, scientist's restraint report) is functional and advances plot without distinct subtext. Free indirect style is clean. Minor register drift: "murmuring plume" in the climax feels elevated but remains within Mara's reflective lexicon. No head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; paragraph lengths create visual flow. Information density is high, with most sentences advancing character, setting, or stakes. Two paraphrase loops: "a vibrant hush that promised permission" / "rumor that when the sea fell silent"; "once she had placed two chairs" / "she could not feed everyone with money anymore" recycles the philanthropist trait without added pressure. Figurative language (driftwood-as-raft, mountain-as-animal) is mostly coherent, though "sheet of ash that curtained stars" strains under the "without panic" modifier. No scaffold or template cadence. Minor clarity slip: "letting desire drift into prearranged paths" abstracts the mechanism.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—orchestrating evacuation via bottled fireflies and prophecy fulfillment—feels specific and non-obvious. The piece transforms the philanthropist archetype through the detail of "gave away coincidence" and the destitute state. Risk-taking in structure (mosaic beats, conceptual closure) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The ending's resonance (fireflies as "revised stars practicing new steps") grows from prior particulars. Mild derivative note: the wise-orchestrator-refuses-credit frame echoes folk-tale patterns, but the textural specificity (black sand, basalt, lightning bugs) anchors originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mara's choices (placing bottles, coaxing strangers, freeing fireflies) drive three distinct beats and shape closure. Her destitute state is signaled early ("gave away money until it left") and inflects her reliance on symbolic rather than material resources. The trait pressures tactics (using donated fireflies rather than purchased gear) and charges the ending when she frees them. Cost is conceptual: she cannot buy safety, only orchestrate it, and cannot escape being named.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The bottled lightning bug collection appears in setup (carried to beach), development (placed as breadcrumb trail, used to guide strangers, child syncs their blinking), and closure (freed to become "revised stars"). The object is handled across four beats, constrains tactics (limited by donation count, requires placement strategy), and reweights meaning at the end. Specificity matters: "donated by a hundred children," "glass chiming," "bright breadcrumb trail." Irreplaceable; no generic light source would carry the symbolic and tactical weight.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The "whispering hush" frames stakes early ("vibrant hush that promised permission," "rumor that when the sea fell silent") and recurs at closure ("letting the hush do most of the speaking"). It shapes tactics: Mara orchestrates quiet evacuation rather than alarm. The concept inflects tone and method but does not narrow options in a high-pressure beat; it remains more atmospheric than causal. Lyric reprise (first → final third) reweights the premise with cost, placing it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Orchestrates coincidences" is signaled early ("gave away coincidence," "useful kindness that flowed like water and sometimes pretended to be chance"), enables three arrivals (fisherman's engine, volcanologist's detour, child's kite), and constrains tactics (requires prearranged paths, bottle placement). The trait pressures the middle by forcing Mara to rely on indirect influence rather than command. Cost: she must accept being read as fulfilling prophecy, losing control of the narrative. Visible across setup, development, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The detour appears in the opening line ("reached the black sand beach… by a detour that felt chosen by the tide") and enables Mara's access to the beach, but does not recur or constrain later choices. The volcanologist's detour ("road above was closed, and the detour down the lava path") echoes the motif functionally but remains a setup convenience. Swappable: any access path would serve; the "tide-chosen" phrasing adds lyric texture but no tactical pressure. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Fulfilling prophecies accidentally" is signaled early (Mara's embarrassment, poet-and-star anecdote), pressures her at midpoint (fisherman's prophecy about "lightning in jars"), and inflects closure (elders' thanks she pretends not to hear). The method shapes her stance—seeking "no myth, only a safe path"—and imposes cost: she cannot control being mythologized. Development shows the friction but not the mechanics; the prophecy is fulfilled more by frame than by visible accident. Present across all three gates but lightly causal.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The black sand beach at the volcano's foot anchors all action, supplies resources (basalt shelf, firm sand, lazy current), and pressures choices (tremor monitoring, ridge placement, ash direction). The setting is established in the opening and remains active through closure (freed fireflies drift upward against the volcano's exhalation). Spatial details (cove, lava path, river mouth, ridge) guide choreography. The setting is irreplaceable: no other geography would deliver the tremor threat, evacuation stakes, and ash plume resolution with the same particulars.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The celestial timeframe ("slow dance of celestial bodies," "moon slipping behind the earth while Mars grazed a shoulder of cloud") is signaled early and recurs at the climax, charging the atmosphere. It modulates light (beach "dim and then glowing") and paces the evacuation ritual. However, it does not tighten decisions or create a deadline; the mountain exhales on its own schedule. The timeframe enriches tone and setting but does not constrain tactics. Lyric contribution without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Mara's desire "to understand the texture of transformation" bookends the piece, shapes her method (orchestrating hush over spectacle, freeing fireflies to practice "new steps"), and charges the closure image. The motivation is dramatized in her aversion to myth-making and her micro-choices (bottle placement, urging stance). Friction: her wish for anonymity conflicts with the elders' naming. The motivation is felt across all three gates and inflects the ending's cost, though internal struggle is more told than shown in peak beats.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Vibrant hush" is established early ("whispering hush," "vibrant hush that promised permission") and sustained through the piece: "hush the mountain sounded," "letting the hush do most of the speaking." Tone modulates with pressure (quiet arrivals, tremor listening, gentle exhalation) and charges the final image (fireflies drifting "to the shaken dark"). Coherent through turns; no tonal breaks. The tone is irreplaceable: noise or alarm would collapse the orchestrated-coincidence method and the texture-over-spectacle theme.</comment>
