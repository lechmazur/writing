<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's spiritual curiosity and past-life mirror-maker identity are embodied through concrete actions (camera setup, breath work, the vial). Internal contradiction between measuring/hoarding light versus giving emerges clearly in the glass-room memory. However, the epiphany about unused love stored in "held breath" arrives through metaphoric assertion rather than through a dramatized mistake or struggle that forces the realization. The encounter with the passing man feels gestural rather than a choice that narrows options with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with closure via Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid). The viaduct-blooms-breath pattern accumulates density and the final image ("viaduct breathe easier") reweights the hoarded-love premise with felt cost (the "storage closet unlatch behind my ribs"). Orientation anchors POV, twilight viaduct, and the past-life frame early. One meaningful deepening occurs when the glass woman turns toward the street, unlocking the storage closet. Cost is legible in the decanting metaphor and the physical sensation of release, though the mechanism remains abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The viaduct's blooming vines, parapet, and arches provide concrete spatial anchors and the flowers "lean in like listeners," charging the closure image when lamps blossom and the bridge "hums like a tuning fork." The camera obscura box and Kwan Yin's tear vial function as micro-setting tools that constrain the protagonist's breathing practice. However, the river and arches remain somewhat atmospheric rather than imposing hard choices, and the foggy twilight soft-focuses physicality when sharper sensory detail could deepen pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding where unused love is stored—is signaled early and pursued through the breath-and-box practice. One meaningful tightening: the past-life woman in glass turns toward the street, which triggers the rib-closet unlatch and enables the decanting. The man's pause and shared breath rhythm adds a secondary pressure accent. Cost is legible (the emptied jars, the unlocked closet) but the resolution feels more like permission granted than a trade-off with visible sacrifice, keeping it from the higher band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The unused-love premise emerges through the camera practice, breath rhythm, and the past-life glass room rather than thesis statements. The final image—"viaduct breathe easier"—and the shared breath with the stranger offer a resonant, non-literal answer: love decants when we "resist the exhale" less. The theme of hoarding versus release threads through action and avoids moralizing. Minor slip: "I am spiritually curious, which is another way of saying…" flirts with meta-commentary, though it remains character-voice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single-POV first-person maintains stable distance and a distinct lyric-philosophical register ("diluted ink," "interior weather," "golden reasons"). Perceptual signature is consistent (light-and-breath focus). However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated diction that feels authored rather than organic to a camera artist under pressure ("translucent letter," "decant"), and the stranger's dialogue—"what I am doing"—is paraphrased rather than quoted, reducing subtext opportunity. No head-hopping; tense is stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative density is high throughout ("fog lucidity," "pilgrim of sparks," "river reads them as if they were meant for its far estuary"). This creates lush texture but also triggers overwriting in peak beats: the closure paragraph stacks metaphors (storage closet, decant, emptied jars, river adjustment) that blur the single decisive image. Paraphrase loops appear: "unused love is stored" recurs across multiple lines without added pressure. Sentence openings vary and no major grammar errors, but the figurative load slows momentum in the final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The camera-obscura-as-healing-practice synthesis is specific and non-obvious, and the breath-as-conduit for releasing hoarded love avoids stock spiritual-quest templates. The past-life mirror-maker detail and Kwan Yin's tear add texture. However, the spiritual-pilgrim frame and the "unused love stored" conceit echo familiar prompt-like structures, and the resolution (breath practice + stranger witness = unlocked closet) feels more confirmatory than transformative. The piece commits fully to its lyric logic, which elevates it within band, but the emotional arc follows a well-worn path from withholding to release.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The camera obscura artist sets the box, adjusts aperture, and exhales/inhales to shift the image; these actions frame the practice. The camera choice enables the breath work but does not force a key reversal. The protagonist's decisions (setting the box, speaking to the past-life woman, sending breath outward) drive the ending, but the artist identity itself is more enabler than constrainer. Present in setup, middle practice, and ending image, satisfying two-of-three gates and shaping one key turn.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Kwan Yin's tear appears early (pocket mention) and is used once (dab on tongue mid-scene) to trigger memory heat, enabling the past-life vision. It does not return at closure or accumulate pressure across multiple beats. Functional but largely replaceable with any sacred catalyst. Two gates (setup, middle) but missing closure participation caps it; the single use prevents higher scores.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Pilgrim of sparks" is named once in narration ("a pilgrim of sparks walking inside the lens") as metaphoric self-description but does not constrain tactics or recur with reweighted meaning. It decorates the spiritual-journey theme without altering on-page choices. Present as thematic echo only; no causal pressure or closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Spiritually curious" is stated early and motivates the search for unused love's storage, shaping the dominant stake. However, it functions as backstory framing rather than a trait that enables or constrains a specific on-page choice with visible cost. The curiosity drives the premise but does not create a trade-off or tactical dilemma in scene. Functional label, one beat (setup), no closure participation caps it at mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Heal what we hoarded" is spoken mid-scene and triggers the arches loosening and blooms releasing pollen, then the storage-closet unlatch and decanting at closure. The action appears in two beats (declaration, resolution) and shapes the ending's release image. However, the mechanics are abstract (breath + declaration = unlatch) and the healing could be swapped for "release" or "give" with minor edits. All three gates present, two-beat involvement, closure linkage, but moderate swappability limits the high band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Breathing changes are signaled early ("breath carries different music") and the method structures the entire practice: exhale thickens arches, inhale grows river ribs, exhales write letters, inhales receive answers. The breath rhythm enables the shared-tide moment with the stranger and charges the final "breathe easier" image. Present across three beats (setup, practice, closure) with causal pressure and closure linkage. Specificity is high; the method is indispensable to the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The twilight viaduct in bloom is anchored early and provides spatial grounding (parapet, arches, blooming vines, river). The flowers "lean in like listeners" and lamps blossom at closure, and the bridge hums "like a tuning fork" in the shared-breath beat, charging the final image. However, the viaduct does not impose hard constraints on choices; it supplies atmosphere and the breath-practice stage rather than narrowing tactics. All three gates, lyric reprise at closure, but passive role keeps it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the past life memory surfaces" is stated early and frames the protagonist's motivation (needing to hear what stone holds). The past-life vision recurs mid-scene and the glass woman's turn enables the closure unlatch. However, "after" is a static condition rather than a ticking clock; time does not tighten decisions or alter tactics under pressure. Two gates (setup, middle), one beat of causal work, but no urgency or deadline.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Finding where unused love is stored is named early, drives the camera practice, and is answered at closure ("unused love…is stored wherever we resist the exhale"). The motivation structures the dominant stake and the breath-practice attempts. Friction appears in the glass-woman's refusal to turn and the protagonist's need to "heal what we hoarded," creating a mini-obstacle. All three gates, two beats of involvement, closure payoff. However, the quest unfolds more as confirmation than as conflicted struggle with competing wants, capping it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Foggy lucidity" is named in the opening line and sustained through "softened, edged but tender," "interior weather," "translucent letter," and the final "breathe easier" clarity-within-mist image. The tone modulates subtly: contemplative in setup, urgent during the glass-woman encounter, calm at closure. It charges the ending by making the release feel gradual and permeable rather than sharp. Coherent throughout, present in all three gates, shapes the story's perceptual texture, and the ending image depends on it.</comment>
