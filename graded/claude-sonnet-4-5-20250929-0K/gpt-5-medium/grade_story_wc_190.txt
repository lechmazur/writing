<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The gondola operator's interiority shows character-specific perception (storm glass reading, noise monitoring) and the mathematician receives embodied emotion through physical cues ("hands rest on her lap betrays turbulence," shoulders loosening). However, the operator's motivation to "teach silence how to comfort" remains largely abstract—demonstrated through exposition about the singer's suicide and guild philosophy rather than through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The mathematician's equation about grief feels more like a symbolic device than a lived struggle with visible micro-choices under pressure. Minor deduction for the therapeutic framing ("how to be held by it") that edges toward label-speak without full embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates sensory particulars (storm glass crystals, train whistles, felt-wrapped notes) and builds through pattern repetition toward a final cadence shift where "the motion now is kin to rest." Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the mathematician's transition from computational analysis to embodied presence, crystallized in "the not speaking is not a wall but a window," with the conceptual cost of abandoning proof-seeking legible in her closing her eyes and ceasing calculation. Orientation is clear by the opening lines. The tightening is modest—one meaningful deepening when she stops computing angles—but sufficient for this length and lens. Cost is felt rather than dramatic, fitting the accumulative design.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The drifting prism terrace is vividly anchored through sensory specifics (cities "glint like pinned insects," facets throwing "pale geometry," iron-scented seams, velvet-lined pylons). The storm glass vial and the physical gondola setup constrain and enable the operator's work, shaping the final moment when the vial "turns clear as winter morning" as a signal tied to the closure image. Micro-setting (the glass, the baffles, the windows) matters to both atmosphere and the operator's sense-making. The piece maintains a consistent lyric-observational filter throughout. Spatial choreography remains legible across the transit arc.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: whether the operator can catalyze comfort for the mathematician's grief-entangled problem. The pressure is situational and accumulative rather than causal-agonistic: the mathematician's resistance to the schedule, her need to "be held" by air rather than proof, builds through conversation and sensory immersion until she stops computing and breathes differently. One meaningful tightening occurs when she "does not try to compute the angle of our sway" and asks the operator to name the work. The cost is legible in her relinquishing the equation's logic, a path foreclosed. Agency is present but quiet—attention and calibrated drift rather than decisive confrontation. The escalation is modest, fitting the lens, but could bear more visible friction or trade-off to reach higher bands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through accumulated particulars: silence as constructed refuge, the contrast between equation and embodiment, the recurring image of stairwells and rooms (the singer's leap, the mathematician's slammed-door memory, "a hush that makes a room of the gap"). The final image—"the cable were a cradle and the night a measured lullaby"—offers a non-literal answer to how comfort can hold without hands, reweighting prior material without stating a moral. The piece resists tidy resolution; the mathematician's problem is not solved, only reconfigured. Minor flaw: "practice of better absences" edges toward thematic statement, though it remains anchored in the operator's work rather than drifting into authorial thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Single POV with clean third-limited focalization throughout. The operator's perceptual signature is consistent and specific: noise-level monitoring, storm glass interpretation, guild-trained attention to hush. Diction remains controlled and voice-motivated, with purposeful compression ("sounding void," "hallway became a hand") that fits the lyric mode. The mathematician's dialogue feels natural and goal-driven. Minor issues: free indirect style occasionally blurs ("fluidly logical" reads slightly external for tight third), and a few lines approach filter-verb stacking ("I tell her," "She asks," "I say") in quick succession mid-passage. These do not obscure clarity or pressure but prevent entry to the high band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm and texture are strong, with varied sentence lengths and purposeful compression. Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere, character, or thematic layering. However, several lines loop or restate without added pressure: "I do this to teach silence how to comfort, to make the sounding void an ally" versus later "I try to build with cables and altitude and listening, a hush that makes a room of the gap" recycles the same concept. The phrase "in the quiet that follows a train whistle's echo" appears verbatim three times as a refrain, which is pattern-taught but borders on redundancy without sufficient reweighting each time. Figurative density is high but mostly coherent; "logic dreaming of color" and "cable were a cradle" work without mixed metaphors. Apply paraphrase-loop and template-cadence penalties: −0.6 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of gondola monitoring, grief-equation, and engineered silence is non-obvious and feels earned rather than gimmicky. The storm glass vial and noise-level work anchor the premise in specific, verifiable detail. The piece takes risks with lyric compression and quiet closure, sustaining coherence without retreating to safety. However, the mathematician's "equation that predicts grief" leans slightly toward metaphorical convenience—a symbolic problem rather than a fully grounded one—and the singer's balcony leap functions primarily as backstory weight rather than plot driver. The fresh angle (comfort as engineered sensory reduction) is strong enough to lift the score, but the emotional calculus could be more surprising in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Gondola operator: Present throughout, makes tactical choices (dimming cabin light, opening windows, slowing drift, marking soundfall, hanging baffles), and the final choice to "let the gondola slow to drift even more gently" directly shapes the closure moment when the mathematician's shoulders loosen. Setup clear, development spans multiple beats, payoff present in final image. Causal pressure moderate; the choices enable the mathematician's shift but are not under high friction themselves.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Storm glass vial: Handled and read in three distinct beats (clouds with slow crystals when city quiets, clears in the iron-scented seam, turns clear as winter morning at closure). The vial functions as both diagnostic tool and signal for the operator's work succeeding, directly shaping the operator's interpretation and tied to the final reconfiguration. Setup early, development clear, payoff charges the ending. Causal pressure strong; the vial's state gates the operator's sense of progress. Specificity high; no generic gauge could replace it without loss.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>In transit: Shapes stakes and tactics throughout. The gondola's continuous motion structures the entire encounter, the "thin line stitching motion to meaning" frames the operator's philosophy, and the final lines resolve the tension between transit and rest ("the motion now is kin to rest, as if the cable were a cradle"). The concept constrains the spatial and temporal frame and charges the closure image. Setup immediate, development continuous, payoff decisive. Removing "in transit" collapses the premise and the final paradox.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Fluidly logical: Applied to the mathematician's speech and provides contrast with her turbulent hands, setting up the tension between rational control and embodied grief. However, the trait remains mostly label-only; we see her ask logical questions ("whether I can measure comfort") but no on-page moment where her fluid logic constrains a choice or creates visible cost. The trait primes the closure (she stops computing) but does not drive a beat. Setup present, development weak, payoff indirect. Swappable with "analytically precise" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Catalyze: The operator explicitly states "I say I can only catalyze it" and the entire arc demonstrates catalysis—creating conditions (dimming light, opening windows, slowing drift) rather than forcing an outcome. The action shapes the middle choice (adjusting the environment) and the final state (the mathematician's unclenching). However, the mechanics are passive enablement rather than high-friction agency; the operator's catalyzing is more atmospheric than plot-driving. Setup clear, development spans two beats, payoff present. Could be replaced with "facilitate" or "enable" without major structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Monitoring noise levels: Signaled early ("My work is monitoring noise levels"), mechanics matter (tapping barometer, marking soundfall on paper, listening for train whistles and hush), and the method structures the operator's guild role and tactical choices (hanging baffles, lining pylons with velvet, adjusting drift speed). The method enables the operator's credibility and shapes the approach to the mathematician's problem. Setup early, development in multiple beats (marking, listening, adjusting), payoff indirect but present (the final "rustle threaded to her breathing" confirms the method's success). Causal pressure moderate; the method is more diagnostic than plot-driving.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Drifting prism terrace: Supplies the spatial frame, the facets that "throw pale geometry across her face," and the altitude that makes "cities glint like pinned insects below." The terrace's drift and verticality enable the operator's noise-monitoring work and provide the isolation necessary for the mathematician's shift. The final line references the terrace learning "a new angle for its light," directly tying setting to closure. Setup immediate, development continuous (crossing zones, passing spires, arcing toward the next tower), payoff charges the final image. Micro-setting (windows, rail, cabin light) also constrains choices. Removing the terrace collapses the premise.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>In the quiet that follows a train whistle's echo: The timeframe anchors the opening, recurs as a refrain mid-story ("we both wait for the returning hush"), and closes the mathematician's arc ("in the quiet that follows a train whistle's echo she closes her eyes"). The recurring sonic event creates a rhythmic pressure and tightens the window in which the operator's catalysis can work. Setup immediate, development structures two key beats (storm glass crystals forming, final unclenching), payoff decisive. The timeframe is not a ticking clock but a recurring condition that reweights each iteration. Cost is conceptual: the mathematician must wait for the quiet rather than force resolution. Specificity high; no generic pause could replace it.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>To teach silence how to comfort: Desire is stated early, contextualized through the singer's suicide backstory, and dramatized through the operator's tactical choices (tuning routes, adjusting drift, hanging baffles, dimming light). The motivation drives the operator's engagement with the mathematician and the final success (the mathematician's shoulders loosening, the not speaking becoming "a window"). However, the motivation is more philosophical mission than conflicted want; there is no visible friction between the operator's goal and a competing desire or cost. Setup early, development spans multiple beats, payoff clear. Could bear more internal contradiction or trade-off to reach higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Vaulting hush: Tone is established in the opening line ("the air has the tone of a vaulting hush"), sustained through lyric compression and sensory restraint (cities below, sky holding breath, notes wrapped in felt, musicians moving "like silent rain"), and modulates subtly under pressure (the mathematician's turbulence, the train whistle's shear, the final "measured lullaby"). The tone charges the closure image by making stillness active and architectural. Setup immediate, development coherent across turns, payoff decisive. The tone's controlled elevation matches the piece's accumulative lens and never breaks into discord or sentimentality.</comment>
