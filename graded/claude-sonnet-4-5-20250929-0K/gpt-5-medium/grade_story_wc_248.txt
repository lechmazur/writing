<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in a backstory promise, but interiority trends toward lyric abstraction ("analytically intuitive meeting analytically intuitive") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The self-portrait's throat-gouge and the seed-planting moment show micro-choices, yet the final stance feels declared rather than earned through visible internal conflict. Miren remains a constructed absence; their relationship is told through metaphor ("kiln, not a bomb") without on-page friction that would test loyalty or doubt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: a trail of artistic clues accumulates toward a final thematic reconfiguration where the arson becomes "primer" and the city a "vow kept." Orientation anchors who and where by the second paragraph, though "after going off the grid" remains vague in duration and consequence. The closure unit is a Conceptual Repricing—the seeds write names onto wind, reweighting the arson as preservation—but the cost (what the protagonist forfeits or risks by planting seeds in a ruin) is asserted rather than dramatically legible. One tightening occurs when the tapestry fragment aligns with the canvas gouge, opening the stair, but subsequent beats feel like successive revelations without narrowing options or raising stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The archive is vivid and purposeful: dunes, stone halls, feather-choked stairwells, and salt-shivering murals create a coherent ruin. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from collapsed reading room to vault to atrium. The oculus and the seeds' sprouting filaments constrain the final act—the protagonist must plant where "wind poured through"—which charges the closure image and meets the 9+ gate test for environment shaping a choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—honoring Miren's promise to shelter readers—is signaled early and carries moral weight. The arson backstory provides context, but on-page pressure remains largely episodic: each clue (painted birds, mosaic, portrait gouge, spool) is solved without complication or cost. The seed-planting is framed as climactic, yet no antagonist, time limit, or internal hesitation tests the protagonist's commitment. One meaningful deepening occurs when the hidden message links past and present names, but agency reads as following a pre-set trail rather than making a trade-off that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—preservation through destruction, memory as debt and gratitude—emerges from the arson backstory and the seed ritual. The final image of seeds writing names onto wind offers a non-literal answer to the central question of how to keep readers safe. However, the thematic calculus is stated rather than tested: "the arson had been the primer" and "the rescue could finish" are assertions that shortcut dramatized realization. Subtext operates in the portrait's slashed throat and the soot-as-skin reveal, but the closing vow to "rebuild the library as a lending of breath" tilts toward direct thematic summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Voice is lyric and image-dense ("heart steaming with volcanic tenderness," "analytically intuitive, that was my curse and compass"), establishing a consistent register. POV remains stable first-person with no head-hopping. However, diction in peak beats often elevates into ornamental abstraction ("filaments that wrote across the floor in curling ink") that prioritizes texture over embodied urgency. Sentence stems recur: "I [verb]" and "The [noun] [verb]" patterns dominate, flattening rhythmic variety. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not evaluated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Figurative language is frequent and sometimes vivid ("spine of stone halls," "a kiln, not a bomb"), but density in high-pressure beats obscures momentum: "seeds opened like small eyes, sprouting filaments that wrote across the floor in curling ink, linking names from portrait to mosaic to tapestry." Mixed metaphors appear ("heart steaming with volcanic tenderness"). Template cadence runs: multiple sentences open with "I [verb]" or "The [noun] [verb]" without variation. Paraphrase loops: the "trail of artistic creations leading to a hidden message" is stated in paragraph 6, then restated in paragraph 23 as "The trail of artistic creations… became a single living sentence." Synonym churn: "analytically intuitive" appears three times as a label without evolving function. These artifacts do not fully obscure closure but dull line-level propulsion and trigger the patterned-artifact penalty pack: baseline −0.8 in Q7, with an additional −0.2 for convergence at the closure beat ("the seeds wrote the last names onto the wind").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The premise—a lending library arsonist following an art trail in a buried archive—combines familiar elements (hidden message, mentor's legacy, ruin exploration) in a specific synthesis. The "punctuation seeds" and the soot-lifting technique offer fresh detail. However, the emotional arc (guilt → understanding → vow) follows a template progression, and the arson-as-preservation paradox is stated rather than tested through on-page friction. The narrative avoids bold risk: no turn surprises, and the final vow to "rebuild the library as a lending of breath" resolves ambiguity tidily. Transformation test: swap the archive for another hidden library and the trail for another puzzle, and the structure holds.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The lending library arsonist frames the backstory and motivation, but the arson itself is recounted rather than dramatized. On-page, the protagonist solves clues without meaningful resistance or internal conflict tied to their arsonist identity. The final vow to rebuild references the arson, but the trait "arsonist" does not constrain a choice or alter tactics in the present window. Present by setup, absent in middle development as a pressure point, and ornamental at closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The faded tapestry fragment appears in paragraph 5, is aligned with the canvas gouge in paragraph 10 to reveal a corridor overlay, and is folded back into the coat in paragraph 25. It enables the key transition from portrait to stairwell (beat involvement: two distinct beats) and its "threads whispering directions" prime the trail's logic. The fragment does not return with reweighted meaning at closure, capping higher-band access, but its causal role in navigation and its early signal earn solid integration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The vandalized self-portrait of Miren is central: discovered in paragraph 8, its throat gouge reveals the underdrawing in paragraph 10, and the protagonist stitches through it in paragraph 19 to lift soot and reveal burned letters. The portrait is carried "like a shield" in the final lines, recharging its protective symbolism. It drives two distinct beats (discovery and stitching), enables the hidden-message reveal, and appears at closure with reweighted meaning. The element is indispensable to the puzzle's mechanics and the mentor-legacy theme.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Analytically intuitive" is named three times (paragraphs 4, 17, 26) but functions as a label rather than a visible constraint or enabler. No on-page choice demonstrates a trade-off between analysis and intuition; the protagonist simply solves each clue without friction. The trait does not narrow options or impose cost, and removing it would not alter the story's logic. Present by setup, absent in middle development, ornamental at closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Portray" is reflected in Miren's self-portrait and the line "Miren loved to portray herself as dangerous to shield her tenderness." The stitching beat in paragraph 19 involves the portrait's surface, and the closing image includes carrying the portrait. However, the action "portray" itself (an act of creation or representation) is not dramatized on the page; the protagonist does not paint, draw, or make an image. The element is thematically present and shapes one key turn (the portrait's reveal) but is functionally passive. Lyric resonance (early seed → final reprise) without mid-scene use allows entry to the 5.5–6.3 band, but swappability with "interpret" or "read" lowers the score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The trail of artistic creations (painted birds, mosaic, portrait, murals, punctuation seeds) is signaled in paragraph 6 and structures the entire middle sequence. Each clue enables the next move: birds point to reading room, mosaic reveals pattern, portrait gouge opens stair, murals arrange the vector, seeds complete the sentence. The method drives three distinct beats and shapes the closure image ("the trail… became a single living sentence"). It is irreplaceable to the story's mechanics and causally essential.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lost civilization archive is anchored in paragraph 3 and supplies resources throughout: the collapsed reading room houses the mosaic, the stair shaft provides passage, the vault holds murals and the spool, the atrium's broken oculus creates the planting site. The oculus constrains the final act—seeds must be planted "where wind poured through"—and the archive's layered history (town swallowed, dead citizens) charges thematic meaning. The setting drives at least two beats (stair descent, seed planting) and shapes the closure image. It is indispensable to both logistics and resonance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"After going off the grid" appears in paragraphs 1 and 14 but remains vague in duration and consequence. No on-page clock or deadline tightens decisions; the protagonist moves through the archive at a contemplative pace without time pressure. The phrase does not constrain tactics or alter options. Ornamental framing without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The motivation to rescue a forgotten promise (to shelter readers by protecting the borrowers list) is stated in paragraphs 12–13 and drives the backstory arson. The promise expands in paragraph 14 to include the buried city's memory. However, the on-page journey does not dramatize friction between the promise and a competing want or cost; the protagonist pursues clues without hesitation. The motivation frames stakes and appears in the closing vow ("keep the readers unlisted"), meeting the lyric-resonance allowance for early seed → final reprise. Desire is present and coherent but not tested under conflicting pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Volcanic tenderness" appears in paragraph 1 ("heart steaming with volcanic tenderness") and paragraph 21 ("with a tenderness that felt volcanic"). The oxymoron suggests heat and care coexisting, matching the arson-as-preservation paradox. Tone modulates lyrically across beats but does not shift with pressure; the contemplative register remains static whether solving clues or planting seeds. The phrase charges the seed-planting moment and reprises the opening, meeting the lyric gate. However, the tone does not escalate or crystallize under stress, capping higher-band access.</comment>
