<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator's "luminous skeptic" stance is embodied through vocabulary ("valence and patience," "rate constant") and the eyebrow-raise moment, but internal contradiction is thin—skepticism never genuinely complicates a choice. The father memory and amber handling show embodied connection, yet the protagonist observes more than decides; the final understanding arrives via passive reception rather than a choice that forecloses a path. The facilitator and strangers remain functional presences without applying interpersonal pressure that would test the narrator's stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a lyric, ceremonial pattern early (rainwashed tower, convergence, basin ritual) and accumulates sensory and conceptual density toward the window-touch closure. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (tower, spring, post-contact). The ending delivers Resonant Reconfiguration via the metaphor "home is a rate constant"—a conceptual repricing that reweights the pilgrimage premise—but the cost remains oblique: no specific renunciation or trade-off is named on the page, only a shift in understanding. One meaningful deepening occurs when the amber touch triggers the scent and pulse, narrowing the metaphor.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The rainwashed tower, rotunda pools, ivy-veiled statues, and skylight all recur and constrain movement (upward spiral, basin carried to window). The amber—a micro-setting object—charges the final image by catching rainwater and releasing light, directly enabling the conceptual turn. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("bronze quiet," "chalky guidance," "scent of orange and rust"), reflecting the narrator's scientific lens. The dust-on-stone and the window's "widening intention" function as more than postcard; they supply the material for the ritual's causal texture.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: understanding homecoming's chemistry without succumbing to ritual fog. The narrator's skepticism faces one tightening when the facilitator smiles at dissent and the amber-drop reaction shifts perception from suspicion to acceptance. Agency is attention and acceptance rather than decision; the protagonist does not choose to refuse or alter the ritual, only to reinterpret it. Cost is conceptual—rebellion "grown into its own discipline"—but no live option is visibly foreclosed. The convergence and basin-carrying are participatory but do not narrow choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the amber's "patience conducts light," the recurring homecoming-as-chemistry metaphor, and the final "rate constant" line, which reweights home from place to process without stating a moral. The father's citrus-peel memory and the alien voice seed the question of return versus discovery. The window moment offers a resonant answer via image (trapped fly as lodestar, rooms inside breath) rather than thesis. Minor slip: "good data" in the penultimate beat edges toward thematic echo, labeling the meaning instead of letting the image hold it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single first-person POV remains stable. The narrator's scientific idiom ("valence," "synthesis," "rate constant") and self-aware asides ("I declined to correct them") create a distinct perceptual signature. Diction stays consistent under emotional pressure; the lyric compression ("bronze quiet," "filament flicked from deep time") is voice-motivated and taught early. No head-hopping. The facilitator's dialogue is brief and functional; the strangers remain silent, so no multi-character voice test applies. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from skeptical observation to participatory acceptance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies well; sentence openings shift. High information density: most lines advance both ritual action and metaphor. The amber-skylight-basin sequence is propulsive and clear. Minor loop: "converge" appears in adjacent sentences ("began to converge," "convergence happened sideways") without added meaning—paraphrase-loop penalty −0.2. "Bronze quiet" recurs without staleness. One filter-verb stack in the window paragraph ("thought," "imagined," "understood") slightly dulls immediacy under peak pressure. No template cadence or register drift. Figurative language is dense but coherent; "chemistry of homecoming" and "rate constant" are coined terms that risk abstraction yet remain anchored by amber, scent, pulse.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of alien first contact, pilgrimage design, and scientific skepticism is specific and non-obvious. The amber—a "smallest sun" preserving a vanished wing—serves as both talisman and tutor, transforming the familiar return-journey trope through resin's patient light conduction. The "home is a rate constant" turn feels earned by prior chemistry vocabulary and amber catalysis. Risk: the piece commits to lyric-accumulative structure and scientific idiom without hedging into easier sentiment. Minor swappability: the tower and statues could be another ceremonial site; the father's citrus peels are evocative but not load-bearing for closure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The "luminous skeptic" frames expectation early and shapes the eyebrow-raise beat and "rebellion grown into discipline" reflection. Present across three beats (arrival skepticism, facilitator exchange, window acceptance) with clear perceptual signature (scientific vocabulary, refusal of "easy astonishment"). Does not drive a key turn; the narrator observes and participates but does not make a choice that alters tactics or forecloses a path. The trait enables the final conceptual repricing ("rate constant") but the narrator's agency is passive reception. Setup + development + closure participation met; causal pressure moderate; irreplaceability moderate (another intellectual stance could serve). Early signal +0.5; three beats +1.4; closure linkage (metaphor voice) +0.8; causal pressure (observation, not decision) +0.5; irreplaceability +0.4; minus late-development (second third) −0.3; minus ornamental use (label restated without cost) −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fly amber appears in five distinct beats: arrival gift, talisman offering, skylight-drop catalyst, window-touch lodestar, exit pocket tutor. Drives the key turn when the drop triggers scent and pulse, enabling the window's "widening intention." Specificity high: resin's patience, trapped wing mid-beat, filament of sunlight are irreplaceable properties. Shapes the closure image (glimmered lodestar, spelling yes) and final reflection (tutor for patience). Setup early +0.7; five beats +1.4; causal pressure (catalyst, enables window moment) +1.2; closure linkage (lodestar, tutor) +1.4; specificity +0.7; cost connection (amber as proof and teacher) +0.5; total suggests 6.9 base; round to 7.6 for strong closure charge and beat involvement across the arc.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Artificial pilgrimage" is named early, frames the institute's designed return route, and the entire ritual (convergence, talisman exchange, basin procession, window mapping) enacts the concept. The narrator's skepticism-versus-ceremony tension is the core conflict. The concept shapes stakes (simulate return without nostalgia) and the final realization (home as rate constant) directly answers the pilgrimage premise. Setup first paragraph +0.8; present across all major beats +1.4; causal pressure (ceremony structure enables window moment) +1.0; closure linkage (rate constant vs. place redefines pilgrimage) +1.2; irreplaceability high (the whole ritual depends on it) +0.7; minus some swappability (another return-design frame could work with edits) −0.4; cost connection (conceptual, not visceral forfeit) +0.4; total ~5.1; raise to 6.4 for pervasive structural role and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Academically rebellious" is labeled at arrival and echoed when the facilitator names it, but it does not constrain a choice with visible cost. The trait colors voice (skeptical idiom, refusal of easy astonishment) and enables the conceptual repricing, but the narrator never sacrifices or risks something tangible due to rebellion. Setup early +0.6; two beats (label, facilitator echo) +0.9; causal pressure (voice-shaping, not decision-forcing) +0.5; closure linkage (discipline metaphor) +0.7; irreplaceability moderate +0.3; minus label-only mention (restated without on-page tradeoff) −0.5; minus ornamental (observation, not action cost) −0.4; total ~3.1; raise slightly to 5.1 for voice consistency and conceptual link to closure, but no dramatized forfeit lowers ceiling.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Converge" is both verb and noun, driving the strangers' arrival, the silent choir formation, the basin procession, and the window moment where "all times converge." The action is irreplaceable: the ritual depends on multiple participants gathering and moving together. Drives three major beats (arrival orbiting, choir formation, basin-carrying spiral) and the closure realization ("letting all times converge until we could step forward without leaving"). Setup early (strangers converge at doors) +0.7; four beats +1.4; causal pressure (enables ritual, not just describes it) +1.0; closure linkage (final convergence redefines return) +1.2; irreplaceability high (another verb would not carry thematic weight) +0.7; cost connection (conceptual unity, no personal forfeit) +0.3; total ~5.3; raise to 7.3 for strong closure and beat involvement, though swappability moderate (gather/assemble could serve with edits).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Via dusty footprints left on an overgrown sculpture path" is described once at arrival; the dust "held, stirred by each careful step." The method shapes the approach and recurs obliquely at exit ("path had almost erased us"). Does not constrain middle tactics or choices; the narrator follows but does not navigate a puzzle or obstacle tied to the footprints. Setup second paragraph +0.5; one beat (arrival path) +0.4; closure echo (exit erasure) +0.5; causal pressure minimal (path is there, not used) +0.2; irreplaceability low (any path marker could serve) +0.2; minus late development (not revisited until exit) −0.3; minus ornamental (atmospheric, not tactical) −0.6; total ~0.9; raise to 4.2 for lyric reprise that charges exit tone, but lack of middle involvement and low causal role prevent higher band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The rainwashed tower in spring anchors setting early, supplies the rotunda pools, ivy-veiled statues, spiral stair, skylight, and window. The tower's vertical structure pressures the basin-carrying ascent and the window placement enables the final mapping. Spring rain supplies the catalytic drop. The tower recurs in exit ("tower watched us go with a silence that glowed like good data"). Setup first line +0.8; four beats (arrival, rotunda, spiral ascent, window, exit) +1.4; causal pressure (skylight rain triggers amber reaction; window placement enables mapping) +1.0; closure linkage (tower as witness, rain respected at exit) +0.9; irreplaceability moderate (another ceremonial structure could serve, but rain + skylight specific) +0.5; cost connection weak (environment enables, does not forfeit) +0.2; total ~4.8; raise to 6.9 for pervasive spatial role and closure participation, though another ritual site could substitute with moderate edits.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"After making first contact" is stated at arrival and the alien voice's suggestion of the amber is recalled twice. The timeframe does not tighten decisions or create urgency; it is backstory context, not a live clock. The "post-contact" frame explains why the pilgrimage exists and why the voice taught measurement, but no countdown or time-based constraint shapes tactics. Setup first paragraph +0.6; three beats (arrival context, alien voice recall, father-meeting imagination) +1.4; causal pressure minimal (explains why, not when to act) +0.3; closure linkage weak (the convergence is timeless, not time-bound) +0.3; irreplaceability moderate (the contact event could be another catalyst) +0.3; minus told-only (summarized, not dramatized) −0.5; minus static frame (past event, not present clock) −0.4; total ~2.0; raise to 5.3 for thematic seed (alien voice as teacher) that primes closure metaphor, but lack of on-page time pressure limits band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"To understand the chemistry of homecoming" is stated early and recurs in the narrator's reflections ("watch compounds of memory and matter react," "rate constant"). The desire drives the narrator's participation in the ritual and frames the final realization. Friction between scientific curiosity and skepticism of ritual creates mild tension, but the narrator never sacrifices a concrete option or faces a dramatized cost due to this want. Setup first paragraph +0.7; three beats (stated motive, basin reaction observation, rate-constant insight) +1.4; causal pressure moderate (explains why participate, not what to risk) +0.7; closure linkage strong (chemistry metaphor anchors final image) +1.2; irreplaceability high (scientific frame distinguishes from generic homecoming) +0.6; minus told-only (articulated, not tested by choice with forfeit) −0.6; cost connection weak (intellectual insight, no personal price) +0.3; total ~4.3; raise to 6.7 for strong thematic integration and closure tie, but lack of on-page sacrifice or conflicted choice prevents higher band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Bronze quiet" appears in the opening line, recurs in the rotunda ("deepened until voices seemed unnecessary"), and charges the exit ("silence that glowed like good data"). The tone is coherent: contemplative, scientific, reverent without sentimentality. Modulates subtly from skeptical observation to participatory acceptance without breaking. The quiet enables the ritual's nonverbal convergence and the final image of the path erasing participants. Setup first line +0.8; three beats (opening, rotunda, exit) +1.4; causal pressure moderate (quiet tone shapes wordless ceremony) +0.8; closure linkage strong (glowing silence as final witness) +1.2; irreplaceability high (another tone would not support the scientific-reverent balance) +0.7; cost connection weak (tone carries mood, not forfeit) +0.2; total ~5.1; raise to 7.1 for consistent modulation and strong closure charge, though tone is atmospheric rather than tactically constraining.</comment>
