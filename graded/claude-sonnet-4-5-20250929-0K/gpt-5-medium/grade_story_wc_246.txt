<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interior voice is distinctive—"confidently uncertain, wary of declarations but fluent in attention"—and embodied emotion appears in concrete moments: chest tight with "the old shame that tastes like rusted tools," the ritual of pressing nib to wrist. The motivation to trade guilt for knowledge drives micro-choices (taking Del's pen, writing furrows on scrap), and the final stance—"still uncertain, and still confident enough to bear it"—earns closure through prior causality. Minor slip: the reflective passages occasionally drift toward label-speak ("strange comfort settle, like a blanket that remembers several winters") without full dramatization of cost in the moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Orientation anchors by line 10 (station, Quiet, role). The story teaches a pattern of contingent editing early ("We do not receive; we edit") and pays it off when the protagonist's terraced lines interfere with the broadcast to produce seed shipments dated months ago. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: history has been edited, the cost is the protagonist's acceptance of uncertain agency ("maybe us, maybe the Quiet, maybe the treaty within me"), and the final image reweights the premise without stating a moral. One meaningful deepening occurs when the protagonist moves from passive listening to active inscription, narrowing options and altering knowledge. Cost is legible in the addendum and the protagonist's shift to "still confident enough to bear it."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The Quiet functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: gravity "pooled and thinned in tides, warping clocks, tea, and sometimes conversations," and the station's precession mirrors the protagonist's avoidance. The dried-up pen becomes a recurring object that charges the closure—its exotic nib and jellied reservoir shape the ritual that produces the terraced timeline. Sensory detail is purposeful ("hiss," "rain on canvas and parchment," scrap tugging against the pen) and filtered through the protagonist's agricultural lens ("furrows," "terraces," "oat awns"). The spatial choreography of the station console and the scrap remains clear. Minor gap: the gravitational anomaly's mechanics are evocative but never constrain a middle choice beyond mood.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: the protagonist seeks to "thresh meaning from experience" and escape the debt of failed crops. Pressure tightens when the broadcast speaks of "crops, calendars, and apology," making the abstract personal. The protagonist's agency—taking Del's pen, writing furrows, allowing Del to guide the lines—produces the interference melody and seed manifest, a tightening that forecloses passivity with visible cost (the timeline becomes contingent, clocks "forgot which wrist they loved"). The escalation is driven by protagonist choice under the accumulative lens, and the cost is felt in the addendum's impossible date. One micro turn (Del's guidance) supports the final reconfiguration without fragmenting pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: editing history is not rewriting fate but adjusting "contingent relationships that ripple like linked bowls of water." The returning image of seeds/furrows/terraces shifts from guilt ("wrong seeds," "poor soil") to forgiveness (the terraced shape, seed shipment) without thematic echo. The pen's transition from "relic of intention" to active tool embodies the theme without statement. The final paragraph resists moralizing—"If any of this sounds like prayer, remember it is also a manual for ladders"—and offers a resonant, non-literal answer to whether the protagonist can unbend the past. Subtext operates in Del's "We are not fate, only neighbors with a decent ladder and awkward timing." Minor note: "We learn to push lightly and listen harder" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward summary but remains grounded in the manual metaphor.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>POV remains single, first-person, with stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature: agricultural metaphors ("unbend a furrowed past," "thresh meaning"), diction specific to the narrator's background ("oat awns," "terraces," "rusted tools"). Dialogue is sparse but goal-driven and carries subtext—Del's "We do not receive; we edit" and "History, but gently" advance plot and theme without exposition. The pen's handling across beats maintains spatial coherence. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident: short clauses in the climax ("I tried to breathe with the Quiet, and the scrap surrendered a thin, shimmering stalk") versus the longer, reflective sentences in setup. Minor slip: "strange comfort settle, like a blanket that remembers several winters" briefly elevates register beyond the POV's established idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance character, world, or stakes. Figurative language is purposeful and controlled: "gravity pooled and thinned in tides," "treaty within me," "terraces" as both literal and metaphorical. Sentence rhythm varies—short beats during peak pressure, longer breaths during reflection. Minor artifact: paraphrase loop in "Edit what, I asked" followed immediately by "History, he said" could compress. Another slip: "strange comfort settle, like a blanket that remembers several winters and waits" stacks metaphor without full clarity. The opening and closing lines anchor voice and recharge motifs (seeds, ladders). No severe template cadence or filter-verb stacks, but a few recycled stems in the middle third ("Del said," "Del tapped," "Del appeared") nudge downward within the 7-band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The premise—editing history under gravitational anomaly via signal interpretation and a dried-up pen—is specific and non-obvious. The combination of celestial station, failed agriculture, and treaty-writing pen feels organic rather than checklist. Tropes (redemption arc, space-station setting) are transformed through the agricultural lens and the contingent-relationships mechanic. The turn (writing furrows that interfere with a broadcast to retroactively authorize seed shipment) is earned in hindsight by the setup of editing and contingency. Emotional truth (guilt, forgiveness, uncertain agency) avoids generic templates. The story commits fully to its premise and follows implications without retreat. Risk-taking (the pen ritual, the impossible manifest date) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The final image—"manual for ladders"—synthesizes prayer, labor, and hope into a fresh inflection.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The celestial signal interpreter role shapes every beat: listening to the broadcast, translating by breathing, deciding to use Del's pen, writing furrows that produce the interference melody. Two key turns trace to the role: interpreting the broadcast as personal and actively inscribing lines to edit history. The closure (seed manifest) is causally linked to the protagonist's signal-interpretation work. Setup in the opening, development when the broadcast arrives, payoff in the final addendum. Causal pressure throughout; the role is irreplaceable. Minor: the protagonist's decision to write is more intuitive than procedurally grounded in signal interpretation, slightly softening the link.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The dried-up fountain pen with exotic nib appears in three functional beats: Del's relic on the console, the protagonist's ritual pressing to wrist, and the actual inscription that produces the terraced timeline. The pen's "jellied amber memory" and exotic nib are specific properties that matter—only this pen writes the contingent lines. Setup early, development when the protagonist takes it, payoff when its lines interfere with the broadcast. The pen charges the closure by enabling the historical edit. Causal pressure and irreplaceability are both high. Visible cost: the protagonist risks foolishness and relies on a tool they don't fully understand. Strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Editing history is the core concept that shapes stakes, tactics, and closure. Del's explanation ("We do not receive; we edit") establishes the mechanic early. The protagonist's attempt to edit personal history (failed crops) drives the middle choice to inscribe terraces. The interference melody and retroactive manifest are on-page demonstrations of editing via contingent relationships. Setup in Del's dialogue, development in the protagonist's inscription, payoff in the impossible-dated addendum. The concept constrains tactics (unbending from the center, not crossing terraces) and defines the stakes. Causal pressure, closure linkage, and irreplaceability all maxed. The story would collapse without this exact concept.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Confidently uncertain" appears as a trait in the opening ("someone confidently uncertain, wary of declarations but fluent in attention") and is restated in the closure ("I was still uncertain, and still confident enough to bear it"). The attribute enables the protagonist to listen without forcing interpretation and to act (taking the pen, writing) despite doubt. Setup early, payoff in the final self-assessment. However, the middle development is implied rather than dramatized in a specific choice where uncertainty constrains or costs. The trait feels more thematic than tactical. Lyric resonance is present but causal pressure is softer than other elements.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Unbend" is the core action metaphor: "unbend a furrowed past," Del's instruction "Unbend from the center, or the field will only learn a new ache," and the protagonist's attempt to unbend guilt into forgiveness. The action shapes the peak beat—the protagonist must not cross terraces while writing. However, "unbend" functions more as guiding metaphor than discrete physical act. It's thematically central and shapes tactics, but could be replaced with similar language (straighten, correct) without breaking logic. Setup in the opening, development in Del's guidance, payoff in the terraced timeline. Causal and closure linkage present; specificity is high but physical irreplaceability is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Through contingent relationships" is the method explicitly named and demonstrated. Del explains the mechanic: "editing, through contingent relationships that ripple like linked bowls of water." The protagonist uses this method by placing the terraced scrap beside the broadcast to create interference. The third melody produced by contingency travels outward and produces the seed manifest. Setup in Del's explanation, development in the protagonist's attempt, payoff in the manifest. The method shapes tactics (placement, not crossing lines) and is irreplaceable—no other mechanic is offered. Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong. Minor: the exact mechanics remain somewhat abstract, softening tactical granularity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly (the Quiet) establishes mood and setting throughout: gravity warps clocks and conversations, the station precesses, and the Quiet "breathed slow and heavy." It enables the signal-interpretation work and provides the isolation that makes editing history plausible. Setup early, present in atmosphere across beats, but does not constrain a key middle choice. The anomaly charges the tone and context but is not causally active in the protagonist's inscription or the manifest's appearance. Lyric resonance is strong (the Quiet as reflective surface for the protagonist's avoidance), but tactical constraint is limited. Swappable with "remote station" or "deep space" without major structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The timeframe "after planting the wrong seeds" establishes the protagonist's past debt and motivates the journey to the station. The backstory recurs in the broadcast ("crops, calendars, and apology") and the closure (seed shipment). However, the timeframe functions more as thematic anchor than live pressure. The story does not track elapsed time or impose a deadline. Setup in the opening, thematic resonance at closure, but no middle beat where the timeframe tightens a choice. Lyric reprise is present, but causal and tactical pressure are softer. The element is replaceable with "after a failed harvest" or similar phrasing.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to thresh meaning from experience" drives the protagonist's role choice, the decision to use the pen, and the act of writing furrows. The desire is dramatized in the chest-tight shame, the question to Del about whether the star knew about bad seeds, and the final acceptance of uncertain agency. Setup early ("I was here to thresh meaning from experience"), development in the inscription beat, payoff in the closure stance. The motivation shapes two key choices and charges the ending. Friction between wanting knowledge and accepting uncertainty is present. Minor: the metaphor is stated more than fully embodied in contradictory wants across beats, softening the conflict slightly.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Strange comfort" is the tone that modulates across the piece: the Quiet as both alien and soothing, Del's gentle explanations, the protagonist's ritual with the pen, and the final "strange comfort settle, like a blanket that remembers several winters." The tone supports the theme of uncertain agency and editing without control. Setup in the opening atmosphere, present in Del's voice and the station's slow turning, payoff in the explicit naming near closure. The tone charges the final image by framing forgiveness as contingent rather than triumphant. Coherence across beats and closure linkage are strong. Minor: the explicit statement "strange comfort settle" in the penultimate paragraph reduces subtlety slightly.</comment>
