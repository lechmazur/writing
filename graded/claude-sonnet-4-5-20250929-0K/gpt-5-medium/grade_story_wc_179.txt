<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interior voice is distinct and lyric-dense, with embodied perception ("spine learned to quarrel with waking," "prickles unwind"). Rell's motivation to release resentment is dramatized through cellular memory and physical reaction, though the transformation feels compressed—his kneeling and thread-loosening occur rapidly without visible struggle. The scheming pacifist's choices (guiding, touching, arranging encounters) are purposeful but operate more as facilitator than protagonist under pressure. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding therapy-speak, but the final shift in Rell lacks a micro-choice that forecloses a live option with on-page cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who (narrator), where (sanctuary), and what (Rell's arrival) by the first paragraph; the piece teaches its accumulative/textural lens early through lyric patterning and metaphor density. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Rell's resentment loosens, he receives the box, the narrator feels the unsung melody)—the final image reweights prior material and the cost is felt in the narrator's solitude and Rell's departure carrying the broken pin. One meaningful deepening occurs when Rell's cellular memory opens the factory corridor and he gathers his mother's breath, narrowing his stance from blame to forgiveness. Causality is impressionistic but coherent under the accumulative lens; the sanctuary's mechanics (shifting grace, soundless music) remain abstract yet stable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The sanctuary is vividly realized through selective sensory detail: walls soften, floor ripples, hush strokes, moonless light pools. The music box—a small recurring object—constrains the climactic beat when Rell touches it and the world stops pretending stability, charging the final image when the narrator presses it into his hands. Spatial choreography is clean (center, threshold, door/wall shifts) and the setting's rule (shifting grace adjusts until the body says yes) directly pressures Rell's transformation. Micro-setting (the box, the lid, the cylinder pin) functions as purposeful constraint and charges closure, meeting the 9+ gate for this category.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—teaching Rell to release resentment—is signaled early and pursued through one meaningful tightening when cellular memory opens the factory corridor and Rell gathers his mother's breath, forcing a shift from blame to forgiveness. The resolution (resentment loosens, he kneels, returns unspent years) is earned by prior setup, but the escalation is smooth rather than pressured; Rell does not resist or make a trade-off on the page, and the narrator's agency operates as guide rather than protagonist under constraint. Cost is implied (the narrator's solitude, Rell carrying the broken pin) but not sharply visible in the climactic beat itself. One tightening is sufficient for this length under the accumulative lens, but the lack of a visible price that alters tactics keeps this in the mid-6s.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—mercy, forgiveness, the arithmetic of absences—emerges through concrete particulars: the music box that refuses melody, the factory corridor cleaned by memory, breath carried on belts instead of blame. The final image ("door learning it was always a window," the unsung melody pacing the narrator's bones) offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and silence (the box remains mute, yet ribs vibrate with forgiveness). The piece resists tidy resolution; Rell's transformation is earned through cellular memory and the sanctuary's shifting grace, not epiphany. Minor slip: "I do not claim credit; I only designed the room to trip him into his own kindness" edges toward thematic statement, though it remains in character voice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: metaphor-dense, syntactically varied, and voice-particular ("scheming pacifist," "soundless sanctuary," "machine rows inside him have slowed"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close in the climactic touch, wider in exposition). No head-hopping; filter verbs are minimal. The narrator's lexicon is consistent and lyric, though compression under peak stress is not tested—pressure remains smooth rather than spiky. Diction control is strong; rhythm supports the accumulative lens. No dialogue present; all interiority flows through the narrator's lens. Minor artifacting: "shifting grace" and "cellular memory" are repeated frequently without varying the phrasing, creating slight template cadence in expository beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose is lyric and image-dense with strong figurative control ("spine learned to quarrel," "door learning it was always a window," "belts carry breath instead of blame"). Sentence openings vary and paragraph rhythm supports the accumulative lens. However, overwriting and metaphor density approach saturation: nearly every sentence in high-pressure beats carries figurative language without pattern-teaching or clear payoff, triggering −0.5. Paraphrase loops appear: "shifting grace" is explained multiple times across paragraphs without added pressure (−0.2). Minor register drift into abstract diction ("cellular memory," "arithmetic of absences") in peak beats feels slightly elevated beyond the narrator's otherwise grounded voice (−0.3). Information density is high, but figurative muddle in the climactic beat ("walls lengthen into halls of childhood, floors ripple into puddles once jumped") blurs spatial clarity. No loops or scaffold that obscure causality; rounding strict.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The premise—a scheming pacifist using a soundless sanctuary and broken music box to teach resentment release through cellular memory—is conceptually fresh and committed. The synthesis of intangible mechanics (shifting grace, silence forming music) with concrete objects (the box, the cylinder pin) feels purposeful. However, the execution leans heavily on abstraction and metaphor rather than grounded choice; the sanctuary's rules are asserted more than discovered through dramatized constraint. The emotional arc (Rell's transformation) follows a familiar forgiveness template, and specificity (factory dust, late rent, receipts) is present but does not transform the premise beyond its conceptual frame. Risk-taking in lyric density is notable, though it occasionally obscures clarity. No close echoes of famous lines, but the "door learning it was always a window" image feels borderline stock wisdom.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The scheming pacifist narrator is present throughout, guiding Rell, touching his neck, showing the box, and pressing it into his hands at the threshold. Setup occurs early (first paragraph). Development: the narrator's choices (guide to center, tilt the box, touch Rell's neck) enable the middle beat where cellular memory opens. Payoff: the narrator presses the box into Rell's hands and writes on a slate, shaping the final image. Two distinct beats involve the narrator's agency (guiding/touching, gifting the box), and the final act (giving the box) charges closure. However, the narrator operates as facilitator rather than protagonist under pressure; no on-page cost or trade-off is visible when the narrator gives away the central object. Causal pressure is moderate; swappability is low (the scheming pacifist frame is specific). Score: early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, facilitator role −0.6, no visible cost −0.4. Base 3.0 + 2.4 − 1.0 = 4.4, round to 5.8 for specificity and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The music box cylinder pin broken is introduced early (paragraph 6: "a music box whose cylinder pin never learned to pierce the lullaby") and appears in multiple beats: showing the box to Rell (paragraph 18), tilting it so light pools across its teeth (paragraph 19), and pressing it into Rell's hands at closure (paragraph 38). Setup clear. Development: the box is opened and its silence triggers Rell's cellular memory (paragraphs 20–21), enabling the transformation. Payoff: the narrator gives the broken pin to Rell as a compass for future rage (paragraphs 38–39), and the final line ("I close the lid and feel the unsung melody pace my own bones") recharges it. Three beats, causal pressure (silence enables memory), closure linkage strong, irreplaceable (the broken pin's specific mechanics matter). Score: early +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal +1.2, closure +1.4, specificity +0.6. Base 3.0 + 5.2 = 8.2, but the box is handled rather than "used" in a way that constrains choice—its role is symbolic anchor more than tactical tool—so cap practical impact at 7.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Shifting grace is introduced early (paragraph 2: "reality shifts," then paragraph 15: "Shifting grace is the rule here") and recurs as the sanctuary's mechanic: the world adjusts until the body says yes (paragraph 16), grace folds around them (paragraph 26), and a door/wall opens (paragraph 33). Setup clear. Development: shifting grace enables the factory corridor to open (paragraph 27), directly altering Rell's options and enabling his transformation. Payoff: the concept frames the threshold moment ("while reality shifts back into the street," paragraph 38) and the narrator's final advice ("reality will continue to shift only as much as he does," paragraph 35). Three beats, causal pressure moderate (it enables the corridor but does not constrain choice), closure participation present but oblique. Score: early +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal +0.8, closure +0.9. Base 3.0 + 3.7 = 6.7, but the mechanics remain abstract and asserted rather than tested under pressure, so apply −0.6 for lack of visible constraint on Rell's agency. Final 6.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Reappears when needed is introduced in paragraph 11 ("a visitor reappears when needed, as if the sanctuary remembers who still owes themselves a softness") and applied to Rell ("Today it is a courier named Rell"). Setup clear. Development: the attribute enables Rell's return but does not constrain any middle choice—it is a framing device rather than a tactical pressure. Payoff: the attribute is obliquely echoed when the narrator says "grace reappears when needed" (paragraph 33), but this is thematic claim rather than dramatized cost. One beat (Rell's arrival), no causal pressure on choices, closure participation weak (not present in final image). Score: early +0.5, one beat +0.4, ornamental use −0.7, summary-only −0.5. Base 3.0 + 0.9 − 1.2 = 2.7, but lyric reprise in paragraph 33 lifts slightly to 4.8 per the allowance for charged callbacks that reweight the stake.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Convince is the narrator's stated purpose (paragraph 4: "I do not heal by speeches; I convince by arranging encounters") and drives the story's action: the narrator convinces Rell's skin to remember the first lullaby (paragraph 24), and the sanctuary convinces him to release resentment (paragraph 29). Setup clear. Development: the act of convincing structures the middle beat when cellular memory opens and Rell gathers his mother's breath (paragraphs 27–28). Payoff: the final advice ("let the silence ring until the remembered hands arrive," paragraph 39) completes the convincing arc. Three beats, causal pressure strong (the action shapes all major turns), closure linkage present. However, the action is partially swappable with "heal" or "teach" without major structural loss, and the mechanics (cellular memory, shifting grace) do the causal work while "convince" operates as frame. Score: early +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal +1.2, closure +1.0, swappability −0.6, frame rather than tactical action −0.7. Base 3.0 + 4.2 − 1.3 = 5.9, lift to 6.9 for centrality to narrator's stated purpose and presence across all beats.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Through cellular memory is introduced early (paragraph 10: "every lesson passes through cellular memory, the old library beneath words") and is the stated method for Rell's transformation (paragraph 24: "through cellular memory, where his infant heartbeat did its learning beside his mother"). Setup clear. Development: cellular memory enables the factory corridor to open and Rell to gather his mother's breath (paragraphs 25–28), directly altering his stance. Payoff: the method is not explicitly revisited in the final image, though the "silence forming music" (paragraph 29) and the box's role at closure imply it. Two beats, causal pressure moderate (the method enables the transformation but its mechanics remain abstract), closure linkage oblique. Score: early +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal +0.8, closure oblique +0.4, abstraction without demonstration −0.6, swappable with "subconscious memory" −0.5. Base 3.0 + 2.7 − 1.1 = 4.6, lift to 5.3 for specificity and signal strength.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Soundless sanctuary is introduced immediately (paragraph 1: "I keep a sanctuary where sound refuses to be born") and recurs as the primary setting throughout: the hush strokes guests (paragraph 5), the center holds the music box (paragraph 7), the sanctuary remembers visitors (paragraph 11), and shifting grace operates within it (paragraph 15). Setup clear. Development: the sanctuary's silence and shifting grace enable Rell's transformation by opening the factory corridor (paragraphs 21–27) and applying pressure ("the world stops pretending to be stable," paragraph 21). Payoff: the sanctuary inhales Rell into the world (paragraph 40), and the narrator remains alone inside it, feeling the unsung melody (paragraph 41). Three beats, causal pressure strong (the setting's rules constrain and enable all action), closure linkage strong (the sanctuary frames the final image). Score: early +0.8, three beats +1.4, causal +1.4, closure +1.5, specificity +0.8. Base 3.0 + 5.9 = 8.9, but the setting's mechanics (hush, shifting grace) are asserted more than tested under constraint, so apply −0.5 for abstraction. Final 7.9, meeting the gate for environment that shapes tactics and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>While reality shifts is introduced early (paragraph 2: "They arrive while reality shifts") and recurs throughout: walls soften and floor ripples (paragraph 2), reality lurches around Rell (paragraph 14), the world stops pretending stability (paragraph 21), corridors open (paragraphs 22 and 26), and reality shifts back at the threshold (paragraph 38). Setup clear. Development: the timeframe enables the sanctuary's mechanics (shifting grace, cellular memory) to operate, and the shifting reality opens the factory corridor that drives Rell's transformation. Payoff: reality shifts back into the street (paragraph 38), framing Rell's departure. Three beats, causal pressure moderate (the timeframe enables action but does not constrain tactics—Rell does not race a clock), closure participation present. Score: early +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal +0.8, closure +1.0, abstraction (no live clock or deadline) −0.6, does not tighten decisions −0.4. Base 3.0 + 3.8 − 1.0 = 5.8, lift to 6.4 for pervasive presence and framing of all major beats.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>To teach resentment to release is the narrator's stated motivation (paragraph 4: "My purpose is to teach resentment to release, gently if possible, slyly when necessary") and drives the story's action. Setup clear. Development: the narrator pursues this goal by guiding Rell, showing the box, and touching his neck to trigger cellular memory (paragraphs 13–24), enabling Rell's resentment to loosen (paragraph 31). Payoff: the narrator gives Rell the box and instructs him to use silence to summon "remembered hands" (paragraphs 38–39), completing the teaching arc. Three beats, causal pressure strong (the motivation shapes all tactics), closure linkage present. However, the narrator faces no on-page friction or trade-off in pursuing this goal—Rell does not resist, and the transformation proceeds smoothly—so the motivation is told and pursued but not conflicted. Score: early +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal +1.2, closure +1.2, no friction or cost −0.9, told more than dramatized −0.4. Base 3.0 + 4.5 − 1.3 = 6.2, lift to 6.6 for centrality and pursuit across all beats.</comment>
