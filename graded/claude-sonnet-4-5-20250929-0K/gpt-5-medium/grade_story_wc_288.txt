<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interior life is concrete and deeply textured—polishing the sundial until "atomically reflective," cataloging "weather" as memory. The motivation to "translate isolation into independence, without hardening into salt" is embodied through micro-choices (angling the dial, singing the herd song, preparing empty chairs). However, the piece leans heavily on poetic assertion rather than dramatized contradiction; the narrator's struggle feels more meditated than enacted under pressure, and the final stance is more lyric crystallization than a choice that forecloses a live path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors who (librarian-narrator), where (tidal library above clouds), and the stake (maintaining independence through resonance with extinct voices) within the first third. The crisis—stone circle faltering, shelves dropping—provides a meaningful pressure point, and the narrator's sung herd call stabilizes the system, constituting a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: the narrator maintains independence by active tuning rather than passive waiting). Cost is felt in the effort and the acceptance of ongoing solitude with purpose. The piece coheres under its lens, though the escalation is a single deepening rather than a cascade.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The tidal library, stone circle hum, brass sundial, and aviary baskets function as a coherent micro-ecology that constrains and enables the narrator's actions. The sundial's "atomically reflective" face is used twice—first to find unshelved moments, then angled toward lightning to locate the resonance knot—directly shaping tactics. The atlas of drowned stars provides the coordinate drops that cue the herd song. Sensory detail is specific and purposeful ("cloudlight pools," "bookplates into fog"), and spatial choreography remains clear across the tilting library.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: maintaining the library's resonance and the narrator's independence without "hardening into salt." The stone circle's faltering hum provides one meaningful tightening that narrows options; the narrator must find the knotted resonance and sing the herd call to stabilize shelves and voices. Agency is demonstrated through tool use (angling the sundial) and vocalization (the herd song), and the ending reconfigures the narrator's role from passive cataloger to active tuner. The cost is the acceptance of perpetual vigilance and solitude, legible on the page but quiet.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—coexistence with extinction, independence earned through active listening rather than withdrawal—emerges organically from the narrator's sung intervention and preparation of empty chairs. The final image of standing "a contemporary of extinct species, translating weather into shelter" reweights the opening catalog motif without stating a moral. "Brittle awakenings" recurs as both fossil voices and the narrator's own rekindled memory, gaining resonance. The piece resists tidy closure, holding complexity without confusion, and the herd song functions as embodied wisdom rather than platitude.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single POV, stable psychic distance, and a distinctive perceptual signature: the narrator notices "hours that move like shorebirds," "hoofprints across gold." Diction is controlled, with purposeful lyric compression ("readable space between waves of murmuring script") that the piece teaches early and sustains. The narrator's way of thinking—oblique, patient, metaphor-dense—remains consistent under pressure, and the herd song moment shifts register intentionally to match the action. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks in peak beats, and the final cadence charges prior images without explaining them.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout, occasionally verging on overwriting ("tusks sweeping comets from grass"), but the metaphors cohere within the established voice and do not obscure causality. Sentence openings vary; paragraph rhythm supports the lyric mode. Minor scaffold present: "I do not wait for visitors, yet I prepare a table of listening" slightly restates the prior table mention without added pressure (−0.2). No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. The atlas opening and sundial angling beats carry clear propulsion. Information density is strong, with most lines doing double duty (image + character + world).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—librarian as tuner of extinct resonances, using brass sundial and herd song to stabilize a floating archive—is specific and non-obvious. The piece transforms the "library" and "memory" tropes through lived-in detail (wicker baskets, drowned atlas, stone circle hum) and the narrator's embodied actions. The risk is the lyric density and elliptical pacing, which could alienate, but the story commits fully to its premise and follows its implications without retreat. The ending's quiet reconfiguration feels inevitable in hindsight, and the premise is not easily swappable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The narrator's identity as "a contemporary of extinct species" frames the opening and ending; the mid-story sung herd call (a decision that stabilizes the library) is directly tied to this identity, and the final stance ("I will stand, a contemporary of extinct species, translating weather into shelter") reweights it from passive observation to active coexistence. Present in setup, development (the song), and payoff. Specific cost: accepting perpetual solitude and vigilance.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The brass sundial appears in at least four beats: found and polished, first use (pointing to aviary stacks), second use (angled toward lightning to locate the resonance knot), and final wipe to read new scratches ("hoofprints across gold" resolve into "shelter"). It enables two key choices and charges the final catalog entry. Irreplaceable: its "atomically reflective" face is essential to both navigation and the conceptual repricing of shelter. Cost: the effort to maintain and interpret it.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Brittle awakenings" appears twice: as a descriptor for extinct-voice fossils ("cracking into syllables") and implicitly in the narrator's own memory-rekindling. It shapes the dominant stake (voices needing care) and the narrator's sung response, but does not directly narrow options in a high-pressure beat. Present in setup and thematically charged at closure, but swappable with a near-synonym ("fragile stirrings") without breaking logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The "atomically reflective" trait of the sundial face constrains two key actions: throwing "a blade of light that cuts fog" to find unshelved moments, and angling toward lightning to locate the resonance knot. Without this exact trait, the sundial could not perform these functions. Present in setup (polishing scene), development (both navigation beats), and payoff (reading new marks). Visible cost: the labor to achieve and maintain the reflectivity.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Coexist" is the narrative spine: the narrator coexists with extinct voices, the library coexists with tidal fog, and the final stance crystallizes coexistence as a deliberate practice ("not pets or ghosts; we coexist as patrons and librarians of listening"). The sung herd call is an act of coexistence that stabilizes the system, and the prepared empty chairs embody it. Present across setup, development, and payoff, shaping the core question and closure image. Swapping "coexist" for "collaborate" would weaken thematic precision but not break logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ancient stone circle's hum is signaled early, provides the library's buoyancy mechanism, and its faltering mid-story creates the crisis. The narrator's sung herd call directly addresses the circle's "knotted" resonance, and the circle "catches the note" to stabilize shelves. Mechanics matter: hum → lift shelves; cough → drop shelves; note → round tone. Present in setup, development (the crisis and sung solution), and payoff (the purr and exhale). Without this exact method, the crisis and resolution would collapse.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The tidal library supplies fog that drowns/exposes aisles, shelves that tilt and drop under pressure, and the nave where the resonance knots—all directly shaping the narrator's tactics (walking slowly so floorboards remember weight, locating the atlas beneath the nave). The setting is not postcard; it is a dynamic system that creates and resolves the crisis. Present across all three gates and charges the final image of rising shelves and exhaled breath.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the reincarnation memory" anchors the piece temporally in a post-awakening present and motivates the cataloging of "what returns to me as weather." It primes the herd-song memory that resolves the crisis. Present in setup and implicit in the sung call, but does not tighten decisions in real time; the timeframe is a premise rather than a ticking clock. Cap at ~4.8 for missing live urgency in the middle development.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation—"to translate isolation into independence, without hardening into salt"—is stated early and dramatized through micro-choices: polishing the sundial, singing the herd call to stabilize rather than retreat, preparing empty chairs as an act of readiness rather than loneliness. The ending rephrases it as "independence is not a door closed, but a door held kindly," with the cost of perpetual vigilance legible. Present in setup, middle choice (singing versus silence), and payoff. Some telling, but the actions align and the cost is felt.</comment>
