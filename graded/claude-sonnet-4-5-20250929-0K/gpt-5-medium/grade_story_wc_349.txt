<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The vendor protagonist has a distinct perceptual filter (moonlight for proofreading, counting absences), but interiority leans heavily on abstract metaphor rather than embodied contradiction. The quest to find "the place where stories begin" drives concrete choices (following the map, pouring moonlight), and the final acceptance of the comma-seed shows agency with cost. However, the central motivation remains somewhat allegorical; the vendor's personal stake beyond professional curiosity is never dramatized, which keeps emotional embodiment at a remove.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. The piece coheres around the dominant stake (gain entry to the vault) and escalates through density increase—each ritual step (moonlight proofreading, incising the map, quantifying absence) tightens the route. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the vendor receives the comma-seed "so heavy with maybe" and returns to the counter before anyone knocks, reweighting the opening lull with charged potential. The cost is conceptual and felt—the seed will sprout only "during the lull on a store's very first opening day," locking the vendor into a singular, unrepeatable moment. Minor orientation lag in the first paragraph (shutters, shop, orchard library, sea of clouds arrive quickly but spatial anchors clarify only gradually) does not fully trigger the Orientation Test penalty because the lyric mode is taught early and the disorientation serves the otherworldly tone.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The glass orchard library and its micro-details (glass trunks, vellum door, plinth) constrain movement and choice throughout. The bottled moonlight functions as both tool and atmospheric anchor, used twice on-page to reveal the map and then open the hinge. The final image—"after the first sentence, which now lay sleeping in my hands"—recharges the opening placard and the comma-seed, anchoring closure in tactile specificity. The sea of clouds remains atmospheric rather than pressing choice, but the glass apple and chamber constrain the vendor's ritual actions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>One dominant stake (enter the vault) is signaled early and tightens through accumulative ritual: the vendor follows the map, finds the vellum door, quantifies absence via counted breaths and moonlight drips, and opens the hinge. The method imposes a felt constraint—the vendor must "weigh the hesitations" and "solve for entry"—and the seed's contract ("sprout only in a store during the lull") forecloses future options. No overt antagonist, but the vault's riddle and the need to quantify absence create situational pressure. The single deepening (discovery of the seed) narrows options with visible cost, meeting the lens requirements.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the premise: beginnings require parole, permission, and the courage to quantify absence. The glass apple "opaque with untoldness" and the comma-seed "so heavy with maybe" charge the concept of potential without stating a moral. The vendor's offering—"ledger of returned regrets, eraser-dust of customers, quiver of my own unfinishedness"—particularizes redemption through trade rather than abstract forgiveness. The final image reweights the opening sign ("back after the first sentence") as literal and contractual, creating resonance without preaching.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable, and the perceptual signature is distinct: the vendor notices via metaphor and procedural ritual ("incise is to cut light from shadow," "numbers became my rosary"). Diction remains elevated and voice-motivated throughout, with no head-hopping. Psychic distance stays consistent; purposeful compression ("I followed the palest corridor under trellised skylight, past shelves of panes…") accelerates transit without losing clarity. The lyric register never slips into mundane exposition, and the prose rhythm modulates with pressure—longer, meditative sentences in the chamber, shorter fragments at the hinge moment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information density is high; nearly every line advances world-building, character stance, or ritual progression. Some figurative language verges on overwriting ("fog had tried to learn manners," "rain deciding to be snow"), but the accumulative texture supports the lyric lens and remains legible. Minor paraphrase loop: "I set the bottled moonlight beside it" followed immediately by "I lifted the moonlight, poured a ribbon" within three lines creates slight redundancy. No major scaffold or template cadence detected; sentence openings vary, and rhythm breathes with scene pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of parole metaphor, glass-orchard library, and absence-quantification ritual feels specific and non-obvious. The vendor's occupation (clean slate vendor) and the method (counting absences, weighing pauses) are tightly braided into the world logic. The comma-seed as closure object is fresh—neither cliché nor forced quirk—and its contract ("sprout only in a store during the lull") imposes a unique, irreversible constraint. Risk-taking in diction and structure (lyric compression, patterned elision) heightens thematic charge without obscuring causality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Present early as protagonist, drives middle ritual choices (following the map, pouring moonlight, offering the ledger), and holds the comma-seed at closure. The vendor's decisions alter tactics and enable entry, meeting two beats and closure participation. Causal pressure is moderate; the vendor observes constraints and performs the ritual rather than wrestling internal contradiction.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Introduced early ("I uncorked the bottled moonlight"), used twice on-page (glazing the counter to reveal the map, pouring along the hinge to open the air), and carried back to the counter at closure. The moonlight enables two distinct beats and charges the method ("shows what words intend when they forget to pretend"). Specificity and irreplaceability are strong.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>First appears mid-story on the vellum door shingle ("glimmering parole"), then shapes the vendor's understanding ("beginnings apply for release") and the seed's condition ("parole depended on a signature no ink could provide"). The concept reweights the opening lull as contractual permission. Present in two beats and closure interpretation, but arrives after the first third and is more thematic lens than tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Applied once to the wares on the counter ("mindfully scattered… practiced the art of silence"). The attribute establishes tone but does not constrain choice or return with altered meaning. Label-only mention, no cost or tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Introduced and defined early ("to incise is to cut light from shadow"), used to create the map over weeks, and enacted in the chamber when the vendor pours moonlight along the etched hinge. The method shapes the vault-entry beat and enables closure. Two distinct beats, but the action could be replaced by another ritual verb with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Signaled early ("one could enter only by quantifying absence") and enacted in the chamber: "count the spaces, weigh the pauses, divide by hush, solve for entry… the beats between drips, the inches of dust, the count of breaths." The method shapes the vault-entry beat and is tied to the vendor's offering. Present in setup and one major beat, but mechanics remain abstract; specificity could be higher.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Established in the opening line, provides the spatial frame (glass trunks, aisles, trellised skylight, vellum door, chamber), and the vendor navigates it throughout. The setting supplies the plinth, apple, and door that constrain the ritual. Present in all three gates and alters movement, but does not force a trade-off or surprise the vendor with resistance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Announced in the second line ("during the lull on a store's very first opening day"), recurs as the vendor sets the placard ("back after the first sentence"), and locks the closure: the comma-seed "would sprout only in a store during the lull on a store's very first opening day." The timeframe tightens the window for action and makes the closure cost irreversible. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Stated early ("I had come here not merely to sell, but to find the place where stories begin") and drives the vendor's quest through the map and chamber. The motivation is present in two beats and shapes the ending's acceptance of the comma-seed. However, it remains somewhat allegorical; personal friction or competing desire is not dramatized, so tension is lower.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Taught immediately through syntax and imagery ("beginnings shaped like blanks," "map etched into the countertop, a filigree of paths," "pages that rustled like wind through unmapped countries"). The tone modulates with pressure—lyric and meditative in the shop, tighter and procedural in the chamber—and charges the final image ("after the first sentence, which now lay sleeping in my hands"). Coherent through turns, specificity high, and the fragmentation (short shards, elliptical phrasing) integrates without obscuring causality.</comment>
