<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is vivid and character-particular ("I move people like water, letting gravity and rumor pull them where truth sits waiting"). Embodied contradiction appears in the decision to take the specs to the sea rather than trade them, driven by the desire to transpose life into a new key. The fortune-writer's "accidental prophecy" trait generates prior mistakes (the fisherman/lightbulbs) that earn the final orchestration. Minor slip: the keeper's motivations remain underdeveloped, though she functions primarily as pressure rather than full co-agent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who (fortune-writer), where (harbor/lighthouse), and when (after last orders) by the second paragraph. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered images (envelope → specs → sugar-inked fortunes → light projection) and resolves in a Resonant Reconfiguration when "You already know" unfurls on kitchen walls, reweighting the town's open secrets with visible social cost ("everyone finally looked"). The causal chain from taking specs to lighthouse to projecting fortunes holds cleanly. Cost is legible: the agent receives a blank, the town's etiquette shifts, and the protagonist accepts complicity ("their shoulders said thank you for arranging the tide").</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setting details are filtered through the fortune-writer's voice ("neon fizzed out like a tired constellation," "causeway while the tide thought things over"). The lighthouse constrains the climactic choice: its lens becomes the tool for projecting fortunes. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from harbor to causeway to lighthouse interior. The body and immediate objects (envelope sweating against ribs, sticky hands with sugar and salt) charge the final image. Minor: the town's layout beyond harbor/causeway/lighthouse remains impressionistic, acceptable at this length under the lyric lens.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: "design the smallest message and make it visible to everyone." The protagonist's agency drives escalation: choosing the lighthouse over trading the specs, then actively orchestrating the light projection. One meaningful tightening occurs when the specs are transformed into microdot-stamped fortunes and broadcast, foreclosing the spy option and forcing public acknowledgment. Cost is visible on the page: the agent is deceived, the town's etiquette shifts from "nobody looked" to "everyone finally looked," and the protagonist accepts the role of arranger. The resolution is earned by the protagonist's choices under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme (open secrets and orchestrated revelation) emerges from concrete action rather than statement. The recurring image of fortunes shifts meaning: from cryptic cookies to accidentally prophetic warnings to deliberate public illumination. The final sentence "see what you have done, and listened" offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures ("Everyone saw, nobody looked") and the lighthouse keeper's soundless laugh. The piece embraces complexity: the protagonist manipulates the town but also offers mercy ("open secrets are waiting rooms where fear goes quiet"). No thematic echo or late-paragraph sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout: "smudge that looked like a gull or a fingerprint trying to fly," "light scattered over the town in thin squares." POV remains stable first-person; no head-hopping. Diction stays character-consistent under pressure ("wet shoes squeaking on tile"). Dialogue carries subtext and advances plot without filter-verb stacks: the keeper's "You are making a habit of orchestrating the weather" acknowledges the pattern while the protagonist's response clarifies method. Rhythmic control modulates from lyric reflection to directive action ("We boiled sugar, inked rice") without register drift. Purposeful compression in the final sequence maintains voice coherence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Information density is high; nearly every line advances character, atmosphere, or plot. Rhythm varies purposefully: short declaratives ("The lighthouse is not haunted; it is simply patient") alternate with complex lyricism. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor deduction: a few metaphors approach overwriting density in the opening third ("harbor's neon fizzed out like a tired constellation" followed closely by "island exhaled" and "gull or a fingerprint trying to fly"), though they remain coherent and voice-motivated. The closure beat is clean and propulsive. Zero scaffold or filter-verb stacks in high-pressure moments.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of fortune-cookie writer as cryptographer and lighthouse as broadcast medium feels specific and non-obvious. The "accidentally prophetic" trait transforms a familiar trope (fortune-teller) through grounded causality (the fisherman/lightbulbs incident). The open-secrets premise is rendered particular through the town's etiquette and the projection mechanism. The ending is earned in hindsight: the specs' transformation into public fortunes grows inevitably from the protagonist's dual roles. Risk-taking in the elliptical, layered structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The piece avoids template morals and hedged safety; the protagonist's manipulation carries visible cost and the town's complicity is acknowledged without neat resolution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The fortune-cookie writer is present throughout and their choices drive all major turns: deciding to take the specs to the lighthouse rather than trade them, collaborating with the keeper to stamp microdot fortunes, and orchestrating the light projection. The "accidentally prophetic" attribute constrains prior choices (the fisherman incident) and enables the climactic broadcast. The character's dual role (cryptic writer + cryptographer) is irreplaceable; removing it breaks the story's causal chain and thematic resonance. Present in setup, middle development (lighthouse collaboration), and payoff (watching the town respond). High causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The microdot film specs appear in the envelope at table six (setup), are examined and slit by the keeper (middle beat), and are transformed into microdot-stamped fortunes that charge the climax (payoff). The object's properties matter: "printed so small they needed a flashlight and patience to bloom" motivates the need for the lighthouse lens. The specs' transformation from spy intelligence to public broadcast drives the final turn. Specific cost: the agent receives a blank and the protagonist accepts complicity. Strong causal pressure and irreplaceability; removing the specs collapses the plot.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Open secrets" shapes every tactic and stake on the page: the town's etiquette ("Everyone saw, nobody looked"), the protagonist's role ("salted sweet shells with hints and misdirection"), and the climactic broadcast ("You already know"). The concept constrains choices: the protagonist cannot simply reveal the secrets overtly but must orchestrate acknowledgment. The resolution reweights the concept: open secrets shift from "waiting rooms where fear goes quiet" to visible declarations that force "everyone finally looked." Present from the first paragraph, drives middle tactics (the lighthouse collaboration), and charges the closure image. Indispensable; the story's logic collapses without it.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The "accidentally prophetic" trait is dramatized through the fisherman/lightbulbs incident ("you will be seen, and a fisherman was hauled out"), establishing prior cost and constraint. It motivates the protagonist's decision to orchestrate deliberately rather than accidentally: "I had decided that my fortunes had run in the wrong key too long." The trait enables the climactic broadcast by establishing the protagonist's credibility and the town's acceptance of fortune-driven events. Visible tradeoff: the protagonist moves from passive accident to active manipulation with social cost. Present in setup and middle reflection, shapes the payoff choice.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Orchestrate" drives the major turn: the protagonist's method of arranging the light projection and the town's response. The keeper names it explicitly ("You are making a habit of orchestrating the weather"), and the protagonist clarifies the mechanics ("I move people like water, letting gravity and rumor pull them where truth sits waiting"). The action redefines options: instead of trading the specs or hiding them, the protagonist uses them to force public acknowledgment. The broadcast sequence ("we fed the machine that stamps fortunes," "we fed it fortunes as if we were priests") dramatizes orchestration. Removing this action and replacing it with direct revelation or passive distribution would fundamentally alter stakes and closure. Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"By directing flow" is signaled in the protagonist's self-description ("I move people like water, letting gravity and rumor pull them where truth sits waiting") and dramatized through the mechanics of the broadcast: transforming specs into microdot fortunes, feeding them to the lighthouse lens, and scattering light over the town. The method shapes tactics: the protagonist does not command or reveal directly but arranges conditions for acknowledgment. The means matters: the flow metaphor is actualized through light, projection, and the town's gradual acceptance. Present in middle reflection and enacted at payoff. Swapping "directing flow" for a more direct method (announcement, confrontation) would require structural changes.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The lighthouse on the rocky island supplies the essential resource: its lens becomes the tool for projecting fortunes across the town. The setting constrains choice: the protagonist must walk the causeway while the tide "thought things over," creating spatial pressure. The keeper's presence and the lighthouse interior (lamps, lens, fortune-stamping machine) enable the climactic orchestration. The setting charges the final image: light scattered over kitchen walls forces public acknowledgment. Present in setup (mentioned as the fisherman's destination), middle (the protagonist's walk and collaboration), and payoff (the broadcast). Removing the lighthouse and replacing it with a generic broadcast tool would weaken thematic resonance and spatial specificity. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"After last orders" anchors the timeframe in the opening line and recurs in paragraph 18, creating a coherent pressure window when "the docks grow honest" and "the gangs of laughter shrink to single footsteps." The nighttime setting enables the light projection to be visible and the town to be home to witness it. The timeframe tightens decisions: the protagonist must act before dawn, and by morning "the fishermen traced new routes that matched the light." The clock is not a ticking countdown but a sustained pressure that makes the broadcast legible and consequential. Present in setup, implicit in middle (nighttime walk), and resolved by payoff (morning consequences). Swappable with other night windows but the specific "after last orders" adds texture and social context.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to transpose life into a new key" is dramatized in the protagonist's decision to reject trading the specs and instead use them for orchestration: "I had decided that my fortunes had run in the wrong key too long. I wanted to transpose life into a new key, where the minor resolve could be felt in the bones." The desire conflicts with the safer option (trade for papers or a ticket) and incurs cost: social complicity and the agent's deception. The metaphor is enacted through the lighthouse broadcast, which shifts the town's etiquette from silent knowing to visible acknowledgment. Present in setup (reflection), drives middle choice (lighthouse collaboration), and resolves at payoff (watching the town respond). Friction between want and cost is visible.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Familiar enigma" is sustained throughout: the lyric voice combines intimate knowledge of the town's etiquette with cryptic phrasing ("open secrets keep the weather calm," "lighthouse is not haunted; it is simply patient"). Tone modulates with pressure: reflective and wry in setup, directive and collaborative at the lighthouse, then observant and satisfied at closure. The tone charges the final image: "see what you have done, and listened" balances acknowledgment with ambiguity. Coherent through all turns, purposeful in its texture, and inseparable from the voice. No single static mood; the tone deepens rather than shifts. Strong integration with theme and voice.</comment>
