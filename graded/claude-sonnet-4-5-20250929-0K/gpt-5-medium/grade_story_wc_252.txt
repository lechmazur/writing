<comment>The narrator's interiority is concrete and particular ("grace is what I hide in my muscles"), and the final choice to name themselves and cross carries embodied cost. However, motivation feels more asserted than dramatized—the decision to speak aloud crystallizes suddenly without sufficient internal friction leading up to it. The move from "I had never named myself aloud" to immediate proclamation lacks the contradictory impulses that would elevate the choice into high-band territory.</comment>

<comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a lyric, image-dense pattern early and sustains it; the final crossing constitutes a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant) where the protagonist's self-naming crystallizes the island and unlocks the community's approach. Cost is present in the line "the one without hardshell, the one that bends like sunlight on scales"—a renunciation of protective identity. Orientation is legible by ~100 words (dock, island, coast setting, single POV). One meaningful deepening occurs when the scrimshaw "rang" and the whale's call answered, tightening the stakes toward the crossing. The closure reconfigures the opening restraint motif ("even the waves learn restraint") into active tenderness ("to love with seawater still drying in our hair"), charging prior material with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<comment>The sublittoral fringe, dock hardware (bollard, cleat, mooring lines), and the whale's offshore presence all constrain the crossing action and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clear: dock → skiff → island → tide mark. The scrimshaw as object-as-setting carries tactile, centuries-old "thumb oil" and functions as a talisman that enables the protagonist's crossing, meeting the micro-setting criterion. However, sensory selection leans heavily visual and metaphoric; under stress, perception does not narrow as expected—figurative language remains lush throughout.</comment>

<comment>The dominant stake—holding the disappearing island by naming oneself without apology—is signaled early and sustained. The scrimshaw discovery and the whale's call form one meaningful tightening that narrows options toward the crossing. Agency is clear: the protagonist detaches mooring lines, lifts the scrimshaw, speaks their true name, and rows across, all with on-page cost (foreclosing the hardshell identity, risking public scrutiny). The final image reweights the opening premise: post-violence restraint becomes combative tenderness, a visible tactical shift from hiding to witnessing.</comment>

<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme—freedom through embracing one's true nature in a world where violence is impossible—emerges from concrete beats: the scrimshaw's carved woman "kissing the knife she no longer needed," the protagonist shedding "hardshell," and the crowd's "windless cheer." The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "to detach without abandoning, to fight without harm, to love with seawater still drying in our hair." No overt moralizing; the final tableau reweights the opening's "gentle coast" as active choice rather than passive restraint. One slip: "because we are all learning" edges toward communal summary rather than staying rooted in the protagonist's singular experience.</comment>

<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>First-person singular POV is stable with a distinctive perceptual signature: metaphoric density ("cradle a gull you have sworn not to tame," "chain singing as it learns it was never a chain"). However, register drifts upward throughout ("sublittoral fringe," "combative tenderness," "detach without abandoning")—diction that feels more like imposed literary polish than the idiom of a dock worker, even a graceful one. Under peak pressure (the crossing), syntax remains ornate rather than compressing. The filter-verb stack in the final third ("wanted," "wanted," "wanted") flattens immediacy at a high-stakes beat.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>5.9</grade>
<comment>Information density is high, but figurative language saturates nearly every sentence without respite, triggering overwriting penalties: "fate came with a pocket," "fog into a staircase," "silence heavy enough to crush careful lies," "a cathedral breathing." Paraphrase loops appear: "I wanted freedom... I wanted to work... I wanted to be seen" cycles without added pressure. Template cadence in the final paragraph: four consecutive "we would" constructions. Mixed metaphors: "ringing traveled up my arms, like chain singing" conflates tactile vibration with auditory image. These artifacts dull the closure beat's impact, preventing entry into the 7+ band.</comment>

<grade>6.6</grade>
<comment>The core premise—a post-violence world where an island only holds if someone names themselves without apology—offers a fresh angle on identity and transformation. The scrimshaw as inherited pirate's tool, the whale's call as method, and the protagonist's dock-worker grace synthesize into a coherent vision. However, the emotional arc (hiding → public self-naming) follows a familiar template without sufficient lived specificity to make the synthesis feel inevitable. The final image ("seawater still drying in our hair") is resonant but not wholly original; proximity to familiar poetic tropes lowers the ceiling.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The graceful dock worker's choices drive key turns: finding the scrimshaw, deciding to cross, naming themselves aloud, and laying the scrimshaw at the tide mark. The profession matters on the page—detaching mooring lines, threading them through a belt, pushing off in a skiff—and "grace" is dramatized as embodied competence under pressure. The character's decision to name themselves is the story's pivot, and the final vow to "ferry them to the island whenever it tries to disappear" articulates ongoing agency. Cost is visible: shedding the protective "hardshell" identity in front of witnesses.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The pirate's whalebone scrimshaw appears in four beats: wedged in the bollard, held aloft over the protagonist's head, warming to show another scene, and laid at the highest tide mark. It carries reweighted meaning—from the pirate's carved woman "kissing a knife" to teaching "a harbor how to say please"—and its tactile handling ("slick with centuries of thumb oil," "ringing traveled up my arms") charges the crossing. Removing it would collapse the mechanism by which the protagonist unlocks their own guarded heart and the island's attention.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The disappearing island shapes stakes from the opening line ("surfaced again like a bruise remembering a fist") and reappears at multiple beats: showing its crescent, thinning at the edges, holding when named, and meeting the protagonist "like a stern aunt." Its behavior—only holds if someone ashore names who they are—dictates the protagonist's final choice and the crowd's later dependence ("ferry them to the island whenever it tries to disappear"). The island's logic governs the closure and would render the story incoherent without it.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>"Unlocks guarded hearts" is attributed to the scrimshaw and pirate's legacy ("Her scrimshaw unlocked guarded hearts... by laying a map of someone's courage into their palm") and claimed by the protagonist at the island: "I wanted freedom in embracing my true nature, the one that unlocks guarded hearts by refusing to guard my own." However, the attribute remains more thematic claim than on-page constraint—no scene shows the protagonist actually unlocking another character's guarded heart through visible action with a cost. It guides the protagonist's self-concept but does not alter tactics in a dramatized beat.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>"Detach" drives the story's pivot: the protagonist begins "to detach the last mooring lines, threading them through my belt like meanings," a physical act that enables the crossing and forecloses return to the hidden self. The word reappears in the final image: "we are all learning to detach without abandoning," reweighting the opening's forced restraint into chosen release. Swapping "detach" for a synonym (e.g., "release," "unfasten") would lose the thematic charge of separation-with-care that defines combative tenderness.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The whale's call is signaled early ("a long note rose, the call of a whale from the deep, old as the first refusal"), answers the protagonist's scrimshaw-ringing moment, turns fog into stairs, and guides the crossing ("The whale's song guided me across the sublittoral fringe"). It reappears at closure when "the whale rose offshore, a cathedral breathing, measuring our resolve." The method shapes multiple beats and its mechanics—sound as path-maker—matter on the page. Removing it would eliminate the catalyst that makes the island "start to hold."</comment>

<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>The sublittoral fringe is named three times and serves as the threshold the protagonist must cross ("across the sublittoral fringe where eelgrass combed the water for lost names and returned them faithfully"). The dock hardware (bollard, cleat, mooring lines) enables the detachment action. However, the setting's constraints remain more atmospheric than tactical—eelgrass "combing for lost names" is lyric decoration rather than a resource or obstacle that alters the protagonist's choices. The setting charges the crossing but does not force a tactical adaptation.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>"After violence becomes impossible" is established early ("after the Great Pacification, the pirate cut deals and throats, but after violence became impossible, she carved instead") and governs the world's social rules: "you cannot grip another body until that body asks to be held." However, the timeframe functions as premise rather than live pressure—no scene shows the protagonist testing this constraint or making a choice because violence is unavailable. It colors tone and backstory but does not tighten tactics or decisions on the page.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The motivation—"to find freedom in embracing one's true nature"—is dramatized across beats: the protagonist hides grace "in my muscles," has "never named myself aloud," then chooses to speak "my name, the one without hardshell, the one that bends like sunlight on scales." The island tests this: "ready to slap me with blessings if I lied about what I wanted." The final vow ("I would ferry them... calling it back with my newest, oldest voice") embodies the freedom sought. Friction between hiding and revealing drives the crossing choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>"Combative tenderness" is named explicitly ("I walked the dock with combative tenderness, ready to argue with any boundary") and woven through the final image: "tenderness is braver when it is witnessed," "to fight without harm, to love with seawater still drying in our hair." The tone coheres through paradox—restraint as active choice, violence redirected into song—and modulates at the crossing when the crowd's silence becomes "heavy enough to crush careful lies." The oxymoron charges the closure, though explicit naming ("combative tenderness") undercuts its emergence through action alone.</comment>
