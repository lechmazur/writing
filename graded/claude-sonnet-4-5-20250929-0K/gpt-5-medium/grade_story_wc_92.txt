<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is evocative and consistent—"I am calmly inventive" filters perception and choice. However, motivation relies heavily on told backstory ("She called the workshops below the cradle of sparks") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final choice to invite Rhun feels abrupt; his nod lacks prior internal friction to make the shift earned. Embodied emotion is present but leans poetic over visceral at key beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: imagery and atmosphere build toward a resonant reconfiguration where the fort "becomes a lighthouse that agrees to listen." Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening lines. Cost is conceptual—dimming the fort to "make room for eyes to learn their own night"—but remains abstract; no specific forfeiture or visible tradeoff is dramatized on the page. The blackout enables rather than tightens, and Rhun's conversion lacks causal preparation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The luminous fort, bronze quill holder, and workshop coals supply vivid anchor images. The quill holder constrains a middle choice (unlocking) and charges the ending ("rests warm in my palm"). Sensory selection is purposeful: "iron and rain," "soot and lullaby." Spatial choreography remains clear across moves from post to alcove to workshop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—spark a silent revolution—is signaled early. Pressure coheres but does not escalate: the blackout grants opportunity rather than narrowing options, and Rhun's appearance could tighten stakes but resolves with a single nod. No visible price is paid; the revolution succeeds without friction or loss. Agency at closure is present but the cost remains conceptual and unfelt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme—consent versus coercion, surveillance versus hearth—emerges organically from image and action: "guarding consent instead of fear," "lighthouse that agrees to listen." The bronze quill holder and cradle of sparks recur with shifting weight. No overt moralizing. The final image offers a resonant answer without stating a thesis, though the thematic moves are more poetic than surprising.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout: "locks I guard are singing with fear," "darkness softens, neither lamp-lit nor starless, but possible." Diction remains controlled and voice-particular under pressure. Dialogue is minimal but functional; Fara's "You are late" and the protagonist's response carry subtext. No head-hopping. Psychic distance is stable. Figurative density is high but mostly legible and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>High figurative density without obvious template loops. Some lines layer jobs well: "medals dreaming of their own reflections" economically conveys Rhun's vanity. However, metaphoric vehicles occasionally collide—"winking hush with a bite" mixes sight, sound, and taste without clear anchor. Repeated phrase structures ("It is X, who…") and the stem "I [verb]" appear frequently. Minor paraphrase loop: "silence revolution" restated as "consent of doors" without added pressure. No scaffold artifacts touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The premise—lock sentinel engineers a blackout to dim a surveillance fort—offers a fresh angle. Specificity in bronze quill holder mechanics and sundial code elevates above generic rebellion templates. However, the core emotional arc (oppressive light → liberating dimness) follows a familiar trajectory without a non-obvious moral calculus. The ending's ease—Rhun converts with minimal friction—undercuts risk. Transformation is present but not startling.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Present in setup, middle (unlocking doors, adjusting regulators), and ending (standing at post). Choices to unlock and invite Rhun create key turns. Causal pressure evident; specificity high ("lock, sentinel, door that learns"). Cost is conceptual but closure linkage strong.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Introduced early ("heavy as a whisper kept too long"), used twice (unlocking corridor, slotting into control), and returns warm in the palm at ending. Enables middle tactics and charges final image. Irreplaceable: mother's legacy and ceremonial axis. Cost connection present (memory and ritual).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Named in backstory and revisited at the workshop. Shapes middle beat (coals, wires) and frames the ending's claim. However, remains more thematic label than tactical constraint; could be replaced with "workshop" without structural loss. Mid-scene use functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Told in line four ("I am calmly inventive") and demonstrated in unlocking without sight. Enables middle action but no visible tradeoff or cost tied to this specific trait. Swappable with "patient" or "skilled" without edits beyond line four.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Setup (motivation), middle (coded angles walked, vents opened), and ending (hearthglow and patient angles). Drives at least two beats. However, "intrigue" as a label is generic; the specific actions (unlocking, adjusting) would remain intrigue-coded under other names. Moderate causal pressure; present at closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Signaled early (eastern bastion sundial) and used once in middle ("tilt the sundial thought in"). Shapes one choice (path selection) but mechanics remain vague. Code scratched on sleeve mentioned late without prior setup. Functional but not structurally indispensable; path could be chosen by other means.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Present throughout; luminous fort pressures the motive, blackout enables tactics, and the ending reconfigures it as "lighthouse that agrees to listen." Spatial choreography clear. The fort's brightness is the problem the closure addresses. Strong causal and closure linkage; irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Blackout introduced early and drives the entire middle sequence (darkness enables movement). Time is not tracked precisely but the event frames all action. Enables tactics and alters the fort's state. Present in setup, middle, and ending. Moderate specificity; "power outage" could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stated in line five, dramatized through choices (unlocking, inviting Rhun), and resolved in ending ("guarding consent instead of fear"). Desire creates the dominant stake with conceptual cost. Friction between wants (revolution) and method (silence, patience) present. Strong closure linkage; drives escalation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Winking hush" appears three times, framing opening and ending. Tone is coherent—quiet, conspiratorial, layered—and modulates subtly (fear to laughter). Charges the final line. However, remains more atmospheric descriptor than structural element; swappable with "quiet resolve" or "secret breath" without breaking logic.</comment>
