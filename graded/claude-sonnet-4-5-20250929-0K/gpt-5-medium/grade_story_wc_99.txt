<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The bonsai tutor's interior voice is distinct and embodied—"obedience is the way fear pretends to be careful"—and the movement from swallowed words to spoken apology is earned through accumulating imagery. The emotional arc from discipline-as-cage to listening-to-branches shows contradictory impulses in action. Minor slips: the gull "measuring the hush like a colleague" feels slightly precious, and the final teaching vow ("I would speak slowly…") edges toward summary rather than lived tension. Still, the renunciation of storm-pruning and the choice to "let the sea's blue instruction diffuse" forecloses the old method with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly: narrator, post-severance, islet, rain-washed paths. The accumulative lens holds: compass ticking → lace instructions → cove recognition → spoken apology → color emergence → vow to teach differently. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the protagonist releases control ("pruning only what asked") with conceptual cost legible in the final blue instruction and the compass pocketed warm. One persistent constraint—the ghost ship's compass as oracle—shapes tactics throughout. The narrative teaches its lyric pattern early and pays it off without causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The islet's salt grass, casuarina needles, black rock, and shallow cove supply concrete anchors and constrain the ritual walk. The compass on the flat black rock and lace drinking the cove's reflections charge the closure image directly. Sensory detail is filtered through the tutor's professional bias: driftwood "nested like unkempt bonsai," wire bruising. The breezy, rain-rinsed setting enables the final vow to "open the garden gates" and let sea instruction diffuse through miniatures, meeting the 9+ gate for environment shaping closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding the color of unspoken apologies—is signaled early and tightens through the lace-map walk to the cove where words were swallowed. The protagonist's agency is renunciation: abandoning storm-caging for responsive pruning. Cost is conceptual but legible: "no more shaping storms into bonsai just to admire how quiet their cages looked" forecloses the old pedagogical stance. Pressure accumulates rather than reversing, fitting the accumulative lens. The tightening is meaningful but the peak moment lacks a visceral tradeoff beyond thematic repricing, keeping it just below 8.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—control versus listening, apology as color, discipline as fear—emerges from concrete particulars: compass, lace map, wire bruising, driftwood nests. The final image offers a resonant answer without moralizing: "let it remember us kindly, blue." Cerulean as both regret and instruction reweights the opening metaphor. The lace drinking cove reflections and the compass warming in the palm embody the shift from extraction to reciprocity. No thematic echo or thesis statement mars the ending; the blue instruction diffuses through every prior miniature.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: "a thin glaze of blue that would not crack under sun," "sea tongued the shore with rhythmically placid hunger." Diction remains within the tutor's idiom—professional, reflective, metaphorically controlled. The compass "clicked like a throbbing tooth" and the lace instructions "stitched by a navigator's wife" anchor voice in craft and water. Minor slip: "quotidian salvage" in the penultimate sequence feels slightly elevated for the narrator's plain-spoken texture under peak emotion, but the effect is brief and the close recovers with "let it remember us kindly, blue."</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully and figurative language is consistent with the tutor's idiom. However, the phrase "rhythmically placid" appears four times, creating a motif loop that edges toward decorative recurrence rather than evolving pressure. "Tides of remembrance" recurs similarly without shifting function. The opening and closing frame the compass and lace cleanly, but mid-passage sentences occasionally stack metaphors without clear propulsion: "Colors began to diffuse…bleached apologies, pale moons, a shy bruise, and then a glow" lists rather than dramatizes. Paraphrase check: "I spoke…I said the words I should have said" restates without added detail. Line-level control is strong but not flawless; apply −0.6 for patterned loops and −0.3 for mild paraphrase, totaling −0.9, lowering from ~7.7 base to 6.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of bonsai pedagogy, nautical lace-map, and apology-as-color is specific and non-obvious. The compass as ghost-ship relic and lace as navigator's wife instructions integrate craft traditions freshly. The turn from pruning storms to "pruning only what asked" transforms the teacher-student trope through the cove recognition beat. Risk: the lyric accumulation and symbolic objects (compass, lace, color) could read as ornamental, but here they constrain the walk and charge the closure. Proximity check clean; no close echoes detected. Freshness is earned through specificity rather than surface novelty.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The slow-spoken bonsai tutor is present throughout, makes the key choice to speak apologies at the cove (midpoint turn), and vows to teach differently at closure. Early signal, two distinct beats (cove speech, final vow), and closure participation satisfy all three gates. The tutor's professional lens filters all perception. Causal pressure: the choice to speak and later to "prune only what asked" narrows the pedagogical path with cost. However, the tutor's agency in the middle stretch is passive—following lace instructions rather than making contested decisions—so the beat involvement is observational until the cove. Score: setup +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure +1.2, causal pressure +0.8, cost +0.4, minus swappability −0.4 (could be another craft teacher), minus passivity in middle −0.7. Base 3.0 + 2.8 = 5.8, round to 5.8. Re-check: the tutor's prior failure (swallowing words) and final vow are character-specific and irreplaceable; raise by +0.9 for specificity and lived detail, reaching 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The ghost ship's compass appears in beats: opening (carried to islet), rock placement (ticking with lace), cove (needle upright, quivering), pocketed warm at end. Four beats, early signal, drives the walk ("needle did not point north but toward…cove"), and charges the final image ("small moon steadied"). Causal: the compass's ticking rhythm governs the walk's pace and the lace-reading beats. Closure: pocketed, its warmth signals acceptance. Setup +0.7, four beats +1.4, causal +1.2, closure +1.4, specificity (ghost ship relic, ticking like a tooth) +0.6, cost (its quivering cease when apology spoken) +0.5. Base 3.0 + 5.8 = 8.8, but the compass does not create the problem it helps solve (late-intro friction does not apply; it's present from line 1), so no penalty. However, the compass's mechanics are never tested—does it guide or merely witness?—so apply mild swappability −0.3 (could be another keepsake). Score 8.5, but the ticking-as-pressure and final steadying are irreplaceable: restore +0.4 for recurring image charging closure. Final 8.9, round down to 8.9. Re-check against band: ≥8.5 requires strong causal pressure, closure linkage, irreplaceability, felt cost—all present. However, the compass does not foreclose an option; it witnesses. Apply cap at 7.9 for witness role rather than constraint role.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The core concept "tides of remembrance" appears explicitly twice and implicitly governs the rising emotional pull at the cove. It shapes the walk's method (following tides' simple insistence) and the final vow to "bow to the tide." Setup present (line 1 context: "after the severance"), development at cove ("tides of remembrance rose…pulled at the knots between my ribs"), payoff in final teaching stance ("bow to the tide, and let it remember us kindly"). Three gates met. Causal: the tide metaphor licenses the walk and the apology's release. Closure: the final line crystallizes the concept as blue instruction. Setup +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure +1.4, causal +0.9, specificity +0.5. Base 3.0 + 4.3 = 7.3. However, "tides of remembrance" is also used as label-only metaphor in mid-passage without altering tactics; apply −0.3 for ornamental echo. Additionally, the concept is slightly swappable with "waves of memory" or similar; apply −0.3. Score 7.3 − 0.6 = 6.7, round to 6.7. Re-check: the tides govern the ritual's timing and the sea's acceptance, so irreplaceability is higher than estimated; restore +0.2. Final 6.9, but the concept does not constrain a choice so much as provide metaphoric frame; apply developmental cap at 6.4 per missing constraint test.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Rhythmically placid" appears four times: needle's patience, sea's hunger, tides rising, narrator's teaching vow. Setup (line 2), development (sea tonguing shore, tides insisting), closure (teaching vow: "speak slowly, rhythmically placid"). Three gates met. The attribute characterizes the narrative's emotional texture and the tutor's method. However, it does not constrain an action—it describes cadence without cost. Setup +0.5, three appearances across beats +1.1, closure +0.8, thematic coherence +0.4. Base 3.0 + 2.8 = 5.8. Deductions: label-only trait (no tradeoff shown) −0.3, decorative recurrence −0.3, swappable with "calmly measured" −0.3. Score 5.8 − 0.9 = 4.9. However, the attribute governs the tutor's final pedagogical stance and primes the closure image, so it contributes to RR; restore +0.6 for closure linkage. Final 5.5. Re-check: the attribute does not enable or foreclose an on-page action; it modulates tone. Per the guidance, label-only traits without cost trend low. Keep at 5.5. Wait: the attribute appears in the final teaching vow and connects to the sea's rhythm, charging the closure; raise to 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The action "diffuse" appears in five contexts: casuarina needles diffuse sky into light, colors diffuse through lace, sea instruction will diffuse through miniatures, and implicitly the tutor's past tight control diffusing into openness. Setup (casuarina beat, early), development (lace drinking reflections, colors diffusing), closure (final vow: "let the sea's blue instruction diffuse through every miniature horizon"). Three gates. The action embodies the thematic shift from constriction to permeability. Causal: diffusion is the mechanism by which the lace reveals color and the final teaching method will work. Setup +0.7, three beats +1.1, closure +1.5, causal +1.1, specificity (opposes prior pruning/wire control) +0.7, cost (letting go of tight control) +0.5. Base 3.0 + 5.6 = 8.6. However, "diffuse" in the middle (colors through lace) is passive observation rather than protagonist action; apply −0.4 for passivity. Score 8.2. Re-check: the action is central to the closure vow and redefines the tutor's method; irreplaceability high. However, it does not create a key turn so much as describe the resolution's mode. Per guidance, major turns should trace to this action; the turn is the spoken apology, not the diffusion. Apply cap at 7.1.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The method "through instructions woven into an antique lace pattern" is introduced early (harbor widow, navigator's wife), used at midpoint (tracing bays and shoals, compass ticking, resolved path), and pays off when lace drinks cove reflections and reveals color. Three gates met. The lace's mechanics—reading with fingertips, pattern as map—shape the walk and the apology ritual. Setup +0.8 (harbor widow scene), two beats (tracing, drinking reflections) +0.9, closure (lace brightens to blue, folded back into absence) +1.3, causal (method directs the walk clockwise, prunes thoughts toward wind) +1.0, specificity (navigator's wife, knotted instructions) +0.6, cost (the method requires touch, patience, and submission to coded instruction) +0.4. Base 3.0 + 5.0 = 8.0. However, the lace does not constrain a choice—the tutor follows its instruction without friction or tradeoff. The lace is oracle rather than test. Apply −0.5 for lack of contested choice. Score 7.5. Additionally, the lace could be replaced with another map artifact (scroll, shell arrangement); apply −0.3 for partial swappability. Final 7.2. Re-check: the lace is irreplaceable as antique pattern from navigator's wife and its texture (drinking reflections) is unique; restore +0.2. Score 7.4. However, the method is introduced and explained in one passage, then used passively; developmental constraint is weak. Apply cap at 6.9 per guidance that methods should shape attempts, and here the attempt is uncontested.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The breezy islet after rain is present throughout: salt grass, shell paths, casuarina branches, black rock, shallow cove, driftwood. Setup (line 1), development (paths, rock for lace placement, cove recognition), closure (channel view, garden gates vow tied to islet's instruction). Three gates met. The islet's micro-settings constrain the ritual: flat black rock for compass/lace, cove for apology, tide's acceptance. The rain-washed state primes the reflections that enable color emergence. Setup +0.8, three beats (rock, cove, final view) +1.1, closure (islet as source of "sea's blue instruction") +1.4, causal (walk dictated by coast, cove location matters) +1.2, specificity (post-rain, breezy, salt-grass stitched paths) +0.7, cost (isolation, exposure, tidal timing) +0.4. Base 3.0 + 5.6 = 8.6. The islet does not constrain a choice so much as provide stage; the tutor could perform the ritual elsewhere. Apply −0.4 for replaceable venue. Score 8.2. However, the cove's driftwood "nested like unkempt bonsai" and the recognition beat are irreplaceable; the islet is the site of prior failure. Restore +0.3. Final 8.5. Re-check: the setting charges the final image (blue instruction from sea) and the garden-opening vow, meeting the 9+ gate for Q3. However, the islet does not alter tactics—it stages them. The close call: setting shapes outcome (color found here) but does not pressure a contested choice. Cap at 7.8 per guidance that postcard description trends low; here the setting does more (enables ritual, charges closure) but does not force a tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"After the severance" anchors the timeframe early and governs motivation (the one who mattered did not return). The timeframe sets up the emotional state and the journey's purpose. However, time does not tighten on the page—the islet walk unfolds without clock pressure or deadline. Setup present (line 1), development weak (no mid-scene time constraint), closure participation minimal (the severance is context, not active at end). Two gates met (setup, thematic presence). The severance's cost is felt throughout but does not alter tactics. Setup +0.6, thematic coherence +0.5, cost (prior loss shapes motivation) +0.4. Base 3.0 + 1.5 = 4.5. The severance primes the entire arc and the apology's target, so it contributes causally; add +0.6. Score 5.1. However, the timeframe does not appear in or shape the ending; the closure is forward-looking (teaching vow) rather than severance-resolving. The severance is backstory that motivates but does not constrain present action. Round to 5.1. Re-check: the severance is irreplaceable context and the protagonist's unspoken apologies trace to it; raise +0.1 for specificity. Final 5.2.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to find the color of unspoken apologies" is stated early ("I had come to find their color"), dramatized at the cove (speaking the words, lace brightening to cerulean), and fulfilled in the closure (blue instruction, teaching vow includes showing compass/lace/cove). Three gates met. The desire drives the walk, the lace reading, the apology speech, and the final pedagogical shift. Setup +0.8, three beats (arrival, cove speech, teaching vow) +1.1, closure +1.6 (motivation satisfied and transformed into instruction), causal +1.4 (each beat serves the search), specificity (color as metaphor for emotional truth, cerulean = regret reweighted) +0.7, cost (speaking costs discipline-as-silence, finding color costs old teaching method) +0.5. Base 3.0 + 6.1 = 9.1. However, the motivation is somewhat told rather than shown in friction—the tutor follows the lace without internal conflict over whether to speak. The apology scene is brief and the choice uncontested. Apply −0.8 for limited dramatization of want-versus-fear tension. Score 8.3. Re-check: the cove recognition ("Here I had promised to speak; here I had swallowed the words") and the act of speaking do dramatize the choice with embodied cost (seawater/discipline metaphor). The tension is retrospective but present. Restore +0.3. Final 8.6. However, the motivation does not generate a mid-scene obstacle; the path is smooth once the lace is read. Apply cap at 7.6 per guidance that desire should be conflicted in choices, and here the conflict is past-tense.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Cerulean regret" is introduced early ("walled every horizon"), modulates through the walk (thin glaze, bruise, shy color), and charges the final image (muted cerulean in lace, blue instruction). The tone is coherent and purposeful: regret as both prison and teacher. Setup +0.8, development (regret's color sought, found in lace, accepted as instruction) +1.2, closure (blue as ending note, "let it remember us kindly, blue") +1.7, coherence across turns +0.9, specificity (cerulean = blue-green, regret's hue, sea's color) +0.7. Base 3.0 + 5.3 = 8.3. The tone does not shift with pressure—it deepens but remains elegiac throughout, which is consistent with accumulative design. No penalty for static mood since the design is lyric-accumulative. However, the tone does not modulate in response to escalation; it sustains one register. Per guidance, tone that charges the final image trends high; here "blue" as final word crystallizes the tone. The tone is indispensable to closure. Score 8.3. Re-check: cerulean as both problem (regret walling horizons) and solution (blue instruction) reconfigures the emotional valence, meeting RR. The tone is essential. Round to 8.2 to avoid overstating; the tone could be another color-regret pairing (grey sorrow, amber remorse) without breaking the story, so partial swappability applies. Deduct −0.3, final 8.0. However, cerulean is specific to sea and the navigator's lace tradition; restore +0.2. Final 8.2.</comment>
