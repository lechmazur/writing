<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to free trapped creativity is clear and sustained, but interiority relies heavily on poetic abstraction ("dark awe," "shadowed rapture") rather than embodied contradiction. The sculptor's recovery is told rather than shown through micro-choices under pressure. Emotional states are asserted through elevated language ("weeps as if a knot inside her unwinds") without the gritty particulars that would ground them in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through repeated archway circuits, meteor tracings, and the sculptor's release. Orientation anchors arrive late—who/where/when clarify only after ~150 words of abstract aurora description. Closure delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (the sculptor carves again, windows open) with felt cost (the instrument calls the narrator back), but the final paragraph drifts into thematic summary ("the night itself learns to speak") rather than holding a charged image. One meaningful deepening is present but weakened by summary.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The aurora-lit archway and astronomical instrument supply vivid sensory anchors (brass, frost, vellum that smells like rain). The archway constrains movement through repeated circuits and opens "a door inside the arch...without brick," directly shaping the sculptor's liberation. Spatial choreography remains coherent across beats. Late orientation (sky, river, archway relationships unclear until midpoint) caps the score despite strong micro-setting work with the instrument.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (freeing trapped creativity) is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the instrument "hums" and the door opens, narrowing the narrator's path to repeated return. The sculptor's release demonstrates visible cost (the narrator must continue for others), but the peak beat—pages drifting, sleep, gallery of breathing statues—is told in summary rather than dramatized with micro-choices that narrow options. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens but lacks a second on-page reversal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme (creativity as imprisoned energy, liberation through listening) emerges through meteor tracings and the sculptor's carved air. The final image—"the night itself learns to speak without wounding its own silence"—reweights prior material but edges toward abstract philosophizing. The unwritten calendar and stardust recur purposefully, though "the city remembers...its stardust" in the penultimate paragraph restates rather than deepens. No overt moralizing, but the thematic answer is more stated than resonantly implied.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Voice is lyric and consistent, with a perceptual signature (aurora as "colors that whisper," instrument "cooling like a moonstone"). However, elevated diction pervades even high-pressure beats ("shadowed rapture," "dark awe kept following"), creating register drift that distances the reader from urgency. Free indirect style is clean, but the prose rarely modulates under stress—syntax remains ornate throughout. No dialogue on the page; single-POV focalization is stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Figurative language appears in nearly every sentence ("sky breathes," "unspoken words braided with frost," "marble lungs," "night repeats it in color"), creating density without pattern-teaching or payoff at closure. Paraphrase loops: "the instrument...a vessel for remembered stardust" / "stardust rises from their shoulders" / "the city remembers...its stardust." Template cadence in the final third: "I [verb]...I [verb]...I [verb]" across six consecutive sentences. Metaphor muddle: "marble lungs afraid of drawing breath" mixes tenor/vehicle incoherently. Artifacts touch the closure beat (−1.7 baseline, pattern pervades).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The frame (liberating artists' silence through meteor tracings at an aurora archway) offers a fresh synthesis. Specific verbs ("combs," "shedding a rind of fear") and the astronomical instrument's tactile presence elevate particularity. However, the emotional arc (cursed listener finds vocation through repeated acts of freeing) could transfer to other magical-realist premises with minor edits. The "unwritten calendar" and "remembered stardust" risk abstraction without transformation through lived choice. Risk-taking in structure (mosaic-like repetition) is present but not fully paid off.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The moonstruck dreamer frames the opening and closing, but the character's decisions (align the instrument, whisper to the night, carry pages to the sculptor) are told in summary rather than shown as micro-choices that narrow live options. Present across beats but replaceable with "compassionate listener" or similar archetype.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The astronomical instrument is handled in at least four beats: lifting it under the arch, aligning circular sight with the first star, setting it on the floor to rest, and shouldering it again at the end. Its brass chill and hum constrain the narrator's method (must trace falling stars) and the instrument's weight/lightness reflects emotional state, charging the final return. Essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Remembered stardust appears in three beats: as a property of the instrument, rising from statues' shoulders in the gallery, and in "the city remembers...its stardust." The concept shapes the narrator's understanding of trapped creativity (stardust refuses to settle) and the sculptor's liberation (stardust rises like pollen), but its mechanics remain abstract. Functional reprise that reweights meaning but does not constrain tactics on the page.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Hearing unspoken words drives the opening motivation ("I hear what mouths are afraid to confess"), enables the method (the narrator hears the sculptor's granite scent in the unspoken words), and costs the narrator peace ("it never stops," "the dark awe kept following"). The trait constrains the narrator to return repeatedly. Present in setup, middle, and ending, with visible ongoing cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Rest appears at three pressure points: when the instrument is "heavy" and must be set down, when the narrator sleeps in the room of pages (enabling the gallery vision), and when sitting on cold stone after failure ("I rest too, and the river writes me a lullaby"). Each rest beat recharges or teaches patience, shaping later attempts. The seventh-circuit door opening follows a rest, tying the action to closure. Essential development across beats.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Tracing the path of falling stars is signaled early ("the method must be by tracing...word by word"), executed in the middle (copying slanted script on vellum, whispering meteor-taught lines), and enables the sculptor's liberation (pages "etched by light" from meteor tracings). The method's mechanics (align sight, copy script, whisper) constrain the narrator's tactics and cannot be replaced without breaking the causal chain. Indispensable across setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The aurora-lit archway frames every circuit, supplies the hinge and door ("a door inside the arch opens without brick"), and anchors the final return ("under the aurora-lit archway, we build a bridge"). The archway's curve structures repeated walks and the aurora "gathers like a vow" at key turns. Setting directly shapes tactics (must walk the arch's curve, align with aurora light) and charges the closure image. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The unwritten calendar is named three times and marks "no dates, only songs," creating thematic texture and a sense of passage ("across the nights," "the seventh circuit"). However, time remains vague—no live clock tightens decisions, and elapsed duration does not alter tactics. The calendar contributes to tone and theme but does not constrain on-page action. Functional metaphor without tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Freeing trapped creativity drives every beat: the narrator comes "to free trapped creativity," traces meteor paths to teach artists "how to unbind," carries pages to the sculptor, and returns for others. The motivation is dramatized through repeated acts and the sculptor's weeping release. Friction between the narrator's own cost ("the silence was digging a grave inside me") and the call to continue sharpens the stake. Essential to structure and ending.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Shadowed rapture is named once early and modulates across beats: awe mixed with threat at the start, brightening "without cruelty" in the gallery, "too bright for dawn" when the sculptor laughs, and teaching the night "to speak without wounding its own silence" at closure. Tone shifts with pressure and charges the final image, though the label itself is ornamental. Coherent modulation with closure linkage.</comment>
