<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The chaplain's interiority is embodied through his listening practice and carries specific contradictions ("lives…harder when the hinges inside them seize"). Jonah is vividly rendered through the apology-as-letters detail and the jaw-clench when offered help. The proprietor's voice is distinct in diction and gesture, though her diagnostic confidence ("Guilt is gravity") flirts with therapeutic abstraction. The final choice—Jonah breathing with the ticking and nodding without asking for mercy—feels earned by prior causality and forecloses passivity with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly: chaplain, shop, wounded music box. The piece operates under a Hybrid lens (causal repair sequence interleaved with accumulative metaphor), coherent at closure. The escalation is clean: thorn discovered → removed → heart ticks → Jonah chooses steps, with visible cost in "nodded without asking for mercy." Closure is Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: the apology becomes a map of steps he can deserve, reweighting prior material with undeniable pressure. One meaningful tightening is sufficient for this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The repair shop is vividly anchored with sensory particulars (brass filings, bench lamp, nest of screwdrivers). The clockwork heart functions as micro-setting, constraining choices (bent thorn) and charging the final image (ticking as map). Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The visiting-room windows and storm-cloud light are signaled early and return to guide Jonah's stance, elevating the ending. Occupational detail (tweezers, oils, escapement) reads plausible and pressures the chaplain's understanding without excess.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early: can Jonah turn apology into action? The thorn discovery narrows options (a physical fix enables the larger choice), and the ticking heart forces the final decision with visible cost. Agency is active: the chaplain brings the heart, the proprietor diagnoses and repairs, Jonah chooses to breathe with the beat and nod. The chaplain's question "Do your machines ever teach you" and the proprietor's answer deepen the calculus without stalling pressure. One meaningful tightening shapes closure under the chosen lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—forgiveness as rhythm and small repeated action—emerges through the clockwork repair, not assertion. "A heart is not forgiven by getting fixed; it is forgiven by keeping time" reweights prior material without moralizing. The thorn as metaphor for guilt and the windows/storm-clouds as pacing guide charge the ending without symbolic shouting. Subtext operates in the proprietor's refusal of payment and Jonah's wordless nod. The final image—apology as map—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question with undeniable pressure and cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited through the chaplain; no head-hopping. Voice is elevated and textured ("vibrant hush," "slow fish," "ribs," "verdict deferred") but mostly consistent. The proprietor's speech carries distinct idiom ("By the way light breaks through storm clouds…you can read the weather of machines"). Occasional lines ("aptly deliberate") echo prompt language and slightly dilute naturalness. Perceptual signature is clear: the chaplain notices thorn/doubt mirrors and listens for rhythm. Dialogue advances goals and carries subtext throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines do two jobs. The opening and closing images charge the frame effectively. However, repeated stems appear: "He told her…He said…He asked…I will tell him…I will ask him…I will say" clusters in exposition. Figurative density is high ("slow fish," "teeth in uncertain smile," "thorn of bent metal," "sliver of midnight," "verdict deferred") and occasionally stacks without breathing room. No major loops touch closure, but the scaffolding mid-story triggers a small momentum drag and disallows 9+ across categories per the artifact rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of repair shop, clockwork metaphor, and penitentiary chaplain is specific and non-obvious. The thorn as doubt, the escapement as rhythm, and the storm-cloud light as pacing guide transform familiar redemption tropes through concrete particulars. The proprietor's refusal of payment and substitution of future action ("bring a chair under it") offers a fresh inflection. Risk-taking in structure (two locations, reflective mode) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Transformation test passes: plot and arc would collapse with generic substitutions.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The chaplain's decisions drive all key turns: he brings the heart, asks the proprietor for diagnosis, and returns to frame Jonah's choice with the ticking and the light instruction. His choice to practice words "until they were his, not borrowed from doctrine" shapes the ending's charge. Present in setup, middle, and closure with causal pressure at each beat.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The clockwork heart is handled in three distinct beats: carried into the shop (setup), diagnosed and repaired with the thorn extraction (middle), and returned ticking to Jonah, where it becomes the auditory map for his choice (closure). Its gears-as-teeth and thorn-as-doubt properties are irreplaceable; swapping for a generic broken object would break the metaphor and rhythm logic. Visible cost tied to the object: Jonah must match his breathing to its beat.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Second opinions" shapes stakes on the page: Jonah asked the chaplain "not on the law, but on repair," the proprietor offers mechanical diagnosis as human insight, and the chaplain reframes it as "the rhythm is decided when the feet move." Present in setup and closure, reweighting the premise with cost. Could be swapped for "expert advice" with minor edits, limiting irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Aptly deliberate" appears twice as label: "aptly deliberate nod" (setup) and "her work stayed quiet, aptly deliberate" (middle). The trait enables the proprietor's careful repair and charges the chaplain's listening, but the phrase itself is static description rather than dramatized constraint. Present across beats but ornamental in execution, lowering the score despite thematic fit.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Deserve" is the hinge of Jonah's stake: "he could not deserve freedom without the rhythm to live it" (setup), and "the apology became a map of steps he could deserve" (closure). The action of deserving—earning through small repeated choices—narrows options and reweights the ending. Removing it would flatten Jonah's moral calculus. Causal pressure and closure linkage present, though the middle beat is thin.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"By the way light breaks through storm clouds" is signaled mid-story as the proprietor's metaphor for reading machines, then becomes the chaplain's instruction to Jonah: "tell him where to stand, and let the timing follow." It shapes the ending's spatial and temporal tactics with cost (Jonah must position himself). The mechanics matter and alter the final choice. Late first appearance (past 40%) but strong closure participation and causal pressure recover the score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The antique music box repair shop supplies the bench, tools (tweezers, oils), and the proprietor's expertise that enable the thorn extraction. It pressures the chaplain's metaphor-building and charges the contrast with the penitentiary. Present in setup and middle with functional pressure, but absent from closure (the ending shifts to the visiting room). Lyric reprise is weak; the shop does not return to reweight the final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"In the calm before realization" frames the opening and closing, bracketing the story's temporal arc. The timeframe is less a tightening device than a tonal anchor; no live clock alters tactics. The phrase reappears at closure ("In that vibrant hush, in the calm before realization"), charging the ending with resonance. Early signal and closure participation present, but middle development is absent, capping the score under the gate model.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Jonah's desire "to turn an apology into action" is dramatized early, drives the chaplain's choice to bring the heart, and is tested in the final beat when Jonah breathes with the ticking and nods. Friction between wanting freedom and needing rhythm creates visible cost: he must choose steps "small enough to succeed and large enough to matter." Present across all three beats with causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Vibrant hush" anchors the opening ("the room settled into a vibrant hush") and returns at closure ("In that vibrant hush, in the calm before realization"). The tone modulates coherently: quiet intensity in the shop, practiced words outside, and listening silence in the booth. The phrase charges the final image by recalling the opening, reweighting stillness as active choice. Coherence across turns and closure participation elevate the score.</comment>
