<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is consistent and embodied through micro-choices (reading the tag, playing the whistle notes, stepping into the corridor). Interiority carries a distinct texture—"questions rot if kept"—and the final choice to step into the glare feels earned by the cumulative pressure of inheritance and obligation. Minor slip: the mother's expedition functions more as backstory weight than as a lived contradiction that complicates present action in real time.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. The piece teaches its pattern early (spiral motifs, pattern languages, incremental revelation) and holds it through closure. The ending delivers Charged Poise: the protagonist steps into the corridor of glare with the third whistle note, crystallizing options and reconfiguring the watcher-city relationship with undeniable cost (becoming a "unit of distance" like her mother). Cost is legible in "I am ready to be measured" and the final image of light "ringing like a bell." One meaningful deepening occurs when the ledger reveals the expedition's fate and the watchers' true function as measures, not mercies.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The turtle-shell city is concretely realized and constrains movement throughout: ridged spirals, barnacle constellations, the crack under the heel that yields the copper tag, the gulley of shell where the ledger is found. The reed whistle functions as micro-setting, shaping tactical choices (three notes chart wind truth, risk, and readiness). The watchers' spacing (five-six-five rhythm) acts as environmental pressure that forces interpretation. The final corridor of glare is a spatial constraint that charges the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: answering the watchers to resolve hunger and her mother's disappearance. Pressure coheres through pattern-reading (bleached limpets, tide knots, lattice of dots) and tightens when the protagonist decodes the ledger and the watchers respond by "altering their spacing." The corridor of glare narrows options to a stark choice: retreat or be measured. Cost is visible on the page—she understands her mother became "a unit of distance" and chooses the same fate. Agency is renunciation with eyes open.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: measuring, silence, the conversion of persons into distances. The ledger's "lattice of dots and swirls" and the watchers' spacing provide a non-literal answer to "What do you see when you look at us?"—not mercy, but calibration. The final image reweights prior material: the protagonist accepts becoming a measure, and the light "keeps ringing like a bell" charges the closure without moralizing. No thematic echo or prompt-like articulation mars the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single POV, stable distance. The perceptual signature is character-specific: "questions rot if kept," "the high note of the day, which is not mercy but obligation." Diction remains idiosyncratic and voice-motivated throughout ("sunwashed dread," "algae roofs," "bright with a pressure that bruises"). Purposeful compression ("turn back only if called") and pattern-taught elision (the expedition's fate revealed through objects, not exposition) pay off at closure. Minor slip: a few lines ("each arc a thread pulled from the seafloor of memory") edge toward stock lyricism but recover quickly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (image, world-rule, character motive). Rhythm varies purposefully: short declaratives during action ("I freeze"), longer accretions during reflection. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor ding: occasional figurative density in non-peak beats ("like sunflowers that prefer the shadow," "thinned into silence") slows momentum slightly, though the metaphors remain coherent and do not obscure causality. Closure beat is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—cartography as inheritance, silence as communication, persons as units of measurement—feels specific and non-obvious. The turtle-shell city, pattern languages, and watchers-as-measures cohere into a singular artistic stance. Risk-taking (lyric compression, the lattice revelation, the final step into glare) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The ending's inevitability is earned in hindsight by the protagonist's "quietly driven" trait and the ledger's grammar of crossing. No proximity to famous images or template plots.</comment>
