<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's internal contradiction—trained caution versus "the thrill of unknowns that become knowns"—is embodied in the weighing of risk and stewardship; the final decision to "widen perspectives responsibly" arises from that friction. Interiority is concrete ("odds stacked against grammar," "variance at the track") and voice-specific. Minor deduction: the father's character is largely reflective rather than pressuring choices on the page, though he functions effectively as motivational ground. No flat therapy-speak; emotional complexity lands with embodied thought.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the protagonist leaves with the theorem stub, waiting for the bus to tell her father "his system had finally done some good," and the line "I felt the odds change, mercifully and slowly" crystallizes a reweighted stance with conceptual cost (accepting his legacy, forgoing pure rejection). The lens reads Accumulative/Textural: details and motifs (lantern, subway scrawls, rain, Martingale) layer toward the final cadence shift. Orientation anchors arrive early (library at midsummer, post-heart-attack frame, narrator identity). Minor deduction: the subway-scrawl navigation mechanic is set up but its literal traversal in the library alcove feels slightly convenience-plotted rather than purely causal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The rainwashed library constrains and enables: the midsummer emptiness grants "freedom to pursue a puzzle," the alcove named Martingale houses the lantern, and the mica pane becomes the lens for seeing "each drop a discrete coin." Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("clover melancholy," "commas against the glass"). The body and recurring object (lantern) charge the final image. Minor deduction: spatial choreography of the archive traversal and the windowsill placement reads slightly abstract rather than sharply blocked.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—widening perspectives responsibly—is signaled early and tightens when the theorem stub offers both warning ("Practice risk as stewardship, not as theater") and template for the seminar. The narrator's agency is renunciation and endurance (accepting the father's legacy with revised framing), not a dramatic reversal. Pressure accumulates through reflection and motif layering rather than a single sharp turn, consistent with the Accumulative lens. Minor deduction: the tightening feels more lyric and cognitive than visceral; no moment of high-cost choice under immediate external pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: the candle lantern, subway scrawls, and theorem stub embody the tension between ruin and resilience, risk and stewardship. The final image—"the odds change, mercifully and slowly"—offers a non-literal, earned answer without moralizing. The lucid-contradiction motif is woven into structure and voice. Minor deduction: "Maybe the city itself… had written to all of us at once" edges toward thematic summary, though it remains imagistic enough to avoid heavy-handed intrusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: "odds stacked against grammar," "glacial paths," "commas against the glass." Voice modulates appropriately under emotional pressure. Diction matches the narrator's academic and personal history. Minor deduction: a few phrases ("sea anemone," "scrim of advice") feel slightly elevated for mid-beat moments, though they remain within lexicon; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; opening and closing lines anchor and resolve. Information density is high with few redundancies. Minor deductions: several lines loop conceptually ("lucid contradictions" appears three times with slightly varied phrasing; "Practice risk as stewardship, not as theater" and "widening perspectives responsibly" echo without advancing pressure). A few figurative images ("sea anemone," "scrim of advice") feel ornamental rather than propulsive in peak beats. No major scaffold or template cadence, but cumulative texture occasionally prioritizes lyricism over clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—compulsive gambler's daughter as probability professor reframing risk via archival discovery—is specific and non-obvious. The subway-scrawl navigation and mica-pane lens offer fresh inflections. The piece commits fully to its accumulative, lyric design. Minor deduction: the candle-lantern-as-relic and theorem-stub discovery edge toward convenient symbolic staging rather than inevitable emergence from prior causality; the overall arc, while emotionally authentic, follows a recognizable template of reconciliation-through-artifact.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Setup: present by paragraph 3. Development: her identity and training shape the interpretive lens and the decision to pursue the puzzle. Payoff: she decides to revise her curriculum and tell her father, foregrounding her dual inheritance. The character drives the traversal and the thematic reweighting. Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong; irreplaceability is high (swap "economist's daughter" and much collapses). Minus ~0.3 for late first full anchor (identity established reflectively rather than through immediate scene choice).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setup: exhibition case, paragraph 7. Development: recognized from father's stories, it anchors backstory. Payoff: reappears on the windowsill with the theorem stub inside; the mica pane becomes a lens ("each drop a discrete coin"). Two distinct beats with lyric reprise. Minor deduction: the lantern is handled and observed but does not constrain a middle choice under pressure; its primary function is symbolic anchor rather than tactical tool. Causal pressure moderate; closure linkage present but not indispensable (the theorem stub could exist without the lantern shell).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph 3 ("I am the compulsive gambler's probability professor daughter") and paragraph 10 ("Lucid contradictions are my compass"). Development: shapes the narrator's interpretive stance and her willingness to pursue "a puzzle that looked like prayer." Payoff: the theorem line "Practice risk as stewardship, not as theater" and the bus-scene exchange ("Only if you do not either") embody the concept at closure. The concept reweights the dominant stake and charges the ending. High irreplaceability; removing it dissolves thematic coherence. Minus ~0.2 for some label-only repetition mid-story that adds texture without fresh pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph 9 ("I was theoretically rebellious"). Development: mentioned but not enacted in a clear middle choice. Payoff: the seminar redesign and the decision to leave a card are modest rebellions, but the trait is more told than shown under pressure. Functional but replaceable; swap "theoretically cautious" with minor edits and the arc holds. Causal pressure weak; closure linkage present but oblique. Score reflects one-gate-plus-echo rather than multi-beat integration.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph 11 onward, the traversal of the stacks is framed as interpreting scrawls and following call numbers. Development: the action structures the middle section and mirrors "his betting slips." Payoff: the traversal delivers the lantern and theorem; the bus ride at the end extends the motif of traversal-as-interpretation. Strong causal pressure; the action is irreplaceable (swap "research" and much mechanical specificity is lost). High beat involvement and closure linkage. Minus ~0.2 for the alcove discovery feeling slightly convenience-plotted rather than purely motivated by scrawl logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph 12, the subway scrawls are introduced as "coordinates in a bookish code." Development: snapshots guide the library traversal to the Martingale alcove. Payoff: the method reappears on the bus ("incised arrows, wondering whom I would thank"), closing the frame. The method is signaled and its mechanics matter, but the library traversal itself is elliptical—how the scrawls map to call numbers is not dramatized. Functional across two beats; lyric reprise present. Causal pressure moderate; specificity moderate (the exact decoding is not shown, weakening irreplaceability). Score reflects two-gate integration with strong thematic echo but thin mechanical dramatization.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setup: opening line anchors place and season. Development: "midsummer emptiness granted me the freedom to pursue a puzzle"; the alcove named Martingale supplies the lantern and note. Payoff: the library windows recede "like numbered squares" as the bus pulls away, and "clover along the curb steamed" recharges the opening sensory motif. The setting pressures and enables choices; the rainstorm brackets the arc. High beat involvement, strong closure linkage, good irreplaceability (the library's archival logic is essential). Minus ~0.1 for spatial choreography of the alcove being slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph 2, "It was the first place I came after the heart attack." Development: the cardiologist's prognosis ("future a deck already cut") frames urgency. Payoff: the bus ride to the hospital closes the frame; the timeframe tightens the emotional stakes. The heart attack shapes motivation but does not impose a live ticking clock on the library traversal itself. Functional across setup and closure; causal pressure moderate (urgency is asserted more than dramatized through constrained time). Score reflects two-gate integration with thematic weight but no middle tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph 6, "to find a way to widen perspectives responsibly, mine first, then my students'." Development: the desire drives the archival search and frames the narrator's reading of the theorem stub. Payoff: "I wrote notes for my next seminar: let them traverse examples of ruin and resilience, let them test priors with empathy," and the decision to tell her father. The motivation is dramatized through choice and friction (inherited caution versus thrill). Strong causal pressure and closure linkage; high irreplaceability. Minus ~0.2 for the desire being stated reflectively in setup rather than tested under immediate external pressure mid-story.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Setup: opening line, "clover melancholy." Development: tone modulates with reflection and sensory detail ("commas against the glass," "grief smell green"). Payoff: "clover along the curb steamed in a way that made grief smell green" and "the odds change, mercifully and slowly" sustain the melancholic-but-hopeful register through closure. Coherent through turns; the tone charges the final image. Strong thematic and sensory linkage. Minus ~0.3 for tone being maintained more through assertion and motif than through pressure-driven modulation (no sharp tonal shift under peak stress).</comment>
