<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is consistently embodied through concrete imagery—"small stone star," "smudge," "margins"—and the choice to voice the lie aloud is earned by prior circling. The oracle's "peripherally aware" trait reads as genuine perceptual signature. Minimal deduction for the slightly over-articulated final reflections ("some certainties must sway forever") that flirt with theme-summary, though they remain anchored in the scene's metaphor system.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the protagonist names the lie aloud in the oracle's presence, and the final image—the folded gentian with its smudge-map—reweights the swallowed truth with undeniable cost (release of secrecy, acceptance of perpetual sway). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds cleanly: the gentian and smudge recur with escalating pressure, the scale and anemometer anchor ritual, and the storm's arrival on schedule charges the ending. Orientation is clear by paragraph two. One meaningful deepening (circling inward to name the lie) suffices for this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The weather station's galvanized rooms, barometer, anemometer, and lee platform constrain multiple choices: the oracle's timing ("prefers quiet when the wind tilts"), the outdoor ritual with the gentian, and the stance-widening exercise. The botanical illustration functions as micro-setting, handled across three beats and charged at closure. Snow and auroral coloring are filtered through the protagonist's grief-laden perception. Minor cap: the station's hum and specific tools could exert slightly more tactical pressure in the middle beats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding the weight of a swallowed truth to relieve internal calcification—is signaled early and tightens through the gentian-smudge ritual, the balance exercise, and the spoken confession. Agency is clear: the protagonist chooses to circle inward and name the lie, foreclosing evasion with visible cost (vocal exposure, acceptance of perpetual sway). The storm's scheduled arrival intensifies time pressure. One meaningful tightening (the protagonist's inward spiral to the lie's core) suffices for this length and the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—swaying certainties, the impossibility of absolving meaning through mass, the necessity of sharing truth—emerges organically from the gentian's smudge-line, the balance exercise, and the protagonist's spiral confession. The final image (folded gentian as compass) offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in the oracle's peripherally aware gaze and the protagonist's margins-occupying history. The piece avoids thematic echo; the oracle's lines about "swaying certainties" and "instruments most honest when barely within range" feel diegetic rather than thesis-signaling.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: lyric compression, metaphor-dense but voice-consistent ("auroral sorrow," "small stone star," "capillary sea"). Purposeful compression and patterned diction are taught early and sustained. The oracle's dialogue ("fault-tolerant oracle," "occupying margins") carries subtext and distinct idiom. Minor deduction: a few lines approach elevated register ("isobars," "fulcrum") that, while voice-plausible given the setting, slightly drift from the protagonist's established texture under peak emotional pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, figurative language is dense but mostly coherent, and information density is high. The smudge/gentian/margin motifs recur with purpose. Minor deductions: "swaying certainties" recurs as explicit phrase in two places, creating light paraphrase; "auroral sorrow" bookends but risks stock poeticism; a few lines ("I reach toward it without meaning to confess") carry slight filter-verb stack. The closure image is clean, but earlier beats carry faint template cadence in participial openers ("talking about," "occupying margins").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—weather station oracle, botanical illustration as ritual object, smudge-as-confession—feels specific and non-obvious. The "occupying margins" method and "peripherally aware" trait are fresh inflections on confession/absolution material. Risk-taking (lyric compression, accumulative structure) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Minor cap: the "swallowed truth as stone/seed" metaphor, while well-executed, echoes familiar concealment imagery; the piece transforms it through the smudge-line fulcrum but does not fully transcend the template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The fault-tolerant oracle is present early, makes the tea/gentian choice, leads the outdoor ritual, instructs the balance exercise, and witnesses the confession. Her "peripherally aware" gaze and refusal to break under imperfect data constrain the protagonist's approach (circling rather than direct confession). She shapes three distinct beats and the closure's ritual frame. Strong integration, though her final lines ("storm will arrive") feel slightly observational rather than choice-driven in the closure moment itself.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The botanical illustration appears early, is handled in three beats (laid out, taken outside, smudged by protagonist's sleeve and soot-line, held for the weight ritual, magnified under glass, folded and returned), and returns at closure as "compass of auroral sorrow." The smudge on the gentian is the protagonist's physical confession-mark, irreplaceable. Removal would collapse the ritual's tactile anchor and the final image's charge. Closure linkage, causal pressure, and irreplaceability all strong.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Swaying certainties" is introduced early via the oracle's line, structures the protagonist's acceptance (truths that "must sway forever"), and shapes the balance exercise ("widen stance until every force finds a path through"). The concept reweights the closure: release without resolution, perpetual motion rather than fixed absolution. It constrains the protagonist's hope for mass-based absolution and enables the margin-occupying method. Causal role across two beats and closure participation both present.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Peripherally aware" is attributed to the oracle twice and shapes her perceptual signature (noticing "everything except my apology," watching "where the tension leaves"). It constrains the protagonist's confession method (circling inward rather than direct statement) and enables the oracle's witness role without intrusive gaze. Present in setup and middle, with closure echo ("peripherally aware that release occurs"). Functional across beats, though the trait's mechanical impact on tactics is more atmospheric than decisive.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The smudge appears in four beats: protagonist's sleeve leaves "second gray comet" on gentian; oracle draws soot-line along stem as fulcrum; protagonist holds page while gentian "weighs as much as your secret"; smudge magnified as "continent split by capillary sea." The smudge is the protagonist's involuntary confession-mark and the oracle's diagnostic tool. It redefines the protagonist's relationship to the lie (externalized, mappable) and is irreplaceable. Closure linkage strong; the folded gentian's "smudge a map I read" charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Occupying margins" is seeded early (protagonist learned it "in school... in houses... in hospitals"), structures the confession method ("tell me the truth aloud, by occupying margins you have left empty, not the center"), and shapes the protagonist's circling approach ("I begin at the edge... circle inward"). The method is signaled, its mechanics demonstrated, and it alters the confession's path. Present across setup, middle instruction, and enacted in the climax. Solid integration, though the method's cost is more procedural than felt-on-the-body.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The mountain weather station is present early, supplies the barometer (repaired with mittened fingers), anemometer lee (ritual site), platform edge (balance test), glass for magnification, and battered scale. Setting constrains the oracle's timing ("prefers quiet when the wind tilts"), enables the outdoor gentian ritual despite weather, and the storm's arrival charges the ending. The station's "humming with auroral sorrow" and "faithful, battered, listening" frame the closure. Environment shapes three distinct beats and the final image's tone. Strong causal and atmospheric integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"After fever breaks" bookends the piece and frames the protagonist's post-crisis state (clarity without steadiness). The timeframe is signaled early and returns at closure ("After fever breaks, I had thought the world would steady"). The storm's evening arrival creates mild time pressure. The fever's breaking enables the hike and ritual but does not tighten decisions beat-by-beat. Functional lyric reprise with thematic charge, but the timeframe itself does not constrain tactics or alter the confession's pacing on the page.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The motivation—"to find the weight of a swallowed truth before it calcifies"—is stated early, dramatized through the protagonist's rattling "small stone star," and drives the gentian-weight ritual and the spoken confession. Desire conflicts with fear of finishing the dissolution ("the word would finish the work") and costs are visible (vocal exposure, acceptance that truth becomes lighter only when shared). The motivation shapes three beats and is repriced at closure (weight cannot absolve meaning). Strong causal and emotional integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>"Auroral sorrow" is present in the opening line, colors the protagonist's perception (rain-chart tea, frost-line veins, long cold ridge dawn), modulates with the storm's arrival ("mercy that hurts"), and charges the final image ("compass of auroral sorrow"). Tone is coherent through lyric compression and elegiac rhythm, intensifies with the confession ("silence kept time with machines"), and lands cleanly at closure without flattening. The tone constrains diction choices and inhabits the station's "humming" and the oracle's "smile without light." Exceptional integration.</comment>
