<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is consistently voice-specific ("faith had not been lost, only interrupted") and embodied choices appear in several beats (rebuilding the gnomon, returning objects). Internal contradiction surfaces in the tension between documenting and restoring, though the resolution toward tending feels earned by the walking-and-listening micro-choices. Secondary character Sami remains functional but one-note; his shovel-knot simile is vivid but he doesn't apply independent pressure. Motivation shifts organically from documentation to restoration to tending, with visible cost in the abandoned departure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural with lyric elision. Orientation anchors (catacomb orchard, diaspora returnee, excavation) land by the third paragraph. The piece accretes pressure through recurring images (interrupted journeys, the sundial, roots braiding bones) that tighten around the faith-restoration stake. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the narrator remains, tending trees and circling the stele—a renunciation of departure that forecloses the return abroad with visible cost in "my journey unbroken." The final orbit image reweights prior wandering motifs. One ambiguity: the flood that "swallowed the road" for the caravan guide feels like a late symbolic echo rather than a causal constraint on present action, slightly muddying whether the orchard's interruptions are historical metaphor or live pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is vividly anchored (tree roots braiding skulls, quince trees, trench shadows) and recurs across beats with escalating sensory detail (dew on sundial base, wind that smells of leaves and turned pages). Micro-setting constrains action: the sundial base provides a literal anchor for rebuilding, and root-bone tangles guide the re-placement of objects. Spatial choreography remains clear (trench, stele, orchard perimeter). The orchard functions as both literal dig site and charged symbolic field, with the final orbit around stele/sundial crystallizing the narrator's new relationship to place.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore lost faith) is signaled early and tightens through accumulative beats: hearing time hesitate, the sundial's missing gnomon, the guide's interrupted journey. One meaningful deepening occurs when rebuilding the gnomon aligns noon with "home" on the stele, causing "a hinge give way in my chest"—a felt internal shift. Agency is clear: the narrator chooses to rebuild, to return objects, and finally to stay and tend. Cost is visible in the forfeited departure and the shift from documenting to embodying the orchard's grammar. Escalation reads as textural density increase rather than causal collision, fitting the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme (interrupted journeys can be repaired through patient listening and embodied presence) emerges from concrete particulars: the tooth beside the heel, the gnomon returned to the sundial, the narrator's decision to tend rather than leave. The final image—circling the stele each evening—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the faith-restoration question without moralization. Subtext operates in gestures (Sami's nod, the elders' touch) and in the quiet shift from mapping to pruning. One thematic echo: "faith could be rebuilt not by arresting time but by walking with it" leans slightly toward articulation, but the surrounding images (shadows moving over the orchard, the sundial's faithfulness to motion) ground it sufficiently to avoid sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric-meditative with a distinct perceptual signature: metaphors of grammar, sentences, punctuation ("starlings circled like punctuation over sentences the earth kept revising"). POV remains stable first-person with consistent psychic distance. Sami's brief dialogue reads natural and goal-driven ("why I smiled at the dirt"), though his lines don't carry strong idiolect distinction from the narrator's—acceptable given his minor presence. Register drift appears in a few elevated phrases ("disquiet," "baroque cataloging implied in 'cataloged the bones'") that slightly exceed embodied thought under field-work pressure. Elision is purposeful (time jumps from noon to dusk, from excavation to tending) and pays off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout ("roots snake between bones," "faith…interrupted, like a traveler delayed by rain and invited to share tea," "orchard…a mouth"), creating textural richness but occasionally slowing momentum in mid-passage beats where causal links are already clear. A few paraphrase loops: "interrupted journeys announced themselves everywhere" followed immediately by examples, then later "faith had not been lost, only interrupted" restates the same idea. Template cadence in the final third: several sentences open with time markers or participial phrases in quick succession ("At dusk…," "Around us…," "We angled…," "The shadow kissed…"). No filter-verb stacks or major clarity breaks. Information density is strong when tied to objects (sundial base, gnomon, stele), but some lines do double metaphorical work without advancing situation. Overall: vivid and controlled, with minor momentum drag from figurative clustering.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The catacomb-orchard premise (excavation site as living library, bones and roots intertwined) is specific and non-obvious. The sundial-gnomon rebuild transforms a standard "lost faith restored" template into a concrete, embodied ritual with cost (the narrator stays, forfeiting the return). Emotional specificity in the "hinge give way in my chest" beat and the shift from documentation to tending avoids generic epiphany. One proximity concern: "home had become a rumor I replayed on airplanes, an ache that never quite cleared its throat" echoes diaspora-narrative phrasing seen in recent literary work. The final orbit image (circling the stele/sundial each evening) feels earned and particular, grounding theme in physical gesture.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setup: established first paragraph. Development: the returnee's choices (setting notes on the sundial base, deciding to rebuild the gnomon, returning objects to "repair interrupted journeys") drive mid-story beats. Closure: the decision to stay and tend rather than leave is the story's hinge, foregrounding diaspora-return tension throughout. Causal pressure: the returnee's dual stance (documenting vs. restoring) shapes tactics and the final renunciation. Cost: forfeited departure abroad with visible price ("arrivals I postponed until they forgot me" reweighted by "my journey unbroken"). All three gates present; strong beat involvement and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setup: introduced mid-first-third ("I set my field notes on a cracked stone ring, a sundial base"). Development: the missing gnomon is noted at noon, prompting the rebuild decision; the base "hummed under my notes like a throat wanting to sing." Closure: the rebuilt sundial with aligned shadow ("the shadow kissed the numeral for home") triggers the narrator's hinge moment and anchors the final orbit ritual. Causal pressure: the base's incompleteness (no gnomon) creates a concrete problem the narrator solves, and the alignment with the stele directly causes the internal shift. Cost: the effort and symbolic weight of repair. High irreplaceability: the sundial's temporal function (marking time, aligning with "home") is unique to this object. Three distinct beats (discovery, rebuild, final orbit) all tied to closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Setup: title phrase appears in opening and recurs throughout ("interrupted journeys announced themselves everywhere," the guide's flood-stopped path, the narrator's "stutter in the long sentence of the family line"). Development: the concept shapes tactics—returning objects "so the dead could finish saying what they meant," repairing rather than erasing. Closure: the narrator's decision to tend and circle the stele/sundial is framed as completing an interrupted journey, and the final line ("my journey unbroken") reprices prior wandering. Causal pressure: the interruption-repair frame motivates multiple choices. Specificity: the concept is lived through concrete actions (tooth placement, gnomon rebuild) rather than merely thematic. Strong closure linkage and beat involvement.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setup: "warmly curious" appears in the opening paragraph, describing the narrator's return stance. Development: the trait enables the narrator's openness to Sami ("warmly curious too") and to listening ("letting my feet listen more than my pen"). Closure: tending the trees and circling the orchard reflects sustained curiosity embodied as patient attention. Constraint: minimal—the trait permits rather than blocks, and no on-page moment shows curiosity incurring a visible cost or foreclosing an option. Mid-range: the attribute is consistent and aligns with choices, but "warmly curious" reads more as tonal flavor than a trait with friction. Present in two beats (opening, Sami encounter) with thematic echo at closure, but lacks the tradeoff or price that would elevate above functional.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Setup: the rebuild decision appears mid-story ("We decided to rebuild it"). Development: the rebuild (scavenging pomegranate rib, fitting it, aligning the face to the stele) occupies a sustained beat and is dramatized with concrete action. Closure: the rebuilt gnomon's shadow alignment ("the shadow kissed the numeral for home") directly triggers the narrator's internal hinge ("I felt a hinge give way in my chest") and anchors the final orbit ritual. Causal pressure: the rebuild enables the alignment that causes the faith-restoration shift. Cost: the effort and symbolic commitment. Irreplaceability: high—the rebuild is the story's physical turning point, and the sundial's restored function is central to closure. Strong closure linkage and beat involvement.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setup: "purposeful wandering" is introduced early ("I walked through purposeful wandering, mapping what did not want maps"). Development: the method is mentioned again near the end ("my plan was not a plan, only to keep walking through purposeful wandering until something answered"), but its mechanics remain abstract. Closure: the final orbit ("Each evening, I circled the stele and sundial") embodies the method as a daily ritual. Causal pressure: the wandering/listening stance enables openness to the sundial repair and object-return choices, but the link is more thematic than tactical—removing "purposeful wandering" and replacing it with "patient observation" would leave the plot intact. Mid-range: present in two beats (early and late) with thematic coherence, but the method is more descriptive label than operational constraint.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setup: "catacomb orchard where tree roots snake between bones" opens the story. Development: the setting supplies concrete resources (the sundial base, the trench, quince trees, roots braiding skulls) and constrains action (excavation reveals objects, root tangles guide placement). Closure: the orchard's spatial logic (stele, sundial, perimeter) anchors the final orbit, and the setting's dual nature (death/life, catacombs/orchard) charges the ending image ("the orchard speaking and my journey unbroken"). Causal pressure: the setting's physical features enable key actions (sundial rebuild, object return) and its symbolic layering reweights the closure. Irreplaceability: high—the catacomb-orchard fusion is the story's conceptual spine. Strong beat involvement (trench work, Sami encounter, tending) and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Setup: "Across excavating a tomb" signals the timeframe in the opening. Development: time markers appear (noon, dusk, dawn, final day), and the excavation's duration is implied but not quantified. Closure: "When the dig ended, I did not leave" marks the transition to tending. Pressure: time is more atmospheric than urgent—there's no live deadline forcing choices, and the pacing is leisurely (multiple days compressed without tension). The sundial's noon alignment is a temporal anchor, but it measures symbolic rather than plot time. Mid-range: the timeframe is legible and consistent, with purposeful elision, but it doesn't tighten decisions or constrain tactics. Present across beats but without the escalating clock that would reach higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Setup: "I came to restore lost faith in this ground" appears in the second paragraph. Development: the faith-loss is dramatized through concrete images (the missing gnomon, the guide's interrupted path, the narrator's postponed arrivals) and the restoration unfolds through physical acts (rebuild, object return). Closure: "My faith had not been lost, only interrupted" reprices the motivation, and the decision to stay and tend embodies the restoration with visible cost (forfeited departure). Friction: the tension between documentation (hired role) and restoration (personal need) drives choices and surfaces in "my pen" versus "my feet." Strong causal pressure and closure linkage; the motivation is both told and shown, with cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setup: "cautious enchantment" is named in the opening phrase and sustained through diction ("time hesitate like a held breath," "the sundial base hummed…like a throat wanting to sing"). Development: the tone modulates subtly—caution in the elders' muttering and the narrator's hesitance, enchantment in the sensory details and metaphors. Closure: the final image (circling the stele/sundial, the orchard speaking) leans into enchantment while retaining the carefulness of ritual repetition, charging the ending without breaking tonal coherence. The tone is consistent and purposeful, elevating from atmospheric to structural as it shapes the narrative voice. Strong integration across beats and ending; minor limitation is that tone is easier to sustain in lyric-reflective mode than to test under high-tempo pressure (which this piece avoids by design).</comment>
