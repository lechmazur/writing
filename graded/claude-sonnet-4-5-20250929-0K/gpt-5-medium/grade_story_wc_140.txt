<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's perceptual signature—"filters reality differently," seeing "texture of memories" rather than truth—is well embodied through concrete micro-choices: handling the poison label until "fingertips taste bitter," following gaps in sentences, layering overheard scraps. The widow confrontation shows contradictory impulses (offering the label as both gift and verdict) with visible cost. Minor deduction: the widow's trembling hand and whispered excuse feel slightly formulaic at the peak beat, and the narrator's erasure premise sometimes edges toward label-only interiority ("the certificate made it illegal for me to remember") without full dramatization of that constraint shaping a present choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story teaches its mosaic pattern early (dock wandering, fragment-gathering) and maintains coherent pressure as scraps layer toward confrontation. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the narrator places the label "like a small verdict" and walks away, crystallizing the widow's choice and his own nameless listener role with felt cost (he relinquishes claim to identity/justice). Orientation anchors (docks, containers, unnamed narrator) arrive within the first ~100 words. One meaningful deepening occurs when the poison-bottle label connects to the widow's inventory, narrowing the narrator's approach and reweighting prior wandering. Cost is legible in the final image: he remains erased, choosing testimony over reclamation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The container labyrinth is lived-in and purposeful: red/blue corridors guide the search, refrigerated-unit vents deliver the overheard clue, the label's storage under a foreman's magnet matters, and the final crate staging of the label charges the closure. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: "oily constellations," "corrugated walls," "bitter" taste on fingertips. The port's tidal rhythm recurs as both temporal anchor and thematic heartbeat. Micro-setting (the label, the crate, the vent) constrains choices and the ending image depends on the container stack where narrator and widow meet.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaiming erased identity or at least its texture—is signaled early and tightens when the poison label links to the widow's private warehouse. The narrator's agency is renunciation with visible cost: he offers evidence, lets her choose, and walks away still nameless, foreclosing justice but preserving his listener role. The mechanic's sideways look and the widow's throat-unbuttoning recognition are micro-reversals that narrow options. Pressure accumulates through overheard whispers, the label's discovery, and the tidal rhythm guiding the final approach. One meaningful tightening: the widow's arrival forces the confrontation the narrator has layered toward.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—erased histories, bureaucratic fiction, the cost of surviving one's own record—emerges organically from the narrator's dock-walking, fragment-gathering, and final refusal to force correction. The poison label and tidal refrain ("Across the rhythm of tides") recur with reweighted meaning: from navigation cue to metaphor for cyclical forgetting. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: he remains a listener, not a man with a name, because "erased histories keep speaking if I keep walking." No overt moralizing; subtext operates in the widow's trembling hand, the clerk's retreat, and the narrator's choice to "layer new stories over the old." The piece invites reflection on institutional erasure and complicity without stating a thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a lyric, textural voice: "eyes are sieves," "memories, coarse and fine like rope," "words slide into my pockets." Perceptual signature is consistent and character-specific: the narrator notices gaps, labels, and overheard scraps, filtering the port through erasure's lens. Dialogue is minimal but purposeful: the widow's whisper ("the bottle was never opened") carries subtext, and the narrator's reply ("the ocean kept my name") advances theme. Distance control is clean. Minor slip: occasional elevated diction ("palimpsest," "erased histories thrive here, crated and numbered") risks register drift, though it reads as voice-motivated rather than artifact. Free indirect moments are well-managed.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("salt and shuffled by cranes," "oily constellations," "silence with fingerprints"). Information density is high: nearly every line advances character, atmosphere, or the fragment-gathering plot. Minor deductions: a few near-paraphrase loops ("I filter reality differently" echoed as "the world sifts through me, and I filter reality differently again") and slight overwriting in the opening third where metaphor appears in most sentences without full payoff until later. The closure beat is clean. Syntax varies and propulsion is strong; no grammar errors or ambiguous references. The final image—"layering new stories over the old until morning"—recharges earlier motifs without overt statement.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The premise—survivor of a bureaucratic death certificate navigating the docks as an unofficial ghost—is fresh and the container-labyrinth setting is particular. The narrator's fragment-gathering method and the poison-label evidence layer into a synthesis that feels specific rather than template-driven. The ending's renunciation (walking away, leaving the widow to "inventory truth or keep the ledger balanced") avoids neat resolution and commits to the listener role. Tropes (wronged man, confrontation) are transformed through the erasure lens and tidal accumulation. One friction: the "death certificate error" setup is conceptually strong but leans slightly toward a familiar wronged-protagonist frame; the textural execution and refusal to claim justice elevate it beyond stock revenge.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The death-certificate-error survivor frames the entire narrative and drives key choices: gathering fragments to reconstruct what was erased, approaching the widow, offering the label, and walking away still nameless. The character's decisions alter tactics (following the import line, waiting for her car) and shape closure (renunciation of reclamation). Setup in opening lines, developed through fragment-layering, and central to the ending's Charged Poise. Highly integrated.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The poison-bottle label appears early (embedded under a foreman's magnet), is handled physically ("my fingertips taste bitter"), connects causally to the widow's inventory, and is placed "like a small verdict" in the closure beat. It drives the mechanic conversation, the narrator's return to the container stack, and the final confrontation. Present across setup, middle investigation, and ending. The label's skull-and-name detail is irreplaceable. Strong integration with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Erased histories shape the dominant stake (surviving bureaucratic erasure) and constrain tactics: the narrator cannot use his name, must gather fragments, and navigates a world that believes the certificate's fiction. The concept is dramatized on-page ("the certificate made it illegal for me to remember," guards forget him, the widow's fear) and pays off at closure when he chooses to remain erased. Present in setup, tactics, and ending image. Core to story logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Filters reality differently" is introduced early and embodied: the narrator sees "texture of memories" over truth, notices gaps and silences, and processes the widow's reaction distinctly ("the world sifts through me, and I filter reality differently again"). The trait enables his fragment-gathering and constrains social interaction (he moves "like a shadow"). It recurs at closure but is more thematic resonance than a visible tradeoff in the final beat. Strong setup and middle use; closure linkage is softer. Mid-high integration.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Layer" (steps, memories, scraps, stories) is the narrative's structural verb: the narrator layers overheard stories, steps over his internal map, and at the end the city "layers new stories over the old." The action is irreplaceable—it defines his method and the accumulative drive lens. Present in setup ("I layer them with other scraps"), drives middle beats (layering label with other evidence), and charges closure ("layering new stories over the old until morning"). Highly specific and essential.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Collecting fragments of overheard stories is signaled early ("the way stevedores gather spilled grain"), drives middle investigation (the cleaners' whisper about the widow, the mechanic's joke), and culminates in the narrator offering the label as gathered evidence. The method shapes his tactics and explains his port-wandering. Present across setup, multiple middle beats, and implicit in closure. Mechanics matter: he listens, rescues scraps, layers them. Strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The container labyrinth pressures every choice: it hides and reveals (vent whispers, foreman's magnet, import-line clue), provides the narrator's sleeping spot, and stages the final confrontation at the crate where the label points. The port's spatial logic (red/blue corridors, catwalks, stacks) is lived-in and purposeful. Micro-setting elements (vents, crates, corrugated walls) constrain action and charge the ending. Setup, development, and closure all depend on this exact setting. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Across the rhythm of tides" recurs as both temporal anchor and thematic refrain (appears three times, framing the search and final approach). Tides guide the narrator's movements and provide atmospheric pressure, but they do not impose a live deadline or narrow options in a concrete way. The timeframe is more lyric cadence than urgent clock. Setup and closure presence are strong; middle causal pressure is lighter. Solid integration but not indispensable to story logic.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The desire "to discover the texture of memories" is signaled early and dramatized through fragment-gathering, the bitter taste of the label, and the confrontation. The motivation conflicts with safety (approaching the widow risks exposure) and is tested at closure when he must choose between reclaiming identity and remaining a listener. The want versus cost friction is legible. Present in setup, drives middle actions, and frames the ending choice. Strong thematic integration; slightly softer causal grip than top-tier elements.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Nameless identity as tone—the narrator without a name, moving like a shadow, erased by paperwork—is coherent throughout and modulates under pressure: initially elegiac and observational, it sharpens at the widow confrontation ("recognition unbutton her throat"), then returns to the listener stance at closure. The tone charges the final image ("I am not a man with a name, only a listener"). Present in setup, intensifies at the turn, and is indispensable to the ending's resonance. High integration.</comment>
