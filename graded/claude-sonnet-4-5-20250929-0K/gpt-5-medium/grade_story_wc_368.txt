<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dye master's interiority is consistent and anchored in concrete sensory detail—the donor heart's "triple time" and observation of how stories "land on her sleeves the way ash lands on a hearthstone." The motivation to understand story magnetism drives several micro-choices (adjusting the wing, tracking sun trails, brewing indigo steam). However, the final stance crystallization feels more stated than embodied; the heart "slows to listen" and the narrator "feels the heart accept the appointment," but these moments lack contradictory impulses acting in scene. The widow and courier remain functional pressures rather than fully individuated characters with distinct knowledge states.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of luminous observation and postural adjustment, building pressure through recurring wing/light interactions toward the final understanding of "magnetism as posture." Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the narrator stands "where the colors are almost colors, nearly seen" with the donor heart "aligning like a compass," crystallizing the learned stance with felt cost (the appointment accepted, the responsibility shouldered). Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words (floating tea house, post-transplant dye master). One meaningful deepening occurs when the narrator tilts the wing to shift story flow from courier to widow, demonstrating the discovered principle. Cost is legible in the appointment's weight and the discipline required ("threading light through patience").</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The floating tea house constrains action throughout—the house "bobbed as if curtsying to their burdens" when customers arrive, ropes sing, the floorboards wobble. The blue morpho wing functions as micro-setting, its "iridescent caution" teaching the narrator how to position herself and others in the light. Sun trails tracked across the room create spatial choreography that directly shapes the narrator's technique of adjusting who receives stories. The final image anchors in the wing above the window and the sun's conspiracy, making setting essential to closure. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through the dye master's professional attention to light, color, and gradation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake clearly signaled: to learn why some people magnetize stories and whether the donor heart's "strange tug" is part of that craft. The narrative tightens meaningfully when the narrator tests understanding by adjusting the wing to shift story flow from courier to widow, demonstrating agency in experimenting with discovered principles. The widow moment creates visible risk—"borrowed tales can burn if you press them too hard"—prompting the protective brewing of indigo steam. Escalation follows Accumulative logic: observation → experiment → protection → systematic application ("tracking sun trails from dawn to dusk over the next week") → formal appointment. The cost is visible in the responsibility accepted and the discipline required, though the stakes remain more contemplative than urgent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the blue morpho wing's lesson: "a color can be true yet deceptive, flaring open only when the light arrives from a respectful angle." This iridescent caution becomes embodied in the narrator's learned posture—"magnetism was not greed but posture, a disciplined tilt...a way to stand near a story without stealing its shoes." The donor heart motif carries thematic weight, its "triple time" memory and eventual "slowing to listen" enacting the shift from grasping to receiving. The final image—standing "where the colors are almost colors, nearly seen"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. The piece resists tidy resolution; the child's request to "keep the stories safe" adds weight without explaining. Minor slip: "unspeaking mouths" in the final line edges toward overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable throughout with a distinct perceptual signature—the dye master's professional lens shapes every observation through color, light, texture, and gradient. Metaphors stay consistent with the craft vocabulary: "apron were magnetized iron," "dyes had always been quietly explosive," "stories rose from them like steam." The prose modulates appropriately between contemplative observation and active experiment. Distance control is clean with no head-hopping. Minor texture issue: some constructions drift slightly elevated ("valley-mist wonder," "lavender hush between storms") but remain within an artisan's plausible poetic register. The rhythmic control under pressure is strong, particularly in the widow sequence where syntax tightens to match rising concern.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information density is high; most sentences advance understanding of the magnetism principle through concrete action or sensory detail. Rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating during the widow experiment, breathing in reflective passages. However, several paraphrase loops appear: the concept of "magnetism as posture/tilt" is restated across multiple paragraphs without added pressure, and "quietly explosive" appears as both descriptor and callback without evolving function. Template cadence surfaces in the final third with repeated "I [verb]" constructions. Figurative language is mostly coherent but occasionally dense ("stories cling...as if my apron were magnetized iron" immediately followed by more metaphors). The "scattered sapphires" image is vivid but the beam-as-river extended metaphor requires careful tracking. No major clarity breaks, but the accumulation of these patterns prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of organ transplant, artisan craft, and story theory feels specific and non-obvious. The blue morpho wing as teaching instrument is fresh, its iridescent physics ("color can be true yet deceptive") grounding the abstract concept in material reality. The floating tea house and sun-tracking methodology create a memorable frame. However, the core insight—that receptivity requires careful positioning and restraint—echoes familiar wisdom traditions. The donor heart as literal vessel for another's listening skill borders on magical convenience but is held to its thematic purpose without convenient problem-solving. The piece commits fully to its premise and follows implications (teaching apprentices, becoming "a lighthouse of cups and cloth"). The risk in lyric compression and metaphor density mostly succeeds in heightening rather than obscuring stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The watchful dye master drives multiple key beats: returning to work with the central question, charting the room by sun trails, holding the wing over the light river, adjusting the wing to shift story flow from courier to widow, brewing protective indigo steam, testing the understanding systematically over a week, and accepting the child's appointment. The character's observational discipline and experimental method shape every turn. Present from opening, causally active throughout, and essential to closure—the final stance of standing "where the colors are almost colors" is the watchful practice embodied. The observation-then-adjustment pattern creates visible costs (risk to the widow, responsibility shouldered).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The blue morpho wing is handled in at least five distinct beats: salvaged from a ruin and placed on the worktable, teaching "iridescent caution" through its surface properties, held over the sun river to scatter light into "broken sapphires," adjusted to shift story magnetism from courier to widow, and mounted "on a nail above the window" where it conspires with the sun in the closing image. Its specific properties—scales whispering gradients, color flaring only at respectful angles—directly constrain the narrator's method. The wing's lesson becomes the story's operating principle. Removing this exact object would collapse both method and theme. Early signal, multiple beats, causal pressure, closure linkage, and high specificity all present.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Iridescent caution" shapes stakes and tactics throughout. Introduced via the wing's physics ("a color can be true yet deceptive, flaring open only when the light arrives from a respectful angle"), it becomes the operational principle: the dye master adjusts positioning to control story flow, brews "a cloth of indigo steam" that "drank the light and released it carefully," and learns that "magnetism was not greed but posture, a disciplined tilt." This caution alters on-page choices—protecting the widow from borrowed tales that "can burn," teaching apprentices "to weigh silence as carefully as pigment." The concept charges the closure image: standing where colors are "almost colors, nearly seen." Cost is visible in the restraint required and opportunities foreclosed by careful positioning.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Quietly explosive" appears early as a trait of the dye master's dyes ("always been quietly explosive, releasing their storms in fabric and tea") and recurs in the self-description as "a quietly explosive beacon only seen when noticed sideways." The attribute captures the tension between restraint and potency that drives the method. However, its constraint function is more thematic than tactical—it describes the achieved state rather than enabling or preventing specific actions with visible tradeoffs. The indigo steam brewing could be read as enacting this quality, but the connection isn't made explicit. Present in opening and closing, but the causal pressure is softer than other elements. Mid-band for purposeful recurrence without hard constraint.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Illuminate" drives the core method and appears in multiple beats: holding the wing over the sun river "to illuminate the grain," watching the beam scatter into broken sapphires that "painted [the courier's] scars with soft lightning," and the closing formulation where wing and sun "conspire to illuminate what nobody names." The action of selective illumination becomes the technique for managing story magnetism. The narrator's final stance—feeling "the donor heart aligning like a compass toward unspeaking mouths"—depends on this practiced illumination. Not easily swappable; the specific interplay of light, wing, and position is essential. Early signal, shapes middle experiments, charges closure. Minor deduction: the action is sometimes enacted, sometimes metaphorical, creating slight fuzziness.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Tracking sun trails" is introduced early ("I began to chart the room by tracking sun trails, moving stools and kettles to catch slow rays") and its mechanics matter throughout: creating the "sun river on the floorboards," positioning cups along it, adjusting the wing's angle to control light scatter, and conducting the week-long systematic test ("tracking sun trails from dawn to dusk"). The method enables the key discovery and differentiates this dye master's approach from generic observation. Present by first third, shapes the widow-protection beat, and extends into the apprentice teaching. The closing image of wing and sun conspiring depends on this established practice. Strong integration; minor deduction for the method sometimes blending into general light-work rather than remaining distinctly "tracking trails."</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The floating rock tea house provides atmospheric specificity and some pressure—it "rose and dipped on its moorings," "bobbed as if curtsying" when customers arrived, creating wobbling floorboards that the narrator must work around when tracking sun trails. The rope bridge customers cross and the paper windows through which light slides add texture. However, the "floating" aspect doesn't constrain tactics as sharply as possible; the story would function similarly in a fixed hilltop tea house with good light. The setting enables rather than pressures—it's well-suited to the work but not indispensable. Present throughout, coherent, but functionally replaceable with minor edits. Mid-band for atmospheric integration without hard constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "after receiving the donor heart" anchors the opening and motivates the central quest—the narrator returns to work "to learn why some people magnetize stories, and whether the strange tug inside my chest was part of that unseen craft." The donor heart recurs meaningfully: its "triple time" response to the courier, its "slowing to listen" as understanding grows, its final "aligning like a compass." However, "after receiving" creates a vague ongoing period rather than tight time pressure. The story spans weeks ("over the next week," customers arriving repeatedly) without urgency. The transplant history provides motive and the heart functions as a sensitive instrument, but the temporal frame doesn't tighten decisions. Mid-band for motivational setup without temporal pressure on tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The desire "to learn why some people magnetize stories" drives the entire narrative arc. Introduced in paragraph three as "a single motive," it shapes the systematic observation (tracking sun trails, watching customer interactions), the key experiment (adjusting the wing to test who attracts stories), the protective intervention (brewing indigo steam), and the week-long verification. The motivation faces friction—the risk of "borrowed tales that can burn," the discipline required for "iridescent caution," the weight of the child's appointment. The narrator's final understanding and acceptance of responsibility ("I promised as any watchful dye master must") show the desire fulfilled with visible cost (ongoing duty, restraint required). Early signal, drives multiple beats, closure pays it off. Minor deduction: the desire itself never conflicts with other wants; it proceeds linearly to understanding.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Valley-mist wonder" establishes tone early ("faces fog-soft," "breathing valley-mist wonder") and modulates appropriately—contemplative during observation, slightly tense when the widow's risk emerges ("the room held its breath"), returning to quieter wonder in the closing image. The tone supports the accumulative/textural lens and charges the final moment of standing "where the colors are almost colors." Coherent throughout without static monotony. However, the tone is more atmospheric backdrop than active pressure; it enriches without fundamentally altering stakes. The "lavender hush," "broken sapphires," and similar constructions maintain the misty, luminous register. Good integration with purposeful modulation, but the tone serves rather than drives. Upper-mid band for coherence and closure linkage without hard constraint on choices.</comment>
