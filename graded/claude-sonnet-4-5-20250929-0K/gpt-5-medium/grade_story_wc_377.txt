<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Iri's silent stance is character-particular and her renunciation of the Archive Keepers' demand is dramatized through gesture and the sculptures' reply. Internal contradiction appears (guarding wonder versus fearing truth would harden) but remains abstracted rather than embodied in micro-choices under peak pressure. The Keepers' transformation—one weeping, another withdrawing his hand—reads as earned, yet their initial motives remain gestural. The final choice forecloses the path of lending the shard with visible cost (trembling from restrained force), meeting baseline requirements without deep embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who (Iri) and where (bluff above clouds) within the opening lines; when ("after words become unnecessary") is conceptual but legible. The piece reads under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through the Keepers' arrival, the shard's activation, and their departure without the fragment. Closure is Earned Stasis—Iri refuses the request, preserving wonder at the cost of withholding a document the Keepers fear losing. The cost is visible: her gloved fingers tremble, and the Keepers leave "carrying no shard, only a new slowness." One meaningful tightening (the confrontation and the sculptures' reply) sufficiently narrows options under the chosen lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The bluff, clouds, and iceberg fragment constrain Iri's method and charge the closure: the shard's angle catches sun, triggering the harmonies that persuade the Keepers. Micro-setting (sculptures, bells, the fragment cradled in ropes) is tactile and purpose-driven. Sensory hierarchy reflects Iri's priorities (graphite chalk, mallet, ledger marks). Spatial choreography is coherent: Keepers step among frames, Iri nudges the shard, light pours through. The environment forecloses the option of portability—this truth-telling cannot be archived—qualifying the setting for high-band entry.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible: Iri must preserve wonder against the Keepers' archival claim. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens: the Keepers' arrival, their request, the sculptures' reply, and Iri's refusal form a single tightening that forecloses lending the shard. The cost is visible (trembling, the Keepers' new slowness) and the protagonist's stance crystallizes on the page. Agency is renunciation with felt cost. No reversals are required under this lens; the deepening suffices. One persistent constraint (the shard's irreplaceability) shapes the final image, lifting the score within band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the contest between ledgers (hardened truth) and wonder (truth as weather). The iceberg fragment and kinetic sculptures embody the theme without stating it. The Keepers' transformation—tears "looked like learning," one declining to reach—demonstrates earned insight from particulars. The final image ("tuned the day the way some water tunes stone") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture, silence, and the sculptures' reply. The piece resists tidy resolution: the Keepers leave changed but not converted, and Iri's vigil continues with its cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited focalization is stable; perceptual signature is consistent (bells, weather, gesture over speech). Diction is lyric and purposeful ("furled clouds," "chill changed attack"), though the register occasionally elevates beyond strict character idiom ("museum shine," "restrained force of guarding delight"). Iri's seasonal muteness constrains voice without leaking into other characters. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are waived. Filter verbs are sparse and voice-motivated. The prose reflects the focalizer's stance (a bell tuner's attention to sound, resonance, tuning) without head-hopping. Lyric compression is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("furled clouds," "sleeping throat"). Overwriting clusters in non-peak beats: "unclasped and clasped her voice like a careful hand" and "colorless as sleep" approach purple without breaking clarity. Two near-paraphrases in the opening third ("silence did not wound her; it tuned her" then "her method was precise and simple") create minor drag. Information density is high in the Keepers' arrival and shard-activation beats. No loops touch the closure unit, capping deductions at −0.4. Metaphors occasionally stack ("starlight," "rang her bones," "canal") but remain legible. Grammar and tense are clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of bell tuner, seasonal muteness, and iceberg-as-truth-document is specific and non-obvious. The contest between archival permanence and ephemeral wonder transforms a familiar preservation trope through Iri's kinetic sculptures and the shard's irreplaceability. Emotional specificity (trembling from guarding delight, tears "looked like learning") avoids generic templates. The lyric frame is committed and coherent. Risk-taking in the compressed, poetic register heightens stakes without obscuring closure. No close echoes of famous lines detected. The premise feels inevitable in hindsight, justifying entry into the 7+ band with modest elevation for bold structural choices.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Iri's choices create key turns: she watches the Keepers' posture, salts bell lips, nudges the shard into angle, and refuses the request through silence and gesture. Present in setup (first paragraph), middle (activating the sculptures), and ending (cradling the shard, tuning the day). Her agency drives the closure (Earned Stasis). Two distinct beats (activation, refusal). Causal pressure: her stance narrows the Keepers' options. Closure linkage: her final vigil crystallizes the cost. Irreplaceability high: no other character could serve this role. Early signal, beat involvement, causal pressure, and closure linkage all present.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The iceberg fragment appears in setup ("Among them shone an iceberg fragment"), middle (Iri nudges it to catch sun, triggering harmonies), and ending (cradled in ropes, humming). Handled in two distinct beats: activation and night vigil. Its unique property (polar patience, transparency when lit) matters: only this shard produces the truth-symphonies that persuade the Keepers. Closure linkage strong: the shard's irreplaceability underpins Iri's refusal. Causal pressure: its activation narrows the Keepers' claim. Specificity/irreplaceability high. Cost connection: guarding it imposes trembling restraint. Three gates met; causal work across two beats; closure active.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Symphonies of truth" frames the concept in the opening third and is dramatized when the sculptures answer the Keepers with "transparent harmonies" that reveal "memory of first reading and last forgetting." The concept constrains tactics: Iri must activate the shard to reply. Closure linkage indirect but present: the concept underpins the refusal (the shard cannot be filed because truth must remain wonder, not document). Two beats: setup and activation. Causal pressure modest: the concept shapes Iri's method but does not itself narrow options; the shard's physicality does that work. Swappability moderate: "truth" could be "meaning" or "beauty" with minor rewrites. Early signal, two beats, closure participation via theme. Mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Seasonal muteness is established in setup ("seasonally mute, springing into speechless clarity when winter held the ridge") and constrains Iri's response: she cannot speak to the Keepers, forcing gesture and sculpture-activation. Present in middle (silence carries, she gestures) and ending (no speech, only tuning). One key turn: the constraint makes the sculptures necessary. Causal pressure: muteness narrows her communicative options with visible cost (she must rely on resonance). Closure linkage: her silence frames the final vigil. Irreplaceability moderate: a vow of silence could substitute. Two gates met; one beat constrained; cost visible. Mid-band for trait integration.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Glisten" appears when the shard "glisten[s] like a trapped breath" at setup and again when "light poured through and shattered into slow rain" during activation. The action is essential to the middle turn: without the shard glistening/light-scattering, the harmonies do not occur and the Keepers are not persuaded. Closure linkage indirect: the action's result (Keepers' transformation) underpins Iri's refusal. Two beats: setup and activation. Causal pressure moderate: the action enables the key turn but does not itself narrow options—the shard's angle and sun do. Swappability low: "glistening" is the exact mechanism. Early signal, one key turn enabled, closure connected. Mid-band for action.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Through kinetic sculpture" is signaled in setup ("Her method was precise and simple: through kinetic sculpture that swiveled, leaned, and breathed the wind") and employed in middle (Iri nudges the shard, the sculptures answer with harmonies). The method constrains Iri's reply to the Keepers: she cannot write or speak, only tune and position. Present in ending (sculptures moved as moonlight walked their joints). Two beats: activation and night. Causal pressure: the method narrows communicative options. Closure linkage: the sculptures' ongoing presence frames the vigil. Irreplaceability high: no other method fits the mute premise. Three gates met; two beats; causal constraint; closure active.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The "whispering bluff above the clouds" is established in the opening line and provides isolation that makes pilgrims climb (middle: "a caravan of Archive Keepers climbed the path"). The height and remoteness constrain access and frame Iri's guardianship. Present in ending ("the ridge returned [the bow] in kind," "Iri watched them vanish into cloud"). Two beats: arrival and departure. Causal pressure modest: the setting shapes who arrives but does not alter Iri's tactics. Closure linkage: the bluff's isolation underpins the vigil's loneliness. Micro-setting (sculptures, shard) does more tactical work than the macro-geography. Three gates met; beat involvement; closure present. Mid-to-upper band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"After words become unnecessary" is declared in the opening but functions as premise/era rather than a live clock. The timeframe justifies Iri's seasonal muteness and the Keepers' fear (without ledgers, truth dissolves). It does not tighten decisions or track elapsed pressure. Present in setup and thematically throughout, but no countdown or urgency tied to time itself. One beat: setup as frame. Closure linkage thematic only (Iri continues her vigil in this era). No causal constraint from time passage. Swappability moderate: "in an age of silence" would serve similarly. Setup met; no middle tightening; closure indirect. Lower mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"To preserve the color of wonder" is dramatized in Iri's refusal: she trembles "from the restrained force of guarding delight" and denies the Keepers the shard to prevent truth from hardening. Present in setup (implicit in her role), middle (she positions the shard to show wonder, not just document), and ending (she watches them leave and tunes the day). Motivation constrains the key choice (refusal) with visible cost (trembling, isolation). Two beats: activation and refusal. Causal pressure: the desire narrows her to one option (guard the shard). Closure linkage strong: final vigil embodies the motivation. Friction: the motivation competes with the Keepers' fear, but Iri's side wins without visible internal conflict beyond the trembling. Three gates; two beats; cost visible; closure active. Upper mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Muted vigor" coheres through the piece: Iri's silence carries force; the sculptures breathe and answer without shouting; the Keepers' tears are "so light" yet transformative; the final image is quiet vigilance. Tone modulates under pressure: the Keepers' arrival brings dry rustling tension, the activation moment intensifies ("light poured," "transparent harmonies"), the ending exhales into stillness. The tone charges the final image: "tuned the day the way some water tunes stone" exemplifies muted vigor. Present in setup, middle, and ending. Irreplaceability high: a louder or more declarative tone would break the premise. Three gates met; tone shapes all beats and the closure. Upper band.</comment>
