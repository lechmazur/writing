<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is declared but not tested through embodied contradiction; her "cautious exuberance" is told rather than shown via competing impulses in scene. Jun receives trait labels ("whimsically attentive") without behavioral specificity that would distinguish him from generic librarian types. The granddaughter's arrival and speech are summarized rather than dramatized, flattening what could be a pivotal emotional beat. No micro-choices under pressure force visible tradeoffs that would demonstrate character hierarchy of values.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative lens: layers of names, gestures, and harbor-music metaphors build toward a community ledger that reweights earlier isolation. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the exchange of ledger key and bookmark crystallizes shared custodianship, and the promise to "keep listening" reconfigures the opening silence with undeniable social cost (public accountability now replaces secrecy). However, orientation anchors drift—"breezy library under stars" and "colonnaded roof" compete without settling spatial logic by ~120 words, and the symphony-to-library transition compresses cause/effect linkage. Cost is legible but primarily conceptual; no on-page forfeiture or tactical narrowing sharpens the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The "breezy library under stars" with "lamps sway and gulls gossip" offers vivid sensory texture, but spatial choreography remains vague—colonnaded roof, circulation desk, display cart, and roof rehearsals never cohere into a navigable layout. The locket photo and ledger function as micro-setting objects that charge the final image, meeting the 9+ gate in principle. Sensory hierarchy is uneven: wind and gulls recur as ambient detail without filtering through Mara's professional or emotional priorities. Occupational detail (manifests, pier logs, demurrage) appears but does not constrain a choice or alter tactics on the page.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uplift silent contributors—is signaled early and sustained, but pressure remains diffuse: no live antagonist, time constraint, or resource scarcity forces a tradeoff. The mistaken-address envelope initiates the friendship and trace, but this complication does not narrow options or raise cost; Mara and Jun proceed without impediment. One meaningful deepening occurs when they "learn the man in the photo taught children to tune by ear," reweighting the locket from artifact to emblem, yet the granddaughter's arrival and public gathering unfold without on-page resistance or visible price. Agency at closure reads as mutual promise rather than decision under duress.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The "cycles of compassion" theme emerges through concrete particulars—borrowed practice rooms, waived fees, returned coats—and the final image of the ledger and bookmark exchange offers a resonant, non-literal answer to how kindness recurs without moralizing. However, the phrase "cycles of compassion" is stated twice on the page, edging toward Thematic Echo; this lowers what would otherwise be a clean 7.2–7.4. The locket as emblem and the harbor-music metaphor carry subtext, but "quiet debts remembered and quiet thanks returned" flirts with abstraction. No false equivalence or tidy moral; complexity arises from the interweaving of economic and emotional debts.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited via Mara, with clean focalization and no head-hopping. Voice carries a lyric register—"tide-smile," "pages breathe calmer when trumpets are sleeping," "the dark seems alphabetized kindly"—that is consistent and purpose-driven, though the diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("repaired attention," "recurs") that sits at the edge of Mara's plausible lexicon as a cargo broker. Dialogue is minimal and functional; Jun's lines are generic and interchangeable with Mara's internal idiom, missing the distinct speech rhythm required for voice distinction. Perceptual signature is present (harbor metaphors) but not character-particular enough to read as Mara's unique noticing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language is purposeful ("envelope... its paper fibers snapping open like sails," "sky holds its breath"), but template cadence recurs in the middle third: "They decide to trace," "They learn the man," "They send a letter," "Mara asks her to speak." This stem repetition creates a list-like momentum drag, triggering −0.4. Paraphrase loops appear: "recognition can be risky, but secrecy has taxed the town's spirit" and "this is a ledger of harbor music" both restate the uplift motive without added pressure. "Cautious exuberance" is asserted twice without embodied variance. High information density in the opening and closing partially offsets mid-section scaffolding, but the accumulation of minor artifacts caps high-band entry.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The mistaken-address envelope as inciting catalyst and the harbor-ledger frame offer a fresh synthesis of community memory and occupational setting. Specificity—demurrage forgiveness, violin resin used to fix splinters, tuning by cupped hands—grounds the premise in verifiable detail. However, the "silent contributors uplift" arc follows a recognizable mutual-aid template without a non-obvious moral calculus or structural risk; the story proceeds without meaningful impediment or tradeoff. The locket-photo emblem and the final bookmark/key exchange feel earned in hindsight, but the accumulative design does not transform the underlying template enough to reach high originality bands.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mara is present throughout and drives the ledger initiation and the search for Hideo Arai's name, meeting setup and development gates. Her "shrewd" attribute is labeled but not demonstrated through tactical negotiation or a high-stakes broker decision; she operates more as a facilitator than a character whose shrewdness narrows options. She speaks at the gathering and forgives demurrage for a choir, but these beats do not hinge on her broker skills specifically. Closure linkage is present (she presses the ledger key into Jun's palm), but the choice feels cooperative rather than a hard-won trade-off tied to her professional identity. Cap at ~6.0 for two gates plus closure mention, then apply −0.8 for label-only trait use and swappability (another community organizer could perform the same beats with minor edits).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The locket photo is handled in multiple beats: discovered in the envelope, identified as showing a dockworker and child, displayed on the desk as an emblem, and hung beside names at the gathering. It reweights from mystery artifact to community symbol. Setup occurs early (envelope arrival), development includes Mara recognizing "the hands" and Jun curating the display, and payoff arrives when the granddaughter hangs it beside names and "the gulls fall quiet as if reading aloud." Causal pressure is moderate—it does not narrow options but it does enable the trace and charge the final gathering. Specificity is strong ("worn brass blinking like a moon"). Score reflects three gates, two beats, and closure linkage, but the object does not impose a cost or constraint that would push it above mid-7s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The "cycles of compassion" concept is named twice on the page ("It sounds like cycles of compassion to Jun," "Jun watches cycles of compassion unfurl") and illustrated through borrowed practice rooms, waived fees, and returned coats. Setup is early (Mara's motive), development includes the captain story and choir demurrage forgiveness, and payoff is the promise to "keep listening, so the harbor's music recurs, and kindness circles back like returning tide." However, the concept operates more as theme than as a mechanical constraint that changes tactics or options; characters enact kindness without friction or competing cost. The concept does not force a tradeoff or reshape the ledger's method. Score reflects two gates plus thematic closure linkage, minus −0.6 for label-only claim and swappability (another community-building concept could serve the same role).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Jun's "whimsically attentive" trait is labeled in the opening ("whimsically attentive, the kind who bookmarks winds and straightens the horizon line") and recurs once ("Jun, whimsically attentive, aligns maps with the night breeze"). Setup is present, but the trait is not dramatized through a choice that carries cost or alters tactics; it reads as flavor text rather than a constraint. Development is absent—no middle beat shows the trait enabling or complicating an action. Closure mention is indirect (his fingers "tap a rhythm nobody learned but everyone recognizes"), which gestures toward the trait but does not hinge on it. Cap at ~4.6 for missing development gate, then add +0.2 for early signal and lyric reprise, yielding 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Initiate" appears twice: "Together they initiate a Harbor Ledger" and "tomorrow she will initiate discounts for crews who mentor." Setup and development merge—the ledger initiation is the key turn that enables all subsequent action (signatures, granddaughter's arrival, public gathering). The action is specific and causally active, but it does not impose a constraint or cost; once initiated, the ledger proceeds without impediment. Closure linkage is strong (the ledger is open to signatures at the gathering, and Mara presses the key into Jun's palm). However, the action could be replaced with "create," "establish," or "launch" without altering story logic. Score reflects three gates and strong closure linkage, minus −0.6 for swappability and lack of tactical cost, yielding mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The "friendship kindled by envelope with mistaken address" is present at setup (envelope arrives with Mara's surname where Jun's should be), drives the middle trace (they decide to trace the locket's story together), and shapes the closure (bookmark and ledger-key exchange as friendship tokens). The method is specific and irreplaceable—no other mechanism links Mara and Jun. However, the addressing error is resolved immediately ("He spots the addressing error and smiles"); the mistake does not complicate or impose cost, serving only as a meet-cute device. The friendship enables the ledger but does not constrain tactics or force a tradeoff. Score reflects three gates and strong causal linkage, minus −0.4 for low friction and lack of cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The "breezy library under stars" is signaled early ("colonnaded roof where lamps sway and gulls gossip") and recurs at closure ("The breezy library under stars hums with repaired attention"). It provides atmosphere and hosts the circulation desk, display cart, and roof rehearsals, but it does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome. Spatial logic remains vague (how does a colonnaded roof under stars also have a circulation desk?), and the setting functions as backdrop rather than tactical terrain. The final reprise reweights meaning (the library becomes a place of "repaired attention"), meeting lyric-resonance criteria for ~5.5–6.3. Score reflects two gates (setup and closure reprise) plus thematic charge, minus −0.3 for ornamental middle use and spatial incoherence.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"After the symphony ends" bookends the piece (opening line and repeated at the gathering), signaling a specific temporal window. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions—Mara and Jun work "by midnight" without urgency, and the chosen-night gathering occurs "next week" with no live clock. Development is absent; the timeframe does not alter tactics in the middle. Closure reprise is present but the time does not charge the final image with pressure or cost. Cap at ~4.6 for missing development gate, then apply −0.3 for vague tracking (no elapsed-time consequence), yielding 4.3.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Mara's motivation "to uplift silent contributors" is established early ("She came tonight to draft a ledger to uplift silent contributors") and sustained through the search for Hideo Arai's name, the gathering, and the promise to publish quiet names. Development includes her memory of the waived fee and her decision to forgive demurrage, showing the motive in action. Closure linkage is strong (she speaks about the project and presses the ledger key into Jun's palm as shared custodianship). However, the motive is not conflicted—no cost or competing want tests her commitment; she proceeds without friction. Score reflects three gates and strong causal linkage, minus −0.5 for lack of dramatized friction or tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Cautious exuberance" is named twice ("A cautious exuberance thrums in her" and "Mara's cautious exuberance steadies") but not embodied through contradictory impulses or tonal modulation under pressure. Setup is present, but the tone remains static—no scene shows the caution and exuberance pulling against each other. Closure mentions the tone steadying, which gestures toward resolution, but the shift is asserted rather than felt through syntax, rhythm, or imagery. The piece maintains a lyric, optimistic register throughout without tonal variance. Score reflects two gates (setup and closure mention) plus mild thematic linkage, minus −0.8 for label-only use and lack of tonal modulation.</comment>
