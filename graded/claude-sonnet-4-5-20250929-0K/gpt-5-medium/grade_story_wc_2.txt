<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The tinkerer's journey from "chasing exactness" to embracing "fidelity to the living irregular beat" is earned through concrete on-page choices—following the compass, timing the waterfall's rhythm, assembling the water clock. Internal contradiction appears in "uncertainly certain" and the tension between planning and improvisation, with embodied choices (counting spray beats, cleaning the hearth) that reflect character-particular perception. The final stance—building "a harbor where improvisations could anchor"—forecloses the rigid approach with visible cost (the burned workshop, the acceptance of uncertainty). Minor penalty for occasional abstraction ("befriend uncertainty") that edges toward label-speak, but the arc remains grounded in tactile problem-solving.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural, shifting from fragmented search to immersive discovery to integration. Orientation anchors by line 3 (workshop ruins, city context). The piece moves through discrete pressure beats—finding the compass, following it, entering the greenhouse, descending, reading the journal, building the water clock—each adding density and reweighting the dominant stake (how to repair time/clocks after failure). Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image crystallizes a new stance ("hours that refuse cages") with conceptual cost (abandoning precision for flow). The lyric mode teaches its pattern early and pays off at closure. One persistent constraint (the waterfall's rhythm) shapes the climactic act. Cost is legible in the renunciation of the old method and the commitment to "improvise."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The subterranean waterfall functions as micro-setting that constrains the protagonist's final choice: its rhythm becomes the teaching mechanism ("kept time with a kindness brutal enough") and the literal model for the water clock. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—"spray glittered on limestone arches and gears," "room carved by persistence, cavern walls polished like watch faces"—filtering through the tinkerer's lens. The greenhouse, compass, and waterfall anchor spatial progression with coherent choreography. The environment charges the closure: "each droplet struck a spoon, each spoon nudged a gear" demonstrates that setting mechanics shaped the final artifact and stance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: how to repair/rebuild after failure. Escalation under Accumulative lens occurs through density increase—each discovery (compass, greenhouse, stairs, waterfall, journal, hearth token, key) reweights the approach until the water-clock assembly crystallizes a new method. Agency is clear: the protagonist chooses to follow the compass, study the spray's rhythm, read the journal, and build the clock. The cost is legible: abandoning the old workshop's precision and accepting "traveling without certainty." One meaningful tightening: the waterfall's rhythm forces adaptation ("I could not plan for water, so I did what brass teaches: improvise"). No requirement for multiple reversals under this lens; the single deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: the contrast between rigid precision and adaptive flow, crystallized in "When coincidence becomes pattern, trust the irregularity to guide you." The compass, waterfall, and water clock function as concrete motifs that constrain choice and charge the closure without overt symbolism. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—"keep hours that refuse cages"—that reweights prior material (the burned workshop, the failed clocks) without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the admiral's deliberate loss of the compass and the journal's prepared message, implying a lineage of seekers. The piece resists tidy resolution: the new workshop is "a harbor," not a solution, and the final stance accepts ongoing uncertainty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable single-focalization with a distinct perceptual signature: the tinkerer's lens filters all detail through craft metaphor ("descended as if reading a stubborn watch spring," "what brass teaches"). Diction is consistently lyric and compressed—"memory glinted," "needle pointed down the alley," "floor hatch breathed dust"—without head-hopping. Compression is pattern-taught and legible. Psychic distance remains controlled. Minor penalty: occasional elevated register ("choreography of adapting steps calibrated to unpredictably constant forces") edges toward abstraction, slightly exceeding the established idiom during high-texture moments, but voice coherence holds through closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully with short beats during search and longer, immersive lines in the waterfall chamber. Information density is high: most sentences advance discovery, setting, or theme. Clarity remains strong despite compression. Minor penalties: "stubborn watch spring" and "the compass rose bloomed with miniature constellations, each point folding like an eyelid" mix vehicle logic slightly; "journey" and "heart" metaphors recur across several lines without full differentiation. Template cadence appears briefly in mid-section transitions ("I [verb]" stems in lines 9–12). These artifacts are non-closure and contained, triggering −0.6 total within Q7. No filter-verb stacks or paraphrase loops. Final line propels cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of tinkerer, lost compass, and subterranean waterfall as teaching mechanism feels specific and non-obvious. The transformation of clock-repair from precision to flow-based improvisation offers a fresh angle on craft-and-failure narratives. Particulars—sextants melted into compass, waterfall rhythm as timekeeper, droplet-spoon-gear assembly—anchor originality in concrete detail rather than quirk. The piece commits fully to its lyric-accumulative premise and follows implications without retreat. Risk-taking in compression and metaphoric density heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Minor penalty: the "admiral shipwrecked inland by drought" backstory edges toward convenient mythos, but the earned use of the compass and journal transforms it into functional lore.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The broken-clock tinkerer is setup in line 1, drives middle choices (following compass, timing spray, reading journal), and executes the closure act (building water clock, deciding new workshop ethos). Choices create key turns: deciding to follow (line 8), studying rhythm (line 21), assembling clock (line 29). Causal pressure throughout. Closure participation direct. Irreplaceable: the craft lens filters all perception and stakes.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The compass rose is setup in line 4, used in lines 5–8 (pointing, tugging, guiding route), reappears in lines 11–12 (pointing through hatch), line 18 (pointing to plunge, relaxing to signal timing), line 17 (blooming constellations), line 26 (sitting with), and line 32 (future repairs). Constrains tactics (following route, timing entry), charges closure (learning to listen, future navigation). Specificity high: "pointing not north but towards sounds," mechanics matter. Cost: protagonist must trust irregularity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Beneath the ashes" shapes setup (line 3: sweeping flakes, finding compass "hidden beneath the ashes near the shattered bench") and returns in line 27 (finding brass key "beneath the ashes" in the hearth). Stakes depend on recovery from destruction. Tactics involve literal and metaphoric excavation. Closure linkage: the new workshop will not rebuild the old but "breathe." Cost: abandoning what was burned. Two-gate presence (setup, closure motif) with causal middle work (descent follows the find). Swappability low: the fire and recovery anchor the need for transformation.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Uncertainly certain" is introduced in line 6, returns in lines 7 and 31, and defines the closing stance (line 36). Constrains action: the protagonist follows despite doubt, improvises rather than plans. Cost visible: accepting uncertainty means forsaking the precision that defined prior work. Causal pressure: this trait enables the choice to follow the compass and later to build without timing. Two beats (initial follow, final stance). Moderate irreplaceability; could be rephrased but the specific oxymoron charges the theme. Closure participation clear.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Improvise" is setup in line 20 ("I did what brass teaches: improvise with patience"), drives the water-clock assembly (line 29: "I timed nothing, but watched everything"), and defines the closing ethos (line 34: "improvise with water, leaflight, and the admiral's lost compass rose"). Major turns trace to this action: studying spray rhythm, building clock, deciding workshop stance. Narrows options: planning is rejected. Cost: forsaking exactness. Irreplaceable: the method is the transformation. Closure direct.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Through the swirling leaves in a neglected greenhouse" is setup in line 10, used once as the entry route, and referenced again in line 33 as the exit point ("The greenhouse received me with a sigh"). Mechanics matter for access but do not recur in middle beats or constrain tactics beyond initial entry. Closure participation weak: the greenhouse is left behind, not reweighted. Lyric reprise (line 33) adds resonance but no new cost or causal pressure. Two gates (setup, exit mention), but middle development minimal. Cap at ~6.8 for weak closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The subterranean waterfall is setup in line 15, dominates lines 15–30 (teaching through rhythm, forcing improvisation, shaping the water-clock assembly), and implicitly underwrites the closing stance (line 36: "hours that refuse cages"). Constrains tactics: protagonist must time spray beats to enter, then use cascade as model. Causal pressure throughout middle and closure. Cost legible: accepting the waterfall's "brutal" teaching. Irreplaceable: no other setting element could provide the rhythm-as-lesson. Three gates (setup, middle, closure), multiple beats, high specificity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"When coincidence becomes pattern" is setup in line 16 (journal line), returns in line 35 ("When coincidence becomes pattern again, I will follow"). Shapes the protagonist's interpretation (trust irregularity) and future stance, but does not tighten decisions on the page during action beats. Time pressure is minimal; the piece is contemplative. Two-gate presence (setup, closure reprise) with thematic rather than tactical force. Lyric reprise reweights meaning but does not alter middle moves. Cap at ~6.2 for weak middle causality and no live clock.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"To befriend uncertainty in planning" is introduced in line 7, dramatized in lines 20–21 (improvising at waterfall), line 26 (sitting until pulses braid), line 29 ("I timed nothing, but watched everything"), and crystallized in lines 32 and 36 (new workshop ethos, closing stance). Desire is conflicted: protagonist wants to repair but must forsake precision. Friction between wants (control) and costs (uncertainty) is visible throughout. Three gates, multiple beats, causal pressure, closure participation direct. Cost: renouncing exactness. Irreplaceable: the motivation defines the transformation.</comment>
