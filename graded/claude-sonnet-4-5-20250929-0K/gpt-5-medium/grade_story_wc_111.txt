<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The vine dresser demonstrates consistent interiority through embodied choices—polishing marbles, kneeling to confess to the fountain, offering soil to the vine. Internal contradiction appears when the narrator admits to "mended deception" yet maintains pragmatic control, creating genuine complexity. The final stance (trust as "the last thing to polish") feels earned through the accumulation of small ritual choices, though the resolution trends slightly abstract. Micro-choices under pressure are present throughout, particularly in the trimming scene where acceptance of withering competes with the impulse to preserve.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (mutual recognition between gardener and garden) with visible cost: the narrator accepts being "mended too, stitched by seasons. / Not whole, but honest enough." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—pressure builds through ritual repetition, the maze's objection, and the vine's half-blooming state, culminating in the unlatched gate as trust enacted. Orientation anchors (garden, dials, maze) appear early. One meaningful deepening occurs when the maze "objected with elegance" and forced confession, narrowing the narrator's options from performance to penance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The garden maze, dials, marbles, fountain, and vine function as micro-setting that constrains choices throughout: the maze grows a new corridor forcing confrontation, the dials register patience as measurable feedback, the cracked marbles anchor confession. The final image ("maze wore my age, and I wore its patience") charges the ending through accumulated spatial particulars. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—"silver breath" of water, "warm ache" of night, hedges that "hiss"—filtered through the narrator's professional attention to plant behavior and ritual object-care.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("to prove that gardens know their gardeners") is signaled early and tightens when the maze objects to the planted marble, forcing the narrator to choose between maintained deception and honest confession. Agency operates through renunciation: admitting the lie, trimming the vine "accepting the leaves that chose ground," and leaving the gate unlatched. The cost is legible—the narrator surrenders control and performance, accepting incompleteness. One clear reversal (maze disapproval → confession → acceptance) drives escalation under the Accumulative lens, though the coincidence of the overnight corridor arrival slightly weakens causal spine.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: cracked marbles as "witnesses," the fountain's "mended deception," and the vine's decision between blooming and withering, culminating in the image of gardener and garden as "equals in attentive weather." The final lines offer a non-literal answer to the proving question—mutual tending rather than measurement dominates, and trust replaces score-keeping. "Stitched by seasons" operates as both metaphor and literal description without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the contrast between visitors' applause and the maze's preference for work, and in the narrator's acceptance that commemorating victories can shift from superstition to genuine recognition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature appears throughout: the narrator notices "timid beetles under glass," registers hedge behavior as approval or objection, and processes the vine's trembling as memory-decision. Diction remains consistent—pragmatic, botanical, ritual-oriented—with purposeful elevation ("courtiers," "gossip measures gossip against grain") that fits the narrator's voice. Psychic distance is stable; the piece maintains focalization through garden-centric perception. Rhythm modulates effectively, slowing for confession ("I knelt, bones quiet as twigs") and tightening at closure ("The night entered gently, blooming and withering in equal, grateful breaths"). No dialogue present to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high: most lines advance image, choice, or ritual. Opening "After luck becomes measurable" anchors premise and voice immediately. Minimal scaffolding or loops, though some phrases trend abstract ("necessary kindness," "attentive weather"). Figurative language ("hedges hissed," "luck's needles steadied") remains coherent and embodied. The line "Each marble stood for a past victory, small and worn but still colored" demonstrates efficient layering of object, history, and state. Minor register drift in "mended deception as penance, not performance" slightly elevates beyond established voice, but remains legible. Sentence variety and rhythm support the accumulative design without mechanical repetition.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The premise—measurable luck and sentient garden judgment—offers a fresh synthesis that the story commits to fully, following implications through dial readings, maze objections, and ritual accountability. The vine dresser's acceptance of being "mended too" transforms the trope of magical recognition into mutual incompleteness. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure and personified landscape heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The marbles as both tally and confession device, and the unlatched gate as enacted trust rather than declared resolution, feel specific and earned. Some images (polishing to reflect cloud, blackbird bell) trend ornamental but don't undermine the core synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The withered vine dresser drives all key choices: polishing marbles, confessing to the fountain, trimming the vine, leaving the gate unlatched. Present from the opening, shapes the middle confrontation with the maze's objection, and enacts the closure through the unlatching gesture. The character's decisions alter tactics from performance to penance and finally to trust, with visible cost (surrendering control, accepting incompleteness).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Marbles appear in setup (commemorating victories), middle (planted marble at fountain triggers maze objection), and closure (set around fountain "like planets," polished until "colors rose again"). Use evolves from prize to witness. The cracked seams align with scars on the narrator's hands, charging the final image. Specific cost: the narrator's confession and acceptance of the marbles as evidence rather than trophies.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mended deception is introduced early ("I had planted it during a drought"), drives the central conflict (maze disapproves, forces confession), and is explicitly named and resolved ("explained why I had lied, and why I had not entirely"). The concept shapes tactics: the narrator shifts from concealment to honest accounting. Closure hinges on the maze accepting "mended deception as penance, not performance," making the element causally indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Wisely pragmatic is stated early ("I was wisely pragmatic, counting leaves and debts") and demonstrated through the narrator's ritual care, measured confession, and acceptance of both bloom and wither. The trait enables the trimming choice ("accepting the leaves that chose ground") with visible cost—control surrendered for honesty. However, the attribute could be swapped for similar descriptors (careful, measured) without fundamentally breaking the logic.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Polishing appears in setup (gate latch, marbles after clean pruning), middle (confession scene does not feature polishing but its absence is felt), and closure ("polished the cracked marbles until colors rose again" and "trust was the last thing to polish"). The action redefines from performance (reflecting cloud, earning courtier-like approval) to witness-preparation and finally to enacted trust. Removing "polish" would break the ritual structure and the closure image's resonance.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Commemorating small victories elaborately is named early, demonstrated through marble-polishing and bell-hanging, and explicitly evaluated ("Some call that superstition, but the dials always bowed afterward"). The method shapes the narrator's ritual approach and is repriced at closure when marbles shift from prizes to witnesses. The maze's objection tests whether commemoration is performance or penance, making the method essential to the story's pressure and resolution.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Garden maze is present from the title and opening, applies immediate pressure (registers patience as percentage, grows new corridor, objects to falsehood, hedges hiss and part), and charges the closure ("maze wore my age, and I wore its patience"). The maze's agency forces the confession and validates the final mutual recognition. Spatial particulars (corridors, fountain, vine anchor) constrain movement and choice throughout. Removing the maze would collapse the story's logic and stakes entirely.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "after luck becomes measurable" is stated in the opening line, establishes the dials and measurement premise, and persists as background condition throughout. However, it functions more as worldbuilding than active constraint—no specific deadline or ticking clock pressures the narrator's choices. The timeframe enables the dials to register patience but could be replaced with a similar conceit (e.g., "after gardens gained voices") without altering the narrative arc.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The motivation "to prove that gardens know their gardeners" is stated early, dramatized through the planting deception and maze objection, and resolved when the maze "concluded that I had become mended too." Friction appears between the narrator's desire for validation and the garden's demand for honesty, forcing the confession choice with cost (pride, control). The final mutual recognition answers the proving desire through acceptance rather than measurement, making the motivation integral to the arc.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Blooming/withering tone is established early ("withered vine dresser," "vines still answered") and modulates throughout: marbles "cracked from summers," the vine "half blooming, half withering, as if deciding which memory to keep," and the closing line "blooming and withering in equal, grateful breaths." The tone charges the final image by making acceptance of both states the resolution, and reflects the narrator's progression from measuring victories to honoring incompleteness. Coherent and purposeful across all beats.</comment>
