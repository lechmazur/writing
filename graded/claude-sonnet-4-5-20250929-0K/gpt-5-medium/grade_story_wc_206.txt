<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The protagonist's interior is grounded in embodied constraint ("I wilt near dishonesty, my bones softening like wax") that drives multiple on-page choices—asking the watchman for truth, confessing the sold lullaby. The confession at the chamber's heart earns the pact with visible cost (shadow forfeiture). Minor slips: some interiority leans toward poetic summary rather than micro-choice texture, and the grandmother's teaching functions more as backstory color than active pressure on present stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the shadow steps away, the covenant shifts from rust-as-theft to rust-as-patina, and light returns tethered to listening rather than ownership—visible cost (shadowless labor) and a coherent reweighting under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The causality is legible: confession steadies → chip resonates → shadow trades → light binds to attention. Orientation anchors (chamber, city dimmed three rotations, repairman's craft) arrive early. One friction: the midpoint threading of mechanics ("stitching futures before they fray") reads more as assertion than dramatized constraint, but the closure image pays off the premise cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The resonance chamber's brass ribs, floor glyphs, and rafters constrain the ritual choreography; the tuning box functions as tool-as-setting, its bellows and chip directly enabling the covenant. Spatial anchors (door, floor, rafters, ceiling slats, streetlamps outside) track clearly. The philosopher's stone chip charges the final image when it glows "like a cherry ember" in the nightly returns. Minor gap: the city's "copper veins" and gantries are named but remain abstract; more tactile grounding of the urban surround would lift specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaim stolen light—is signaled in the opening promise and tested across escalating thresholds: door (truth vs. collapse), chamber (offering vs. refusal), covenant (shadow vs. keeping light). The rust's terms narrow options with visible cost: shadow forfeiture and ongoing labor ("mending what isn't torn"). The tightening is causal under the Accumulative lens: confession → rust listens → binding requires collateral → light tethered to attention. The story delivers one decisive deepening (light becomes conditional on listening) with cost legible on the page and a persistent constraint (shadowless vigilance) shaping the ending image.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—repair as attention, light as borrowed through listening—emerges from the chip's resonance, the shadow's willing service, and the pact's terms without moralizing. The final image (narrator and shadow cranking together, city singing) offers a resonant answer: care sustains what force cannot fix. The "mending what isn't torn" motif recurs with reweighted meaning (aligning futures, noticing quiet pain) and charges the closure. One small friction: "dawn is a borrowed instrument" in the street scene tips toward thematic summary, but the particulars (youngest cupping light, giggles, generous ears) ground it quickly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The perceptual signature is distinct and consistent: lyric compression ("knuckles to rain," "tinkersong wonder"), selective focus on sonic and tactile particulars (overtones, lunar flecks, hush tasting like tin and pears). Psychic distance holds stable in first person with one brief apostrophe to the reader ("I told them..."). Register remains voice-coherent even under peak pressure. One friction: the lexicon occasionally stretches toward elevated diction ("rivering chord," "cocked its metal ear") that rides the edge of the narrator's plausible idiom but stays legible within the established poetic frame.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and lengths create visual cadence without algorithmic drumbeat. Information density is high: most lines advance stakes, atmosphere, and character simultaneously. Minor deductions: a few near-paraphrases ("mending what isn't torn" recurs five times; the concept earns thematic weight but two instances feel more scaffolding than pressure) and one filter-verb run in the opening third ("They said the theft began...my knuckles to rain") that slightly dulls immediacy. The closure beat is clean and propulsive, so non-closure slips cap at −0.5 total.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—covenant of rust + music-box repair + philosopher's stone + shadow-as-collateral—feels specific and non-obvious; the frame of mending-before-tearing offers a fresh angle on restoration narratives. The shadow stepping away "like a careful apprentice" is a memorable image that grows from prior craft language. Risk-taking in lyric compression and non-literal mechanics heightens stakes without obscuring causality. One limiter: the resonance-chamber ritual leans on familiar summoning-pact structure; the transformation is strong but not fully inevitable in hindsight, leaving the piece in the upper-strong band rather than exceptional.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Music box repairman: establishes opening frame, drives key turns (cranking the tuning box triggers the covenant, nightly returns tune rafters), and the craft idiom ("mending what isn't torn") shapes both tactics and theme. Present in setup, middle pact, and closure labor. Causal pressure is clear: his inherited skill and tool enable the light's return. Irreplaceability is high; another occupation would require major plot rewrites.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Chip from philosopher's stone: signaled early as inherited from "the first horologist," placed in the tuning box's heart at the covenant beat, and glows "like a cherry ember" in the nightly closure ritual. Three distinct beats with causal work (inheritance → resonance → sustained anchor). The chip's "spine of daylight" property is specific and irreplaceable; no generic talisman could perform the same function. Cost linkage is solid: the chip channels the confession's truth into physical resonance that earns the covenant.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Covenant of rust: named early as the theft's origin, speaks as an active negotiator in rivering chords, names terms (shadow + ongoing labor), and transforms into patina at closure—shifting from antagonist to collaborator. Three beats (cause, negotiation, transformation) with causal stakes. The covenant's requirement for truth and offering directly narrows the protagonist's options and charges the ending pact. Specificity is high: rust-as-covenant rather than generic curse or spell.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Wilts near dishonesty: dramatized twice with visible cost—knees fold when the watchman lies, strength returns when truth is told; later, confession steadies the protagonist during the covenant. The trait constrains tactics (must pursue truth to maintain function) and shapes the pact's logic (honesty as currency). Present in setup and middle beat, implied at closure (ongoing vigilance requires listening, which depends on truth). Solid causal work but no direct mention in the final image; cap around upper-6s for two-gate coverage with clear constraint.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Tether: named as the protagonist's offer ("tether the returning light to listening rather than ownership"), accepted by the rust as fair terms, and enacted when the shadow takes its place to "wind the night back when we forgot to listen." The tether becomes the story's hinge: light returns conditional rather than permanent. Present in negotiation and closure; implied throughout the final paragraph's collaborative vigilance. Causal and irreplaceable; swapping for "bind" or "anchor" would require conceptual rewrites.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mending what isn't torn: taught in the opening as grandmother's lesson, applied at the covenant ("not fixing, but mending what isn't torn, aligning futures before they frayed"), and named again in the pact's terms and nightly labor. The method is both tactic and theme: it distinguishes the protagonist's craft from brute repair and justifies why the covenant listens. Four beats (teaching, chamber application, rust's terms, ongoing closure work) with high causal pressure. The method's specificity is irreplaceable and charges the final image of collaborative tuning.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Resonance chamber: doors, floor glyphs, brass ribs, rafters anchor the covenant ritual; the space "wanted honesty and offering," constraining what the protagonist can bring. The chamber's acoustics (hushed overtones, names carved in floor) enable the tuning box's effect and the rust's voice. Present in setup (door confrontation), middle (chamber negotiation), and closure (nightly returns to tune rafters). The setting directly shapes tactics and outcome; no generic room could substitute without losing the resonance mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>In the balance: frames urgency from the opening ("time itself were in the balance") and recurs at the climax ("the whole attempt in the balance, the moment taut as a spring between tick and tock"). The phrase charges two key beats with temporal pressure but remains more metaphorical than tracked; no explicit countdown or clock narrows tactics on the page. Two-gate coverage (setup and climax mention) with thematic weight but limited mechanical constraint. Solid mid-6s for lyric-resonance contribution without tactical tightening.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Reclaim the light stolen by midnight: named in the opening promise, drives all chamber actions (offering chip, confessing, trading shadow), and resolves when "light returned as a pale choir" tethered to listening. The motivation is tested under friction—cost of shadow, ongoing labor—and conflicted (wants light back vs. price of vigilance). Three gates (setup, middle choices, closure payoff) with visible cost at each turn. Strong causal pressure and irreplaceability; the desire shapes every tactic and charges the ending image of collaborative tending.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Tinkersong wonder: establishes tone in the opening craft idiom, modulates through the chamber's hush and lunar flecks, intensifies at the covenant's "rivering chord," and returns in the street scene ("tinkersong wonder I grew up on, the hum of work made holy by care"). The tone is coherent and distinct, blending lyric compression with tactile craft detail. It charges the final collaborative image but remains more atmospheric than pressure-driving. Three gates with consistent modulation; solid upper-7s for tonal integrity that supports rather than drives closure.</comment>
