<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The historian is portrayed through consistent action and embodied perception—touching objects, reading fragments, listening to walls—with clear motivation to collect stories. Interior life is concrete and particular ("porous, letting other lives flow through"), though the interiority sometimes edges toward lyric label rather than contradictory impulse. The final choices (rearranging shelves, returning the disk, whispering to the axis) are earned by prior causality and foreclose paths with visible cost, but the character remains more a vessel than a figure wrestling with internal conflict.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes an accumulative/textural lens by the opening tercet and sustains it through layered images and objects. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first 120 words. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the historian commits to teaching walls to speak and stitching a world from echoes, foreclosing the option of mere passive collection with visible conceptual cost ("If dreams are finished..."). The cost is legible in the final image of pulse and echo, though quieter than exemplary high-band work.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The reclaimed silo library is vividly anchored through selective, purposeful detail: ladder rungs, binding twine, corrugated skin, welded rings. Micro-setting elements (the brass disk, the flue, the tapestry fragment) constrain the historian's choices and charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy is consistent with the POV's professional priorities—listening to brick tone, feeling for leaves the fire spared—and the displaced axis reweights spatial logic throughout, contributing directly to the ending's pulse.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—collecting the stories walls have heard before silence forgets—is signaled early and tightens once through the discovery of the brass disk, which reconfigures the historian's understanding and tactical response (rearranging shelves along the new pull). The piece offers one meaningful deepening that narrows options under the accumulative lens. Agency is expressed through renunciation and endurance (volunteering to absorb stranded stories), with visible cost in the final commitment to teach walls and stitch echoes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from image and action: the displaced axis as myth-as-geometry, dreams unseated, rooms waking in terror, the historian as voluntary vessel. The brass disk and dragon tapestry recur with reweighted meaning, and the final image—"teach the walls to speak to each other, and stitch a world from echoes"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence and gesture ("whispers to the displaced axis as if to a fevered child"), and the piece resists tidy resolution while avoiding abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and sustained: "bronze quiet that even dust learns to honor," "porous, letting other lives flow through," "patient as a plow." POV remains single and stable; perceptual signature is consistent—listening, touching, reading—shaped by the historian's professional stance. Diction remains within register throughout, with purposeful compression ("probe," "burnished," "stitches") that heightens rather than obscures. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks; rhythm modulates effectively under emotional pressure in the final tercet without breaking voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information load per line and varied rhythm that breathes with scene needs. Metaphors are coherent and specific ("reclines like a fallen compass needle," "dust flurries like moths, each wing a different year"). Minor template-cadence slips appear in the middle third ("They tell… They describe… They remember"), applying a −0.3 deduction, but do not touch the closure. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and recharge motifs cleanly. Zero paraphrase loops; clarity remains high throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The piece synthesizes post-human archive fiction with the specific angle of walls as witness and the displaced axis as both physics and myth. The historian as "odd" and "sensitively perceptive" listener transforms the archivist trope through embodied micro-choices and renunciation. The bronze-quiet tone and the tapestry-as-warning angle feel fresh, though the post-dream premise echoes familiar territory. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure and lyric density heightens coherence without obscuring clarity; the final image earns its resonance through prior particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The historian is present throughout, making on-page choices: touching the dragon fragment (beat 1), reading diaries (beat 2), retrieving the brass disk (beat 3), rearranging shelves (beat 4), returning the disk (beat 5), whispering to the axis (beat 6). These choices drive accumulation and the final commitment. Setup is immediate, development spans multiple beats, and closure depends on his decision to teach walls rather than passively collect. Cost is visible in the foreclosed path and the commitment to echo-work.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The tapestry fragment appears in beat 1 (table), is handled in beat 2 (dust flurries), interpreted in beat 3 (spindle as warning), and stitched into the logbook in beat 5. It signals the displaced axis motif and recurs with reweighted meaning. However, its causal pressure is oblique—it informs interpretation but does not directly constrain a choice or alter tactics. Closure participation is indirect: the dragon on the brass disk echoes it, but the tapestry itself is not active in the final image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The displaced axis is seeded in line 9 ("when the axis displaced") and developed through the tapestry spindle (beat 3), the brass disk's offset circles (beat 4), and the historian's realization that it "unseated dreams" (beat 5). It shapes the on-page tactic of rearranging shelves "along the new pull" and charges the final image where he whispers to it and the silo pulses. The concept constrains spatial logic and drives the thematic closure, making removal destructive to both stakes and meaning.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The attribute is labeled in line 3 and demonstrated through actions: listening to brick tone, notating murmurs, hearing groans of bolts, touching objects, and feeling for leaves in the flue. It enables the historian's work and is visible throughout. However, it does not impose a visible cost or tradeoff—perception is purely enabling. No on-page moment where sensitivity creates a constraint or friction that alters a choice. Present and functional, but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Probe" appears in beat 2 (probe a vanished day via diaries) and beat 6 (probe the rusted flue, finding the brass disk). The flue probing drives the key reversal: discovering the disk that reframes the axis and prompts rearrangement. Without this action, the historian would not gain the spatial map or the insight that rooms woke in terror. Setup is early, causal pressure is clear, and the action shapes the ending's commitment. Swappable with "search" or "explore" only with minor conceptual loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The half-burned diaries are introduced in beat 1 (folded inside a hearth), used in beat 2 (he reads them to probe a vanished day), and inform beat 4 (the page reporting the night men woke). They supply the evidence of the hour dreams ended and prime the historian's realization. However, the method is not mechanically stressed—"reading" is the action, and the burned state adds atmosphere more than constraint. Middle development is present, closure linkage is indirect, and the diaries could be swapped for similar fragmentary texts without deep structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The reclaimed silo library is anchored immediately and shapes choices: the ladder rungs and twine supply shelving, the flue hides the disk, the corrugated skin remembers boots, and the displaced tilt prompts rearrangement "along the new pull." The setting is handled across beats and directly alters the historian's tactics (where to place tragedies vs. hope). The final image of "something like weather shifts in the heart of the silo, almost a pulse" charges closure. Removal would collapse spatial logic and thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The timeframe is seeded in the opening line and returned in beat 4 ("the hour after the last human dream was dreamt"). It establishes the story's conceptual premise and explains why rooms woke in terror. However, it does not tighten on-page decisions or create a live clock—there is no urgency or countdown. The timeframe functions as thematic backdrop rather than pressure device. Closure linkage is indirect: the historian's work responds to the post-dream condition, but time itself does not constrain his choices.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The motivation is stated in line 4 ("to collect the stories walls have heard") and dramatized through on-page actions: reading diaries, listening to walls, touching fragments, retrieving the disk, rearranging shelves. The final beat shifts the goal from passive collection to active teaching ("teach the walls to speak to each other"), creating visible cost—the foreclosure of mere archival work. Friction between the wish to preserve and the need to animate is present, though more implied than contested. Setup, development, and payoff are all on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The tone is seeded in the opening phrase ("bronze quiet that even dust learns to honor") and sustained through diction: "softly," "murmurs," "whispers," "patient as a plow," "almost a pulse." It modulates appropriately under pressure—remaining hushed but intensifying through layered images in the final tercet. The tone charges the final image of the prairie listening back and the silo's near-pulse, making the stillness resonant rather than inert. Coherent throughout, purposeful, and indispensable to the story's atmospheric and thematic work.</comment>
