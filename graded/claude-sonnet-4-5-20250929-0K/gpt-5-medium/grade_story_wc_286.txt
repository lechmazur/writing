<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The potter's internal landscape is embodied through kiln and clay metaphors that root choices in craft knowledge ("I will hold you without forcing you"). The character's stance evolves through micro-choices—filling the dish, cleaning frames, singing—each reflecting a value hierarchy without therapy-speak. Her decision to leave cups in multiple timelines forecloses return, a renunciation with visible cost. Minor slip: some reflective passages drift toward abstraction ("phototropic to kindness") rather than staying grounded in perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece braids observation, ritual action, and timeline shifts toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis meets Charged Poise). Orientation anchors quickly (wasteland, oasis, hives). The lantern glass enables escalation by revealing three threads, and the potter's actions (water, cleaning, song, cups) accumulate pressure that crystallizes in "the place resisted change by practicing it gently"—a conceptual repricing with felt cost (she leaves the cups and walks away). One causal seam: the thrumming "climbed the note" feels slightly unmotivated, emerging more from lyric will than scene logic, but the closure lands with cost intact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The oasis—cracked troughs, empty hives, scorched ground—pressures every choice by denying resources (water scarcity, no shelter). The lantern glass functions as micro-setting tool, constraining the potter's sight to three braided timelines and charging the final image when she gathers breath-condensed water to fill cups. Sensory detail is purpose-driven: heat trembling, smoke flattening, thrumming air. The body and glass shape tactics throughout and anchor the closure, meeting the 9+ gate easily.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding resistance to change—is signaled early and deepens through ritual actions. The lantern glass reversal (past/now/almost threads) narrows options by making timelines visible, forcing the potter to choose a stance: she offers kindness across all three. The thrumming response and timeline braid-tightening mark escalation under the Accumulative lens. Cost is legible: she expends her last water, fires cups with scavenged material, and walks away leaving her work behind. No antagonist needed; the environment and fractured timelines supply coherent pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—kindness as anchor across fractured time—emerges from particulars (water dish, cleaned frames, breath-fired cups) without thesis statement. The lantern glass and thrumming recur with shifted meaning, charging the closure image: "the place resisted change by practicing it gently, little by little, phototropic to kindness and memory." The ending reweights the opening question through the potter's final resolution ("She intended to be that someone") without moralizing. One phrase—"phototropic to kindness"—edges toward concept-label, but the final image ("shawl of times") roots it in embodied perception.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, controlled, and compressed: "sharp gentleness" operates in diction ("whispering thanks for their work long done") and syntax (fragments and parallelism: "In one thread... in another... In the third"). POV remains stable in close third, filtering all observation through the potter's craft idiom (kiln, glaze, kick wheel). Psychic distance modulates purposefully—tighter during ritual action, broader during reflection. Minor slip: "phototropic to kindness, leaning toward whatever light came in that shape" drifts briefly into explanatory register, but voice recovers immediately in sensory action.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm and imagery are strong: "lids ajar like mouths too tired to pray," "smoke lay down again, taught by the day to flatten." Information density is high, most lines layering action and perception. Two friction points lower the score: some reflective passages loop near-synonyms ("steady tenderness, again and again" / "little by little"), and elevated diction ("phototropic," "braided three threads") occasionally floats above the concrete. No template cadence or filter stacks; propulsion stays clean. Figurative language is mostly coherent, though "shawl of times, colors against ash" mixes vehicle slightly (shawl/colors).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—zen potter meets fractured timelines via lantern optics, kindness as temporal anchor—feels specific and non-obvious. The beekeeping oasis and craft-based problem-solving avoid template plot. Risk-taking in structure (timeline threads, accumulative pressure, quiet closure) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The piece commits fully to its premise and follows implications (firing cups from trough clay, placing them in unseen timelines). One note: "phototropic to kindness" as metaphor borders on workshop coinage, slightly reducing raw freshness, but the lived detail (breath-condensed water, twig and shirt-hem cleaning) anchors the concept in embodied action.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Zen-minded potter is signaled early, drives all middle beats (water dish, frame cleaning, song, cup-making), and shapes closure through her final resolution to "be that someone wherever she set her wheel." Her craft idiom filters perception throughout. Decisions alter tactics (firing with scavenged brush, placing cups in timelines) with visible cost (water, materials, departure). Essential across setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Faded lantern glass appears early, enables the timeline-viewing reversal at midpoint, and returns at closure when the potter gathers breath-condensed water from it to fill cups. Its optical properties are irreplaceable (catching sun "just so," braiding three threads). Used in at least three distinct beats, causally active, and charges the final image. Cost is tied to the element (she must position and interpret it, then leave it behind or carry it).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fractured timelines shape stakes (understanding why places resist change) and tactics (the potter must act across all three threads). The lantern glass mechanism makes timelines visible by the first third, timelines pressure the middle (bees in one thread, ash in another, child in the third), and closure hinges on the timeline braid tightening when the potter places cups. Conceptual cost is legible: she cannot unify the threads, only offer kindness to each. Indispensable to story logic and final image.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Phototropic to kindness is realized mid-story ("the place was phototropic to kindness, leaning toward whatever light came in that shape") and immediately tested through small ritual actions (water, cleaning, song) that trigger the thrumming response. The trait constrains her approach (she must offer gentleness, not force) and enables the timeline shift. Visible cost: she expends resources and time, and the trait's mechanics feel slightly asserted rather than fully discovered through action, keeping it below 8.0.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Thrum appears first as potential ("the air seemed ready to thrum"), then as response to the potter's note ("The thrumming climbed the note and spread"), and finally as sustained presence in closure ("the cups and the hum to keep speaking"). It signals the oasis responding, escalates when the timeline threads braid tighter, and persists in the ending image. Major turn (timeline convergence) traces to it. Swapping "thrum" for another sound would weaken specificity (wings/bees/kindness linkage), but the action's causal trigger feels slightly soft (why does her note summon it?), keeping it from 8.5+.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>By following sun patterns is signaled in setup ("She had found this place by following sun patterns, pacing her steps with the slow drag of light"), used mid-story (positioning the lantern glass "until it caught the sun just so"), and returns at closure ("She walked away by following sun patterns again"). The method shapes her approach and links to the lantern optics. However, its mechanics remain abstract—what specific sun-pattern navigation entails is not dramatized—and it does not constrain a middle choice with visible cost, limiting it to mid-band despite three-gate presence.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Abandoned beekeeping oasis in scorched wasteland is signaled immediately, supplies all material constraints (cracked troughs for clay, hive frames to clean, scarcity forcing water trade-offs), and drives the closure choice (she must leave the cups there). The oasis embodies the fractured timelines and is irreplaceable—beekeeping ties to the thrumming/wings/kindness chain. Setting pressures every tactic and charges the final image ("the oasis wore all its times like a shawl"). Essential and indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>As chimney smoke flattens appears in the opening line and returns late ("the flattened chimney smoke on the horizon thickened, as if agreeing to bear weight"), creating a lyric bracket. However, it does not tighten decisions or track elapsed time—no live clock alters the potter's moves. The image adds tonal coherence but remains ornamental to causal pressure. Present at setup and closure but lacks middle development, capping it under the gate model and earning low-functional band for resonance without tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>To understand why some places resist change is announced early ("She came to understand why some places resist change") and dramatized through all middle actions: she kneels, touches hives, watches timeline threads, performs rituals, and receives an answer encoded in the glass and thrumming ("the same kindness keeps happening here, and it anchors the fractures"). Desire drives choices with cost (water, materials, departure). Friction between intellectual curiosity and the need for embodied ritual is visible. Closure delivers the answer through action and image, not exposition, earning high integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sharp gentleness is embodied throughout: diction mixes precision ("braided three threads") with tenderness ("whispering thanks"), syntax alternates taut fragments with flowing clauses, and the potter's actions are controlled yet generous (cleaning with "a twig and a shirt hem," singing until "ribs felt like kiln walls warming"). Tone modulates with pressure—sharper during the lantern-glass reversal, gentler during the cup-making—and charges the closure image ("the place resisted change by practicing it gently"). Coherent, specific, and indispensable to voice and theme.</comment>
