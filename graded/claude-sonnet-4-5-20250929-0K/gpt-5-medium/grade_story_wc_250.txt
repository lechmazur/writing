<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is embodied through precise perceptual choices ("palm damp and expectant," "shame tried retreating") and the brother's suicide backstory anchors present stakes without expository drift. The guardian remains properly opaque—his silence and gestures constrain rather than explain—though his motivations stay purely external. The narrator's micro-choices (accepting the mirror, angling light toward drowned arches) carry visible cost tied to grief work, and the final shift ("my voice returned like floodwater") earns its claim through prior causality. Minor: "spiralingly calm" recurs as label without dramatized contradiction under stress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis hybrid): the narrator refuses the brother's "old pull" and the final walk together reweights the opening isolation with conceptual cost (the city "felt slightly less alone" implies ongoing work, not resolution). Accumulative lens is taught early (rain, mirror flickers, shutter sequences build density) and holds through the ending image. Orientation anchors cobalt dock, post-rain, and two figures by line 3. One meaningful deepening occurs when the narrator receives the mirror and turns light toward the drowned arches, shifting from witness to agent. Cost is legible: "my voice returned like floodwater, slow and brown, carrying what was lost to banks again."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The dental mirror functions as micro-setting, constraining the guardian's method and charging the final image when the narrator keeps it "cupped, a small star." The cobalt dock's rain-slick surface, bollard, pilings, and carved rings supply tactile anchors that shape the rope-weaving lesson. Sensory selection reflects urgency: the guardian "smelling faintly of tar and nettle," shutters "chattering and hushing," and the canal's "small lift" are filtered through grief-weighted perception. The drowned arches in the final third provide spatial specificity that the light must navigate, and the closing alleys "bent toward other harbors" extends the world without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—teaching darkness the value of stars, literalized as grief work for the brother—is signaled by line 34 and drives the mirror exchange. One clear tightening: the guardian gives the narrator the mirror (agency transfer) and the narrator angles light toward drowned arches, forcing confrontation with the brother's refusal. The barge pilot's unclenched pain provides secondary evidence that the method works. Escalation reads accumulative under the chosen lens: density increases from passive witness to active participant, and the cost is visible when the narrator "told him the secret I had withheld" and receives stitching-light in return. The ending walk reweights the opening solitude without soft reset.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—silent empathy as craft, not sentiment—emerges through the guardian's mirror work and shutter sequences without meta-statement. The final image ("I kept the dental mirror cupped, a small star I would use when speaking failed") offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the brother's darkness without moralizing. The rope-weaving lesson ("soft grip teaching a firm one") and the canal's dignity encode forgiveness as ongoing practice. The brother's boots-on detail and the town's love of his silence anchor the premise in particulars, and the shimmer that "felt my brother refusing" avoids ghost-story convenience by staying perceptual. Minor: "darkness waited to be shown its measure" tilts slightly abstract in the penultimate line.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout: "rain left the dock the color of cobalt," "rope snoring," "night bruises easily." Psychic distance is stable (close third on narrator) with the guardian's interiority properly withheld; his communication stays gestural. Compression is purposeful and patterned: "He made a circle in the air, spiralingly calm, and let the gesture drift outward" teaches the lyric register early. Diction remains anchored in the narrator's register (floodwater, folded sails, bellows) without tourist drift. No head-hopping; the barge pilot's smile is external observation. Free indirect style is clean: "Walk, his eyes said, but softly, because the night bruises easily" reads as narrator inference, not omniscience. Rhythm modulates under pressure without template runs.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High information density: most lines do double work (e.g., "His coat held old rainbows of oil, and his eyes held every failed promise" anchors both appearance and thematic weight). Sentence openings vary and paragraph cuts create visual rhythm. Zero paraphrase loops; figurative language is coherent and controlled. Minor deduction: "spiralingly calm" recurs four times as label without syntactic variation, borderline template cadence (−0.3). The opacity of "spiralingly" itself strains clarity under peak pressure when the gesture should land most precisely. "Stillwater tension" and "half-spoken secret" front-load atmosphere effectively, and the final "alleys bent toward other harbors" extends world without stalling closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The dental mirror for light-weaving rather than diagnosis, combined with shutter-pattern empathy, offers a fresh synthesis; the occupation (canal guardian) and method feel integral rather than ornamental. The brother's suicide anchors stakes in specific loss, avoiding generic grief. The closing shift—narrator keeps the mirror to continue the work—transforms witnessing into vocation without tidy resolution. Risk: the lyric compression and withheld exposition could obscure, but the piece teaches its pattern early and payoff is legible. Transformation test passes: swapping guardian for therapist or mirror for another tool breaks the closure image. Minor: the "teach darkness the value of stars" phrase borders writerly, though it's filtered as narrator's unspoken desire.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The silent canal guardian appears in line 4, demonstrates mirror method across multiple beats (lines 9–20, 25–28, 38–43), and gives the mirror to the narrator at line 39, enabling the narrator's turn toward the drowned arches and the brother's refusal. His decision to hand over the tool is the key causal turn that shifts the narrator from witness to agent. His final walk beside the narrator charges the ending ("the city felt slightly less alone"). The spiral gesture and shutter weaving are his primary actions. Essential across beats and ending; removing him breaks the story's engine.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The dental mirror appears in line 8, is used in at least four distinct beats (lines 9–10, 12, 19, 25–26, 38–44, final line), and returns at closure with reweighted meaning: the narrator keeps it as a "small star I would use when speaking failed," converting tool to vocation. The mirror's specific property—reflecting light too shy to arrive—enables the empathy method and shapes the barge pilot's relief, the drowned-arch confrontation, and the stitching-light ritual. Its handle warmth (line 39) and the final cupped posture anchor embodiment. Indispensable; the closure image fails without it.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Silent empathy frames the guardian's method from line 6 ("the canal mouthed little statements") through line 27 ("He used silent empathy the way other men used keys"). It shapes tactics: the mirror and shutters are empathy made physical, opening "what had grown stuck" in grief. The concept drives at least two beats (barge pilot's unclenched pain, narrator's chest door lifting) and informs the ending when the narrator inherits the practice. The narrator's brother "hated bright rooms where words made him clumsy," establishing silence as respect rather than absence. Causal and closure-linked, though the phrase "silent empathy" itself appears as label in line 27.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Spiralingly calm" appears in lines 4, 22, and 48, always as descriptor of the guardian's manner. It arguably enables his patience (line 11: "He angled it with a patience that felt like silent empathy turned into motion") and shapes the circular gesture in line 22. The attribute constrains his method—no haste, no speech—but its exact mechanical contribution is abstract. It charges the closing image when he "walked at my side, spiralingly calm," reinforcing tone. Present across setup, middle, and ending, but the trait functions more as atmospheric constant than pivot. Swappable with "imperturbable" or "centered" without major structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Weave" appears in lines 17 (light weaving across ripples), 35–36 (rope weaving through carved rings), and is implicit in the shutter-pattern creation. The rope-weaving lesson in lines 35–36 ("His fingers moved like rain remembering its fall, a soft grip teaching a firm one") is the key teaching moment that prepares the narrator to hold the mirror with purposeful grip. The action is named in line 17 as metaphor, then literalized in the rope scene, then extended to the shutters ("He was weaving, not with thread, but with windows, water, and the timid moon"). Essential to the guardian's method and the narrator's learning arc; removing it breaks the craft metaphor that anchors the theme.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Shutter-pattern method appears in lines 15–16, is elaborated in lines 24–26 and 30, and provides the final chord in line 44 ("He snapped the shutters shut in a final chord"). The mechanics are signaled: each opening/closing is "a syllable I almost understood," and the patterns reach "into rooms where grief lay like folded sails," establishing the method's therapeutic reach. The shutters enable the guardian's question in line 31 and teach the narrator forgiveness sequences in line 49. Present across setup, middle development, and payoff. The method's specificity (shutters + reflected glints) constrains the setting to narrow houses and canal, and its social penetration (reaching into rooms) establishes stakes. Indispensable to the guardian's craft.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The cobalt dock after rain anchors the opening three lines, supplies the bollard (line 12), pilings and carved rings (line 35), and the drowned arches (line 42). The rain-slick surface and "footprints fill and empty" establish transience that mirrors the grief work. The dock's proximity to narrow houses enables the shutter method, and the water itself serves as mirror surface for the guardian's light-weaving. The setting returns implicitly in the closing lines ("we left the dock together, the rain beginning again") and extends outward to alleys and other harbors. The dock pressures choices by making the brother's bridge death proximate and the canal's "little statements" a recurring presence. Essential; the story's logic depends on this exact location.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Within the edge of a half-spoken secret" appears once in line 7 as atmospheric phrase. It frames the narrator's withheld confession (line 46: "I told him the secret I had withheld") but does not function as a ticking clock or time limit that alters tactics. The timeframe is more spatial metaphor than temporal constraint—threshold language rather than duration. The piece unfolds in one continuous dusk-to-night scene without clear elapsed-time markers. Present in setup and paid off thematically at closure, but the "edge" never tightens decisions in the middle. Lyric reprise that reweights the stake modestly; functional but not pressure-driving.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrator's desire "to learn how to teach darkness the value of stars" is articulated in line 33 as internal thought, shortly after the guardian's question. It frames the narrator's acceptance of the mirror and the decision to angle light toward the drowned arches (lines 38–42), where the brother's refusal becomes legible. The motivation is dramatized through the micro-choice to step beside the guardian, watch the knots, and finally speak the withheld secret. Friction: the brother "chose that darkness" and the narrator's intervention is uncertain work, not rescue. The closing image—keeping the mirror cupped—enacts the motivation as ongoing practice. Present in final third, shapes the closure, carries cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Stillwater tension" is named in line 2 and sustained through "pause that did not exhale," "edge of a half-spoken secret," and "gulls kept distance." The tone modulates with pressure: quiet early, deepening through the mirror and shutter work, releasing slightly when "my voice returned like floodwater," then recharging in the walk toward "alleys bent toward other harbors." The tone shapes the guardian's silence and the narrator's damp palm, and it charges the final image when "the night [is] newly complicated by stars" rather than resolved. Coherent across beats; the stillwater metaphor returns in the canal's dignity and the water "kept the lesson." Indispensable to the piece's emotional architecture.</comment>
