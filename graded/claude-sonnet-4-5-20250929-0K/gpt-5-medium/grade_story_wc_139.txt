<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is concrete and voice-specific ("liquefies rigid thinking in me with a sound"), with embodied contradiction between inherited con-artistry and the desire for fairness. The micro-choices under pressure—singing low while the director peers, the wrist-squeeze acknowledgment—reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost. Internal conflict between father's "carnival math" and the protagonist's "inverse function" drives the helping choice, though the final epiphany ("feel the new vowel of fairness arrive") edges toward label-speak without full embodied grounding in the closure beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as Conceptual Repricing: the protagonist signs witness with the father's ink, transforming inherited tools of fraud into instruments of testimony, and the "new vowel of fairness" reweights the premise with felt cost (carrying evidence to the clinic attorney, cleaning away Arman's warmth). The lens is Accumulative/Textural with causal backbone: density increases through layered imagery (ink pot, ledger, breach-as-inattention) and the cadence shifts from tense prep-room waiting to the quiet final cleaning. One meaningful tightening occurs when the reset chime dings and the window opens, narrowing options under taught constraint. Orientation anchors early: funeral home prep room, narrator washing a living man pretending to be dead.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The prep room is vivid and functional: "citrus, ethanol, and deathly vitality," steel table, pumps, vents, service elevator, and the bolt the director leaves hanging all constrain and enable the escape. The vintage ink pot and cabinet anchor micro-setting, and the dolly-roll through the hallway while the floor polisher drones creates spatial choreography that shapes the breach. Sensory detail is filtered through the narrator's mortuary professional lens (rinsing instruments, gel on skin, towels and tubing as theater). The ink pot's "rings like the timeline of a small moon" charges the final image when it returns to the cabinet after signing witness, fulfilling the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—help Arman reach asylum without lying—is signaled early and tightens through the taught breach window: shift change, alarm reset, the director's habit of leaving the bolt hanging. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens as each beat (waiting actively, camera theater, the reset chime) narrows the escape corridor. The protagonist's agency is clear: choosing to sign witness and carry the laundered-bribe evidence to the clinic attorney forecloses the path of silent complicity with visible cost (the risk of testimony). One meaningful deepening occurs when the sponsors hand over the account numbers, transforming the escape from mercy into a fair trade with proof that can balance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the ink pot's transformation: from the father's tool for forging "tenderness into contracts" to the protagonist's instrument for signing witness, enacting "the mathematics of a fair trade that cancels debts cleanly." The final image—cleaning Arman's warmth away while the ink pot sits "a little moon with tides that answer to hands"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the premise without stating a moral. The "new vowel of fairness" risks slight abstraction but is earned by the ledger kept "for court, for dignity, for counting the bargain." Subtext operates in the breach shaped like inattention, "exact and kind as a key," and in the whispered plan that will not lie but will not name him dead.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and poetic with controlled diction: "deathly vitality held too long in the mouth," "the room answers back," "breach that looks like routine and not like courage." Perceptual signature is consistent—mortuary professional with lyric compression—and modulates under pressure ("the air stays dead, then wakes a little"). No dialogue, so voice rests entirely on narrative texture. Psychic distance is stable; focalization remains tight to the narrator's knowledge and bias. The father's ink pot and "carnival math" anchor reflection in present choice without head-hopping. Filter verbs ("I think of my father") are voice-motivated and legible. POV certainty matches what the narrator can know; inference reads as inference.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are diverse and information density is high (most lines do two jobs: advance plot and charge imagery). "Waiting actively is like polishing a mirror; the reflection arrives because the cloth never stops" is fresh and voice-specific. Minor issues: "small moon, stubborn and elegant" and "little moon with tides" recur without added pressure; "liquefies rigid thinking in me with a sound" is slightly opaque. A few adjacent lines paraphrase the fairness-math concept ("inverse function," "mathematics of a fair trade," "proportion"), creating mild synonym churn in the thematic register. No template cadence or filter stacks. Propulsion is strong; peak beats (reset chime, handing the ledger) remain clear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The premise—mortuary worker smuggling asylum-seeker by faking body donation—is a fresh synthesis of funeral-home procedural and political-asylum narrative. The "breach shaped like inattention" (the director's habit of leaving the bolt hanging) feels earned in hindsight rather than convenient. The ink-pot transformation (con artist's tool → witness signature) and the ledger kept "for court, for dignity" give the escape moral calculus beyond simple heroism. Voice and thematic stance cohere as a singular vision. Risk-taking in lyric compression and the "waiting actively" method heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, warranting a modest bonus within band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The "con artist's honest child" frames the narrator's opening stance ("I wash the dead because it is honest work in a dishonest family") and drives the key choice to help Arman with a ledger and witness signature rather than the father's fraud. The attribute shapes the tactic: keeping the ledger "in my cramped handwriting for court, for dignity," signing with the father's ink to "sign witness" instead of forging. The closing line—"feel the new vowel of fairness arrive"—reweights the inheritance. The character's choices create the escape and the testimony turn. Early signal, two distinct beats (prep-room decision, signing witness), closure linkage, and visible cost (risk of testimony) present.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The vintage ink pot appears in three beats: stored next to the blue-stamped papers, used by the director to sign a form, and returned to the cabinet after the narrator signs witness. Its "rings like the timeline of a small moon" and "tides that answer to hands" charge the closure image. The ink's transformation from the father's forgery tool to the protagonist's testimony instrument is irreplaceable and shapes the ending's resonance. The pot's physical presence (glass scarred by rings, liquid that sloshes) constrains the signing ritual. Early signal, development (director's use), and closure payoff all present.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Political asylum shapes the dominant stake: Arman requires proof of danger, the sponsors need him to testify, and the narrator must help him reach safety without lying. The concept drives tactics (disguising him as a teaching-hospital donor, the service-elevator route, the reset-chime window) and the final trade: the narrator will carry laundered-bribe evidence to the clinic attorney. The closure turns on testimony and recorded breach, making asylum the pivot. Early signal ("Help Arman reach political asylum"), middle beat (sponsors passing invisible passport and code words), and ending participation (evidence for asylum proof) all present. The concept is indispensable; removing it breaks the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Liquefies rigid thinking" is attributed to the ink pot's sound and metaphorically extends to the protagonist's shift from the father's carnival math to fairness. The attribute enables the protagonist's willingness to see the breach as "shaped like inattention, exact and kind as a key" rather than mere risk. Its cost is slight—conceptual rather than tactical—and it does not constrain a middle choice as sharply as other elements. The phrase appears once with action (uncapping the ink so it breathes, then signing) and returns implicitly in the closing "new vowel of fairness." Two-gate presence (setup in cabinet scene, closure image) but weaker middle development and lower causal pressure than top-tier elements.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The breach—alarm reset at shift change, the brief open gate—is the story's hinge. It is set up early ("Our plan depends on a breach that looks like routine and not like courage"), developed through the director's habit of leaving the bolt hanging, and executed in the climax when "the reset chime dings; the camera light goes dead and blinks again." The breach defines the escape window, constrains the timing, and enables the dolly-push through the service door. Removing the breach collapses the plot. Early signal, two beats (habit established, reset executed), closure linkage (van waiting, signing in the breach window), causal pressure, and irreplaceability all strong.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Waiting actively" is defined early ("attending to the room until the room answers back," "polishing a mirror; the reflection arrives because the cloth never stops") and demonstrated in the prep-room theater: making motions with towels and tubing, singing low, rinsing instruments. The method shapes the middle beats—patient observation that reads the director's habit and the reset-chime rhythm—and enables the breach. It appears in three beats (definition, prep-room theater, final cleaning) and charges the closure when the narrator cleans Arman's warmth away, completing the active waiting. Early signal, development (theater for the camera), and payoff (cleaning after escape) present. Causal pressure moderate; the method is less indispensable than the breach itself.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The funeral home prep room anchors every beat: steel table, pumps, vents, cabinet, service elevator, floor polisher, exhaust door. The setting supplies the disguise (Arman as donor body), the tools (cart, gel, tubing), and the constraints (security camera, director's inspection, the bolt). The prep room's layout and routines enable the escape and charge the ending when the narrator returns to clean the table's warmth. Spatial choreography is clear and causal; removing the setting breaks the plot. Early anchor, middle beats (director's inspection, camera theater, dolly-roll down hallway), and closure participation (table still warm, ink pot in cabinet) all present. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The motivation—"to find the mathematics of a fair trade that cancels debts cleanly"—is dramatized through the ledger kept for court, the refusal to lie, and the final signing of witness in exchange for laundered-bribe evidence. It drives the protagonist's choice to help Arman with proof rather than mercy alone, and it creates friction: the father's carnival math versus the inverse function. The desire shapes two beats (keeping the ledger, signing witness) and charges the closure ("feel the new vowel of fairness arrive"). Early signal, causal pressure, closure linkage, and visible cost (testimony risk) present. The abstraction ("mathematics," "inverse function") is purposeful but slightly lowers embodied immediacy compared to more concrete motivations.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The tone—"deathly vitality held too long in the mouth"—is introduced in the opening and sustained through oxymoron and lyric compression: Arman "not dead, pretending expertly," the air that "stays dead, then wakes a little," the warmth the narrator cleans away. The tone modulates with pressure: tense waiting ("every sound is a calendar without numbers") gives way to quiet action (singing low, dolly-push) and resolves in the final cleaning, where the ink pot sits "a little moon" after the escape. The tone is coherent across turns and charges the final image. Early signal, consistent application, and closure modulation all present. Tone is indispensable to the story's emotional texture.</comment>
