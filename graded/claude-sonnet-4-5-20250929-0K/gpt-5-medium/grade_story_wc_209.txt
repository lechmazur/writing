<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator's contemplative stance is sustained through sensory anchors (pressing palm to glass, grinding pigments) and the grandmother's postcards provide embodied history. Interior life remains consistently lyric-reflective rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses under pressure. The final panel delivery and verger's revelation feel received rather than chosen, limiting agency. Motivation is signaled but the arc reads more as accumulation than transformation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of layered perception (glass, postcards, scent) that culminates in the pavilion moment where grandmother's final card reweights all prior material. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): "my murals were doors" crystallizes the threshold between artist and ancestor with conceptual cost (the work is no longer solely hers). Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (studio, cathedral, winter). One meaningful deepening occurs when the draft carries tobacco scent and the mural unfolds inside the narrator.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Etched glass, cathedral nave, amber pavilion, and the garden's trumpet flowers anchor spatially and constrain the narrator's attention across seasons. The pavilion's honey glass and resin-apple air charge the final beat when moths read the panels. Micro-setting (the cool pane, the scaffold) enables discovery. Sensory hierarchy reflects the artist's priorities: scent and light dominate; touch and visual texture support. Objects (postcards, pigments, candles) recur with purpose.</comment>

<issue>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: understanding nocturnal bloom as courtship/meaning beyond daylight. Pressure accumulates through seasonal labor and layered study (glass, postcards, scent, painting). One meaningful deepening: the draft/incense moment when "a hinge turn[s]" and the mural concept arrives. Agency is contemplative (waiting, mapping, grinding) rather than choice-driven; the verger's final postcard delivers resolution rather than the narrator earning it through a trade-off. Cost is conceptual (the work becomes inheritance) but felt mildly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—night as courtship with distant partners, not rebellion—emerges through specific images: moon moths, etched vines as wind channels, pavilion as amber shell. The final postcard and "doors" metaphor answer the opening question without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the grandmother's address ("Future Painter") and the narrator's realization that her hand is steadied by lineage. No thematic echo; the closure image (moths reading panels, verger's card) reweights daylight versus nocturnal perception with quiet resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single-POV first-person maintains lyric distance and perceptual signature (artist's eye for vine etchings, pollens as lamps). Diction is consistent and elevated ("umbral tenderness," "inchoate hush"), voice-appropriate for a mural artist steeped in botanical postcards. No dialogue; the verger and neighbors appear as benign presences without distinct speech. Purposeful compression (months pass in summary) serves accumulative design. One slip: "dawning hush" recurs five times, risking template cadence, but the phrase is thematically load-bearing and each use slightly shifts context.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings shift. Information density is high in sensory anchors (cloves, iron, trumpet flowers). Two frictions: "dawning hush" appears five times, creating mild template echo; several lines loop conceptually ("Night, I thought, is not the opposite of day but a careful engraving" / "night blooming…was not rebellion but courtship"). Figurative language is dense but coherent (pollens, beads, gloved hands). No hard clarity breaks. Propulsion slows in the middle montage (spring–summer panels) where summary replaces scene.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Premise—artist decodes nocturnal bloom via cathedral glass and ancestral postcards—synthesizes art-process, botanical lore, and lineage in a non-obvious frame. "Dawning hush" and "umbral tenderness" are fresh coinages. The grandmother-as-Future-Painter twist and moths-as-readers elevate the ending. Risk: lyric compression and contemplative pacing over dramatized choice. One derivative note: artist-seeks-meaning-through-craft is a familiar template, but the etched-glass method and pavilion payoff transform it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The mural artist observes, waits, maps, and paints but decisions (climbing scaffold, opening postcards, waiting at twilight, carrying the final panel) are low-stakes moves that accumulate rather than narrow options. No on-page choice forecloses a path with visible cost. Present across all three gates (setup, middle, closure) but causal pressure is mild.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Postcards appear early, are read and sketched in the middle (one depicts the pavilion window), and the final card arrives at closure to reweight the work as inheritance. Three distinct beats with causal linkage (cards teach wind channels → narrator maps panels → final card confirms prophecy). Cost is conceptual (agency shared with ancestor). Swappable with "journal" or "letters" without major structural change.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Dawning hush" appears in setup (cathedral nave), recurs as description (vespers, pavilion), and charges the final beat ("the whole pavilion held a dawning hush"). It names the threshold state between day and night, aligning with the stake. Does not constrain a choice but reweights the closure image with lyric resonance. Recurrence feels purposeful but the concept remains atmospheric.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Quietly driven" is signaled early and sustained (grinding pigments before dawn, staying past midnight) but functions as label-only trait. No on-page moment where this attribute forecloses a loud or overt action with visible cost. It colors the narrator's steadiness but does not enable or constrain a key turn.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Reckon" appears six times, naming the narrator's method (reckon the pattern by scent, neighbors reckon patience). It ties to the stake (understanding bloom) and charges small beats (reckoning doubt into patience). Present in setup and closure but does not drive a major turn that swappable verbs ("discern," "intuit") could not. Lyric cohesion but mid-causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The etched-glass method is introduced early (verger lets narrator study hidden layers), tested mid-story (draft through glass layers carries scent), and echoed at closure (amber pavilion filters sun through copied cathedral scenes). It shapes the narrator's discovery (layered perception → layered painting) and charges the ending when dusk sinks through amber into etched scenes. Two beats with closure linkage. Specific and irreplaceable mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Amber pavilion appears late (final third) but serves as the closure location where moths read panels and the final postcard reveals grandmother's prophecy. It does not constrain earlier choices. Sensory detail (honey glass, resin-apple air) enriches the ending but the setting could swap with "gallery" or "exhibition hall" without breaking logic. Late-arrival and swappability cap the score despite closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Across the melting of winter's last snow" frames the timespan (late winter → autumn fair). Snow melts in the opening third, spring and summer pass in summary, autumn arrives at closure. Time does not tighten decisions; the narrator works at her own pace. The seasons mirror the mural's completion but function as backdrop rather than pressure. Early signal and closure bracket, but no causal constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The motivation—understanding nocturnal bloom—is signaled in the opening question, drives the study sequence (glass, postcards, scent, painting), and is answered at closure ("courtship…with distant partners"). Friction: the discovery feels received (draft, verger's card) rather than wrested through conflicting wants. Desire shapes tactics but lacks on-page resistance or cost. Three beats with closure payoff.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Umbral tenderness" names the tone (shadow softness: bats like gloved hands, beetles like beads, expectancy as dark petal). It modulates from studio quiet to pavilion hush, charging the moths-and-children ending. Coherent through turns and present in closure image. One slip: "umbral" appears only once as direct label; the effect is sustained through imagery rather than recurring diction. Tone shapes the final image's gentleness.</comment>
