<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is specific and voice-driven ("I disguise wisdom as foolishness because truth slips past when dressed like a jester"), and the choice to stitch the falsified routes shows agency under pressure. However, the protagonist remains observational through most beats; the keeper and the conspirators act off-page, reducing on-page struggle. The final act—tucking the embroidery away and accepting blame—reads as renunciation with cost, but the emotional stakes feel muted because we never see the narrator wrestle with competing desires in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (cobalt observatory, autumn, narrator with satchel) arrive promptly. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the narrator accepts blame and carries the rumor forward, crystallizing stance with the cost of future scapegoating made explicit ("You will be blamed"). The escalation accumulates through stitching → whisper → names in ash → keeper's warning, and the final image (eternal candle set to watch) reweights prior vigilance motifs. One persistent gap: the coup "rehearses each night in the dust" but remains abstract; the consequence of carrying the embroidery is asserted more than dramatized, slightly softening closure impact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The observatory is grounded early (cobalt, domes, brass rails, eternal candle, telescopes, unused charts) and sensory detail is filtered through the narrator's craft bias (dust constellations, cloth trembling, candle bending). The eternal candle constrains a mid-beat choice (cupping with glass glove, contracting flame when blood is added) and charges the final image (set near window to watch). Spatial choreography is clean. Minor gap: the coup and falsified star charts remain conceptual backdrop rather than pressing the narrator's immediate movements; the setting enriches atmosphere more than it narrows tactical options.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: carry the conspiracy's rumor safely without triggering the coup prematurely. The narrator's stitching deepens pressure in discrete steps (pattern opens throat, whisper tells of falsified charts, names slip into fibers), and the keeper's warning ("You will be blamed") tightens options by making cost explicit. The final choice—accepting the embroidery and a place to sleep—is a renunciation of safety with visible cost. One weakness: the conspirators and their tactics remain off-page, so the opposition feels atmospheric rather than embodied; no on-page antagonist tests the narrator's tactics directly, slightly dulling escalation bite.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme (truth hidden in foolishness, conspiracies loosened by listening rather than cutting) emerges through the narrator's craft and is never stated baldly. The recurring candle flame and stitching motifs accumulate meaning without becoming checklist symbols. The final image—candle set to watch, names staining cloth until the coup resolves—offers a resonant non-literal answer to the central question of how to carry dangerous knowledge. One missed opportunity: the theme of synchronizing adjacent possibilities is introduced mid-story and remains abstract; grounding it in a concrete micro-choice earlier would have sharpened the conceptual payoff.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and sustained: lyric compression ("rumor is a wandering star," "doors beside doors"), purposeful archaism ("starwash"), and a perceptual signature that privileges pattern and sound over visual catalog. Psychic distance is stable first-person. No head-hopping. The prose teaches its pattern early (pauses, shivers, whispers) and maintains it through closure. Minor slip: a few lines approach workshop idiom ("I disguise wisdom as foolishness because truth slips past") that reads slightly thesis-like, but the effect is brief and does not flatten voice elsewhere.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high ("sky were cold and wanted a shawl," "moth," "cello under the stars") and mostly coherent, supporting the lyric mode. Sentence openings vary. Information density is solid; most lines advance image or Stakes. Two deductions: (1) paraphrase loop in the middle third—"whisper told me," "whisper hardened into speech"—restates without added pressure (−0.2); (2) filter-verb stack in reflective beats ("I recognized," "I asked," "I told") clusters in three adjacent paragraphs, slightly dulling immediacy (−0.3). Subtract −0.5 total. The final image is clean and propulsive, so non-closure cap applies.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of embroidery-as-intelligence-gathering, synchronizing adjacent possibilities, and the fool-as-truth-carrier is specific and non-obvious. The eternal candle as both tool and witness adds fresh texture. Risk-taking in voice (lyric compression, unconventional objects) heightens atmosphere without obscuring Stakes. One limit: the conspiracy mechanics and the coup's threat remain generic backdrop; the story does not transform the "secret knowledge before political upheaval" template through unique moral calculus or lived occupational detail that would make removal of this exact conspiracy impossible. Still, the narrator's craft and the synchronization method provide enough particularity to lift the piece above derivative.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Galaxy-chart embroiderer: Introduced in the opening, drives two distinct beats (stitching the pattern that opens the whisper, gathering thread ends to make new current), and participates in closure by tucking the embroidery into the satchel and accepting blame. The occupation enables the synchronization method and the fool's disguise. Not indispensable—a different artisan role could serve—but the embroidery metaphor charges the final image of names staining cloth. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, moderate specificity +0.4, cost tie +0.4 = baseline ~6.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Flame from eternal candle: Present in opening third (keeper cups it with glass glove), drives two beats (contracts when narrator pricks finger and adds blood; bends left/right counting footsteps), and appears in closure (set near window to watch). The candle's reactions narrow options (contraction signals the pattern opening) and its final placement charges the image of ongoing vigilance. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +0.9, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.6 = baseline ~7.7; round to 7.8 for the candle's active participation in escalation.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Unraveling conspiracies: Signaled in the middle third ("Unraveling conspiracies is not cutting; it is easing the knot"), drives one major beat (loosening threads where falsified routes crossed), and participates in closure (narrator promises to carry the rumor safely, knowing blame will follow). The concept shapes Stakes (how to expose conspiracy without triggering coup) and tactics (listening, stitching pauses). Early signal modest (appears ~40% in) −0.3, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +0.9, moderate specificity +0.5 = baseline ~6.0; add +0.4 for the concept's integration with the fool disguise.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Disguises wisdom as foolishness: Introduced early ("I disguise wisdom as foolishness because truth slips past"), enables one on-page action (narrator's quips and dropped stitches convince keeper to let them listen), and participates in closure (accepting blame "because only the fool is permitted to be everywhere"). The trait constrains choice (must perform foolishness to gain access) with visible cost (future scapegoating). Early signal +0.6, one beat +0.4, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +0.8, cost tie +0.4 = baseline ~6.0; deduct −0.2 for label-like phrasing that borders on thesis.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Synchronize: Introduced mid-story ("you can synchronize them with a timid fingertip"), drives two beats (narrator and keeper synchronize breathing to the candle's measure; doors click like teeth), and participates in closure indirectly (the synchronized breath enables the ratcheting lock choice). The action is signaled but its mechanics remain abstract; a clearer on-page consequence of synchronization failure would sharpen causal pressure. Late first mention −0.4, two beats +0.9, causal pressure moderate +0.7, closure linkage indirect +0.5, swappability moderate −0.3 = baseline ~6.4; add +0.3 for the breathing beat's embodied specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Through adjacent possibilities: Introduced mid-story ("paths run that close, you can synchronize them"), enables the stitching method (corridors beside corridors, doors beside doors), and participates in closure metaphorically (sleep as travel through adjacent possibilities). The method is signaled but remains conceptual; no on-page moment shows the narrator choosing between adjacent paths with Stakes riding on the distinction. Late mention −0.4, two touches (stitching, sleep) +0.9, causal pressure weak +0.3, closure participation metaphoric +0.4, high swappability −0.6 = baseline ~4.6; add +0.5 for the method's thematic resonance with the fool's liminality.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Cobalt observatory in autumn: Anchored in opening line, supplies resources across three beats (eternal candle, unused charts, window for final candle placement), and participates in closure (maple leaves clacking outside, candle set near window). The observatory's domes and brass rails ground the listening craft, and the autumn leaves provide the final auditory image. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure moderate +0.6, closure linkage +0.9, specificity +0.5 = baseline ~7.1; deduct −0.5 because the observatory functions mostly as atmosphere—no locked door, missing tool, or spatial constraint narrows the narrator's tactical options.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Before the coup: Introduced in opening paragraph, tightens Stakes in one major beat (keeper says "the coup rehearses each night in the dust"), and participates in closure (names will stain cloth "until the coup finished, or failed"). The timeframe creates urgency in principle but remains abstract; no on-page countdown or escalating event horizon narrows the narrator's window for action. Early signal +0.6, two touches +0.9, causal pressure modest +0.5, closure linkage +0.6, live-clock weakness −0.7 = baseline ~5.9.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>To listen for unheard stories: Stated early ("I came to listen for unheard stories floating in the telescopes"), drives two beats (narrator asks keeper to let them listen, then stitches what they hear in pauses), and participates in closure (the carried embroidery is the harvested story). The motivation is dramatized through the stitching action and the choice to accept blame. Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +0.8, cost tie +0.5 = baseline ~7.7; deduct −1.4 because the desire never conflicts with another want on the page—no moment where listening costs the narrator safety or relationship in real time, only future blame asserted at the end.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Echoed silence: Established early ("The halls kept an echoed silence"), sustained through key beats (heavens ticked, dust made constellations, whisper climbed, observatory thrummed), modulates with pressure (silence → whisper → speech), and charges the final image (maple leaves clacking, a choir we could not see). Tone is coherent and purposeful, anchoring the lyric mode. Early signal +0.7, pervasive presence (four+ touches) +1.4, modulation under pressure +0.8, closure charge +1.0, specificity +0.6 = baseline ~8.5; deduct −1.1 because the tone does not shift decisively at the climax—echoed silence persists uniformly, missing a tonal break that would mark the conspiracy's exposure or the narrator's acceptance of cost.</comment>
