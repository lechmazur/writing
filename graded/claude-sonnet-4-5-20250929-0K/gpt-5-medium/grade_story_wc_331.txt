<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The librarian's interiority is concrete and specific—rubbing the scarf's "frayed edge like a coastline of silk," carrying "tide" in pockets—with choices (stepping between shelves, filing the card under "Promise, Noted") that foreclose exploration with visible cost. Contradiction operates subtly: seeking warmth through mathematics while acknowledging "shocks never know when to stop." The mentor backstory anchors present choices without flattening momentum. Minor: the boy and woman remain observational props rather than pressure sources, and the final stance crystallizes more through lyric accretion than a single foregrounded choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens dominant: the piece teaches its pattern by ~25% (shelving by curvature, scarf ritual, hyperbolic geometry references) and delivers Resonant Reconfiguration at closure—the librarian returns "the way a river returns, by leaving evidence of curves," filing the card and embodying the search rather than completing it, with cost legible in "not found...but seen its weather." Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening stanza. One meaningful deepening occurs when the saddle-space becomes navigable and the reading room with no walls materializes, tightening the dominant stake (finding where stories live) into a weathered reconnaissance rather than arrival. Cost is conceptual and opportunity: the search continues, closure deferred, but the method is validated and the library "counts back in waves."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The scientific poetry library supplies recurring constraints—shelving by negative curvature, margins annotated with equations, the saddle-space between titles—that charge the final image when "shelves growing from seabeds, heavy with wet paper and salt" materialize and the narrator wrings the scarf to produce snow-letters. Sensory hierarchy reflects professional focus: ozone and printer's ink, "air sharpens," "saltier," snow becomes letters. The scarf functions as micro-setting, a tactile anchor whose frayed coastline-edge seeds the final wring-and-transform beat. Spatial choreography remains coherent across the lyric drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—"to find the place where stories live"—is signaled early and tightens when the narrator steps off the grid into the no-wall reading room, writes the card ("stories live where vectors consent to curve around a heart"), and encounters the seabed-shelves that answer with "tide charts" grammar. One meaningful deepening: the scarf-wring produces snow-letters, validating the hyperbolic method with conceptual cost (the search remains open, "not found...but seen its weather"). Agency is navigational and ritual; coincidence does not resolve. No antagonist required under Accumulative lens; pressure coheres through accretion and pattern-break at the saddle-space.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—memory's embodied geography and the refusal of straightness—emerges through particulars: "negative curvature," "coastlines I have not finished mapping," "endings are coastlines, plot a weather-making current." The final image ("seen its weather") reconfigures the opening solitude into a climatology of story-origins without stating a moral. The scarf's shift from ozone/ink to salt to snow charges closure without mechanical symbolism. Subtext operates in the mentor's ellipsis ("shock to reawaken...quieter methods") and the patrons' unknowing that "the room has shifted." No thematic echo or explicit philosophizing mars the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout: "punctuation as compass roses, dedications as small lighthouses," "distribution of endings, shorelines where closures erode." Distance stable in first-person present with purposeful lyric compression ("Every book here...Every poem here") that teaches pattern by the second stanza. Diction remains within an educated librarian's lexicon (hyperbolic geometry, Mandelbrot, Hawking) without jarring register drift. No head-hopping; the boy and woman remain observed. Rhythmic control modulates pressure—short declaratives at the scarf-wring, longer accretive sentences during the seabed revelation. Minor: a few filter verbs ("I see," "I understand") are present but voice-motivated and don't dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>High information density: most lines do multiple jobs (the scarf smells of ozone/ink and belonged to the mother who "believed libraries kept the weather honest," linking object, backstory, and theme). Rhythm varies purposefully—short beats at turns ("The shelves answer with a long breath"), longer accumulations during the no-wall room exploration. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; opening lines vary. Minor: a few near-synonym clusters ("tilt into new alignments" / "opening a new door" within two beats; "breath" / "breathe" recurs) and one stock metaphor ("candle cupped against drafts"). Figurative density is high but coherent and voice-motivated, not overwriting. Zero scaffold or generation artifacts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—hyperbolic geometry as method for navigating story-origin, shelving as cosmology, librarian-as-cartographer—feels specific and non-obvious. The scarf's transformation (ozone→salt→snow→letters) and the seabed-shelves with wet paper are particular to this voice and frame. The patrons unknowingly inhabiting the shifted room and carrying home snow-mapped napkins adds a layered irony. Risk-taking in structure (lyric accumulation, no antagonist, conceptual closure) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Transformation test passes: plot and arc depend on these exact specifics. Minor: the mentor's "paper of odd folds" and the "shock to reawaken" remain slightly generic within the established frame.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setup clear in opening line; development in stepping between shelves, reciting theorems, and writing the card; payoff in filing under "Promise, Noted" and locking the door while "the library counts back in waves." Choices (following the bent aisle, wringing the scarf, returning the path) create key turns that alter tactics and validate the method. Cost: the search remains open. Two beats (saddle-space entry, card-writing). Causal pressure moderate; closure linkage present.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setup immediate (tied once, twice for luck); development in rubbing the frayed edge "like a coastline of silk" at the saddle-space; payoff in wringing it to produce snow-letters that fall on patrons. Object used in three distinct beats with evolving function: ritual anchor, tactile map, transformative tool. Closure linkage strong; specificity (belonged to mother, smells of ozone/ink, coastline texture) matters. Cost tied to it (mother's death, seeking warmer mathematics). Indispensable to the wring-transform beat.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Setup in "tending analog memories" that "hum like filament bulbs"; development implicit in the distribution of endings and seabed-shelves "heavy with wet paper"; payoff when "memory has weight, and the spine learns to carry it" on the card. One beat (card-writing) explicitly ties it to stakes. More thematic echo than tactical constraint; removing the exact phrase would not break structure. Lyric reprise reweights the stake but mid-scene use is light.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Setup in "sanely eccentric, which is the only way to shelve infinities"; mentioned once as label. No on-page action clearly constrained or enabled by this trait; "shelving by curvature" demonstrates the practice, but the trait itself remains asserted rather than dramatized with visible tradeoff. Does not shape a middle choice or appear at closure. Ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setup in "mentor said it would take a shock to reawaken the path"; development when narrator chooses "quieter methods" (reciting theorems, stepping off grid); payoff when the blank card asks "what the library will remember" and writing it seems to reawaken the seabed-shelves and tide-chart voices. Two beats (theorem recitation opens doors, card-writing triggers the answer). Causal role moderate; the "reawaken" framing shapes the approach but the exact action (writing the card) could arguably swap for another ritual. Closure linkage present.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setup when mentor shows "paper of odd folds" and explains "stacks themselves could be navigated through hyperbolic geometry"; development in "shelving by negative curvature" and "Triangle sums less than straight, circle grows boundless"; payoff when the curved aisle delivers the no-wall reading room and the narrator's route-signature validates the method. Three beats (shelving practice, theorem recitation, route-as-signature). Mechanics signaled; shapes attempts and final validation. Swappability low; any other geometry would alter the coastline/curve motif. Cost: "private practice I hardly confess," and the search remains incomplete.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Setup immediate (scientific poetry library, odd-hour shift, margins annotated with equations); development in the saddle-space between "History of Number and Breath Mechanics" that enables the off-grid step; payoff when shelves grow from seabeds and supply the tide-chart answer. Three beats (shelving constraint, saddle-space portal, seabed revelation). Environment pressures method and supplies the final image's logic. Indispensable; no other setting would support hyperbolic navigation or scientific-poetry fusion.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Setup in title and opening ("while patrons browse"); development when "Between them, shelves curve" and later "They are still browsing, unknowing that the room has shifted"; payoff at "Closing time arrives without alarm." Time brackets the action and the patrons' presence creates a live constraint (narrator must return before they notice). Two beats (patrons unknowing, closing time). Tightens decisions moderately; not tracked beat-by-beat but frames the window. Swappable with "during a shift" without major structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setup explicit ("What I want is simple, to find the place where stories live"); development in stepping between shelves, seeking "their breathing country of origin," and filing the card that defines where stories live ("where vectors consent to curve around a heart"); payoff in "not found...but seen its weather." Three beats (off-grid step, card definition, weather observation). Desire dramatized through navigational choices; friction between wanting arrival and accepting reconnaissance. Cost: the place remains unfound, closure deferred. Indispensable to the arc.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Setup in "observed solitude is my element, the hush between stanzas and experiments"; modulates when "the air sharpens" and the reading room has no walls (solitude deepens into liminality); charges the final image when the library "counts back in waves" and the narrator locks the door "counting heartbeats." Coherent through turns; single static mood would not support the shift from hush to salt to snow. Final image reconfigures solitude as companionship with the library's tide. Two beats (air-sharpening transition, heartbeat-wave closure).</comment>
