<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is concrete and voice-particular ("bone setting, like truth, hurts first and then holds"), with embodied skepticism driving micro-choices throughout. Internal contradiction operates cleanly: the narrator doubts yet acts with mercy, a stance that earns the final choice to "tell it plain" with visible cost (sheltering Ari while facing town clamor). Ari's shame and Linnet's "shrewdly innocent" presence add secondary pressure, though Linnet's trait remains more labeled than dramatized in choice. The shoulder-setting scene demonstrates professional competence balanced with genuine emotional struggle, and the ending forecloses the witch-tale path with felt relational cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors promptly (bone-setter narrator, post-substitute-body timeframe, hedge maze). The piece operates under a Hybrid lens leaning Accumulative/Textural: pressure deepens through discovered objects (tooth, sketch, Ari's emergence) and culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the narrator and Ari choose mercy over the town's narrative, crystallizing stance with visible social cost ("The town would clamor tomorrow"). The tooth→sketch→Ari sequence creates motivated ellipsis and tightens options cleanly. Cost is legible in the final image: they accept tomorrow's reckoning to "hold" tonight, and the stars are reframed as witnesses rather than omens—a reweighting that reconfigures the opening's "cleft in certainty."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The secret garden functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: "mint and iron," the fountain's "dialect of abandoned plans," and the lattice where the tooth is found all pressure the investigation and charge the final leaving of the tooth "under the fountain stone." Spatial choreography is coherent (maze→bench→Ari's emergence→wrapping his shoulder). The hedge as shifting constellation-map and the "deep blue hour" anchor the closing stance without postcard drift. Sensory detail is filtered through the bone-setter's professional eye (dentin rings, joint mechanics) and selective without catalog bloat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—protecting Ari and reframing blame—is signaled early and tightens through discoveries (tooth, map, Ari's emergence with dislocated shoulder). The narrator's agency drives escalation: choosing to enter the maze, examining evidence, setting the shoulder, and committing to "tell it plain" despite town pressure. One meaningful reversal occurs when Ari emerges, transforming the investigation into an immediate medical and moral choice. The resolution is earned by the protagonist's renunciation of the witch-tale and acceptance of social cost, with visible price (tomorrow's clamor) that alters tactics (leaving the tooth as burial, walking home carrying "the ache of repairs").</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—turning mistakes into constellations—emerges organically from Ari's map, the narrator's bone-setting philosophy, and the final reframing of blame as navigation points rather than scars. The tooth burial and star-witness image offer a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question (how to hold mercy in a blaming town) without moralizing. Subtext operates in Ari's nod at the tooth, the garden's "abandoned plans," and the contrast between the town's "witch tale" and the narrator's "ours." The closing image ("bright bones of the sky, set just so that we could heal") reweights prior material—bone-setting as metaphor for moral repair—with quiet conceptual cost and zero sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and voice-particular throughout: "voices thinned like smoke," "doubt is brave," "grief is a mineral." Psychic distance is stable first-person with no head-hopping; perceptual signature (bone-setter's attention to joints, stress marks, alignment) remains consistent under pressure. Diction stays within the narrator's plausible lexicon, blending clinical precision with lyric compression ("patient choreography," "reduction well made"). Purposeful compression and elision (the substitute body's wrongness, the child's drowning) are taught early and pay off at closure without obscuring causality. Brief dialogue (Linnet, Ari) carries subtext and goal pursuit; Ari's "hissed, then sighed" sequence and Linnet's whispered clue both advance plot and reveal character.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot without padding. Rhythm varies purposefully; figurative language ("smoke," "minerals," "constellations") is compressed and coherent, avoiding mixed metaphors. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs; sentence openings vary cleanly. Minor filter-verb presence ("I saw," "I felt") is voice-motivated and does not dull immediacy. The read-aloud test passes: "After the substitute body is found, a cleft in certainty opens under every step" shifts from exposition to embodied perception smoothly, and the final paragraph's syntactic variation ("careful," "learning," "bright bones") creates visual rhythm without drumbeat monotony.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—bone-setting as literal and metaphorical repair, hedge maze as constellation map, changeling myth reframed through autism-coded difference—feels specific and non-obvious. The premise avoids the template "magical realism solves grief" by grounding the tooth and substitute body in social cruelty rather than literal fae logic. Emotional specificity (Ari's shame eroding him "into someone else," the narrator's "ache of repairs") avoids generic templates. The final turn (reframing mistakes as navigation rather than omens) arises from established pattern (the map, the shoulder reduction) and feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in voice (compressed lyricism, medical/mythic juxtaposition) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The forgiving skeptic shapes three key beats: entering the maze despite doubt, examining the tooth with professional lens, and choosing to "tell it plain" rather than accept the town's witch-tale. The narrator's skepticism constrains early moves (pocketing the tooth "like a clue" while doubting "fae economies") and enables the final mercy choice, with visible cost (facing tomorrow's clamor). The trait is embodied in action and perception throughout, driving the closure stance.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The tooth appears in three beats: discovery in the soil, examination under moonlight (dentin rings reveal stress), and burial under the fountain stone at closure. It bridges the changeling myth to Ari's real grief and charges the final image as "a small moon for the roots to orbit." However, its role is more symbolic reprise than causal driver; the story would function with a different token. The reweighting at closure lifts it above ornamental but not to indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The "cleft in certainty" frames the dominant stake explicitly ("After the substitute body is found, a cleft in certainty opens under every step") and shapes tactics: the narrator investigates rather than accepts the town's resolution, Ari hides in the maze, and the final choice to "straddle" the cleft drives the closure stance. It recurs in the ending (stars as "witnesses" rather than "omens") and constrains the social cost of their mercy. The concept is more than thematic echo—it alters options on the page.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Linnet is labeled "shrewdly innocent and grass-kneed" but the trait constrains no visible choice with cost. She guides the narrator to the maze and fetches water, both helpful actions that fit a child's role but do not demonstrate the tension between shrewdness and innocence through on-page tradeoff. The attribute remains more descriptor than dramatized complexity.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Yearning appears in two key beats: Ari's "yearn for green" (his gardening as displaced grief) and the narrator's closing commitment to "yearn without lying." The action shapes the final stance—honesty about longing rather than fabrication—and charges the closure image. It is present early (Ari's garden work) and reweighted at the end, but could be reframed as "grieve" or "hope" with minor edits; not fully indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Bone setting is signaled early ("I had set more wrists than clocks"), demonstrates mechanics in the shoulder reduction scene ("patient choreography, a hush, a traction"), and serves as the governing metaphor for the closure choice ("setting a story" = moral realignment with cost). The method constrains the narrator's professional identity, enables trust with Ari, and charges the final image ("bright bones of the sky, set just so that we could heal"). Removing it would collapse both the literal climax and thematic unity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The secret garden pressures choices: it hides Ari, supplies the tooth and map as evidence, and provides the setting for the shoulder reduction and tooth burial. The hedge maze as navigable constellation-map constrains investigation and charges the closure (they leave through a path "set, like a reduction well made"). The fountain and lattice supply tactile resources. Not mere postcard; the setting alters tactics and anchors the final image's resonance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The timeframe is signaled early and shapes urgency: the town has declared resolution via substitute body, Ari is in hiding, and night provides cover ("after dusk, when doubt is brave"). The time window tightens the final choice—they act tonight before tomorrow's clamor—and charges the closing image ("deep blue hour"). However, the clock is more atmospheric than mechanical; no moment-to-moment pressure from a visible countdown. One meaningful tightening present but not fully indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The motivation is dramatized in Ari's map ("turn mistakes into constellations, so they would guide rather than scare"), tested when the narrator chooses to shelter him despite social cost, and articulated at closure ("we would tell it plain...joining our blunders with brighter ink and naming them kindly"). The desire faces friction (town blame, risk of complicity) and drives the ending's moral calculus. The constellation metaphor recurs with escalating weight, though the final articulation edges toward statement rather than pure dramatization.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Nostalgic innovation operates consistently: the narrator uses traditional bone-setting augmented by "a magnifier, nostalgic innovation strapped to an old trade," and the garden holds "abandoned plans" while they chart new moral routes. Tone modulates with pressure (lyric compression during discovery, clinical focus during the shoulder reduction, quiet resolve at closure) and charges the final image (stars as "bright bones" merge old craft with new meaning). The blend of archaic idiom and fresh metaphor remains coherent through turns without static mood.</comment>
