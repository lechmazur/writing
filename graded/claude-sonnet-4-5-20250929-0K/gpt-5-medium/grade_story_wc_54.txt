<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The intern's interiority is concrete and particular—"functionally creative" operates as both identity and constraint. The decision to "angle myself toward solutions" with the sextant shows embodied choice-making, and the progression from solitary equations to collaborative mapping with the janitor tracks a genuine arc. Minor weakness: the mother's arrival feels slightly convenient, but the intern's choice to let "the sinks speak mathematics" rather than explain demonstrates earned restraint. Motivation remains consistent and pressure-driven throughout.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the terminal "no longer pretending to be empty" and the intern sleeping with "wonder steadied by work" crystallize the shift from abandoned ruin to functioning mercy with visible cost (tomorrow's "proportional headaches"). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density increases through layered flows (rain, power, air) and the cadence shifts from diagnostic observation to collaborative action. Orientation anchors cleanly in the opening paragraph. The cost is both felt (exhaustion, ongoing maintenance) and conceptual (hope as "tested by maintenance").</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The terminal functions as active setting: duct vanes, valve handles, breakers, and skylights constrain the intern's choices at each junction. Sensory detail is filtered through engineering POV—"flows were wrong," "circuits murmured"—and the sextant piece as micro-setting charges the final image when set on the counter "catching the starless light." Spatial choreography remains coherent across concourse, medbay, archives, and ballroom. The abandoned spaceport's layered history (evacuation routes under carnival chalk) provides texture without tourist-catalog exposition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—resurrect function in a dead building—signals early and tightens when the janitor's concrete needs (shelter buses, brighten clinic) transform the intern's abstract equations into shared purpose. The progression from solo technical work to collaborative mapping constitutes meaningful escalation under the Accumulative lens. Pressure builds through each redirected flow (rain gutters, breakers, escalator reversal), and the cost is legible: "proportional headaches of functioning mercy" and ongoing maintenance. The mother seeking a nap space dramatizes stakes without resolving them artificially.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete engineering actions rather than statement: hope as system ("tested by maintenance") gains weight through valve adjustments and fan angles. The sextant piece—"measuring toward harbors nobody could see"—recharges at closure without spelling out its meaning. The intern's realization that "hope is engineered, not declared" arises from on-page struggle (rerouting flows, flipping breakers) and gains complexity when the janitor's needs refocus the work from abstraction to human necessity. The final line—"the terminal breathed out, and I breathed back"—offers resonant answer without moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voice remains stable and distinct: engineering idiom ("balancing gradients against distances like budgets of mercy") filters all perception. Psychic distance is controlled—the intern's uncertainty about equations coexists with technical confidence in a character-specific way. Dialogue with the janitor feels natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext (his wary "voice... eyes curious" before engagement). Minor slip: "functionally creative, the compliment both practical and haunting" edges toward self-aware labeling, though it recovers by shaping later choices. Perceptual signature (flows as currents, intentions as compass bearings) remains consistent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high—most lines advance setting, choice, or theme. Rhythm varies purposefully: short declarative sentences during diagnostic work ("The flows were wrong") shift to longer cumulative cadences at closure. Minor scaffold issues: "intentions had diverged" and "the building was following ghosts" restate the same idea within three lines (−0.2 paraphrase loop). A few figurative constructions cluster in the opening third ("windows mirrored dusk like paused galaxies," "silence took inventory") but remain legible and voice-consistent. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence runs; propulsion stays clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The premise—resurrect a spaceport terminal through engineering rather than narrative convenience—offers a fresh synthesis of infrastructure-as-character and practical mercy. The sextant piece as navigational fragment (not a magic tool) and the intern's equation-driven hope avoid template solutions. The janitor's shift from wary observer to collaborator feels earned rather than convenient. Risk: the lyric frame ("hope is a system, not a slogan") could tip toward abstraction, but the story grounds it in specific valve handles and breaker switches. Transformation test passes: plot and arc depend on these exact choices and this setting.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The civil engineer intern drives key turns: mapping currents (beat one), redirecting flows (beat two), and collaborating with the janitor to repaint floor lines and draft a volunteer roster (beat three). Observation leads to decision in each case—checking gauges, adjusting fan angles, opening skylights—and these choices alter tactics (from solo diagnosis to shared purpose) and outcome (terminal becomes shelter). The intern's engineering lens shapes perception throughout, and the final act of sleeping with the sextant "warm against my leg" demonstrates embodied commitment. Closure participation is strong: the intern's breathing in sync with the terminal crystallizes the relationship.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The sextant piece appears in three beats: carried to junctions for alignment (middle), set on counter at dusk catching light (near end), and warm against leg during sleep (closure). Its function shifts from navigational tool to symbolic anchor ("measuring toward harbors nobody could see"), charging the final image. However, its mechanical use—"pretended to take bearings, then corrected duct vanes and valve handles accordingly"—reads more as ritual than necessity; the intern could perform the same actions without it. This caps the score below 7.0 despite reprise, as swappability remains plausible.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The "maze of intentions" shapes stakes on the page: the terminal's divergent flows (rainwater pooling in ballroom, corridors baked dry, archives in darkness) embody conflicting purposes that the intern must navigate. The concept drives tactical choices—mapping currents by color, aligning the sextant at junctions, reversing escalators—and reappears at closure when "the maze of intentions felt legible now... readable like weather." It operates as more than theme: the layered history (evacuation routes under carnival chalk) constrains what can be salvaged, and the janitor's needs add new intentions that unlock a corridor. Irreplaceability is high; the story's logic depends on intention-as-infrastructure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Functionally creative" appears early as the supervisor's label ("the compliment both practical and haunting") and recurs implicitly when the intern pretends to use the sextant for bearings, a creative-yet-practical ritual. It enables the choice to "teach [the terminal] to aim again" through redirected flows rather than declaring the place dead. However, the trait is more narrated than dramatized in a specific tradeoff; the story shows creativity (chalk equations, reversed escalator) but does not stage a cost where functional creativity constrains another option. This limits the score to mid-band despite clear presence and thematic fit.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Resurrect" anchors the dominant stake from line seven ("Everyone said the place was dead; I came to see what could resurrect") and drives every beat: rerouting gutters to awaken sinks, flipping breakers to feed archives, reversing the escalator, opening skylights. The verb reappears at closure—"the terminal breathed out, and I breathed back"—where resurrection is complete with visible cost (tomorrow's maintenance burdens). The action is irreplaceable; swapping "repair" or "restore" would lose the life-death framing that charges the intern's equation ("hope is a system... tested by maintenance"). Major turns trace directly to this action.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The method—redirecting flows—is signaled early ("I made a map of currents... Air, light, water, attention, footfall, and electricity") and shapes every tactical beat: rerouting rain gutters into cisterns, flipping breakers to archives, reversing escalator heat flow, adjusting fan angles. Mechanics matter: the intern must identify which flows are "wrong" (rainwater in ballroom, medbay dark) before correcting them, and each redirection has consequence (sinks cough awake, fans comb spores). The method is indispensable—no other approach would preserve the story's engineering logic or the intern's character.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport terminal supplies resources (duct vanes, breakers, skylights, cisterns) and constraints (mold in archives, heat disparities, flooded ballroom) that alter every choice. The setting's layered history—evacuation routes under carnival chalk, faded wayfinding arrows to "constellations that never arrived"—pressures the intern's tactics by revealing prior intentions. The medbay, concourse, and flood-prone doors become active locations for plot turns (mother seeking nap space, janitor fetching mops). The terminal's transformation from "listening" ruin to "breathing" shelter constitutes the closure effect itself, making the setting indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the carnival left town" anchors the opening and explains the confetti in vents and chalk schedule, but does not tighten decisions or tactics beyond establishing abandonment. The carnival's departure is backstory context rather than a live pressure. The intern's work unfolds across "dusk," "night," and "morning," but no urgent clock constrains choices—each flow correction could proceed in any order. The story would function identically if the carnival had left months earlier. Present but replaceable as a temporal marker.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to puzzle out new equations for hope" is dramatized in the intern's opening stance ("stubborn and simple") and tested across beats: mapping currents, adjusting valves, drafting equations in chalk. Friction emerges when the janitor's concrete needs (shelter buses, brighten clinic) challenge the intern's abstract approach, forcing a shift from solo equations to shared purpose. The cost—"proportional headaches of functioning mercy"—makes the desire's price legible. The final realization ("hope is engineered, not declared, and tested by maintenance") earns its weight through on-page labor. Strong integration, though the phrase "new equations for hope" risks abstraction without the grounding work.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Tone coheres through turns: stoic observation ("The terminal listened by changing, which is one form of gratitude") modulates to quiet wonder at closure ("wonder steadied by work"). The prose maintains equilibrium under pressure—no emotional spikes when the janitor arrives or the mother seeks shelter, only measured attention to small victories (sinks coughing awake, fans combing spores). Figurative language ("windows mirrored dusk like paused galaxies," "corridors... like lifelines") sustains wonder without breaking stoicism. The final image—intern sleeping while "circuits murmured"—charges the tone with earned stillness. Tone shapes the ending's resonance decisively.</comment>
