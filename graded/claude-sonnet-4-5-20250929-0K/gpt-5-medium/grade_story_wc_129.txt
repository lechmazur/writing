<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is vivid and particular ("boldly sympathetic, a flaw and a craft"), and the arc from isolation to grafting shows contradiction and cost. However, the emotional work relies heavily on abstraction—"luminescent ache," "tenderized by strangers"—rather than embodied micro-choices under pressure. The final choice to "tend the arbor" feels inevitable but lacks a foregrounded visible trade-off in the closure beat itself. Secondary characters (Farrin, baker, diver) apply immediate pressure but remain gestural.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive early (crystalline orchard, crater, marsh-reed sculptor). The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the search for the tag accumulates community participation, and the final discovery ("a repeatable curve...Together") reweights the opening ache with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). The cost—committing practice rather than a finished statue—is legible and closes the circuit. One meaningful deepening (discovery of the posture, ring of bodies) tightens the stake. The elliptical middle (baker, diver legends) risks ornamental drift but the closure pulls material together.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard, obsidian shards, and crater function as micro-setting that constrains choice: the arbor's former location, the shards integrated into the new frame, the posture toward crater and orchard. Sensory detail is selective and charged ("void-sun," "stardust sugar," "dusk-blue panes"). Spatial choreography tracks cleanly (orchard lip, fruit-pillar, ring of bodies). The recurring crater hum and orchard chime signal permission and charge the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—grafting onto community—is signaled early and tightens through the search pact, gossip accumulation, and discovery of the posture. The protagonist's agency (listening walk, reed sculptures, building the new arbor) narrows options and the final dedication forecloses a path (practice over finished work). The cost is felt but quiet; the ache "stays, but now it glows" registers as Charged Poise. One meaningful deepening (finding the seam, adopting the posture) is sufficient under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: the search for connection enacts the connection, and "Together" as a posture rather than a picture reweights the opening isolation. The final image (arbor held by leaning bodies, shards reflecting faces) offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates through gesture (the repeatable curve, ribs touching) and the constraint that the orchard asks "through us." The ache as lantern bridges individual and collective without abstraction creep.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Voice is lyric and compressed with a stable first-person register ("I was a marsh-reed sculptor"). Psychic distance is controlled; purposeful compression ("vows had been spoken, children had been weighed") economizes backstory. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction mid-pressure ("luminescent ache," "webs of kinship I could finally feel"). Dialogue is minimal but functional (Farrin's legend); Farrin's voice is not strongly distinct from narration. The perceptual signature (listening, tenderized, reed twists as replies) is character-specific.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Line-level clarity is strong; syntax varies and rhythm modulates (short beats at discovery, longer reflection at closure). Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere or stakes. Minor issues: "webs of kinship" and "rhymes of root and glint" repeat the same idea across adjacent sentences (paraphrase loop, −0.2). "Luminescent ache" recurs without deepening (−0.2). Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "singing bowl" crater and "chiming" orchard land without muddle. Opening and closing lines anchor well.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The frame—community rebuilt through posture rather than monument—offers a fresh angle on belonging narratives. The search for a street artist's tag as community-making method is specific and non-obvious. Emotional specificity (listening until tenderized, ache as lantern) avoids templates. The synthesis (arbor as echo of living posture) feels earned in hindsight. Risk-taking in the lyric, elliptical structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity (+0.3 within band).</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The marsh-reed sculptor's choices drive key turns: initiating the listening walk, threading reeds as markers, building the arbor frame with glass and shards. Present in setup, middle (sculptures), and ending (arbor construction). Causal pressure moderate; the role is specific but the sculptural work itself remains somewhat gestural in the middle beats.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The glimmering obsidian arbor is present in setup (legend of the shattered arbor), development (elders show shards, sculptor slides them into reed lattice), and closure (arbor held by bodies, shards reflecting faces). The object's destruction and reconstruction shape the entire arc; its shards constrain the new build and charge the final image. High irreplaceability and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Webs of kinship appear in setup ("webs of kinship, rhymes of root and glint") and closure ("webs of kinship I could finally feel...as tug and warmth"). The concept shapes the search method (gossip, shared hints) and the final understanding (grafted into the net). Functional reprise that reweights the stake, but mid-scene development is more atmospheric than causal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Boldly sympathetic" is labeled early ("a flaw and a craft, which is to say I listen until I feel tenderized") and enables the listening walk. The trait constrains one key choice (answering Farrin's question with a reed twist) but does not generate visible friction or cost in later beats. Present in setup and thematically relevant but not causally active in middle or closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Dedicate" is present in the climax ("I knew then what I had to dedicate, and it was not a statue, but my practice") and shapes the resolution (building the arbor as frame for breath, tending it). The action redefines the protagonist's commitment and forecloses other paths (finished monument). Strong closure linkage; arrives late but transforms prior material with cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The shared search for the street artist's tag is signaled early (Farrin's pact), structures the middle (baker and diver legends, listening walk, reed markers), and pays off in the discovery of the seam and curve. The method's mechanics (gossip, chalk, sculptures) matter and shape participation. Good beat involvement and causal work; not the sole driver but essential to accumulation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard at the crater's edge is present throughout: setup (location anchor), middle (orchard permission, mirrored fruit reflecting faces), and closure (panes go dusk-blue, orchard chimes acceptance). The setting constrains choice (arbor must face the crater's scar, orchard's grammar must be learned) and charges the final image. High integration and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Beyond the murmur of lost languages" frames the opening and closing but does not tighten decisions or track a live clock. The phrase functions as tone and thematic bracket rather than a temporal constraint. Present in lyric reprise but does not alter tactics or escalate pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The motivation to graft onto community is dramatized early ("I came here to graft myself onto community") and drives all major choices: initiating the search, building with the town, dedicating practice. Friction appears in the ache that persists even at closure ("not healed, not finished, but grafted"). Cost is felt; want and need align rather than conflict, which limits high-band eligibility.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>"Luminescent ache" is introduced early and modulates through the arc: unnamed ache at the shattered arbor, the ache that "stays, but now it glows like a lantern meant for many hands" at closure. Tone coheres through turns and charges the final image. The reprise reweights the opening loneliness with earned transformation and visible cost.</comment>
