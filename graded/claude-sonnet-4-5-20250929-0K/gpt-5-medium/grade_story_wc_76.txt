<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The clockmaker's interiority is richly embodied through craft-specific perception ("my hands, neatly inventive, smelled of brass and boat pitch") and contradictory impulses act simultaneously in the climax—desire to transcend fate versus memory of the keeper's voice. The decision to "let the yoyo climb" and choose "the keeper, the unbroken tide" is earned by prior causality and forecloses the supernatural path with visible cost. Minor deduction for occasional label-only emotional states ("bleak exhilaration") that edge toward diagnostic phrasing, though the embodied particulars mostly compensate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on the page as Earned Stasis: the protagonist lets the yoyo climb and refuses the door, choosing the keeper with visible forfeiture of "unbroken mornings" and the chance to escape fate's design. The causal-accumulative hybrid lens holds—mechanical puzzle-solving escalates through reverse-engineering beats, hunger stone activation, and vision of alternate timelines, then tightens to a renunciation. Orientation anchors (lighthouse, keeper, chamber) appear early. One micro turn (seeing the keeper's potential death) reweights the choice without breaking coherence. Cost is legible: "desire shook me apart into cogs and screws" and the supernatural door closes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The lighthouse and hunger stone constrain the protagonist's choices—descent to the chamber, interaction with the carved script, and the final decision are all spatially rooted. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: "wind spoke under the steps like old lovers hiding under beds," "the chamber opened like a throat." The yoyo as micro-setting object charges the final image when its climbing motion seals the closure. Minor cap: while vivid, some metaphors ("glass eye cracked") lean decorative rather than constraining action in real time.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>One dominant stake ("to step beyond fate's design") is signaled early and tightens through puzzle-solving beats, hunger stone activation, and the vision of alternate timelines that shows the keeper's death as cost. The protagonist's agency drives escalation: offering blood, aligning gears, and ultimately choosing to let the yoyo climb. The final renunciation is motivated by the keeper calling his name and forecloses the supernatural door with visible emotional cost. No reversals feel arbitrary; coincidence complicates (the keeper's call) but does not solve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—whether to escape fate or remain within mortal limits—emerges through the hunger stone's script, the yoyo puzzle, and competing visions of futures. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "chose the keeper, the unbroken tide" reweights prior ambition without stating a moral. Subtext operates in images (tide, clockwork, hunger) and the keeper's final call is not pleading but "remembering me louder than the tide remembered itself." The piece invites reflection on agency, solitude, and the cost of transcendence through earned particulars rather than thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyric, and compression-heavy ("a counter clockwise clock maker who kept time against the grain of consolation"), maintaining perceptual signature tied to craft and mechanical metaphor. Distance is stable first-person with clean interior access. Dialogue is minimal (keeper's two brief lines) but carries subtext and advances plot. Minor deduction: occasional elevated diction ("latent radiance," "hushed catastrophe") edges toward register drift in peak beats, though it remains mostly voice-motivated and legible. No head-hopping; focalization is controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Figurative density is high but mostly purposeful, with metaphors tied to clockwork and tide. Rhythm varies and information density is strong—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot. Deductions: several near-paraphrase loops ("hunger stone" described multiple times with similar syntax; "the yoyo dropped / hung / climbed" beats slightly redundant in function), and stacked metaphors in the vision sequence risk muddling clarity ("threads…humming with hushed catastrophe," "blade of fog"). These artifacts appear mid-story but do not obscure the closure image. Baseline −0.6 for template cadence and loop presence; −0.2 for mild figurative muddle in one high-pressure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The counter-clockwise clockmaker and reverse-engineering method offer a fresh synthesis of craft, time manipulation, and supernatural threshold. The hunger stone and backward script are specific rather than generic portal devices. The ending's choice—renunciation over transcendence—avoids the expected "step through" resolution and feels earned. Minor deduction: the lighthouse-as-liminal-space and magical-puzzle-as-test are familiar genre templates, transformed here by craft specificity and the lyric voice but not fully reinvented. Risk-taking in voice and compression elevates within band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The clockmaker drives all key beats: reverse-engineering the yoyo, offering blood, aligning gears, and the final choice to let the yoyo climb. Setup early, development through puzzle-solving, and payoff in the renunciation. Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong; the character's choices create every turn. Cost is visible in forfeiting the door and "unbroken mornings."</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The hunger stone is present in setup (jutting from foundation), development (protagonist studies its script, offers blood, watches it brighten and open), and payoff (the crack releases wind and the door, which the protagonist refuses). Used across multiple beats with reweighted meaning—from carved mystery to activated threshold. Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong; the stone's opening is the final test.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Latent radiance appears in setup description ("pulsed with a latent radiance") and payoff (brightens "from coal to ember," sharpens "to a blade of fog"). It drives the visual transformation that signals the door's opening, shaping the protagonist's final choice. Present in two beats with reweighted intensity. Mid-band: the concept frames atmosphere and stakes but does not constrain tactics as much as the yoyo or stone mechanics do.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Neatly inventive" is established early in setup ("My hands, neatly inventive, smelled of brass and boat pitch") and enables the reverse-engineering action in development. Payoff: the trait's mechanical skill allows puzzle-solving but the final cost is choosing the keeper over craft mastery. One clear beat where the trait enables action; modest cost connection (the protagonist's pieces "arguing softly" as desire conflicts with choice). Causal link is present but swappability risk moderate—any skilled craftsperson could function similarly.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Initiate" is signaled in development when the string whispers the word, then enacted as the protagonist sets the lantern and prepares to "initiate the cycle in reverse." The yoyo drop that follows is the major turn triggering the hunger stone's activation and the vision sequence. Present across two beats; causal pressure strong. Minor deduction: the word itself is somewhat generic—"begin" or "start" could substitute with minimal edit—but the reverse-cycle framing adds specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Reverse-engineering the yoyo puzzle is signaled in setup ("the keeper had told me its puzzle resisted every scholar"), attempted in development ("I began through reverse-engineering…unwinding its logic from the tail end"), and completed in payoff (yoyo drops, traces spiral, gears align). The method shapes all mechanical beats and the protagonist's craft identity. Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong; the method is indispensable to the supernatural threshold opening. Slight swappability risk (another puzzle-solving approach might serve), but the counter-clockwise/reverse specificity anchors character and theme.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The lighthouse and rocky island are present in setup, the chamber at its base houses the hunger stone and puzzle in development, and the setting's vertical axis (spiral stairs, descent) mirrors the yoyo's path in payoff. The keeper's presence and the tidal environment pressure the protagonist's choice. Spatial choreography is clear and the setting constrains access (must descend to chamber) and supplies resources (the stone, the yoyo). Strong causal link; the lighthouse's liminal geography is essential to closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Low tide is signaled in setup ("under the slow exhale of low tide, the stones…sweated salt") and frames arrival timing ("I arrived by skiff with the tide turning"). The timeframe is evoked lyrically in the final image ("the keeper, the unbroken tide") but does not actively tighten decisions in development—no countdown or clock that alters tactics on the page. Present in two touches with thematic reprise; modest closure linkage. Mid-band: the tide metaphor charges atmosphere but remains largely symbolic rather than a live constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The motivation "to step beyond fate's design" is established early ("I wished that more than anything"), tested in development through the puzzle and vision of alternate futures, and paid off when the protagonist renounces the door. Friction between want (transcendence) and cost (keeper's potential death, "the desire shook me apart") is dramatized in the climax. The choice forecloses the supernatural path with visible cost. Causal pressure, closure linkage, and cost connection are all strong.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The tone "bleak exhilaration" is embodied early ("the wishing had a cost I already felt collecting like barnacles on my ribs") and crystallizes in the vision beat ("I felt bleak exhilaration rip through me, a happiness too thin to hold"). It modulates with pressure—mechanical focus during puzzle-solving, emotional intensity at the threshold, quiet resolve at closure. The final image's restraint ("chose the keeper, the unbroken tide") charges the renunciation with that tonal mix. Strong coherence and closure linkage.</comment>
