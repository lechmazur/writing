<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete action (lighting lamps, seeking memories, exhuming the box). Interior contradictions emerge in the tension between duty and grief, reflected in choices that narrow options (choosing which memory to retrieve). The sister's presence is evoked through specific sensory details (laugh beginning in shoulder, misnamed stars) rather than summary. Minor deduction for occasional elevated diction that feels slightly above the lantern lighter's plausible lexicon in peak moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds throughout; the narrative builds pressure through density increase and recurring motifs that converge at closure. The ending achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the protagonist understands their work "keeps a path through change," reweighting the opening silence and lamp-lighting ritual with conceptual cost—the acceptance that memories must be carried manually through gravitational flux. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive clearly in the opening lines. One meaningful deepening occurs when the exhumed memory sheet opens the corridor, narrowing the quest into concrete action with felt stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains multiple choices: the salt chamber provides the chemist's archive method, the whale's ribcage creates the spatial pressure for exhumation, and the piers house the gravity pockets that drive the final corridor discovery. Sensory hierarchy reflects professional priorities (lantern posts, rope slackness, light behavior). The micro-setting of the tin of wildflowers functions as tactile anchor that charges the closure when scent returns. Spatial choreography remains clear across four locations (pier, chamber, whale, memory pocket) without floating-room syndrome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding deleted memories) is signaled early and tightens through a single meaningful deepening: the exhumation discovery that opens the corridor. Agency manifests through deliberate choices (borrowing spade, pressing glass to whale, choosing the specific memory) that foreclose the path of passive grief. The cost is legible on the page: the protagonist must physically carry memories back and seal them into fragile containers rather than simply remembering. Under the accumulative lens, the pressure coheres through density increase until the final image reweights "what my work really keeps."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme (how we navigate loss through ritual and physical anchoring) emerges from concrete particulars: lamp-lighting, salt crystallization, memory exhumation. The ending offers a non-literal answer to the central question—memories don't return to the mind but must be manually retrieved and housed—without stating a moral. The pressed wildflowers function as a motif that accumulates meaning and shifts at closure (color returns, scent revives). Subtext operates through image: gravity fluctuation as grief's unpredictable pull, the whale as catalyst rather than villain. Minor deduction for one moment of near-thematic echo ("understand what my work really keeps") that borders on articulation, though it remains grounded in image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV distance is stable and lyric throughout; the first-person singular maintains consistent perceptual signature (nautical awareness, световая sensitivity, gravitational hypervigilance). Purposeful compression and patterned syntax create a deliberate accumulative rhythm that teaches its logic early. Voice modulates appropriately under pressure: shorter clauses when exhuming, longer woven sentences during reflection. Deductions for occasional filter-verb density ("I realize," "I understand") in the final paragraph that slightly dulls immediacy, and one moment of register drift ("extravagant patience") that feels elevated beyond the established idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, and the central quest simultaneously. Figurative language is purposeful and controlled (gravity as "mischievous," lanterns as "birds on a winter wire") with consistent vehicle logic. Sentence rhythm varies naturally, avoiding template cadence. Deductions accumulate: minor paraphrase loop in paragraphs describing the tin's scent shift (salt/paper restated); one run of "I [verb]" stems in the exhumation sequence across three sentences; elevated metaphorical density in the chemist scene where nearly every line carries a figure without clear pattern-teaching at that moment. These artifacts appear in supporting beats, not at closure, capping penalty at −0.6.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of beached-whale gravity disruption with manual memory retrieval through salt crystallography is specific and non-obvious, transforming the "lost memory" trope through tactile, procedural anchoring. The lantern lighter's occupational frame integrates organically with the quest rather than serving as mere decoration. Risk-taking in the lyric-accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; the four-location mosaic is taught early and pays off at closure. The story commits fully to its premise that memories have physical weight and location, following implications without retreat. Slight deduction for the "corridor to deleted memories" concept approaching familiar metaphysical-library territory, though the salt-glass mechanism and gravitational framing provide fresh specificity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lantern lighter's occupation frames expectation early and returns at closure ("I light the final lantern...I understand what my work really keeps"). Choices drive key turns: deciding to visit the chemist, borrowing the spade, exhuming the box, pressing glass to the whale, choosing which memory to retrieve, sealing it in the tin. The work itself (creating boundaries with light) is reweighted at the end as "keeping a path through change," making the character's role indispensable to both action and theme.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The tin appears in three distinct beats with evolving function: introduced as a grief object that has lost scent (paragraph 9), carried through the quest (implicit presence), and reweighted at closure when it receives the retrieved memory and scent returns (paragraph 31). The object's transformation (lost scent → restored scent) directly signals the success of the retrieval quest and provides the felt cost (memories require physical housing). Its specificity (pressed wildflowers, hillside/constellation teaching) ties it irreplaceably to the sister and the stakes.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Gravity pockets are introduced immediately (paragraph 3), shape on-page tactics throughout (fluctuating pull alters movement and perception, nest under piers, open "like an unscheduled mouth" when glass touches whale), and participate causally at closure (pockets "flutter like nervous birds" during retrieval, the world "shakes me off" when touching memory spines). The concept's mechanics—local, mischievous disruption linked to the beached whale—are specific and consistent, directly enabling the corridor discovery and memory access. Removal would collapse both the quest mechanism and the story's central metaphor.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The "fluctuates mysteriously" attribute is embodied on the page through specific sensory effects: pull on bones that tugs then shrugs (paragraph 4), ground that lifts/eats/returns the protagonist's step (paragraph 24), world indecision about time's direction (paragraph 24). These fluctuations constrain movement and create the conditions for the memory corridor to open. The attribute appears in setup, middle pressure (during exhumation), and closure participation (the gravity-flutter during retrieval). Visible cost: the protagonist must navigate unstable terrain to complete the quest.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Exhumation occurs at the story's structural midpoint (paragraph 20), creates the major turn by producing the memory sheet that enables corridor access, and directly shapes the ending sequence (retrieval, sealing). The box's discovery under the whale—caused by gravity-buckled sand revealing "a buried hinge remembering its purpose"—is causally prepared and irreplaceable; no other action could substitute without rebuilding the quest mechanism. The exhumation forecloses the path of passive searching and commits the protagonist to active intervention.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Coffee-ground divination appears in one beat (paragraphs 13–15), provides the chemist's diagnostic that points to "where your sister left her name to keep a door open" and explains that gravity pockets nest under piers. This information shapes the protagonist's decision to return to the whale and look beneath it. The method is signaled and its mechanics matter (patterns reveal locations), but it appears only in the middle third without setup or closure reprise. Two-gate presence (development, modest causal role) places it in mid-band; swappability with another divinatory method slightly limits the score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The salt chamber appears early (paragraph 11), supplies critical world-building (crystals archive the shoreline, memory sheets grow when salt teaches water to remember shapes), and provides the chemist who decodes the coffee grounds and explains the mechanism. The chamber's "listening" and "extravagant patience" are reactivated at closure when the corridor opens ("The chamber had been listening, waiting for me to carry it here"). The setting enables the quest by teaching the protagonist what to look for and how memory retrieval works. Removing it would require substantial rework of the discovery mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The whale beaching establishes the inciting disruption in the opening line and recurs as spatial anchor (paragraphs 7, 17–19) and causal mechanism (its body as "gravity seed" that created the pockets). The timeframe ("after") is stable and shapes the present-tense quest: people are currently forgetting, gulls are arguing, the protagonist is missing memory pieces now. The beaching's aftermath tightens the window by establishing that disruption is ongoing and memory loss is active, creating urgency. The whale's ribcage provides the exhumation site, directly participating in closure mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The desire to find deleted memories is stated explicitly (paragraph 6) and dramatized through escalating choices: visiting the chemist, interpreting patterns, returning to the whale, exhuming the box, following the corridor, choosing a specific memory, carrying it back, sealing it. Internal friction emerges between wanting the memory intact versus accepting it must be housed externally. The motivation is tested on the page when the world "shakes me off politely" as if questioning the retrieval, and the protagonist persists despite gravitational resistance. Cost is visible: memories don't restore naturally but require manual labor and fragile storage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Gleaming silence is introduced in the opening line ("fits inside my lungs like a lantern flame held still"), modulates through the narrative (the chamber "listens," the whale "sounds like a city breathing," the memory pocket "smells like rain behind stone"), and returns explicitly at closure ("in that gleaming silence between the click and the flame"). Tone remains coherent through lyric compression and accumulative patterning, never breaking into exposition or mechanical summary. The final reprise charges the image by linking the opening's suspended silence to the protagonist's new understanding, making the tone indispensable to thematic resonance.</comment>
