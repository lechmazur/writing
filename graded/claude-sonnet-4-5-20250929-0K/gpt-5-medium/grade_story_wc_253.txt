<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's blank-faced performer persona is strongly embodied through micro-choices (teaching children "angles of light that read as joy without needing the organ underneath"). Internal contradiction operates consistently: paid compliance versus teaching the unmeasurable pause. The whittling and staging lessons reveal a hierarchy of values under surveillance pressure. Motivation remains character-particular throughout, though the final turn ("not joy, but lightness") feels slightly abstract rather than a bodily choice with immediate cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of narrated performance layered with private resistance; closure arrives when the protagonist names the distinction on-camera ("not joy, but lightness") and the remade hush "held with it." Cost is conceptual and social—risking inspectorate scrutiny by articulating the unstated. The final beat reweights the dominant stake (cultivating lightness versus mandated happiness) with undeniable pressure. Orientation is clean by the third paragraph. One meaningful deepening through the private lesson with muted microphones suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The turbines, farmhouse, and surveillance infrastructure constrain choices throughout: the feed, inspectors, microphones shape every performance beat. The dried bouquet is handled across multiple scenes and charges the final teaching moment. Micro-setting (sink, sponge, window sill) anchors the narration performances. Spatial choreography remains coherent. The turbines' "giant applause" and persistent whine create atmospheric pressure that the protagonist navigates tactically.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (cultivate lightness versus mandated happiness) is signaled early and tightens through inspector visits and the private lesson with microphones off. The protagonist's agency operates through renunciation and performance calibration, each move narrowing options (teaching compliance while seeding the pause). The unannounced inspector scene escalates pressure; the final on-camera line forecloses safety by naming the distinction. Cost is legible: social and economic risk under surveillance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the tension between performance and interiority, surveillance and hush. The dried bouquet shifts meaning from mourning to teaching tool to witness without overt symbolism. "Lightness" versus "happiness" (one carries, one is ballast) operates through concrete choices rather than declaration until the necessary final beat. The remade hush functions as earned resistance, not abstraction—built through whittling, silent gestures, and the pause between breath and speech. Final line offers a resonant answer to the premise without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person; distance and focalization remain consistent. Perceptual signature is distinct: "behold, a dish...wet crescent of responsibility" and "silence saunters in, thin as a foal" reveal a lyric, performative interior voice under compression. Diction stays within the narrator's register—elevated but voice-motivated, given the mandate performance layer. No head-hopping. Micro-compression under peak stress (the inspector visit) serves pressure without obscuring clarity. Child's dialogue is minimal but distinct; the narrator's voice modulates appropriately with scene urgency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence structure shifts between lyric fragments and longer accretive moves. Information density is high ("Gratitude Transition" simultaneously names world rule, reveals tonal register, and advances plot). Minor figurative clustering in early paragraphs ("insect wings," "foal," "clock hands") without clear pattern-teaching, though it coheres with the lyric stance. One paraphrase moment: "remade hush" is restated across beats but with evolving function, so not penalized as loop. Propulsion is strong; no scaffold detected. Final line lands cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The surveillance-performance premise is familiar but transformed through the specific mechanics: mandated happiness measured in wattage, dramatic mundane narration for algorithm compliance, teaching children "compliance postures" while seeding unmeasurable pauses. The dried bouquet as teaching tool rather than mere symbol, whittling as quiet refusal, and the distinction between lightness and happiness offer fresh inflection. The piece commits fully to its premise and follows implications (tokens, inspectors, turbine-time) without retreat. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure and final camera confession heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Present throughout. The blank-faced performer role constrains every public beat (inspector visits, feed performances) and shapes the teaching strategy. Drives the private lesson with muted microphones and the final on-camera distinction. The blank face functions as "costume and insurance," enabling compliant performance while protecting interiority. Essential to closure: the final line depends on maintaining the blank face while naming the distinction.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Introduced early (paragraph 7) as relic of the renamed funeral. Returns in inspector visit as deflection tool ("who the bouquet mourned"). Placed on table for child to handle; petals fall across beats. Participates in closure paragraph by "listening" as the hush holds. Causal role in two beats (inspector, teaching moment) and charges atmosphere, though its specific properties (brittle, perishable) could be swapped for similar fragile objects with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Signaled by paragraph 9 ("trying to make a remade hush"). Shapes stakes and tactics: the protagonist teaches children the pause "which is not flaggable," stages silent gesture performances, and holds the hush at closure. Drives the middle escalation (microphones off) and is named in the final beat. The concept's unmeasurability versus mandate measurability creates the central tension and forecloses options (risking punishment for seditious silence).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mentioned explicitly in paragraph 5 ("morally ambiguous, which plays well on state screens"). Enables the teaching role ("I also teach them the pause...which is not flaggable") and creates friction: "the ambiguous part, because I am paid, and their parents need the tokens." The trait justifies inspector approval while allowing subversive teaching. However, after early establishment it operates mostly as backdrop rather than constraining later choices with visible tradeoffs in peak beats.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Introduced paragraph 19 ("I whittle in the evenings"). Returns in the private teaching moment (whittled flute from peach wood), which is a key middle beat. The whittling produces "small things that do not expect applause," embodying resistance to the performance mandate. The flute's creation and non-use ("we needed ground") ties to the remade hush. Essential to two distinct beats and contributes thematic charge, though swapping for another quiet craft would alter tone more than structure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Established paragraph 11 ("dramatically narrating mundane tasks so the algorithm hears zest"). Demonstrated immediately with sink and sponge ("Behold, a dish...Behold, a sponge"). Returns in inspector visit with laundry narration ("shirt that caught the rain, a hero"). Drives the contrast beat (paragraph 45: "we narrated with our hands only" after turning off microphones). Method shapes every public performance, enables inspector deflection, and its suspension in the private lesson creates the story's key escalation. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Present from opening line ("turbines cast slow shadows over the farmhouse"). Turbines provide surveillance infrastructure (inspector "nasal with duty and the turbine whine in his suit"), keep narrative time ("turbines kept time for a calendar nobody trusted"), and supply atmospheric pressure. The farmhouse anchors all action. Setting participates in closure ("turbines lost their rhythm"). However, much of the pressure could transfer to generic surveillance infrastructure; the wind-turbine specificity adds texture but doesn't uniquely constrain the protagonist's tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Signaled paragraph 2 ("after the happiness mandate, where cheer has measurable wattage and fines"). Shapes all stakes: inspectors enforce mandate compliance, tokens are economic necessity, seditious silence is punishable. The timeframe drives every public performance and private resistance beat. The mandate's mechanics (algorithm, wattage measurement, Gratitude Transitions) constrain tactics throughout. Closure depends on the mandate framework: naming the distinction on-camera carries risk only within this timeframe. Essential across the arc.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stated explicitly paragraph 9 ("I want to cultivate lightness in grief, not happiness"). Drives the whittling, private teaching, and the remade hush creation. Creates friction with mandate compliance and economic necessity (tokens). The distinction between lightness (carries) and happiness (ballast) structures choices across beats. Culminates in the final camera line: "not joy, but lightness, which is grief without the anchor." The motivation is dramatized through choices with visible costs (risking inspector scrutiny, teaching children the flaggable pause).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Established through the blank face, neutral performance, and controlled distance from emotion. Modulates appropriately: lyric compression during private reflection, flatter register during inspector encounters. The void functions as protective strategy and aesthetic choice. Charges the final image when the blank face "held" and "the remade hush held with it"—the void becomes the vehicle for resistance. Tone coheres through all turns without becoming static; it deepens under pressure rather than breaking.</comment>
