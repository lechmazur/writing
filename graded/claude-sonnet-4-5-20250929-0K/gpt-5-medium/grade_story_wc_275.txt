<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's voice is concrete and character-particular, with embodied details like threading stories through irrigation tubes and holding the sandbag scrap. Internal contradiction surfaces in "senselessly perceptive"—feeling more than she can prove, less than she would strike—and drives her micro-choices with visitors. The emotional progression from restraint to teaching gratitude reads earned, though the father's absence remains more told than dramatically tested on the page. Minor slip: the trio's arc from scoffing to planting names feels compressed without visible struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors who/where/when within the first ~100 words. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid): the narrator ties the father's letter to the sandbag scrap, tells the rose the values again, and commits to tending "the breathing knives" until the city learns—a crystallized stance that forecloses reunion with visible cost ("He will return when the city learns...Until then"). The pattern of visitors → ritual → conversion accumulates density and the final vow reweights all prior particulars. Cost is legible in the father's exile and the narrator's solitary vigil.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The glass dome, vestibule sand, and irrigation lines constrain visitor behavior and anchor the narrator's ritual. The airship ballast scrap and rose trellis charge the final image when the narrator ties letter and scrap together, making the ending materially specific. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "dust scrawls outside," "engraved quiet," "roses drink." Micro-setting (the dome's acoustic and thermal effects) alters tactics—visitors soften because "the heat has already scorched their edges smooth."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: maintaining the farm as a reconciliation space while the father remains in exile. The trio's arrival tightens pressure—they demand blame and a map to grief—and the narrator's response (plant names, not violence) narrows options and demonstrates cost. The revelation of the father's letter deepens understanding and reweights the vigil with explicit renunciation ("cannot come home until blame learns to breathe"). Agency is enacted through teaching and withholding, though the visitors' conversion happens quickly without visible internal resistance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—how mercy and accountability coexist after catastrophe—emerges through the rose-tending ritual, the father's ballast choice, and the visitors' shift from knives to seedlings. The recurring motif of "engraved quiet" and "breathing knives" accrues meaning and the final image (letter and scrap as kin, both cut to make falling kinder) offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in the father's absence, the sandbag's rough prayer-stone texture, and the roses that "cast more shade than fire." No thematic echo or sledgehammer thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled: "the sky becomes a carefully held breath," "dust scrawls," "knives that soften," "velvet bucket" night. Perceptual signature is selective and character-specific—mineral taste in irrigation, sundial spines, exhaust-hope fraying. Distance remains stable; free indirect style is clean. Minor density concern: some lines repeat conceptual content ("engraved quiet" appears three times with slight variation) and a few gestural tics (holding, threading, pressing) recur without fresh texture, though the effect supports the meditative stance and does not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes. Information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs (world-building + character + stakes). Clarity is strong except for occasional figurative stacking: "tranquil blaze of calm" mixes registers and "honest heat" at the ending feels abstract. Minor paraphrase loop: the final paragraph recycles "weight" and "cut to make falling kinder" across two sentences without fresh pressure. No scaffold or template cadence. Proofreading clean; no grammar slips.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The premise—pacifist daughter of a blamed bounty hunter runs a rose farm that teaches restraint—synthesizes fresh elements (inculcating plants, engraved quiet, breathing knives) into a coherent post-collapse ritual. The airship/ballast choice transforms the trolley problem through embodied cost (the father's exile, the city's grief). Transformation test passes: plot and arc would not work with generic substitutes. Risk-taking in tone (tranquil amid ruin) and structure (accumulative pressure, no confrontation scene) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Minor: the visitor conversion arc echoes reconciliation templates, though the rose-tending method adds specificity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The bounty hunter's pacifist daughter is present throughout, frames the premise, and drives all key choices: asking visitors to sheathe weapons, teaching gratitude through roses, choosing to withhold the father's location, and committing to the farm vigil at closure. Her attribute (tracking taught as pausing) constrains tactics and the final stance. The opposition between her restraint and visitors' demands generates pressure across multiple beats. Cost is visible in her solitary vigil and the father's continued exile.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The airship ballast sandbag scrap is introduced early ("beside the watering can"), handled in the breath-counting ritual with visitors, strung to a rose in the climactic teaching moment, receives backstory that reweights its meaning (the father's cut), and is tied with the father's letter at closure as "kin." It appears in at least four distinct beats, each time with evolving function. Removing it would break the thematic and causal linkage between the father's choice and the narrator's teaching. Strong causal pressure and closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Engraved quiet is signaled early, recurs in visitor interactions ("the dome makes derision sound like thirst"), and culminates in "the engraved quiet becomes a shared vow." It shapes tactics—visitors must enter the acoustic/thermal space that softens them—and charges the ending mood. The concept could be slightly more causally active (visitors obey partly because of heat, not solely the quiet), but it constrains behavior across multiple beats and participates in closure. Solid integration with minor swappability.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Senselessly perceptive is introduced via the father's memory, defines the narrator's core trait ("felt more than I could prove"), and enables her teaching method (threading stories, reading plant responses). It constrains her choice to withhold direct answers and offer ritual instead. Visible in at least two beats (visitor interaction, father's letter interpretation) with thematic payoff. Could be stronger if it created an on-page cost or tradeoff—currently it enables without clear friction—but it is non-ornamental and shapes the ending stance.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sheathe is the central ritual command ("sheathe whatever bites, including words"), enacted when a visitor lays down a knife and the narrator sheathes it "with cloth and soil." The action frames the farm's rule, drives the visitors' conversion, and culminates in the closing image of "breathing knives" (sheathed but alive). It appears in setup, peak teaching beat, and closure metaphor. Removing it would collapse the thematic spine. Strong causal and closure linkage, though the physical act occurs in one literal beat with metaphoric extension.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Inculcating plants with values is signaled early ("since I learned to listen"), demonstrated in the irrigation-tube storytelling and rose-leaning-toward-scrap beats, and restated at closure ("I tell the plant the values again"). The method drives the visitors' conversion and provides the story's central conceit. Mechanics matter—thread stories, lay maps, pair debt and mercy—and the ending relies on it. Present across setup, middle teaching, and closure. Could score higher if the method faced a test or cost; currently it succeeds without friction.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The desert rose farm in a glass-domed enclosure is introduced in the second line, provides all spatial choreography (vestibule, nursery beds, workroom, trellis), and supplies the key constraint: the dome's heat and acoustics soften visitors ("the dome makes derision sound like thirst"). The setting enables the teaching ritual, houses all key objects (roses, sandbag, irrigation), and charges the final image (night lowers, dome gathers starlight). Removing it would break both tactics and closure. Present in setup, every middle beat, and ending. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>After the tower falls is signaled in the opening line, establishes the story's present (post-collapse), and provides the inciting pressure (people come with knives seeking blame). The timeframe motivates the father's exile and the narrator's vigil, and the ending hinges on "until blame learns to breathe"—a future conditional that depends on this post-collapse moment. Present in setup and closure, though the middle does not track time's passage or use it to tighten decisions. Functional and non-swappable but not a live clock that alters tactics beat-to-beat.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>To weave continuity through chaos is dramatized in the narrator's opening of the farm, the teaching of patience and gratitude, the ritual with visitors, and the father's letter requesting she "weave continuity through chaos." The motivation is tested when visitors demand blame and she offers planting instead—a choice with visible cost (the father's continued absence). It drives setup, middle conversion, and closure commitment ("This is my work"). The desire is concrete and conflicted; the ending's vow forecloses reunion. Strong causal and thematic integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Tranquil blaze appears explicitly ("tranquil blaze of calm") and implicitly throughout: "engraved quiet," "honest heat," "velvet bucket" night, roses that "cast more shade than fire." The tone is coherent through all turns, modulates with visitor pressure (scoffing → breathing), and charges the final image (starlight, shadow-guiding father, threaded world). The oxymoron holds—calm coexists with ruin's heat—and the ending sustains both poles without collapsing into single-note serenity. One minor slip: "tranquil blaze of calm" is slightly redundant and could be tighter. Otherwise strong tonal control under pressure.</comment>
