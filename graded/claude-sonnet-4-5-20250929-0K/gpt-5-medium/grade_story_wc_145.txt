<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The atlas editor's interiority is rendered through concrete, particular observation—"I am not brave, but I am subtly confident in the way hard winters shape a person"—and micro-choices (striking the match, turning the valve) carry embodied tension. The falcon functions as external pressure and the phrasebook as inherited constraint, both filtering through the protagonist's stance. Internal contradiction appears in the tension between fear of taming and trust in naming, paid off when the editor copies lines "and let my wit rest, unneeded in the quiet." Minor deduction for the ending's slight drift toward abstraction ("let the atlas breathe differently") where a concrete image would sharpen cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening lines. The piece accumulates pressure through layered pattern—breath on glass, condensation, the phrasebook's verbs—that converges when the editor turns the valve and "rivulets accepted their siblings." Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the editor records the convergence, accepts the cost that "water that begins as one must learn to part again," and commits to following departure. Cost is conceptual and vocational (the map will breathe differently), legible in the final ledger-close and tomorrow's promise. One tightening deepens the stake from tracing to governance to departure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The outpost, lake, and culvert constrain every choice: cracking ice forces the editor under the hill; the valves "like hard hearts" require the prayer and turn that trigger convergence. Sensory detail is purposeful and POV-filtered—"girders hummed like teeth pressed tight," "reeds that clacked their teeth in slow panic"—and the recurring condensation-on-glass motif charges the final image when "the pattern on the window thinned, the prophet content once the sermon concluded." The body (breath, palm, fogged glass) functions as micro-setting. Spatial choreography from outpost to shore to culvert to locker is clear and causally motivated.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding where the rivers begin—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens when the falcon reports "a mouth that swallowed maps," forcing the editor into the cold. The valve-turn is protagonist-driven agency that narrows options (the convergence cannot be undone) and forecloses the path of passive observation. Cost is visible: the editor becomes "clerk and herald," fearing the map will "tame what should remain wild" yet trusting "naming follows listening." The final commitment to follow departure imposes occupational and conceptual cost. One meaningful deepening (from tracing to turning to recording) is sufficient under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: breath, condensation, convergence, and the cost of naming. The phrasebook's "begin as one" and the final recognition that "water that begins as one must learn to part again" reweight the premise without moralizing. The piece resists tidy answers—the editor's fear that naming tames coexists with trust that "naming follows listening, the way a scar follows an honest wound"—and the final image (closing the ledger, letting the stove speak) offers a resonant, non-literal answer. No thematic echo or direct statement; the conceptual cost of governance and future departure charges the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: "dry-witted," precise diction ("quorum of thawed decisions"), and a rhythm that modulates from lyric compression in setting to embodied action at the valve. Register is consistent—technical ("culvert," "locker of rust") yet imagistic ("a small sun trying to herald morning from thin, blue ribs")—and no head-hopping occurs. The falcon remains external, observed but not voiced. Minor deduction for occasional elevated figuration in peak beats ("rivulets accepted their siblings") that slightly distances the reader from immediate physical sensation, though it remains voice-coherent and does not obscure clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and lengths create visual and aural texture. Information density is high—most lines advance image, choice, or atmosphere—and no paraphrase loops or template cadence runs appear. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and voice-motivated. Deductions: "a sound like a door considering whether to close" and "water moved black and holy" veer toward strained metaphor in high-pressure beats; "lines gathered from the corners, leaned toward one another, and stitched a trembling vein" is vivid but dense enough to slow the valve-turn moment slightly. No artifacts touch the closure beat. Propulsion is strong overall.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of condensation-as-oracle, cartographic quest, and embodied listening feels specific and non-obvious; the phrasebook's multilingual verbs and the falcon-as-clerk are fresh angles on the atlas-editor premise. The valve-turn as convergence-governance is earned in hindsight through prior breath-on-glass beats. Risk-taking in lyric compression and the quiet, reconfigured ending heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Minor deduction: the core frame (solitary specialist deciphering natural patterns) echoes familiar templates; transformation is solid but not transformative enough to reach the highest band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The atlas editor's choices drive all key turns: fogging the window and sketching (middle beat), walking to the shore and following the condensation arrows (escalation), and turning the valve (climax). The dry wit shapes perception ("the falcon shook snow from its back and glared at me as if to herald impatience") and the subtitle confidence enables the valve-turn despite fear. Present in closure when the editor closes the ledger and commits to tomorrow. Subtly confident attribute constrains the turn with visible cost. All three gates met; causal pressure and closure linkage strong.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The phrasebook appears in three beats: beside the inkpot at setup, offering "Follow" in reed and guttural hush mid-story, and providing the mountain-dialect prayer "begin as one" at the valve. Its multilingual, migratory history charges the theme of naming and listening. The dog-ear "curled like a pet that finally trusted the floor" at closure signals earned trust but does not causally shape the final choice. Setup and development gates met; closure participation is atmospheric rather than causally active. Meaningful but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Singular convergence shapes stakes from the outset: the editor seeks where rivers begin, the falcon reports convergence, and the valve-turn enacts it ("rivulets accepted their siblings"). The concept drives the middle descent to the culvert and the climactic turn, then reweights in closure when the editor recognizes "water that begins as one must learn to part again." All three gates met; causal pressure, closure linkage, and specificity all strong. Cost is conceptual (the atlas will breathe differently) and vocational (future departure). Indispensable to structure and theme.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Subtly confident is stated once ("I am not brave, but I am subtly confident in the way hard winters shape a person") and enables the editor to step outside and turn the valve despite fear of taming. It constrains the choice with visible cost (the editor's wit rests at closure, unneeded). Setup gate met; development shows the trait enabling action under pressure; closure shows the trait's modulation (confidence no longer needed). Visible tradeoff present. Two-of-three gates met with solid development; not indispensable but purposeful.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Herald appears in multiple forms: the falcon "glared at me as if to herald impatience," the outpost lamp "a small sun trying to herald morning," the editor becoming "clerk and herald" who records the convergence. The action defines the editor's final role and charges the closure commitment to follow departure. Setup in the falcon's glare, development in the lamp image, payoff in the editor's self-designation. All three gates met; causal role in closure stance. Not mechanically indispensable but thematically essential and tied to cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The pattern of condensation on glass is signaled early ("struck a match, fogged the window, and sketched with a fingertip"), used twice more to guide the editor ("breathed onto my field glass," "the condensation mapped a new insistence"), and paid off when "the pattern on the window thinned, the prophet content once the sermon concluded." The method shapes all three directional choices (leftward, descent, under the hill) and charges the closure image. All three gates met; causal pressure and specificity high. Removing it would break the navigation logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The rusted outpost pressures every choice: it frames the opening, supplies the lamp and stove, and defines the cold that forces breath-condensation. The culvert beneath the hill houses the valves; the frozen lake supplies the threshold crossed. The outpost anchors closure when the editor returns to warm hands and close the ledger. All three gates met; environment constrains movement and supplies resources. Micro-setting (body, breath, field glass) also functions as setting. Essential to spatial logic and closure return.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>After the falcon returns is stated once in the opening ("the hour after the falcon returns") and establishes a post-event window. The falcon's report ("it had flown along the thready rivers") creates urgency, but no on-page clock tightens decisions beyond general cold and nightfall. Setup gate met; development shows the falcon's impatience and report; closure shows the falcon departing "like a signed decree." Time does not narrow options beat-to-beat. Functional but not indispensable; swappable with "dusk" or "evening" without major structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>To find where the rivers begin is stated explicitly ("I had come here to find where the rivers begin") and drives every choice: fogging the window, following condensation arrows, descending to the culvert, turning the valve. Friction between the goal and the fear of taming charges the valve-turn and the closure recognition that the editor must now follow departure. All three gates met; causal pressure, closure linkage, and visible cost (occupational and conceptual) all strong. The motivation is the story's spine.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Worrying tranquility is named in the opening ("all creak and frost and worrying tranquility") and modulates across beats: the lake "held its breath," the ice made "a sound like a door considering whether to close," silence arrived "as if the world kept pausing to listen for proof," and tranquility returns at closure "still worrying, because water that begins as one must learn to part again." Tone charges the final image and reflects the unresolved tension. All three gates met; coherent through turns and purposefully unresolved at closure.</comment>
