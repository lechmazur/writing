<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The lucid dream chronicler's interiority is concrete and particular, embodied through specific micro-choices ("I choose to soar...not away but along"). Internal contradiction operates well—jealousy of past selves versus acceptance of chronological confusion. The protagonist's renunciation at the ending (patrolling "the day after my own funeral" rather than correcting the burial) forecloses the path of resurrection with visible cost. Minor penalty for occasional label-leaning phrases ("feral nostalgia paced the room") that border on abstraction, though most emotional beats remain embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly within the opening paragraph. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered dream logic, the scroll's dates "loop backward, forward, sideways," and the final image reweights the opening grave with the narrator packing the scroll and patrolling forward. Closure is Charged Poise/Earned Stasis—the narrator accepts chronological confusion and continues without resurrection, forecloses correction with felt cost ("let the narrative soar somewhere just ahead, dragging you kindly"). One meaningful deepening when the dream-flight over the grave transforms the stones into question marks. Cost is legible in the choice to walk forward after one's own funeral.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The mountain ranger cabin constrains multiple choices: the stove's ticking and need for feeding anchor the waking/sleeping boundary, the map drawer houses the scroll, the kettle marks elapsed dream time. The birch bark scroll functions as micro-setting, charging the final image when packed "with the first aid kit, because language can bleed." Sensory selection reflects POV priorities (spruce tea, wet wool, snow rasping windows). Minor penalty for the ridge and grave remaining slightly abstract in spatial detail—distances and terrain features could be more tactile during the soaring sequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early: "to distill chaos into narrative" and resolve chronological confusion. The tightening occurs when jealousy of past selves sharpens the scroll's letters, forcing them to "confess their pattern," then deepens in the dream when the narrator bargains with feral nostalgia, trading envy for continuity. The final choice—to pack the scroll and patrol forward without correcting the burial—narrows options with on-page cost: accepting death's ledger rather than resurrection. Agency is renunciation with visible consequence ("ready to patrol the day after my own funeral"). One clean escalation under the Accumulative lens; pressure coheres throughout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: the scroll's chaotic dates, the grave's shifting initials, the kettle's hiss as time anchor. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer—narratives as "the only heat that lasts," tested by packing the scroll with first aid, walking forward "chronologically confused but forward." No overt moralizing; the ending reweights "jaded wonder" (opening phrase) into a profession of forward motion. The recurring motif of the scroll constrains choice (bargaining for continuity, aligning dates) and charges the closure without being forced. Minor penalty for one phrase that borders on theme-stating ("Continuity is a trick river plays on stones"), though it's spoken to the creature rather than reader-facing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single-POV first person with a distinct perceptual signature: compressed, lyric diction ("stones stacked like unsent letters," "snow crouched at the windowsill like a sentinel"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully—tighter during the dream flight, wider during waking reflection. No head-hopping; focalization stays locked. Purposeful compression and patterned repetition ("I wrote fast...I wrote slow") are taught early and pay off at closure. Minor penalty for occasional filter-stack ("I wanted...to distill") in high-pressure beats, though the effect remains voice-consistent and does not dull immediacy significantly. Experimental tolerance applies; the piece teaches its lyric mode by the second paragraph.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>High information density with most lines doing multiple jobs ("Dreams know my name because I autograph them for a living, or a dying, whatever order I wake into"). Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings are diverse. Two paraphrase moments near the midpoint: "I was chronologically confused again" echoes the opening claim without adding new pressure, and the "I wrote fast...I wrote slow" couplet borders on semantic loop though it serves thematic rhythm. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; one mixed vehicle ("the floor rose like a wave...buoyant as a leaf") blurs scale. No template cadence or pronoun drift. Strong propulsion overall; the loops and metaphor muddle cost −0.4 cumulatively in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of lucid dream chronicler, birch bark scroll as map of recursive time, and jealousy-as-method is specific and non-obvious. The piece transforms the familiar "character confronts own death" premise through chronological confusion that becomes a vocational stance rather than mere confusion. Risk-taking in structure (dream logic layered with waking anchors, no hard scene break) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The final turn—patrolling forward after one's funeral as a professional act—feels inevitable in hindsight, arising from the scroll's alignment and the bargain with nostalgia. One phrase ("narratives are the only heat that lasts") risks platitude, but the surrounding particulars (spruce tea, kettle, first aid kit for language) ground it. Within-band risk bonus applies: +0.3 for sustained lyric compression that remains legible.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setup: signaled in the opening sentence. Development: the chronicler's vocational stance (autographing dreams, mapping sleeping weather) shapes the choice to bargain with nostalgia and align the scroll's dates. Closure: packing the scroll with the first aid kit and patrolling forward "chronologically confused but forward" is a direct professional choice with visible cost—accepting death's ledger rather than correcting it. Three distinct beats (opening identity claim, dream-flight as documentation, packing scroll as professional tool). Irreplaceability high; the vocation drives the logic of navigating recursive time and treating language as first aid. Cost legible: the narrator chooses chronicle-work over resurrection.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setup: introduced at ~15% ("birch bark scroll in the map drawer"). Development: two distinct beats—touched and traced in the cabin (letters climb off, dates align), then stretched across the sky in the dream where a paragraph "began to behave." Closure: packed with the first aid kit in the final waking beat, reweighted as professional tool and language-as-injury metaphor. Three gates met. Causal pressure: aligning the scroll's dates enables the dream-flight and the bargain with nostalgia. Specificity: birch bark and scraped surface matter; the medium encodes both fragility and Indigenous recording tradition. Cost tied: packing it commits the narrator to forward patrol without correcting the grave.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Setup: named explicitly at ~20% ("feral nostalgia paced the room"). Development: the creature guards syllables in the dream, forcing a trade (envy for continuity), which constrains the narrator's tactics. Closure: the final sentence's "dragging you kindly" echoes the creature's pull. Two gates met (middle and closure). Causal pressure moderate: the bargain enables the scroll's alignment, but the mechanism is somewhat abstract. Swappability concern: "regret" or "longing" could substitute with minor edits; "feral" adds edge but the creature's function remains generic guardian. Cost visible but not deeply irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setup: signaled in the opening line ("chronologically confused") and repeated in line two. Development: shapes the dream logic where "my first patrol was happening beside my tenth failure," enabling the narrator to see past/present/future simultaneously and bargain for continuity. Closure: the final line's "chronologically confused but forward" is the achieved stance. Three beats (opening label, dream-time overlap, closing acceptance). Causal pressure: the trait enables the scroll's non-linear dates to be readable and actionable. Cost tied: accepting confusion forecloses the desire for linear clarity. Minor penalty: the attribute is more enabling than constraining—no moment where it costs the narrator a tactical choice mid-scene.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setup: foreshadowed early ("let the narrative soar") and enacted at ~50% ("Then the floor rose like a wave...I soared over the ridge"). Development: the soaring beat reveals the grave's initials unraveling into question marks, redefines spatial relationship to past selves, and enables the bargain with nostalgia. Closure: the final image's "let the narrative soar somewhere just ahead, dragging you kindly" recapitulates the action as method and stance. Three gates met. Causal pressure high: soaring changes the narrator's knowledge (grave becomes question marks) and enables the closing choice. Irreplaceability strong; "climb" or "float" would not carry the same charged reconfiguration of vertical/horizontal logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Setup: signaled at ~25% ("I used my oldest method, getting jealous of past selves until the present brightened like magnesium"). Development: the jealousy sharpens the scroll's edges, making letters climb off; later the narrator bargains by "trading the envy I felt for the younger ranger." Closure: the trade enables continuity and the final patrol stance. Two beats (cabin sharpening, dream bargain). Causal pressure clear: the method changes the scroll and unlocks the creature's cooperation. Minor penalty: the mechanics are somewhat abstract—how jealousy materially sharpens perception is asserted more than dramatized. Cost tied: trading envy forecloses nostalgia's claim, but the price is conceptual rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Setup: anchored in the opening paragraph ("mountain ranger cabin"). Development: the cabin supplies the map drawer with the scroll, the stove that ticks and needs feeding (anchoring waking/sleeping boundary), the window where nostalgia's reflection appears. Closure: "the kettle had sighed itself senseless" marks elapsed dream time; the narrator packs the scroll and exits to patrol. Three beats (stove/drawer/window as resources, dream-float where "the cabin kept up," waking return). Causal pressure: the cabin's objects constrain the narrator's actions (must feed stove, consult drawer, brew tea as patience). Specificity: ranger cabin ties to occupation and radio motif. Cost tied: staying in the cabin versus patrolling forward is the final choice.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Setup: title position ("after seeing my own grave"). Development: the grave's observation triggers the return to the cabin and the scroll consultation; in the dream, soaring over the grave reveals the stones forming initials then question marks, redefining the narrator's knowledge. Closure: the final paragraph's "ready to patrol the day after my own funeral" directly invokes the timeframe as the new stance. Three beats (opening trigger, dream-flight revelation, closing acceptance). Causal pressure high: the grave's existence frames the dominant stake (reconcile death with narrative-work) and the ending forecloses resurrection. Specificity: "after" rather than "before" matters—post-death time inverts urgency. Cost legible: patrolling post-funeral is renunciation with visible consequence.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Setup: stated explicitly at ~18% ("I wanted, more than warmth, to distill chaos into narrative"). Development: the desire drives the scroll consultation, the jealousy method, the dream-flight to align dates, and the bargain with nostalgia. Closure: packing the scroll "because language can bleed" and patrolling forward enacts the distillation with cost. Three beats (cabin want, dream alignment, closing action). Causal pressure high: the motive shapes every major choice and tactic. Friction visible: the narrator's want ("order was wrong, but wanting the wrongness to confess its pattern") conflicts with the scroll's chaos, forcing trade-offs. Cost tied: accepting that chaos requires respect ("I have made a profession of bowing to it without kneeling") forecloses tidy resolution. Irreplaceability strong; the vocational frame depends on this exact motive.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Setup: opening phrase ("jaded wonder"). Development: the tone modulates—jaded in the cabin's opening beats ("the grave was smaller than memory"), wonder intensifies during the dream-flight ("the snow hissed like applause withheld"), then recombines in the waking close ("Jaded wonder is the flavor of that coffee, bitter as spruce pitch, sweet as a thaw you do not trust"). Closure: the final line's "dragging you kindly" fuses weariness with forward motion, charging the ending image. Two distinct modulations (cabin restraint, dream expansion, closing synthesis). Tone coherence holds through turns without flatlining. The explicit mid-story definition ("Jaded wonder is the flavor of that coffee") borders on self-annotation but is anchored in sensory detail (spruce pitch, thaw) and reweights the opening phrase with cost, so the reprise earns its place.</comment>
