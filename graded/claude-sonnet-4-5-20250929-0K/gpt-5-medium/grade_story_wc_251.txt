<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The chess coach's motivation is grounded in a desire to slow the town's pace, and the children's "unspoken words" create a consistent perceptual filter. However, interiority often drifts into abstract philosophizing ("strategy is just long listening") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The climactic grotto scene shows the coach watching rather than wrestling with a live choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Micro-choices exist (organizing displays, placing boards) but lack the weight of genuine internal conflict or felt renunciation at closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens early (mist, benches, library as recurring anchors) and attempts closure through a pattern of slowing and reflection. Orientation is delayed—who, where, and when coalesce only after ~150 words—but the mist/library frame eventually pays off, so I waive the Orientation Test penalty. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the town "cradles questions"), yet the cost remains conceptual and diffuse; I cannot point to a single on-page sentence where a specific price is paid or a live option foreclosed. The final image ("leaves promising shade") reweights the opening but lacks the sharpness required for high-band entry.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The cobalt library, mist, and magnetic grotto supply vivid, purpose-driven anchors that recur and charge the final image. The grotto's iron veins (compasses fail) directly enable the climactic stalemate exercise, satisfying the 9+ gate for constraint. Sensory detail is filtered through the coach's perception ("mist curled like quiet music"), and the basalt plinths ground the endgame physically. Minor deduction: the town's spatial layout remains vague between shop-window beats, and some descriptions ("breath like paper drinks light") tilt ornamental without altering tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—planting "forests of second thoughts"—is signaled early and drives the window-display choreography and grotto gathering. However, escalation under the Accumulative lens is a single deepening (the town slows, the children practice stalemate) without a second beat that narrows options or raises cost. The coach's agency is primarily observational ("I watched"), and the resolution ("we might live with our next moves unfinished") is asserted rather than earned through a protagonist decision that forecloses a path. No persistent constraint (time, resource, opposition) shapes tactics or the final image.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the chess/slowness motif: "decisions need a longer cradle than a clock." The final image ("leaves promising shade for those not rushing") reweights the opening without stating a moral, and the grotto's magnetic pull operates as effective subtext for disrupted certainty. The "prophecy" frame and "unspoken words" recur with shifted meaning, earning the 9+ quick test for resonant reconfiguration. Minor slip: occasional therapy-speak ("tender admission," "carry-through") edges toward abstraction, and the phrase "humble rebellion" appears both as concept and thematic echo, risking redundancy.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>First-person voice is stable and carries a distinct perceptual signature (chess metaphors, listening for "unspoken words"). Psychic distance remains controlled, and no head-hopping occurs. However, diction often drifts into elevated register ("amplified quiet," "cradling, too, were my plans") that feels authored rather than voice-consistent under the coach's claimed humility. The children's whispered jokes about bishops are mentioned but never dramatized, missing an opportunity for dialogue that would test subtext and character distinction. Purposeful compression (lyric phrasing, patterned elision) is taught early and legible at closure, so no experimental penalty applies.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, and many lines do double duty ("small kings felt warm as teacups" merges image and stakes). However, pervasive figurative density in high-pressure beats ("mist curled like quiet music," "needles over true north," "breath like paper drinks light") stacks metaphors without always clarifying cause or sharpening pressure, triggering a −0.5 overwriting deduction. Paraphrase loops appear ("unspoken words" recurs five times across similar constructions), and template cadence ("I could hear…," "We…") runs through multiple paragraphs without pattern payoff, adding −0.6 for scaffold. One run of participle openers in the grotto sequence blurs action order. No artifacts touch the final beat directly, so I do not escalate penalties or disallow 9+ globally, but accumulated line debt caps this category in the mid-6s.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of chess coaching, magnetic grotto, and town-wide window choreography is non-obvious and specific to this voice. The "magnetic grotto" as a site where compasses fail literalizes thematic uncertainty in a fresh way, and the deliberate stalemate practice transforms the familiar mentor-student trope. Risk-taking (lyric compression, extended metaphor) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, earning a +0.3 within-band adjustment. Minor deduction: the "humble rebellion" phrase and "forests of second thoughts" tilt toward writing-prompt echo, and the resolution (slowing as transformation) lacks a counter-pressure or cost sharp enough to feel fully inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The coach is present throughout, frames the stakes, organizes the window displays (middle beat), and orchestrates the grotto endgame (closure beat). However, the coach primarily observes and facilitates rather than making a choice that alters their own options or forecloses a path with visible cost. The role is essential to the premise but the character's agency is thin; the children and town change, the coach does not. Setup and development gates are met; closure participation is present but not causally active. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.4 (weak), swappability −0.6 (another guide/teacher could serve), no on-page cost tied to the coach's own renunciation −0.4. Band guidance suggests mid-5s for functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The grotto appears in setup (introduced ~40% as "magnetic grotto under starlight"), is dramatized in the climactic scene where compasses fail and children play stalemate, and charges the final image ("the grotto let our needles waver"). Its magnetic property constrains choice (disorientation as metaphor and physical fact) and is handled on the page (boards placed, lanterns carried). Early signal +0.6, two distinct beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.0 (enables the stalemate exercise), closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.6 (iron veins, basalt plinths). No major frictions. Reaches high-7s for essential participation across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Humble rebellion" is named early, drives the window-display method, and the grotto gathering enacts it (practicing refusal to finish). It shapes stakes and tactics on the page rather than remaining abstract theme. Setup +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.8 (organizes town intervention), closure linkage +0.9 (the town "cradles questions"), but the concept is also stated outright ("Call it a humble rebellion"), reducing irreplaceability −0.5, and the final cost is diffuse rather than sharp −0.3. Mid-6s for solid integration with some thematic redundancy.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Hears unspoken words" is introduced early, recurs as perceptual filter throughout (children's doubts, town's questions), and charges the penultimate beat ("unspoken words the town carried…sounded like leaves"). However, it remains largely label-only; no scene shows the coach acting on heard subtext in a way that narrows options or imposes cost. Setup +0.6, weak development (perceptual, not action-driving) +0.3, closure linkage +0.6 (present in final reflection), label-only usage −0.7, no cost −0.4. Mid-5s for present but not causally decisive.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Cradle" appears three times: children cradle knights, the coach's plans are "held close…cradling," and "decisions need a longer cradle than a clock" at closure. The action is embodied (hands on pieces) and the final line ("cradling") reweights prior material, earning lyric-resonance credit. Setup +0.6, closure linkage +1.4 (decisive reprise), specificity +0.5 (tactile and thematic), but middle development is weak (only one dramatized beat where cradling alters choice) −0.4, and the term's metaphoric and literal uses blur without sharp cost −0.3. High-6s for strong closure participation with thin middle causality.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Window displays are introduced early ("organizing synchronized window displays"), detailed in the middle third (baker, tailor, music shop), and execute at the appointed minute when "every window…shifted." The method shapes the rebellion's form and is causally active (town stops, looks, slows). Setup +0.7, two beats +0.9 (planning and execution), causal pressure +1.0 (alters town behavior), closure linkage +0.8 (town "cradles questions" as direct result), but the mechanics remain summary ("each shopkeeper agreed") without on-page negotiation or friction −0.5, and the displays could be replaced by another coordinated signal without breaking logic −0.4. Mid-to-high-6s for essential participation with some swappability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The "cobalt library in mist" opens and closes the story, anchors the coach's role, and pools "blue on the steps" in the final image. It functions as micro-setting and charges closure through lyric reprise. Setup +0.8 (first line), closure linkage +1.4 (final third), specificity +0.4 (cobalt as distinct color), but middle development is absent (no choice constrained by the library's space or resources) −0.6, and spatial choreography inside the library is never dramatized −0.3. Lyric-resonance allowance applies; mid-6s for purposeful frame without beat-level constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"During the hush where past meets prophecy" is stated once in the opening and never operationalized. Time is tracked loosely ("tonight," "the appointed minute," "when the stars dimmed") but does not tighten decisions or alter tactics. The "prophecy" returns in the final third ("The prophecy some feared was only this…") as thematic claim rather than temporal pressure. Setup +0.4 (present early), closure thematic echo +0.3, but no middle development −0.8, no clock that narrows options −1.0, ornamental phrasing −0.6, swappability high −0.5. Low-to-mid-4s for present but non-functional.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"To plant forests of second thoughts" is articulated early, drives the window and grotto interventions, and the final image ("leaves promising shade") completes the metaphor. The motivation shapes stakes and is tested on the page (will the town slow?). Setup +0.7, two beats +0.9 (organizing, observing outcome), closure linkage +1.3 (leaves image), causal pressure +0.9 (organizes rebellion), but the desire is told more than dramatized through internal conflict −0.6 (no moment where the coach weighs cost of failure or success), and the resolution is collective rather than personal −0.4. Mid-to-high-6s for solid thematic and causal work with thin interiority.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Amplified quiet" is named early, sustained through "hush," "mist," "pieces clicked like rain," and "breath…like paper drinks light," and charges the grotto scene ("the grotto hummed"). Tone modulates under pressure (from waiting to deliberate action to reflective close) and is coherent across turns. Setup +0.7, present in all major beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.1 (final "slower voice than fear"), specificity +0.6 (quiet as active force, not passive absence), but occasional figurative density blurs momentum in mid-story −0.4, and the tone risks static lyricism in the middle third −0.3. High-7s for strong tonal integration that charges the final image with minor mid-story drift.</comment>
