<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The narrator demonstrates consistent interiority through calmly intuitive methods, embodied in the patient mirror work and final proposal. Internal voice remains coherent with poetic specificity ("shadows lace me tighter, a mantle earned by patience"), though some lines ("I am calmly intuitive, my teachers used to say ruefully") edge toward self-conscious labeling. The choice to stay a season and the visible acceptance of the role's weight provide credible endurance with cost. Minor penalty for the direct trait announcement, but the embodied patience and final commitment earn the band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the mirrors reconstitute understanding through layered glimpses, and the proposal emerges from pattern recognition rather than causal reversal. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration—the community's "smallest synchronized movement" and the narrator's decision to stay constitute Earned Stasis with visible cost (staying a season, accepting the mantle). Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening lines. One meaningful deepening occurs when the shard reveals the historical wound, reweighting the quarrel and enabling the proposal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard, ice floes, and vintage store supply vivid, purposeful constraint: the groaning ice underscores urgency, the mirrors enable reconstitution, and the lantern pears charge the climactic gathering. Sensory selection is excellent ("floes bit at each other like tired wolves," "ice groaning below like a thing trying to sleep"). The shard's silk wrap and the mirrors' "quiet choir" recur with shifted meaning at closure. The environment pressures choices (beacon saplings, watch shifts paired to the tides) and the final image of a splitting floe signals ongoing stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—bridging the rift between keepers and fishers—is signaled early and tightens when the shard reveals the drowned child. The narrator's patience under Matilde's and Harun's challenges constitutes agency via endurance, and the proposal (beacon saplings, paired shifts, naming the child) forecloses easy blame with visible social cost. One clear deepening: the mirrors show "the underside of choices," transforming abstract blame into actionable amends. The nod at the end carries weight because the prior beats established the depth of mistrust.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "a courageous anomaly is only courageous until it becomes practice, and practice, finally, is how peace keeps." The reconstituted sphere, beacon saplings, and the ledger-as-compost image avoid thesis statements and arise from particulars. The final image (floe splitting "like a page turning") offers resonant closure without moralizing. Minor deduction for the explicit thesis in the penultimate paragraph ("guilt would be compost, not a flag"), which edges toward articulation rather than pure dramatization.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout: "shadow-laced peacekeeper," "patience were a stubborn weed," "the mirrors hummed with other afternoons." Psychic distance remains stable; no head-hopping. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful, with Matilde's and Harun's challenges carrying subtext and resistance. The prose rhythm modulates effectively from the meditative mirror scene to the tense lantern-pear gathering. Syntax and diction cohere as a singular lyric-realist voice under pressure, with no filter-verb stacks or voice leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High information density with minimal loops. Figurative language is consistently controlled and purposeful ("lanterns shaped like pears," "guilt would be compost, not a flag"), avoiding mixed metaphors. One brief paraphrase near the ending ("not together and not apart, the smallest synchronized movement") restates nuance without adding pressure, but the slip is minor and does not touch the closure image. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings diversify. No template cadence, scaffold, or register drift. Strong propulsion and clarity throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The combination of lighthouse orchard, ice-floe setting, vintage-store mirrors, and the reconstitution method offers a specific, non-obvious synthesis. The peacekeeper role transforms the mediator trope through lyric patience and mirror-driven forensic work. The beacon-sapling proposal and the decision to stay a season avoid convenient resolution. Risk is evident in the slow, reflection-heavy pacing and the choice to resolve via earned stasis rather than dramatic reversal. The "courageous anomaly" frame and the final aphorism feel slightly template-adjacent, preventing entry to the highest band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setup: present in the opening line. Development: the narrator's decision to use mirrors (middle) and the proposal at the gathering both hinge on the peacekeeper role. Payoff: the choice to stay a season and the final image ("shadows lace me tighter") confirm the role's cost. The role drives two distinct beats (mirror method, proposal) and shapes the ending. Causal pressure is evident; specificity is high. Swappability is low—removing "shadow-laced peacekeeper" would require rewriting the narrator's methods and stance.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setup: introduced early ("I carried the broken crystal ball fragment"). Development: handled in the vintage-store mirror scene (reconstitution) and again at the lantern-pear gathering (held to reflect light, reveal the sphere). Payoff: the shard "fall[s] back into silk" at the end, marking the shift from divination to earned practice. Three distinct beats; visible causal work (enables the glimpse method, charges the proposal moment). The shard's fragmentation is essential to the reconstitution logic. Slightly below highest band because the ending cameo is brief.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setup: appears late ("we would name the child...the courageous anomaly"). Development: the concept does not constrain middle choices; it enters as a naming proposal. Payoff: returns in the final paragraph ("a courageous anomaly is only courageous until it becomes practice") with thematic weight. Two-of-three gates (development is weak, setup is late). The lyric reprise reweights the child's loss, but the concept does not shape tactics on the page—it functions as theme label rather than dramatized stake.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Setup: stated explicitly ("I am calmly intuitive, my teachers used to say ruefully"). Development: the trait enables the mirror method and the wait through arguments ("I waited through the rise and fall without offering rescue"). Payoff: the narrator's decision to stay a season embodies patience with cost. Two-of-three gates plus a clear cost. The trait shapes two beats (mirror work, endurance at the gathering). Minor penalty for the label-only introduction; stronger credit for the embodied patience in action.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Setup: signaled early ("we began to reconstitute via glimpses"). Development: the reconstitution reveals the historical wound (the child's fall) and enables the proposal. Payoff: the reconstituted sphere "hover[s] again around us" at the ending, making peace legible. Three gates; high causal pressure. The action is irreplaceable—removing reconstitution would collapse the mirror method and the closure logic. Strong specificity and cost connection.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setup: introduced in the vintage-store sequence ("I held the shard before them"). Development: the mirrors supply "ghostly curvature" and "other afternoons," enabling the glimpse of the drowned child. Payoff: "the mirrors of the vintage store still spoke in me" in the penultimate paragraph. Three gates; strong causal work (the method is the story's engine). The mirrors' mechanics (overlap, consent, seam recording) shape the protagonist's tactics. Slight swappability (generic "reflective surfaces" might substitute) prevents highest band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setup: opening line anchors the orchard and ice floes. Development: the setting informs the beacon-sapling proposal (floe lanes, safe crossings, tides). Payoff: the floe split ("like a page turning") charges the final image. Three gates; moderate causal pressure. The ice's groaning and the orchard's lantern pears add atmospheric pressure, and the beacon proposal is setting-specific. Could score higher if the environment constrained a middle choice more tightly; here it mostly supplies context and the proposal's logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Setup: appears late, in the climactic gathering ("Between my words and their answer, during the weighted breath before reply"). Development: none—the timeframe is invoked once. Payoff: the phrase frames the moment when the sphere "hover[s] again," but it does not constrain tactics or recur. One gate (payoff only); no mid-beat use. The timeframe is poetic but replaceable; removing it would not break the closure logic. Late introduction and single mention cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Setup: stated in the opening ("I wanted to map empathy onto action"). Development: the mirror method and the amends proposal both dramatize the mapping. Payoff: the decision to stay and "keep the watches and learn their names" embodies the motive with cost. Three gates; strong causal work. The motive drives the protagonist's tactics (patience, reconstitution, proposal). Minor penalty for the early tell rather than full dramatization, but the ending choice earns the mid-7s neighborhood.</comment>
