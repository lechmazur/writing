<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The uncertain alchemist's interiority is richly embodied through concrete gestures—calipers kissing craters, face-dunking as ritual—and the internal contradiction between doubt and compulsion lands cleanly. The bond with Mira is dramatized through objects and sensory memory rather than abstraction, and the final choice to hang the charm back carries visible cost: "swings toward the statue, as if that moon had found a tide again." Minor slip: the phrase "quilts memories together, piecing blueprints to lullabies" risks abstraction, but the surrounding tactile work anchors it. Motivation intensifies from "promised myself" to visible stakes (the engine, the charm) under escalating pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Orientation anchors early: workshop, acid sea, alchemist present. The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered tactile beats (measurements, bell-humming, soldering) until the final image reweights the opening promise with audible cost—"low music keeps me from the edge." Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the engine speaks, names the pattern, and the protagonist commits to tomorrow's work with "sharpened hope," forecloses retreat. Cost is legible: "She did not give me her, but it gives me the pattern of her choosing." One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The workshop environment constrains choice: pontoons groan, fumes sting, the cooling cistern becomes a tactical necessity ("each plunge steals a little fear"). The acid sea, gears, glass bells, and pockmarked statue are not merely vivid but functional—the statue's craters encode the ribs' choreography, directly shaping the protagonist's method. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency: salt, solder, fog on glass. The final image ("pontoons rising as if the acid forgot its hunger") charges the ending by reversing the opening threat. Micro-setting (calipers, seams, bells) drives the closure beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: "conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion" and "complete the memory engine." Escalation under the Accumulative lens: measurements → bell-hum → charm installation → engine speech, each beat narrowing options until the final choice to "finish the rest tomorrow" forecloses despair with visible cost (unsure still, bearing "sharpened hope"). Agency is decision and endurance: the protagonist sets the final pendulum, an act that reweights Mira's absence. No coincidence resolves; the engine offers pattern, not resurrection. One meaningful tightening at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: kintsugi as enacted philosophy (golden seams on the engine, not metaphor-only), the statue's "map of absence," and the charm's reprise. The ending offers a non-literal answer—pattern rather than person—and reweights the opening's "lead in my chest" with "sharpened hope," a stance that accepts cost without resolution. No thesis statement; the bells' "grammar of distances" and "low music" crystallize meaning. Subtext operates in gesture: the charm swinging toward the statue enacts tidal pull without explaining it. Complexity: the protagonist gains direction, not comfort.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person; perceptual signature is richly specific ("my hands smell of salt and solder," "each plunge steals a little fear"). Diction stays character-bound: alchemical idiom ("solvents to the smell of her wrists," "dire enchantment") without corporate drift. Purposeful compression ("She said the pocks encoded a map of absence") accelerates momentum. Minor slip: "kintsugi intentions" reads slightly elevated for crisis narration, though the surrounding tactile work anchors it. Rhythm modulates: long immersive sentences under reflection, shorter beats at closure ("I whisper that I will finish the rest tomorrow").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; nearly every sentence advances image, choice, or atmosphere. Figurative language is sustained ("the sea gnaws," "wind threads the machine") but stays coherent and voice-motivated, not ornamental. Minor loop: "The seam is not apology, it is a declaration" / "Her absence is a diagram" risk synonym churn in the middle third, and the phrase "Time here is counted between breaths held underwater, when I duck my head into the cooling cistern to spare my lungs" is mildly circuitous. No sentence-stem templates; rhythm varies purposefully. Clarity at closure is pristine ("the bells agree with a weary concord").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of kintsugi philosophy, memory engine, pockmarked statue, and acid-sea workshop feels inevitable in hindsight rather than assembled from prompt tokens. The choice to make the key-ring charm the final pendulum—"the one piece Mira refused to draw"—transforms a personal object into structural necessity. Risk: the lyric density and metaphor saturation could flatten, but the tactile anchors (calipers, solder, bells) prevent abstraction. The turn from seeking resurrection to accepting pattern is non-obvious and earned. Transformation test passes: swap the setting or method and the emotional logic collapses.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The uncertain alchemist makes key choices: measures the statue, sets the ribs, hangs the charm as pendulum, commits to tomorrow's work. Present throughout; decisions alter tactics (dunking to clarify) and drive closure (charm installation activates the engine). Cost tied to the attribute: uncertainty persists ("unsure still") even as hope sharpens.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Key ring charm appears early (setup), is taken down and installed as the final pendulum (middle action with causal pressure), and swings toward the statue at closure, reweighting the opening loss. Three beats: introduction, installation, final swing. Irreplaceable: "the one piece Mira refused to draw." Closure participation and charged reprise.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kintsugi intentions shape stakes and tactics: the protagonist solders gold seams to gild fractures, not hide them. Explicit early ("kintsugi intentions"), enacted in the middle ("tiny rivers of gold that flicker"), and present at closure ("low music keeps me from the edge"). Not merely thematic; the method (golden seaming) alters the engine's construction and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Quilts memories together, piecing blueprints to lullabies" appears once in the first third as a label for the protagonist's mental process. No second beat where this trait constrains or enables a choice with visible cost. Present in setup, absent in development and payoff. Functional but replaceable; the memory work proceeds without this specific metaphor shaping tactics.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Narrate appears as explicit action: "I speak aloud as I work because the engine yawns unless I narrate the logic it will inherit." This method is signaled early, enacted in the middle ("My words tap the bells"), and the engine's final speech ("a grammar of distances") repays the narration. Two beats; causal pressure (engine requires narration); closure linkage (the engine speaks back). Essential to the ending.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Matching pockmarks signaled early ("the engine would sing if the ribs matched those scars"), executed in the middle ("I trace the statue now, my calipers kissing each crater"), and paid off at closure ("the statue's pockmarks glow with sourceless starlight"). Three beats; irreplaceable mechanics. The method drives the protagonist's entire task and the ending's visual charge. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The workshop is introduced immediately, pressures choices (fumes sting, pontoons groan, cooling cistern becomes tactical necessity), and participates in closure ("the workshop steadies, the pontoons rising"). Gears, acid sea, and floating structure constrain the protagonist's work and charge the final stabilization. Three beats; causal involvement; closure participation. Strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Timeframe "between breaths held underwater" appears in the first third, recurs as a tactical ritual ("Between measurements, I dunk my face again"), and the final breath-hold ("I hold my breath without water") reweights the opening frame. Lyric reprise with charged payoff. Two gates (setup, closure); middle use is ritual rather than decision-shaping. Purposeful but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation "to conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion" is stated early, dramatized through the memory-engine project (middle beats), and reweighted at closure: the engine gives pattern, not person, and the protagonist accepts "sharpened hope." Friction is visible: "That promise was light once, now it is lead in my chest." Three beats; causal driver; closure participation. Essential.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Tone of "dire enchantment" coheres from the opening ("a night rusted with green fumes," "rafters drip a tone of dire enchantment") through the middle (bells tremble, engine drinks the room) to the final image ("low music keeps me from the edge"). The tone modulates with pressure—dread to ritual focus to weary concord—and charges the closure without flattening. Purposeful and integral.</comment>
