<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The apprentice's interior is richly specific—"sleep under charts and wake with compass dust on my cheek"—and embodied choices under pressure (brewing tea, pinning the dog-ear, kneeling to trace the hopscotch) convey diligent curiosity without label-speak. The shift from passive observation to active problem-solving (ringing the bell, asking for trust, steering) shows earned agency. Interiority remains concrete throughout; the visceral "ribs were lantern slats and my hands rang like bowls" avoids therapy-speak and grounds emotion in sensation. No secondary character pressure on the page limits relationship crucible; the helmsman is functional rather than a source of conflict.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening lines (apprentice, Petrel airship, dusk). The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece gathers sensory density, pattern correspondences (grid/hopscotch/birds/porthole), and a mounting hum until the figure-eight maneuver releases the luminance. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image reweights the opening curiosity as a mission statement, and the cost is legible—the apprentice remains alone, lantern-lit, committed to watching. One meaningful tightening occurs when the apprentice deciphers the hopscotch and acts on it, narrowing tactical options and paying off prior setup.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The airship gondola, rigging, and controls (altimeter, kettle, compass, sextant) are tactile and recur across beats; the dusty hopscotch board on the floor constrains the final choice by supplying the decode key. Sensory detail is filtered through the apprentice's professional attention: "halos gathered on the rigging, a pearly static that hummed against my teeth." The micro-setting (chalk lines, porthole grid) charges the closure by echoing the phrasebook doodle and enabling the figure-eight solution. Spatial choreography is clean; no props teleport.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—chart the stranded luminance—is signaled early and drives every beat. One meaningful tightening: the apprentice moves from passive observation to decoding the hopscotch and steering the Petrel, narrowing options and accepting visible risk ("a fingertip of trust"). The figure-eight maneuver unspools the light with on-page consequence: "leaving our ropes unprickled and our tongues our own again." Agency is protagonist-driven under the Accumulative lens; coincidence (the chalk board's presence) complicates setup but does not resolve—the apprentice must interpret and act.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through accumulated particulars: language-as-motion-as-light, the phrasebook's grease and marginalia as palimpsest, hopscotch numerals as navigational code. The final lines offer a resonant answer without moralizing: "I will find it where language becomes motion and motion becomes light, and I will note it so well that even silence can follow the route." The closure image reweights prior motifs—chalk, birds, patterns—into a charged mission statement. No thematic echo or prompt-label intrusion; the piece trusts image and implication throughout.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single-POV, first-person narration holds stable psychic distance; diction is consistently lyric-specific and voice-particular ("sociable isolation," "compass dust on my cheek," "lantern slats"). Purposeful compression and patterned syntax (the story teaches its rhythmic, mosaic accumulation early) remain legible throughout. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks in pressure beats. The apprentice's perceptual signature is selective and professional: noticing grids, arrows, bird diagonals. Under peak stress (entering the pale) the prose tightens without losing texture: "even the engine hush was bright."</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most sentences advance image, pattern, or pressure. Rhythm varies naturally; opening stems avoid template repetition. Minor density lapse: "I had kept, tucked inside my coat, a polyglot's phrasebook dog-ear, a torn corner mottled with grease..." could compress further. One small scaffold loop: "I made a note on the chart and a second note on the kettle lid" then "We recorded the figure-eight page reference on the dog-ear"—both note-taking beats; consolidation would tighten. No figurative muddle in the closure beat; the final lines propel cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The synthesis—navigation by chalked hopscotch, polyglot phrasebook as palimpsest, starling murmuration as computational flock—feels specific and non-obvious. The airship-apprentice-luminance premise avoids steampunk cliché through precise sensory grounding and the unusual decode method. Risk-taking in lyric accumulation and elliptical pacing heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The ending's commitment to ongoing watchfulness rather than triumphant discovery feels earned and fresh. Minor proximity concern: "stranded luminance" echoes certain fantasy tropes, but the execution transforms it through procedural specificity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The curious map apprentice drives all key turns: observing the birds and luminance, pinning the dog-ear, decoding the hopscotch, ringing the bell, requesting the helmsman's trust, and steering through the figure-eight. Setup early (paragraph 2), beats in middle third (observation, brewing tea, kneeling to trace), and closure participation (final paragraph restates identity as anchor). Causal pressure is protagonist-driven; decisions alter tactics. Cost is visible: accepting isolation and ongoing vigil.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The polyglot's phrasebook dog-ear appears early (paragraph 5), returns at mid-point when pinned to the chart (paragraph 13), and reappears at closure when the figure-eight reference is recorded on it (paragraph 26). Each use advances pressure: first as memory anchor, then as grid/pattern key, finally as palimpsest where two strangers "shake hands across a language wall." The object bridges past and present, constrains interpretation (the doodled grid matches the hopscotch), and charges the ending. Three distinct beats; high specificity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stranded luminance is the central stake from paragraph 7 onward: "rumor said light could become snared in the upper lanes." The phenomenon pressures all tactics—approach, decoding, steering—and the closure hinges on releasing it ("the light unspooled and ran ahead"). The concept shapes on-page action: entering the pale, feeling the hum, tracing the figure-eight. Cost is visible: the crew's ropes "unprickled," the town's "smothered dawn" freed. Not merely thematic; it alters options throughout.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Diligently curious" is signaled early (paragraph 2: "diligently curious enough to sleep under charts") and demonstrated through on-page micro-choices: brewing tea, squaring pencils, noting bird turns, pinning the dog-ear, kneeling to trace the hopscotch. The trait enables the decode action and constrains the apprentice to night watch and solitary observation. Cost is visible: accepting isolation and the ongoing vigil. The trait recurs in the penultimate paragraph ("diligently curious, with a phrasebook corner pinned to the stars") to anchor closure. Slightly label-reinforced at the end but the on-page work justifies it.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Note" drives multiple beats: noting bird patterns (paragraph 10), making a note on the chart and kettle lid (paragraph 19), recording the figure-eight reference (paragraph 26), writing the purpose in the log (paragraph 28). Each instance advances or consolidates a turn. The act of notation is the protagonist's core method—observation translated into cartographic action—and shapes the closure: "I will note it so well that even silence can follow the route." The action is profession-specific and irreplaceable; removing it would break the apprentice's identity and tactical approach.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The method—"noting secret patterns in a dusty hopscotch board"—is seeded mid-story (paragraph 16: the deckhand's child sketched the board weeks ago) and enacted in paragraph 17 ("I knelt, traced the numerals with a knuckle, and solved the rumor"). The hopscotch's numerals (nine, four, two, five) translate into steering commands (paragraph 18), which the helmsman follows (paragraph 20). The mechanics are specific, causal, and irreplaceable: no other on-page detail provides the decode key. Participates directly in closure by enabling the figure-eight maneuver that releases the luminance.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The antique airship Petrel is named in the opening line and recurs across all beats: gondola windows, rigging, altimeter, kettle, ropes, deck rings, envelope. The setting constrains choices—night watch assignment, limited crew, the ability to steer into the pale—and supplies resources (the chalk board, the bell, the helm). The airship's physical layout (porthole grid echoing the phrasebook doodle) contributes to the decode. The setting pressures the closure: "the Petrel creaks, the kettle sighs" anchor the final vigil. Micro-setting details (hopscotch on the floor, rigging halos) alter tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The starling murmurations appear in the opening line, recur in paragraphs 4, 11, 14, and 24, and guide the final maneuver ("The birds beat around the envelope, guiding us by pulse"). The timeframe shapes observation and decoding: dusk gathers, night watch begins, the birds' flight patterns provide the decode rhythm. The murmurations pressure the closure by computing the figure-eight alongside the crew. However, the clock itself is not tightly tracked; the night watch spans an indeterminate duration. The timeframe is more atmospheric anchor than strict tactical tightener, though the birds' real-time presence does constrain the steering window.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation—"to chart the next great discovery"—is stated in paragraph 8 and restated in paragraph 28 as the log entry. The desire drives all beats: accepting night watch, observing the luminance, decoding the hopscotch, requesting trust, steering. Friction between want and cost is visible: the apprentice accepts isolation ("sociable isolation"), risk (entering the pale), and ongoing vigilance. The final paragraph dramatizes the commitment: "I will find it where language becomes motion and motion becomes light." Not merely told; the stakes and costs are enacted on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Sociable isolation" is introduced in paragraph 3 ("a kind of sociable isolation that let wind and canvas be our common gossip") and recurs at closure (paragraph 27: "company enough for this sociable isolation"). The tone is coherent throughout: cordial nods without intimacy, the helmsman's grunt, the crew's sleep, the apprentice alone with instruments. The paradox charges the final image: the apprentice feels kinship with birds, kettle, and sleeping crew without direct interaction. The tone modulates under pressure—hum and brightness at the pale—without breaking the established mood. The reprise reweights the opening by confirming the apprentice's chosen stance.</comment>
