<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The widow's interiority is concrete and deeply embodied—"she breathes to their patience," the hand remembering his mirror-practice—and grief manifests through contradictory impulses: refusing to restore the tag's name while carving the collar, allowing memory without treats. Micro-choices (pausing at the knot, not perfecting the collar, leaving the tin shut) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The final renunciation—wrapping the piece, opening the window—earns closure through prior causality. Minor slip: "he is not a ghost…he is the rhythm" borders on articulated insight but recovers by grounding it in action ("choosing what not to fix").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred: pressure accumulates through ritual constraint (kettle's duration), the carving's gradual revelation, and rain's parallel lesson. Orientation anchors who/where/when by line three (widow, loft, morning ritual). Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): she wraps the incomplete carving, opens the window, arranges three objects "like a new ring"—a stance crystallization with felt cost (the collar remains unfinished, absence preserved). One persistent constraint (the kettle's timeframe) shapes all tactics. Cost is legible: she refuses completion, trains memory to come without treats, and the final exhale signals a path foreclosed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The rain-beaded skylight and workbench function as micro-setting that constrains every choice: the kettle as metronome, droplets as "little lenses" that freeze the world, ropes and tins as witnesses. Sensory hierarchy filters through the carver's priorities—ash texture checked like a pulse, shavings curling like whiskers, rust-hued peace from tea laying weight on wrists. The loft's spatial choreography is precise (bench, shelf, sill, window) and the carving's placement on the sill beside kettle and tin charges the final image. The recurring rain teaches containment and release, directly shaping the climactic window-opening.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (how to inhabit loss without erasure) is signaled early and tightens through the carving's progression: touching the blank, working the knot into a scar, refusing to restore the tag, wrapping unfinished. Agency manifests as renunciation with visible cost—she will not perfect what he never wore, will not open the keepsake tin. The kettle's duration creates a persistent constraint that narrows all moves. One meaningful deepening: the pause at the knot where she watches rain and speaks aloud, then turns off the flame—refusal becomes active choice. The final arrangement ("keeping all three in sight like a new ring") reconfigures prior loss into disciplined witness.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme (the hinge between presence and absence) emerges through particulars: the knot as "meaningful because it survived," memory trained without treats, the collar's notch where a name was "scuffed off by long parades." The widow's refusal to name miracles until "they need no names" enacts the thematic question rather than stating it. The final image—wrapped carving, open window, three objects arranged "like a new ring"—offers a resonant answer: containment as a rehearsed trust, not resolution. Rain as recurring motif accumulates pressure (freckles to beads to teacher) and charges closure when it finds her cheeks. One minor slip: "If you must be here and gone, teach me the hinge" articulates the theme slightly more directly than the piece requires, though it's addressed to wood and rain rather than reader.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>POV distance is stable third-limited with distinct perceptual signature: the widow notices through a trainer's lens (tigers blinking like uncles, danger taught to step aside, trust rehearsed). Diction remains controlled and voice-particular ("rust-hued peace," "small growing animal of sound," "cages moving through distances"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully—closer during carving beats, pulling back for rain observations. Purposeful compression in the ending (wrapping, opening, arranging) accelerates without losing clarity. Minor density slip: a few lines in the middle third ("she is working to harvest lessons from loss, though she would never say it out loud") tell what the scene already shows, though the immediate self-correction ("Words have claws") recovers momentum.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally, information density is high (most lines do multiple jobs: "Steam ropes the air" = sensory + time marker + mood). Strong figurative control: "ropes hang like molted skins," "whistle tests itself like a child at a door." Overwriting friction: figurative language appears in most sentences of high-density beats without always advancing pressure—"rust-hued peace lifts…and lays its weight" is lovely but the vehicle ("lifts…lays") contradicts itself slightly. Template-cadence check flags minor stem repetition ("She [verb]…She [verb]") in middle paragraph but not enough to trigger full penalty. No loops or scaffolding. The final image propels cleanly. Proofreading is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: widow-as-carver enacting containment through a trainer's discipline, the kettle's duration as structural constraint, and rain teaching what she practices. The carving's progress (blank to collar to wrapped bundle) offers a non-obvious angle on grief work—incomplete preservation rather than monument. Emotional specificity avoids template: she refuses the tin, lets the knot stay, speaks to wood and rain. The final arrangement (three objects "like a new ring") feels inevitable in hindsight yet surprising. Risk-taking in pacing (no dialogue, extended reflection interleaved with micro-actions) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Minor hedge: the circus-animal metaphor field is familiar territory, but the piece transforms it through the widow's hands rather than spectacle.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Present early (title, line one). Drives multiple beats: touching the blank, sharpening the gouge, pausing at the knot, deciding not to restore the tag, wrapping and placing the carving. Her choices (what not to fix, when to stop, opening the window) create all key turns. Causal pressure: her trainer-inflected perception shapes every tactic. Closure participation: she wraps, opens, arranges. Irreplaceable: the tamer's widow brings embodied knowledge of precision, trust, and danger that another mourner could not.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setup early (line three, touched "as if checking a pulse"). Development: carved across multiple beats (sharpening, first cut, working the knot, revealing the notch), each shaving a concrete action with reweighted meaning (curling like whiskers). Payoff: wrapped and placed on the sill "beside the tin and the kettle, keeping all three in sight like a new ring." Causal pressure: the blank's resistance and yield govern her pace and choices. Specificity: ash wood's pale stubbornness, the knot, the collar's notch—details that matter. Cost: she stops before completion, preserving absence.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setup: "here and gone in the same gesture of the blade" (paragraph five) and frames the piece's rhythm. Development: shapes every tactic—she works within the kettle's span, speaks "If you must be here and gone, teach me the hinge," watches rain beads "visit, teach, and slide away." Payoff: "he is not a ghost…he is the rhythm of her hands choosing what not to fix" and the wrapped bundle set to cool. The concept constrains her method (containment) and charges the final image. Cost: she must let presence and absence coexist without resolution.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setup: "hauntingly practical" appears explicitly (line ten, sharpening the gouge like combing his mustache) and is immediately embodied. Development: every action enacts it—ritual timing, the knot worked into a scar rather than erased, pouring only when water is quiet, refusing to perfect the collar. The trait constrains choices (she will not rush, will not restore what's gone) with visible cost (incompletion, restraint). Payoff: wrapping the carving unfinished, arranging objects with disciplined care. Specificity: the attribute governs both micro-movements and large refusals.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setup: "doing only what fits within the span while the kettle boils" (line two). Development: the kettle hum thickens, whistle tests, she turns off the flame, pours when water is quiet. The action structures all beats and creates the timeframe constraint. Payoff: "When the tea is half gone, the carving reveals the notch"—the act of containment has governed the entire sequence. Causal pressure: containment determines what she attempts and refuses. Swappability test: another timer would lack the domestic, embodied quality of boiling and pouring that mirrors the carving's patience.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setup: "droplets hold on the glass and become little lenses. The world outside freezes through crystallized time" (paragraph mid). Development: the method is signaled as observation through paused parade, and she "breathes to their patience." Payoff: "lets the rain finish its lesson, showing her the city in beads that visit, teach, and slide away." The method teaches her containment and appears at closure when rain finds her cheeks. Friction: the mechanics matter thematically but do not constrain a middle action as directly as other elements; it's more observational than instrumental. Still, it reweights the stake (paused moments as practice for here-and-gone).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Setup: title and line one ("rain-beaded skylight loft above the old circus yard, where ropes hang like molted skins"). Development: the loft supplies all resources—workbench, shelf, tin, ropes—and the skylight's rain teaches through beads. The setting constrains every choice (no escape from weather, ritual space limits what she can do). Payoff: opening the window lets rain find her cheeks, and the loft "answers with an exhale, like the tent after applause." The micro-setting (bench, sill, window) charges the final arrangement. Irreplaceable: another workspace would lack the circus history and skylight's pedagogy.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Setup: line two ("doing only what fits within the span while the kettle boils"). Development: the timeframe tightens every beat—steam ropes, whistle tests, she turns off flame, pours when quiet, tea half gone marks the notch's reveal. The clock is live and tracked. Payoff: "When the tea is half gone…when the cup cools" brackets the carving's completion and the window-opening. Causal pressure: the duration forces containment and prevents over-working. Cost: she must finish or stop within the span, and she chooses incompletion. Minor friction: the exact duration is elastic (kettle boil + cooling + half-drunk tea) but the pressure remains coherent.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Setup: "She is working to harvest lessons from loss, though she would never say it out loud" (paragraph mid). Development: the desire is dramatized through choices—carving not a lion or face but the collar, working the knot into a scar, refusing to open the tin, speaking to wood and rain. Friction: the motivation is told more than shown in its initial appearance, though subsequent beats embody it. Payoff: "trains memory to come without treats," wraps the carving unfinished, arranges objects as "a new ring." Cost: she must accept incompletion and absence. The final gestures enact the harvest without naming it.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Setup: "rust-hued peace lifts from the cup and lays its weight on her wrists" (late paragraph). Development: tone is coherent through turns—patient, disciplined grief modulated by the kettle's rhythm, rain's silver music, and the loft's exhale. Payoff: the tone charges the final image (wrapped bundle, open window, three objects kept in sight). Friction: the explicit phrase appears only once and relatively late; the tone itself (patient containment, tempered sorrow) pervades but the specific "rust-hued peace" descriptor does not return. Still, the tonal quality—measured, embodied calm layered over loss—holds through closure and the tea's rust hue seeds it early enough to reweight the ending.</comment>
