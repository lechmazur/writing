<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The narrator demonstrates embodied emotion and consistent POV bias (breath, pulse, fingertips) throughout. The child of bronze and wind functions as a secondary character, but the relationship doesn't pressure choice; their partnership is collaborative without friction. The protagonist's change from archivist to teacher feels asserted rather than earned through contradictory impulses dramatized on the page. Internal conflict exists as abstract hunger versus "arrogance of conquest," but the resolution never forecloses a path with visible cost—the narrator simply breathes and descends.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is established by ~80 words (archive, historian credentials, forbidden knowledge). The piece accumulates density through vertical ascent and intensifying imagery, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the narrator emerges "calibrated to steadily unpredictable truths" and teaches students to "avoid patterns." Cost is conceptual—no publication, a shift from citation-seeking to alignment—but the final image doesn't reweight prior material with undeniable pressure; the narrator simply carries questions and teaches. The closure reads as thematic summary rather than a decisive tightening or charged poise moment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The archive environment actively shapes movement: tiles hum, shelves morph into pagoda, stairs climb sideways, mirrors translate rather than reflect, tablets pulse. The compass returned by the child functions as micro-setting that "turns pulse into direction" and warms at key beats, constraining choice and charging the final descent. Spatial choreography remains coherent across transformations. The "lake remembering fire" ceiling participates in the climax, releasing visions that reweight the narrator's understanding.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: to access forbidden knowledge without conquest. The archive tests this through metamorphosis (pagoda opening, tablets offering purity bargains), and the narrator's refusal to bargain with the tablets is one meaningful choice under pressure. However, escalation plateaus after the second landing; the third landing and top chamber deliver visions without additional narrowing of options. The ending resolves by absorption ("breathed until it tasted of mercy") rather than a protagonist-driven decision that forecloses a path. Cost is stated ("alignment, not citation") but not felt in the final image.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—responsible love of forbidden knowledge, learning by avoiding patterns, permissions rather than facts—emerges through image and action (mirrors that translate, avoiding rhythm to escape grip, archives storing "licenses to feel honestly"). The compass pointing to "yesterday's most honest mistake" offers concrete resonance. However, the final paragraph explicitly states the theme: "to pursue forbidden knowledge is to love responsibly" and "love is what restores the city"—this is a Thematic Echo that replaces scene pressure with prompt-like articulation. The articulation occurs in the final lines, triggering −0.6 in Q5.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is consistent and distinctive: "atoms of nostalgia," "twilight was a verb," "end of innocence is not a cliff but a ramp." Psychic distance remains stable in first-person; no head-hopping. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("calibrated to steadily unpredictable truths," "purify their wondering") that feels more essay than crisis perception, but remains within the narrator's scholarly idiom. The child's speech ("teach me to forget with fidelity") matches the lyric register without distinct idiom separation, though the brief exchange is acceptable for length.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, figurative language is dense and mostly coherent ("dust rose...atoms of nostalgia practicing breath," "mirrors...translated me into constellations of borrowed ash"). However, multiple metaphors blur physical logic: can stairs climb sideways while being a ramp pretending to be stairs? Can a ceiling be a lake remembering fire? The density approaches saturation—nearly every sentence carries metaphor—without pattern-teaching or relief. Paraphrase loops appear: "opened like a seedpod, revealing stairs" followed immediately by "took the invitation" restates acceptance. Template cadence: "I saw X, and I saw Y, I saw Z" runs across three beats without variation. Apply −0.8 in Q7 for density without breathing room plus mild figurative muddle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The archive-as-sentient-test and learning-by-pattern-avoidance offer a non-obvious angle on the scholar-enters-archive template. Specific details (saffron-veil credentials, hexagram tiles, child polishing a compass to "yesterday's most honest mistake") provide texture. However, the emotional arc—humble pursuit of knowledge, collaborative descent, return to teach—follows a familiar wisdom-quest structure. The "atoms of nostalgia" and "steadily unpredictable" phrases feel more ornamental than transformative. Risk-taking in lyric density and metamorphic setting is present but doesn't heighten stakes; the protagonist's safety is never in question.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The saffron-veil historian is the narrator and POV throughout. Setup: present by opening line. Development: makes one clear choice at the second landing (refuses to bargain with tablets, disrupts patterns). Closure: present in final teaching scene. However, most beats involve observation and absorption rather than decision that alters tactics. The refusal to bargain is functional but the consequences (archive loses grip) arrive without visible cost. Two gates plus one meaningful choice place the score in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The bronze prism pagoda at twilight appears early (first paragraph as destination, fuller at ~15% when shelves spiral into it). Development: the pagoda opens "like a seedpod" to reveal sideways stairs, structuring the ascent. Closure: "pagoda folded back into shelves" as they descend. The object frames the central journey and its morphology (opening, containing landings, folding) shapes access. However, its bronze and prism qualities are not leveraged in beats; "twilight" is verb-used elsewhere but not tied to the pagoda's material. Specificity is partial; a tower or temple could substitute with minor edits. Two full gates plus structural presence yield mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Atoms of nostalgia appear in the opening ("dust rose in quiet spirals, as if the atoms of nostalgia were practicing breath") and return in the final teaching ("carry the atoms of nostalgia like lantern seeds, igniting only when hurt asks for light"). The concept seeds expectation and recharges at closure, reweighting the stake from access to responsible carrying. However, the atoms never constrain a middle choice or alter tactics; they function as metaphor for memory's texture rather than an active pressure. Lyric reprise with thematic reweighting but no causal work: ~5.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Steadily unpredictable" describes the archive early ("said the archive rearranged itself, steadily unpredictable like a river") and returns at closure ("heart calibrated to steadily unpredictable truths"). The attribute frames the challenge and the learning outcome. Development: the metamorphoses (shelves to pagoda, mirrors that translate) enact unpredictability, and the narrator's pattern-avoidance tactic directly responds to it. However, the attribute itself doesn't impose a visible cost or enable a specific action beyond the general avoidance strategy. Purposeful setup and thematic closure with moderate causal link: ~5.4.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Purify appears at the second landing ("tablets...offering to purify my motives") and the narrator's refusal triggers the tactic shift ("I refused to bargain, for purity cannot be purchased, only practiced by avoiding patterns"). The action shapes the middle turn and recurs at closure ("taught the students to purify their wondering by avoiding patterns"). Three beats, clear causal role in the tactic that frees the narrator, and closure participation. However, the mechanics of purification (avoiding patterns) are more method than distinct action; "refuse" or "practice" could substitute. Strong integration but moderate swappability: ~6.8.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Avoiding patterns is signaled at the first landing refusal ("purity...practiced by avoiding patterns"), enacted at the second landing ("blinked without rhythm, stepped irregularly, hummed no melody, allowing the archive to lose its grip"), repeated in the litany ("by avoiding patterns so the names could not chain themselves to fate"), and becomes the final teaching ("purify their wondering by avoiding patterns"). The method drives the escape tactic, shapes the climactic litany, and defines the transmitted pedagogy. Mechanics matter on the page with visible consequence. Three beats, high specificity, closure-shaping: 7.2.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The lost civilization archive is established in the opening line and anchors every beat. Setup: immediate. Development: the archive's rearranging morphology (tiles, shelves, pagoda, mirrors, tablets, chamber) pressures each choice and supplies resources (compass from child, visions from ceiling-lake, permissions rather than facts). Closure: the archive's inversion (shelves to corridors to questions) and the narrator's teaching preserve its lesson. The setting is indispensable; no other location could supply the metamorphic tests or the permissions framework. High integration across all gates with causal and thematic necessity: 7.6.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Across the end of innocence" appears as framing metaphor ("the end of innocence is not a cliff but a ramp pretending to be stairs," "learning would happen across the end of innocence," "what walks with us across the end of innocence"). The phrase is present in setup and closure, reweighting the journey's cost. However, it functions as theme rather than timeframe; no ticking clock or deadline shapes tactics. The temporal span (entry to emergence) is vague. Lyric framing without time-pressure mechanics: ~4.2.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The motivation is declared early ("come to pursue forbidden knowledge without the arrogance of conquest, yet with the hunger of drought") and dramatized through choices (climbing despite warnings, refusing purity bargain, speaking the litany of names). Closure: the motivation is fulfilled and articulated ("to pursue forbidden knowledge is to love responsibly"). Friction exists between hunger and humility, tested at the tablets. However, the competing pulls don't create visible cost on the page; the narrator navigates successfully without forfeiting a live option. Two beats, thematic closure, moderate dramatization: ~6.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Anguished joy is signaled early in small touches ("each warning tasted sweeter than safe bread"), explicitly named at the vision climax ("Anguished joy threaded the visions, as if tenderness had learned to bear the weight of entire ruins"), and returns in the final line ("an anguished joy that keeps opening rooms"). The tone modulates from dry-mouthed tension to collaborative wonder to teaching resolve, but the durative emotional charge doesn't intensify at pressure peaks—"anguished" and "joy" coexist as labels more than lived contradiction. Purposeful setup and closure reprise with moderate embodiment: ~5.9.</comment>
