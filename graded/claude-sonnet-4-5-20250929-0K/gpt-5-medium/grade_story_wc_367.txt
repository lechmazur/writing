<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator shows distinct voice through perceptual signature ("jokes came true with awkward obedience," "weighted joy that keeps the lantern from tilting"), but remains largely external to pressure—observing and tending rather than facing forced choices with visible cost. The child arrives as coincidence rather than complication earned by prior action, softening agency. Internal contradiction appears in "accidentally prophetic" but never constrains a pivotal choice on the page. Embodied emotion is present ("cheek against green coolness") yet the stakes feel more atmospheric than urgent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds through recurring images (beam, storm, glass) and cadence modulation rather than causal turns. Orientation anchors arrive within the opening lines (lighthouse keeper, post-newspaper world, Emerald tower). Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the final declaration "the lighthouse keeps its emerald vow to tomorrow," but cost remains asserted rather than dramatized—no visible forfeiture or foreclosed path appears on the page. The child's arrival and her integration feel more like expansion than tightening, weakening escalation under any lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The emerald glass foundation, fused silica wick, and storm-mouth imagery supply vivid, purpose-driven anchors. The lighthouse functions as micro-setting: beam steering through prisms, sleeping on the stair, and the lamp room glass all constrain action and charge atmosphere. Sensory selection reflects urgency (kelp in hair, phosphor and wind) and the green glass returns at closure to reweight the vow. Spatial choreography remains coherent across vertical tower moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—maintaining guidance after newspapers fold—is signaled early but pressure remains diffuse. No meaningful tightening occurs: the storm and child are complications without visible cost or tradeoff. The narrator's "accidentally prophetic" trait never forces a gamble or renunciation; feeding the child and teaching her feel like lateral moves rather than escalation. Coincidence (ocean delivers child) complicates without agency, and the ending summarizes continuation rather than a turn or deepening that narrows options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme—publishing guidance in a post-print world—emerges through particulars (beam as newsroom, headline = weathered joy) without overt statement. The final image of "sea kept printing us in phosphor and wind" offers a resonant callback that reweights prior material. However, the child's arrival and integration feel thematically convenient rather than earned friction, and "shadowed elation" is named more than embodied in contradictory choices. Subtext operates in storm-speak and the prophetic log, elevating the piece above simple metaphor.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout: "light tumbles down mirror angles," "drone barges...and pilgrim rafts of thinkers unplugged," "ballast...weighted joy." POV distance remains stable; free-indirect style is clean. Diction holds a consistent elevated register tied to the narrator's archival voice. The child's speech ("tomorrow is only a room we lens from the present") converges tonally with the narrator's, acceptable as learned idiom but reducing voice distinction. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks; rhythmic control modulates with intensity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high and mostly coherent ("storm has a mouth open at the sky and teeth made of waves"), but some vehicles strain logic ("jokes were lightning," "cat with sparks for fur"). Paraphrase loop appears: "I feed it names...The storm laughs, and I answer" restates interaction without added pressure. Template cadence visible in repeated "I [verb]" stems across multiple paragraphs. Information density is strong in setting details, but climactic beats (child's arrival, final vow) are told rather than dramatized, dulling propulsion. Clarity holds; no major pronoun or tense breaks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The post-newspaper lighthouse keeper using "total internal reflection" as both technical method and thematic lens offers a specific, non-obvious synthesis. Storm-speak, accidentally prophetic jokes, and the child who "swallowed a page" transform familiar post-apocalyptic tropes through grounded detail. The piece commits to its lyric register and coined idiom ("wreckers once lit false fires, but I pour a brighter truth"). Risk-taking in dense figurative language and elliptical causality heightens stakes without obscuring core clarity, though the child's convenient arrival leans toward template convenience.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The "laughing storm herald" narrator is present throughout and steers the beam, feeds the storm names, and teaches the child, but these are observational routines rather than pressured choices that alter tactics. The narrator's decision to light the lantern each night and respond to the storm are mentioned repeatedly but do not create a key turn. The character functions more as witness and curator than agent facing a dilemma with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The glass lantern wick appears in the opening act ("braid of fused silica fibers that drinks light like rain"), is handled in the lighting ritual, and returns in the penultimate paragraph ("the glass lantern wick never chars, it only remembers"). Its property—storing light to seed the next night—directly shapes the thematic closure ("collect yesterday's shadows and steer them forward"). The wick's mechanics of total internal reflection are integral to the beam-steering action across multiple beats, making it essential rather than ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Otherworldly routine" is named once in the opening third ("an Otherworldly routine that began the day information stopped smearing ink") and frames the nightly beam-lighting sequence. The concept shapes the narrator's repeated actions (lighting, steering, storm-speak) and informs the tonal register, but it does not constrain a specific choice or create friction. It reappears implicitly in the ending's emphasis on continuation ("the lighthouse keeps its emerald vow"), offering a reprise that reweights persistence as purpose, elevating it above mere theme-label.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Accidentally prophetic" is introduced in the opening third ("I wrote predictions in the log as jokes, and the jokes came true") and causally justifies the narrator's assignment to the tower. It enables one key beat—the prediction that "the ocean would deliver an answer in a crate" leading to the child's arrival—but this is told in summary rather than dramatized, and the trait does not constrain later choices or impose visible cost. The attribute informs character texture but remains label-adjacent in peak moments.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Steer" appears throughout: steering the beam through prisms, steering silence into shape, the child learning to steer the lantern, and the ending's "steer them forward until they bloom." The action drives the nightly ritual and is central to the guidance metaphor. However, no major turn traces uniquely to this action—beam-steering could be swapped for "broadcast" or "guide" without structural break. The verb charges the final image but does not foreclose a path or force a trade-off with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Through total internal reflection" is introduced early as the mechanism for the beam ("I steer the beam through total internal reflection along the spine of the tower") and appears in two later beats: the wreckers contrast and the child's drawings that "route light through total internal reflection." The method is signaled and its mechanics matter thematically (light that "refuses to spill"), but it does not constrain a tactical choice or create friction. The phrase charges the closure via repetition and thematic consistency, earning mid-band placement.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The Emerald lighthouse is anchored in the opening line and supplies the story's spatial frame. The green glass foundation (once bottles, now beacon bones), the lamp room where motives are written in grease pencil, the stair where the narrator sleeps, and the beam's vertical path through the tower all constrain action and charge the atmosphere. The tower's vertical architecture enables the total-internal-reflection method, and the emerald color returns in the final vow, making the setting indispensable to both mechanics and meaning.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"After the last print newspaper folded" anchors the story's premise in the opening lines and justifies the shift from ink to beam-guidance. The timeframe informs the world state (satellites, drone barges, feeds) and the narrator's motive to publish in a new medium. However, it does not tighten decisions or impose a live clock—the nightly routine persists without deadline pressure. The era is established and consistent but does not escalate tactics or foreclose options, placing it in functional-but-replaceable range.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The motivation "to shape a new dawn using ancient shadows" is written in grease pencil in the lamp room (opening third) and echoed in the ending: "collect yesterday's shadows and steer them forward until they bloom." The desire drives the nightly beam-lighting and the teaching of the child, but these acts are routines without visible friction or competing cost. The motivation reappears in the closure image with reweighted meaning (shadow-as-resource rather than absence), earning a reprise bonus, yet it remains more thematic anchor than dramatized conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Shadowed elation" is named explicitly in the opening third and modeled throughout via "laughing storm herald," "weighted joy," "storm chuckles like gravel," and the child who "laughs at lightning." The tone modulates across beats—playful in the storm-speak exchanges, somber in the kelp-haired child's arrival, buoyant in the final vow—and charges the ending ("weathered joy"). However, tonal coherence occasionally slips into ornamental lyricism that diffuses pressure rather than sharpening it. The tone is present across structure and shapes the final image, placing it in the essential range.</comment>
