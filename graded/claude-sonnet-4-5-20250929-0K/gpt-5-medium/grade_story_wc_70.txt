<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The toll keeper's involuntary truthfulness is established early and consistently shapes micro-choices ("truth pinned my tongue and freed my hands," "truth spoke ahead of me"). The relationship with Mara functions as a crucible where the keeper's desire to preserve wonder conflicts with urgency, creating embodied tension. Interiority remains concrete and voice-specific ("stubborn desire to preserve wonder in routine"), though the final choice to reveal the hidden tray feels slightly under-motivated—the keeper's resistance isn't dramatized enough to make the release feel costly. Minor deduction for the trait operating more as flavor than as a binding constraint at the climax.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece builds through density and charged callback (nectar dusk bookends, lacquer box seed → crown payoff), and the closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—the keeper's work is reweighted from solitary ritual to shared purpose with visible cost (the box leaves with Mara). Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly by the desk setup. One meaningful deepening occurs when the riddle is solved and the hidden tray is revealed, narrowing the keeper's control and opening the tower. Cost is legible: the keeper surrenders the hidden object and ascends with Mara, forgoing isolation. No causality breaks; the lens holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The lightning tower functions as both macro-setting and constraint: the crown platform with capacitors and rods is the site where the queen tone can be reactivated, and the stair key controls access. The lacquer box (micro-setting object) charges the final third by enabling the restoration. Sensory detail is vivid and POV-filtered ("stormfruit," "steel smelled faintly of bloom"), and the tower's verticality (desk below, crown above) structures the spatial climb that mirrors thematic ascent. The tower directly enables the closure action and appears in the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: restore the drone lattice to revive city function and preserve wonder. The matchbox riddle provides one meaningful pressure point—Mara must solve it to pass—and the reveal of the hidden tray tightens options by making the restoration possible. The climb and calibration sequence raises physical and conceptual stakes (drones reciting coordinates, screens brightening). Cost is visible: the keeper relinquishes the hidden box and abandons the solitary toll role. Agency is present but slightly passive during the tower sequence; Mara performs the technical work while the keeper listens. Escalation is sufficient for this length but not sharp enough for high band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—wonder as ritual, curiosity over efficiency—emerges organically from the toll keeper's riddle practice and Mara's question ("you could charge for swiftness... you charge for stories instead"). The lacquer box and queen tone function as charged particulars: restoring alignment isn't technical alone but a return of "why" to "how." The final exchange ("I ask payment that keeps my work alive") offers a resonant answer without moralizing. The piece resists binary resolution; the city resumes "comfort of repeating" while the keeper returns to riddles, holding tension between restoration and routine. No thematic echo in prompt language; closure reweights prior material cleanly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single-POV first-person maintains stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature: metaphors lean toward organic/sensory ("nectar dusk," "hive-warm twilight," "steel smelled faintly of bloom"). Diction is elevated but consistent and voice-motivated, anchored in the keeper's ritualistic worldview. Dialogue is sparse, functional, and carries subtext (Mara's "you could charge for swiftness" vs. keeper's "I ask payment that keeps my work alive"). One minor slip: "truth tugged me up the iron stairs beside her" shifts slightly into external narration of impulse rather than staying interior. No head-hopping; filter verbs are purposeful. Rhythmic control holds under pressure without template cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high—most lines do double duty (e.g., "I had kept it hidden, not from law, but from those who rushed without reverence" advances character and stakes). Minor scaffold appears in adjacent lines: "Truth spoke ahead of me, as usual, as if it had rented my lungs. / I wanted the right listener, I said" restates agency without adding pressure (paraphrase loop, −0.2). One metaphor leans strained: "nectar dusk draped... like slow honey cooling on a spoon" mixes nectar/honey/draping/cooling in ways that blur vehicle coherence (−0.3). No major loops or template runs. Clarity and propulsion remain strong; opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—toll keeper as wonder-curator in a lightning-harvesting city with drone beehive infrastructure—is specific and non-obvious, avoiding template plots. The riddle-as-toll and the lacquer box's hidden queen tone transform stock "restore the tech" arcs into a meditation on ritual versus urgency. Emotional truth (the keeper's "stubborn desire to preserve wonder in routine") grounds the premise. The piece commits fully to its metaphoric register (bees/electricity/nectar) without retreat. Minor limitation: the core conflict (urgent repair vs. ritualistic passage) resolves cooperatively without a sharper ethical trade-off, reducing risk. Still, the vision is coherent and the particulars feel earned rather than assembled from a checklist.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The candid toll keeper is focalized throughout and makes two key decisions: holding up the matchbox (enforcing ritual despite urgency) and pulling the hidden tray after the riddle is solved. The second choice enables the climb and restoration, altering tactics. Present in setup, middle enforcement, and closure participation (returns to desk as "candid toll keeper"). The trait "candid" operates more as voice flavor than a binding constraint on these specific choices, limiting causal pressure slightly.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lacquer box appears in three beats: hidden in the desk tray (setup), opened at the crown to reveal the queen tone wafer (middle calibration action), and carried away by Mara (closure). Its properties—housing the living tone, "whispering" lacquer, crystal wafer—are specific and irreplaceable. The box enables the restoration and charges the ending image as Mara carries it "like a lantern." Removing it would break the causal chain and closure linkage. Strong cost: the keeper surrenders it permanently.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The drone beehive failure is the inciting situation (parks soured, orchards emptied), shapes the dominant stake (Mara's need to restore alignment), and drives the tower ascent. The failure's mechanics—loss of the queen tone causing drones to "remember how to move and not why"—constrain the solution and are paid off when "drones woke across the terraces, reciting coordinates." Present in setup (city-wide consequences), middle (Mara's urgency and the wafer explanation), and closure (drones flowing "like punctuation returning to sentences"). Essential to plot logic and stakes.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The attribute "involuntarily truthful" is signaled early ("I am involuntarily truthful") and colors voice throughout ("truth pinned my tongue," "truth spoke ahead of me"). It enables one micro-action: the keeper cannot refuse to open the box at the crown ("I could not refuse, because truth is also obedience"). However, this moment lacks visible cost or friction—the keeper intended to open it anyway. The trait functions more as atmospheric consistency than a binding constraint that alters tactics or forecloses options. Mid-band for presence across beats but low causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The "reveal" (pulling the hidden tray with the lacquer box) occurs at the story's first major turn, enabling Mara's passage and the tower ascent. It's dramatized on the page ("I pulled the tray where a red-black sheen waited like a heartbeat") and the keeper's motivation—waiting for "the right listener"—grounds it in character. The reveal shapes two subsequent beats (the climb and the calibration). However, the resistance prior to the reveal is thin; the keeper's internal conflict isn't tested on the page, so the moment feels more like a gate-opening than a costly sacrifice. Present in middle and closure participation but swappable with "grant access" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The matchbox containing a cryptic riddle is introduced early (setup) and used in one beat: Mara solves it to earn passage. The riddle's content ("What keeps thunder in a box, and teaches bees to grieve by singing") directly foreshadows the lacquer box and queen tone, and the solve mechanic ("Correct, I said, and pulled the tray") gates the next action. Present in setup and middle, with thematic echo at closure ("I would tend their passage with riddles"). However, it's functionally a single-use gate; removing it would require only minor edits (e.g., the keeper grants passage based on Mara's identity). Mid-band for purposeful setup and one causal beat.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The lightning collection tower structures the entire piece: the desk below is where the toll is kept, the stair key controls access, and the crown platform with capacitors and rods is the only site where the restoration can occur. The tower's verticality mirrors the thematic climb from routine to wonder. It appears in setup (desk and spire description), middle (the climb: "iron stairs," "capacitors lay like sleeping drums"), and closure (drones visible from the crown, keeper returns to desk). The tower's unique function—sipping thunder—is irreplaceable and directly enables the plot. Strong integration across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the city-wide blackout" is established in setup ("After the city-wide blackout, no one wanted polish anyway") and shapes urgency (Mara arrives "with tools, eyes ringed in charcoal fatigue"). The blackout's consequences (loss of hum, screens, drone lattices) drive the dominant stake. However, the timeframe itself doesn't tighten on the page—there's no live clock or escalating deadline within the scene. The restoration succeeds without visible time pressure. Present in setup and middle motivation but doesn't constrain tactics or alter the ending.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to preserve wonder in routine" is dramatized early ("wonder needs a ritual, even in crisis, perhaps especially then") and tested when Mara's urgency conflicts with the matchbox toll. The keeper's choices—enforcing the riddle, revealing the box only to "the right listener," ascending to witness rather than remaining at the desk—enact this desire with visible cost (the keeper leaves the solitary role and surrenders the box). Present in setup, middle friction (riddle enforcement), and closure (returns to riddles but now "between the city and its climb"). The desire is shown through action and final stance, not merely told.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The tone "nectar dusk" is established in the opening line ("Nectar dusk draped the lightning collection tower like slow honey") and reprised at closure ("nectar dusk deepened, and even the steel smelled faintly of bloom"). The warm, organic diction ("hive-warm twilight," "stormfruit," "meadow after winter") modulates with pressure—compressed syntax during the climb, expansive sensory detail at resolution. The tone charges the final image by linking the keeper's ritual world (nectar, bloom) to the restored city. However, the metaphoric register occasionally strains (nectar/honey overlap, bees/drones/flowers saturation). Strong setup-to-closure arc with purposeful modulation.</comment>
