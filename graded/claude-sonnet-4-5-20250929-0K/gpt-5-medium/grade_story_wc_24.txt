<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is concrete and particular—the mantle clock key becomes a tactile anchor for inheritance and professional heresy. Motivation coheres: the desire to understand clocks beyond forced measurement drives micro-choices (adjusting valves, counting drops backward). The final stance is earned through accumulative perception rather than epiphany, with visible cost in the bleeding finger and the foreman note. Minor slip: the grandmother's presence in reflection feels slightly too tidy, though it remains embodied through the key.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its pattern early—lyric compression, image recurrence—and holds it cleanly to closure. Orientation anchors appear by line 2 (fjord station, night watch, hydraulic clocks). Closure achieves Conceptual Repricing: "not to pace minutes but to shepherd edges" reweights the premise with felt cost (the bleeding finger, the uncorrected boundary event). The stylus-knit-darkness final image crystallizes the reconfigured understanding. One escalation point (Basin Three lag → backward counting → blood-marked key → conceptual shift) suffices for this textural mode.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The fjord station is rendered through task-specific detail: siphons, calibrated basins, drip pressure, gauge needles with razor edges. The mantle clock key and Basin Three function as micro-setting that constrains choice (the key turns valve stems, the basin's lag forces counting backward). Sensory selection reflects urgency—bright gull-bone needles, slate water, bass hush—and the razor edge literally constrains action by nicking the finger, charging the final recorder-window moment. Spatial choreography (catwalk, basins, far beacon) remains coherent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: to understand what clocks measure beyond forced obedience. One meaningful tightening occurs when Basin Three lags, forcing the protagonist to count backward and discover "razor edges where one state cuts into another." Agency is renunciation and endurance (staying after shift, refusing correction in the note), with visible cost in the bleeding finger and the boundary event left unresolved. The backward-counting method imposes a constraint that narrows options and deepens perception, fitting the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through recurring images: clocks, edges, breath, the key, the stylus tracing darkness. The final answer is non-literal and resonant—"not to pace minutes but to shepherd edges"—reweighting prior material without stating a moral. The grandmother's presence and the mantle key anchor inheritance and the household heart without sermonizing. Epiphanies are earned through specific experience (the nicked finger, the drop hesitation, the beacon blink). No thematic echo or moralizing; the piece trusts particulars to carry conceptual weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single-POV distance is stable; perceptual signature is distinct (technical detail filtered through poetic syntax: "razor edges, bright as gull bones," "crook a wrench, my flock a choir"). Diction remains within the focalizer's lexicon—watchkeeper idiom braided with inherited metaphor. Purposeful compression and lyric patterning are taught early and sustained. One minor slip: "the fjord did not argue" feels slightly too convenient as resolution, though it remains voice-coherent. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates intentionally with pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift; figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. Information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs. Two artifacts reduce the score: slight overwriting in the final third (multiple metaphors per sentence without clear pattern payoff, e.g., "bell held on a palm" adjacent to "bass hush") and one paraphrase loop ("the exact moment a surface breaks" echoes prior edge/severance language without added pressure). No template cadence or filter-verb stacks. Propulsion remains strong; the loop is contained and does not obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of industrial timekeeping, inherited domesticity, and fjord silence is specific and non-obvious. The "shepherd edges" reframing transforms the occupational premise through lived detail (bleeding finger, backward counting, the key as crook). Risk-taking in lyric compression and metaphor density heightens stakes without gimmickry. The piece resists template structures; its premise (what clocks measure when unwatched) is explored through particular labor rather than abstraction. Slight deduction for density that occasionally trends decorative, but transformation is undeniable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Present by line 2; drives three beats (staying on, adjusting Basin Three, writing the foreman note); the final stance—shepherding edges rather than pacing minutes—is causally enabled by this role's specific duties. The decision to leave the boundary event uncorrected and count breaths backward closes the arc. High irreplaceability: no other role could engage valve stems, drip pressure, and stylus with this specificity.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Introduced line 5; used twice on-page (nudging valve stems, printing blood crescent); returns with reweighted meaning in the final image ("the key bright with the dried crescent"). Charged reprise links inheritance, heresy, and the household heart to the protagonist's labor. Strong closure linkage and causal pressure (enables the valve adjustment). Slightly swappable with another small tool, but the inheritance dimension adds irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Signaled line 8 (gauge needles "razor edges, bright as gull bones"); shapes three beats (moving careful, nicking finger, realizing clocks measure "razor edges where one state cuts into another"); anchors the conceptual repricing at closure. The concept constrains physical action (cautious movement, bleeding) and redefines the protagonist's understanding with felt cost. Indispensable: the story's logic and final image collapse without this exact framing.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Present line 6 ("our instruments were eminently peculiar"); enables one on-page action (using the mantle key on water clocks, a heresy). The trait justifies the unorthodox method but remains somewhat swappable—"unusual" or "experimental" would serve similarly. No clear cost tied to peculiarity itself; the heresy cost is routed through the key and the method. Two-gate integration (setup, middle development) limits ceiling.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Introduced line 9; used twice (squinting at far beacon to test faith, squinting again when the beacon blinks with Basin Three's hesitation). The second squint drives a key realization (the synchronicity of beacon and drop) that crystallizes the "boundary event" understanding. Causal role in one major beat; contributes to closure by linking external and internal observation. Moderately swappable with another perceptual verb, but the doubt/faith thread adds specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Signaled line 10 (taught by foreman); used twice on-page (counting Basin Three drops backward, counting breaths backward to zero at closure). The method's mechanics matter: backward counting "uncovered grit in the gears of water" and enables the edge-discovery. Shapes two beats and contributes decisively to the ending's calm. Strong irreplaceability; forward counting would not yield the same thematic or causal effect.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Present line 1; constrains action throughout (siphons, basins, gauge needles, recorder, catwalk). The station's tools and layout enable the valve adjustment, backward counting, and stylus observation. The far beacon and recorder window charge the final image. Setting pressures choices (staying on after shift, accessing specific instruments) and supplies resources that affect the conceptual outcome. Essential across beats and ending; strong causal integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Introduced line 3 ("after blowing the whistle at shift change"); establishes the frame (night watch, post-shift solitude). The timeframe enables the protagonist's uninterrupted observation and heretical adjustment but does not tighten decisions with a live clock. Present in setup and implied through closure (the engines hush, breaths counted to zero). Functional but somewhat passive; no urgent countdown shapes tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Signaled line 4 ("to understand what clocks really measure when nobody is forcing them"); drives three beats (staying on, adjusting Basin Three, the edge realization). The motivation is dramatized through micro-choices (using the key, counting backward, writing the note) and conflicted with professional duty (heresy, the foreman's lesson). Closure directly answers the question with felt cost (bleeding finger, uncorrected boundary event). High causal pressure and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Introduced line 1 ("fjord quiet, like breath held by mountains"); modulates with pressure ("bass hush under everything," "the fjord did not argue"). Tone is coherent through turns and charges the final image ("we watched the stylus knit darkness," "mountains released their breath"). The quietness constrains the protagonist's perceptual mode (listening, watching, counting) and supports the accumulative textural design. Strong closure linkage; the tone reweights the opening frame with earned stillness.</comment>
