<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The map dealer's interiority is concrete and character-specific ("cataloging other people choosing in vellum and ink"), with embodied hesitation across years before the midsummer decision. Micro-choices under pressure—crouching to watch ants, pressing the chip, taking it back—reveal hierarchy of values. The final renunciation (removing the chip "because leaving it would make the door too easy") forecloses a path with visible cost, meeting the Earned Stasis test. Minor slip: Ruth's empirically intuitive wisdom is told more than dramatized in contradictory impulses.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors early (map dealer, shop, midsummer approach). Accumulative/Textural lens inferred: pressure builds through years of stillness, the rebuilt bridge, ant-following, cavern discovery, and the hallway of reflections. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the protagonist removes the chip and crosses the creek, crystallizing options with felt cost ("promise had not ended; it had finished transforming"). The walk-out and creek-crossing supply visible consequence. One hairline issue: the hallway-of-mirrors segment risks exposition, but the final image reweights prior material cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Micro-setting qualifies: the matrix chip constrains the seam interaction, and the rising creek functions as live environmental pressure that narrows the window for choice. Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered ("blooming cavern breathed cold air," "petals glimmer where quartz veins surfaced"). The creek's rising water physically tests the protagonist's legs and drags grit, altering the walk-out. The cavern's geometry and the chip's notch directly enable and charge the closure beat, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (honoring the promise to find the doorway) is signaled early and tightens at midsummer. One meaningful deepening occurs when the hallway shows alternate routes and the protagonist realizes "the door did not choose for you, it only stopped time long enough to notice." Agency crystallizes in the decision to remove the chip and step where reflections overlap, foreclosing the easy-door path with felt cost. The creek's rise supplies physical urgency. Escalation is driven by protagonist observation and micro-choices under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: promises as "small, repeated choices" and "tracks ants leave" reweights the opening's "potential" versus "place." The final image—"travel by choosing, one decision at a time"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The matrix chip's return to pocket and the ant-bridge crossing supply earned closure. Subtext operates through the chip's broken-letter engraving, the creek's rising voice, and the reflections' overlap. The piece resists easy resolution; the promise "finished transforming into something I would keep daily" avoids sermonic summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Single POV with stable distance and distinct perceptual signature: the dealer's idiom blends cartographic precision ("elevation lines curl like sleeping cats") with Ruth's teachings ("hear the geography inside metal"). Diction remains character-bound; no unmotivated register shifts. Purposeful compression in the hallway segment ("light poured through as if corrected by a proofreader") fits voice and heightens pressure. Minor slip: a few filter verbs ("I felt the promise pull tight") dilute immediacy in peak beats, though the internal texture stays consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings diversify. Information density is high: most lines serve character, pressure, or resonance. The creek and ants supply recurring motifs with evolving function. Two minor artifacts lower the score: paraphrase near "cataloging other people choosing" / "maps that ask nothing back" (slight loop), and one filter-verb cluster in the cavern beats ("I felt," "I put my ear," "I understood"). No scaffolding or template cadence. The final line ("matrix chip warmed, a small weight that aligned my steps like a compass") charges closure cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of antique maps, typography, and ant-navigation feels specific and non-obvious; the matrix chip's broken-letter shape echoing the seam is a fresh inflection. The "doorway of decisions" as reflective pause rather than magical solution transforms a familiar quest trope. Removing the chip to preserve difficulty shows moral calculus. Risk is present in the lyric compression and the unconventional climax (a hallway of mirrors, not confrontation). Slight reduction: the "empirically intuitive" pairing and the promise-as-bridge metaphor edge toward abstraction without full embodiment in early beats.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lonely antique map dealer is introduced immediately, frames the promise and years of stillness, makes the midsummer walk, presses and removes the chip, and crosses the creek in the ending. Choices (watching ants, seating the chip, removing it, stepping through reflections) create key turns. Setup, development, and payoff gates all met. Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong. Swappability is low: the dealer's profession colors perception throughout.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The type foundry matrix chip appears in paragraph four (early setup), is described with the broken-letter engraving, is carried in the pack, pressed into the seam notch (enabling the hallway), removed with deliberate cost ("leaving it would make the door too easy"), and returns in the final line as a compass-weight. Four distinct beats, high causal pressure, closure linkage, and irreplaceability (the engraving matches the seam). Cost is tied directly to its removal. All three gates met; indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The lingering promise is introduced in paragraph six, shapes the years of stillness ("I kept still"), tightens as midsummer nears, pulls "tight like a knot behind my ribs" in the cavern, and transforms in the ending ("finished transforming into something I would keep daily"). It constrains choices (whether to leave or act) and drives the walk. Setup, development, and payoff all present. Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong. Specificity (the promise to find the doorway together) makes it irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Empirically intuitive" is attributed to Ruth early ("happiest when observation and hunch braided into something testable") and echoed in the protagonist's final stance ("observe and act"). It informs the method (following ants, watching for evidence) but remains more thematic than action-constraining. One on-page moment: "I felt their empirically intuitive wisdom in my knees and fingers." Setup and payoff present; middle development is thin. The trait enables the search but could be described otherwise without breaking logic. Mid-band for functional but somewhat decorative use.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Glimmer" appears in Ruth's instructions ("listen for a seam that will glimmer"), recurs when petals "glimmer where quartz veins surfaced," and again in the ending's "clean, thin glimmer like a percussion note" at the moment of crossing. Setup and closure participation are clear. The glimmer marks the seam and signals the successful passage. Two distinct beats. Causal role is moderate: the word guides search and marks the threshold. Swappable with "shimmer" or "light" with minor edits, limiting the top band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Following ants home" is seeded in Ruth's instructions early, becomes the protagonist's mantra ("repeating the phrase the way some people repeat prayers"), guides the walk into the thicket, and is reprised when ants return "balancing a pale petal like a sail" and arch "a bridge of moving bodies" for the creek crossing. Three beats, high causal pressure (the method finds the cavern and later enables the exit), closure linkage (ant-bridge), and irreplaceability (specific, non-obvious tactic). All three gates met.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The blooming cavern at midsummer is discovered mid-story, supplies the seam and chip-notch interaction, and houses the hallway of reflections. Midsummer timing is flagged early and verified on arrival ("It was midsummer exactly"). The cavern's "impossible and exact" geometry and cold air create atmosphere; the quartz veins enable the glimmer. Setup is mid-story (~40% mark), capping potential slightly, but development and payoff are strong. The setting enables the key choice and charges the final departure. Two gates solid, third (early setup) marginal.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The rising creek is mentioned early ("the creek swallowed the footbridge"), recurs as Ruth's instruction ("The creek rises when it is time"), becomes live threat outside the cavern ("the creek climbing the banks," "water hissed outside"), and is crossed in the ending where "water pressed my shins and dragged grit." Three beats; the rising water tightens the decision window and physically tests the exit. Causal pressure and closure participation are strong. The timeframe narrows options and supplies urgency. All three gates met.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The motivation to find the doorway of decisions is introduced early (paragraph seven), drives the midsummer walk, tightens in the cavern ("I felt the promise pull tight"), is tested when the protagonist considers leaving ("return to the maps that ask nothing back"), and resolves in the ending ("promise had not ended; it had finished transforming"). Friction between stillness and action, safety and risk, spans the arc. Setup, development, and payoff all clear. Causal pressure and closure linkage are high. Cost is visible in years of waiting and the final walk through rising water.</comment>
