<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is concrete and character-particular: "awkwardly confident," seeking echoes because "echoes told the truth," speaking to the stones about her father. Her choices under pressure—pressing palms to the stones, risking waking silencers, sending the map to the rooftops—reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost. Internal contradiction surfaces when she realizes "she had carried it only to justify her feet," and her final stance crystallizes as "orientation rather than rage." Minimal embodied emotion under stress; the circuit scene reads slightly abstract, but the arc from searching to broadcasting is earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mara's decision to broadcast the Lark's route reconfigures the rebellion from rage to orientation, with visible cost (exposure, "waking whoever had silenced them"). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered imagery (stones-stars, hum-breath, opera glasses as chronology), culminating in the projector banner that reweights the dominant stake. Orientation anchors early (spaceport, barefoot stargazer, father's disappearance). One meaningful tightening occurs when she closes the circuit with her palms, and the bay answers with the star map. Cost is legible: she steps into hangar light "barefoot and sure," carrying the risk forward.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The spaceport repair bay constrains and charges the closure: gutted shuttle, cargo door with orbital equations, stone circle at the spine, projectors that paint coordinates. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—"hummed the way grief hums," "heat climbed through her arms, prickling," floor lines flaring into a star map. The opera glasses function as micro-setting, transforming perception twice (stones into stars, then chronology). Spatial choreography is coherent across moves from dented hulls to the stone ring to the hangar mouth. The margin-of-daylight frame and the stones' mineral memory anchor tone and constrain her choice to broadcast.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding her father and the Lark—is signaled early and tightens when Mara risks the circuit to ask the machine. One on-page reversal: the bay's answer (map of the Lark's route) transforms her search into a tool for the rebellion's orientation. Agency is clear: her decision to broadcast the route forecloses secrecy with visible cost (exposure to "whoever had silenced them"). The escalation follows the Accumulative lens: pressure deepens as she moves from listening to the stones, to closing the circuit, to projecting the map. The pause in rebellion creates situational pressure that her action reconfigures. Cost is felt in "her knees gave... in release" and stepping into the light "barefoot and sure."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: meaning-making as "the courage to ask a machine the right question and wait until it hums back," rebellion shifting from rage to orientation. The opera glasses, stone circle, and star map accumulate without over-symbolizing; each reweights the search with concrete constraint. The final image—"thunderous serenity down the service stairs"—offers a resonant answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in the lull as "held breath," the siren that "chirped and died," and Mara's realization that "the rebellion would reignite as orientation rather than rage." No thematic echo or prompt-language intrusion. The ending reweights prior material: her father's disappearance, the map of scraps, the hum as conversation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled: "margin of daylight," "awkwardly confident," "thunderous serenity," "echoes told the truth." Diction remains within Mara's plausible lexicon with occasional elevated phrasing ("calibration altar," "spilled ribbon of routes"). POV is stable third-limited; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent: she reads rust as prophecy, hears the hum as grief, translates the stones into stars. Purposeful compression in phrases like "to justify her feet" and "not destroyed... merely refused" supports rhythm without obscuring clarity. Slight register drift in "alignment" and "chronology" during peak stress, but the effect remains legible and voice-motivated. No dialogue to assess.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information density is high: most lines advance character, setting, or stakes. Rhythm varies naturally, with short declarations ("She rose") alternating with longer accumulative sentences. A few paraphrase loops: "the hum" recurs across adjacent lines without new pressure, and "awkwardly confident" is repeated verbatim. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent—"margin of daylight," "thunderous serenity," stones as stars—though "the bay breathed like a sleeping leviathan awaiting a final whisper" stacks metaphors heavily in the opener. The loop/scaffold penalty applies for "awkwardly confident" and minor synonym churn around "hum." Template cadence is avoided; sentence openings vary. No filter-verb stacks or major clarity loss.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—barefoot stargazer using vintage opera glasses to read an ancient stone circle in a spaceport, transforming a rebellion's pause into orientation—is specific and non-obvious. The piece commits fully to its lyric-SF premise without retreating to exposition. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure and charged poetic compression heightens stakes without gimmickry. The transformation of "lull in rebellion" into "thunderous serenity" and "orientation rather than rage" is earned through the stone-circuit sequence. Proximity check: no close echoes of famous lines. Minor deduction for the opera-glasses-as-chronology move, which feels slightly convenient, but the particulars (father's work, Lark's route, projector banner) ground the fantastical turn.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara (barefoot stargazer) drives three key beats: pressing her ear to deckplates, closing the circuit with her palms, and broadcasting the map. Setup is immediate (first paragraph), development includes the circuit choice under pressure, and closure hinges on her decision to project the route. Her choices narrow options (risking exposure) and charge the final image. Cost is visible: stepping into the light "barefoot and sure" after the broadcast. Causal pressure is present but not maximal; the stargazer label itself does less work than her actions.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Vintage opera glasses appear in three beats: carried in her pockets (setup), used to peer through the ring (stones sharpen into stars), and lifted again to see chronology (Lark's route). Development: the glasses enable her to read the stones as stars and the star map as a timeline. Closure linkage: she pockets them "not as relic but as proof of alignment." Specific properties (clouded lenses, chipped frame) matter. Causal role is clear: without them, the stone-reading and route-discovery do not occur. Minor friction: the chronology function feels slightly late-introduced, but the glasses are present and reweighted across the arc.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"A lull in rebellion" is signaled early (outside, hush after alarms, "held breath"), shapes stakes (streets emptied, pause creates listening space), and reconfigures at closure when Mara decides the rebellion will reignite "as orientation rather than rage." The lull creates situational pressure: absence gathers into presence, permitting her broadcast. Development: the pause allows her to act without immediate interference. Closure: the concept is explicitly reweighted in the final paragraph. Cost is conceptual but legible: the rebellion's direction shifts because of the lull and her action within it.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Awkwardly confident" is labeled twice (opening and at the stone ring) but does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with visible tradeoff. The trait colors her movement but remains ornamental; no beat hinges on awkwardness versus confidence. Setup is early, but development and closure participation are absent. Swappable with "hesitant" or "deliberate" without structural change. Lyric reprise (first paragraph and stone-ring approach) provides slight resonance but no causal weight.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Reignite" anchors the ending explicitly ("the rebellion would reignite as orientation rather than rage") and is prepared by the bay's awakening: lights blinking, floor lines flaring, projectors painting the map. Setup occurs midway (circuit scene), development includes the star map's emergence, and closure depends on the broadcast that will reignite the movement. The action redefines the rebellion's direction with visible cost (exposure, stepping into light). Causal pressure is strong; removing "reignite" would flatten the arc's final reconfiguration. Minor friction: the verb itself appears only once at the end, but the underlying action pervades the second half.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The ancient stone circle is signaled early (chamber with ring of black stones, "calibration altar"), its mechanics matter (hum, closing the circuit with palms, heat climbing through arms), and it drives the closure (bay answers, star map appears). Setup is in the first third, development includes the hum as conversation and the circuit test, and closure depends on the stones' activation to produce the Lark's route. Specific properties (too regular, too cold, humming) constrain her approach. Cost is tied to the method: risking "waking whoever had silenced them." The stones shape two major beats and the ending. High integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport repair bay is present throughout, pressuring choices and supplying resources: gutted shuttle (listening post), cargo door with orbital equations (entry to the ring), stone circle (mechanism), projectors (broadcast tool). Setup is immediate (first sentence), development includes the bay's spatial logic (dented hulls, gantries, service stairs), and closure depends on the hangar mouth for the projected banner. The setting constrains her search path and enables the broadcast. Specific micro-elements (deckplates, nets, floor lines) alter tactics. Visible cost: the bay's reawakening exposes her. Essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Margin of daylight" opens the story and frames the setting as liminal. Time pressure is implied (curfews, alarms, the lull as temporary), and the phrase returns conceptually when the Lark is "tucked into that same margin of daylight where Mara stood." Setup is early, closure linkage is lyric (Lark hidden in the same temporal margin), but the timeframe does not tighten on-page decisions or create a live clock. Development is weak: no scene urgency tied to daylight fading or a deadline. The phrase charges the final image poetically but does not constrain tactics. Mid-band for lyric resonance without mechanical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"To discover meaning in the mess" is stated early and dramatized through Mara's search: reading rust as prophecy, listening for work's song, speaking to the stones, asking the machine. Development includes the map-of-scraps realization ("carried it only to justify her feet") and the circuit question ("where did the Lark go"). Closure reconfigures the motivation: meaning becomes "the courage to ask a machine the right question and wait until it hums back." Friction between want (find father) and cost (risk exposure, broadcast to the rebellion) is present. The motivation shapes three beats and the ending. Minor friction: the phrasing "discover meaning" is slightly abstract, but the on-page search is concrete.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Thunderous serenity" is stated twice (as the lull's quality and in the final line) and modulates with pressure: the quiet as "held breath," the siren that "chirped and died," the hum as patient rhythm, Mara's knees giving "in release." Tone is coherent through turns, balancing industrial decay, grief, and charged stillness. The final image—"carrying thunderous serenity down the service stairs"—reweights the opening's atmospheric claim. Setup is early, development includes the hum's steadying rhythm, and closure participation is explicit. Minor friction: the phrase risks oxymoronic abstraction, but the piece earns it through accumulation. Charges the final image without dominating every beat.</comment>
