<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The cartographer's interior is rendered through poetic compression rather than contradiction or choice under pressure. Motivation is consistent (vow to map what walls dream), but the protagonist observes and records rather than facing a dilemma that forecloses a path with visible cost. The "legacy's burden" moment and the hopscotch action show micro-choices, yet they do not create an internal conflict that narrows options. Embodiment is present ("I knelt," "I coaxed") but often filtered through lyric distance rather than visceral immediacy.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece accretes images (ivy, negative, letter, hopscotch) and the final sigh ("the house rose slightly on its stilts of memory") reweights the premise with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Orientation is swift (cartographer, drowned district, post-climate shift), and the single-scene window holds. Cost is oblique—the protagonist accepts the shawl of echoes and promises to return—but the final image of the house rising suggests that the burden is now shared, a conceptual price paid. One deduction: the closure reconfigures meaning but the felt cost is more implied than dramatically visible on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setting is specific and purposeful: ivy-veiled passage, half-burned fireplace, seaweed-braided towers. The hopscotch grid in dust and the negative held to the doorway are micro-setting uses that constrain the protagonist's method (play the room to know it). Sensory detail is vivid and selective ("soot," "coals," "lime"), and the drowned district's post-climate particulars shape the cartographer's vocation. The final image of the house on "stilts of memory" charges the setting with thematic weight, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: to map the house's dream and honor legacy's burden. Pressure accumulates through discovery (diary, negative, letter, hopscotch), and the protagonist's agency is shown in the choice to play the room and bind the negative into the ledger. However, escalation is gentle and the final act is acceptance rather than a trade-off that forecloses a live alternative. Cost is present (the shawl settles, the promise to return) but accumulative rather than a decisive narrowing of options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—legacy, forgiveness, listening as citizenship—emerges organically from the cartographer's actions and the house's memories. The final image ("the house rose slightly on its stilts of memory") reweights prior material without stating a moral. Subtext operates in gesture (ivy tapping, wall sighing, hopscotch instruction) and the letter's promise. One minor slip: "citizenship earned by attending to the walls" edges toward abstract declaration, though it remains grounded in the map-making practice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and sustained: lyric-poetic diction ("coin down a tide drain," "pantry of bones") remains consistent and voice-motivated. POV is stable first-person, and perceptual signature is clear (sensitively perceptive to plaster, brick, stories). Figurative language is dense but coherent and anchored in the cartographer's idiom. One deduction: the elevated register is unvarying even in peak action (playing hopscotch, coaxing the letter), which risks flattening urgency, but the piece teaches its pattern early and the effect supports the textural lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is lyric and compressed, with high information density and purposeful rhythm. Metaphors are vivid ("sleeping eel," "stilts of memory") and grammatically clean. Two issues: (1) Paraphrase loop appears ("Outside, ivy tapped… recalling how seasons now moved" / "Outside, gulls hacked the wind"), a minor −0.2 deduction. (2) Figurative density is high throughout without sharp alternation with plain statement, risking overwriting in a high-pressure beat (the hopscotch sequence), −0.3. Sentence openings vary and no scaffold or template cadence is present.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The corridor echo cartographer premise is fresh and the drowned-district setting offers specific post-climate particulars. The combination of film negative, hopscotch grid, and half-burned letter is inventive. However, the emotional arc (acceptance of legacy's burden) is familiar in structure, and the final image, while resonant, does not surprise in hindsight. The piece transforms its tropes through voice and specificity but does not take a bold structural or thematic risk that redefines the reader's frame.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character present throughout; drives the discovery sequence and makes micro-choices (holds negative to light, plays hopscotch, binds negative into ledger). The cartographer's sensitively perceptive attribute enables all moves, but the choices are more observational than high-stakes decisions that narrow options. Present in closure (locks door, promises return), but the final turn is the house's rise, not the protagonist's decisive change.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Film negative strip appears mid-story, is held to the doorway to reveal a ghosted city, and is bound into the ledger at the end. Three beats: discovery, use (reveal silhouette of child), and closure incorporation (bound as lens). The negative's property (inverts brightness) is specific and charges the final instruction to "invert brightness," shaping the cartographer's method. Strong causal and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Legacy's burden is named explicitly ("Legacy's burden breathed there") and dramatized when the protagonist feels the shawl settle on their shoulders. It shapes the protagonist's decision to map faithfully and to return, and the letter's promise (son to return and translate) ties the burden to the closure. The concept is thematic and emotional rather than a constraint that alters tactics on the page, placing it in mid-band despite closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Sensitively perceptive is stated in the opening paragraph and enables all discoveries (tremble of plaster, click of brick, pressure of stories). However, it is primarily a label that justifies the protagonist's method rather than a trait with a visible tradeoff or cost. No moment on the page shows the attribute narrowing options or imposing a price (e.g., overwhelm, misreading). It functions as a credential rather than a constraint.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Glimpse occurs when the protagonist holds the negative to the doorway, revealing the ghosted city. This action is a key discovery beat that introduces the heritage and blueprint, and it leads to the child's silhouette instruction. However, the glimpse could be replaced with another reveal method without breaking story logic. It is purposeful but not indispensable to the closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Method (half-burned diaries in fireplace) is introduced early ("Near the hearth I found the method the old mentors spoke of") and is the first discovery that leads to the negative and letter. The diaries provide the conceptual frame (diagrams of rooms, arrows toward secrets) that the protagonist then enacts. The method is named, used, and its mechanics (reading for pressure changes) shape the protagonist's approach across subsequent beats. Present in three beats and causally linked to closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Ivy-veiled passage is the entry point and recurs (ivy taps window, ivy quiets). The passage frames the single-scene window and the ivy's "small weather reports" provide atmospheric pressure. The passage's sideways-slid house enables the hearth discovery. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it is a stage rather than an active constraint. Present in closure image indirectly (ivy quiets as the house tilts an ear), but does not decisively charge the final turn.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>After the climate shifts is stated early and provides the drowned-district context (seaweed on towers, floodplain, water as landlord). However, the timeframe is backdrop rather than a tightening clock that alters decisions. The protagonist's work is post-disaster archaeology, not a race against time. The timeframe enables the premise but does not pressure tactics on the page.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Motivation (to discover what walls dream about) is stated early and drives all moves (following ivy, pressing ear to wall, playing hopscotch, coaxing the letter). The protagonist's question "What do you dream?" is dramatized on the page. The motivation is tested when legacy's burden asks whether to map faithfully or shirk, and the protagonist chooses to accept the weight. Desire is clear and conflicted, but the friction is brief and resolved without a visible tradeoff.</comment>
