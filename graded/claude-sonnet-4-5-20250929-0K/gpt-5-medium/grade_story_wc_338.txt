<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's perceptual signature—"methodically curious" map framer—is consistent and embodied through micro-choices: comparing footage, tracing seams, promising village gathering. Interiority avoids therapy-speak and filters observation through professional discipline ("listen before I pin anything down," "the way a framer listens for the right bevel"). The verger functions as credible secondary pressure with his exhausted shrug "that tried to be refusal and failed." Minor slip: the final stance feels more curator than framer—no on-page cost to the professional identity itself, though gratitude and the mat-cutting anchor the trade.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density increases through layered video evidence, procession detail, vault descent, and the final reframing decision. Orientation anchors who/where/when by ~80 words. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the narrator frames the tear visible, reopens the chapel conditionally ("and then see"), and returns to shop practice with added ritual. Cost is conceptual and occupational—"a wound is also a seam"—and the final note modulates professional stance with earned humility. One credible deepening (video comparison → seam discovery → village gathering) tightens options without mechanical reversal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rain-scoured vault, henge, and whispered chapel constrain multiple beats: cold air at the seam, architectural hush from the slit, names pricked in lime. The map tear and fresco detail charge the closure image by framing history's wound as seam. Sensory hierarchy filters through framer's eye: bevel, crease, embroidery metaphor. Spatial choreography tracks descent, wall trace, door lift, and shop return cleanly. Minor: the henge bookends feel more atmospheric than constraining—sheep threading needles is vivid but ornamental to choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: interpret the cartographic blank and honor unspoken care. Escalation unfolds through accumulative deepening: torn map → video comparison → seam discovery → village gathering → conditional reopening. Agency is renunciation and curation—narrator refuses solo reopening, involves community, frames the wound rather than mending it. Cost is legible: the verger's face-wipe, the narrator's shift from solver to witness, and the conditional "and then see" foreclose permanent answers. No forced antagonist; pressure coheres under the chosen lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—care left unspoken, silence as testimony—emerges from vault names, chapel hush as architecture not miracle, and the framed tear marking "where one thing meets another." The final note "Open to history, open to quiet" reweights the opening "shielded openness" without thesis statement. Subtext runs through the verger's crossed self, villagers' careful feet, and the narrator's oath to "interpret silence with empathy." No late symbol drops; motifs (map tear, video silence, fresco breath) constrain beats and charge closure. The physics-not-superstition explanation risks didacticism but stays anchored in perception ("steady physics of breath, stone, damp, and patience").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>First-person POV maintains stable psychic distance and perceptual signature: framer's idiom (bevel, mat, seam), methodical pacing, and metaphor through craft ("needles in old hands," "wind in reeds but steadier"). Diction stays within narrator's register—elevated but particular, no corporate drift. Brief村er dialogue ("the parish could reopen... and then see") reads natural and goal-driven. Minor slip: "My hands were steady, as ever, methodically curious, and guarded by gratitude" stacks near-synonyms for narrator's trait in summary rather than action. No head-hopping; focalization clean throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift. Information density high: most lines do two jobs (e.g., "rain eats old limestone like a slow animal" grounds setting and tempo). No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Minor artifacts: "The hush was not miracle, but architecture" echoes "He said it was a whispered chapel, not by miracle" within six paragraphs—acceptable thematic recurrence but nears redundancy. "Methodically curious" appears three times, twice as direct label. Figurative density ("bellows," "needles," "embroidery," "purl") risks overwriting in lyric sections but stays legible and voice-coherent. Final image ("pale bevel that echoed the horizon") charges closure without muddle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Core synthesis—map framing as interpretive practice, silent footage as evidence, chapel as architectural phenomenon—feels specific and non-obvious. The vault discovery avoids treasure-hunt cliché by centering community witnessing and conditional reopening. Risk: sustained lyric register and reflective pacing in a detective-adjacent structure; the accumulative lens justifies it. Minor derivative note: the torn-map-as-wound and "known/unknown" boundary language echo common metaphor templates, though execution through fresco vault and pricked names adds fresh detail. Transformation test passes: plot requires this exact framer's method and stance.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Perceptive map framer present from opening line, shapes video comparison (beat 1), seam trace (beat 2), and conditional reopening + framing choice (beat 3). The occupation's "listen before I pin" ethos constrains tactics: gathers village rather than acting solo, frames the tear visible. Causal pressure: framer's skill enables evidence discovery; professional oath ("interpret silence with empathy") motivates climax gathering. Closure hinges on framing decision and shop note. Late penalty waived—continuous POV. Cost: narrator shifts from solver to curator, visible in final mat-cutting and note placement.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Ancient henge appears in two beats: opening atmospheric anchor ("rain eats old limestone") and walk-past before church ("sheep threaded between stones like needles"). No causal pressure—removal would not break story logic. Lyric reprise brackets the vault action but does not reweight meaning at closure. Functional tone-setting for locale; replaceable with any similar ruin marker. Scores mid-band for purposeful atmosphere but lacks necessity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Whispered chapel is the story's engine: the map tear lines up with it, video evidence traces it, vault descent reveals it, village gathers for it, and the final framing honors it. Present by first third (verger's story), drives middle discovery, and closure ("saved hush") depends on it. The hush-as-architecture explanation (slit drawing storms) provides specific constraint. Architectural detail—names pricked in lime, shingled lean-to—charges ending image. Irreplaceable: no synonym could substitute the exact concept.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Methodically curious signals early ("my manner," "my work does not allow"), enables video-comparison method (middle), and returns at closure ("methodically curious, and guarded by gratitude"). Constrains tactics: narrator promises village gathering rather than solo breach, listens at seam "the way a framer listens for the right bevel." Cost: patience over speed, communal witness over personal discovery. Minor label-repetition in final paragraph slightly lowers irreplaceability, but trait drives key choices.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Reopen appears in oath ("promising I would reopen nothing without the village gathered"), drives climax beat (door lift with village present), and conditional ending ("reopen the chapel for the day, and then see"). The action redefines options: from sealed vault to conditional access, from solving mystery to honoring silence. Causal: verger's agreement and village participation hinge on narrator's promise. Cost visible: partial rather than permanent opening, ongoing negotiation. Essential to closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Comparing silent video footage signaled early (parish film reels), detailed in middle beat (1972 procession door, 1999 lime swell), and explains final gathering ("I explained what the videos had shown"). Method shapes discovery: narrator finds seam location via cross-decade evidence. Specificity—pauses, finger-slip, dark swell alignment—makes it irreplaceable. Minor: the mechanics feel slightly summarized rather than enacted on the page, but causal work is clear and method constrains attempts.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rain-scoured fresco vault introduced early (fourth line), drives descent and seam discovery (middle), houses whispered chapel revelation, and frames ending choice (vault "breathed like a bellows" in penultimate beat). Setting supplies resources: peeled paint warms under lamps, cold air at seam signals hidden room, architectural slit explains hush. Causal pressure: vault condition (damp, lime bubble) enables video evidence; fresco preservation justifies shingled lean-to. Spatial choreography tracks wall trace, door lift, name reading. Indispensable to story logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Timeframe "at the spot where a map tears, dividing known from unknown" anchors opening inciting beat (parchment tear) and reappears in closure logic (tear framed visible, marking saved hush). Lyric reprise reweights the map wound as seam. No strict clock pressure—story spans undefined days—but the cross-decade video comparison and village gathering add temporal layers. Functional early-to-final pattern but does not tighten tactics under time constraint. Scores mid-band for thematic reprise without escalation mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation "to interpret silence with empathy" stated as oath (first third), drives video analysis and seam listening (middle), and shapes closure choices: village gathering, conditional reopening, framing the wound. Desire conflicts with solver instinct—narrator must resist solo action. Cost: public witness over private achievement, ambiguity over answers ("and then see"). Friction visible in verger's shrug resistance and narrator's restraint at seam. Minor: "interpret silence with empathy" is slightly abstract phrasing but enacted through specific choices.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Shielded openness introduced in opening lines ("notebooks closed while my eyes stay welcoming"), modulates through vault descent (verger crosses himself, narrator "merely listened"), and charges final note ("Open to history, open to quiet"). Tone balances restraint and receptivity: methodical observation, refusal of superstition, gratitude without sentimentality. Coherent through turns; no static mood. The lyric register sustains tone without flattening pressure. Minor: tone converges with theme—functional but nears redundancy with "silence" motif.</comment>
