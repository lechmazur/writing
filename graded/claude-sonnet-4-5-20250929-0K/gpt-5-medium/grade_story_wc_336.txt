<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Miren's interior world is vivid and particular—she "felt insatiably creative" when the orchard asks for "a new kind of gesture"—but the motivational arc lacks contradictory impulses acting in scene. The child interaction adds a second character and pressure, yet Miren's choices flow without visible internal friction or cost that forecloses a path. Embodied emotion appears ("Wind braided mist into her hair"), but the peak choice to plant the seed feels preordained rather than torn from competing desires. The piece reads as lyric observation more than dramatized struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of sensory layering and mythic compression early; the seed gathers testimonies across beats and culminates in a planting that reweights the valley's memory. Orientation anchors (Miren, parapet, waterfall) land within the first ~80 words. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the seed is planted "where the worlds already greet each other," and the valley promises to "remember to breathe"—a cadence shift with conceptual cost (the ongoing work of wonder-keeping). One persistent tightening: the child's loneliness is drawn into the seed, altering the valley's future. The cost is more implied than visceral, keeping the score from 8+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The parapet, waterfall mist, and orchard function as micro-setting that constrains Miren's gestures: she clips branches, taps the jar to the seed, plants in the seam "where the waterfall's mist left bright beads." Sensory detail is dense and purposeful ("scent like bread learning to rise"), filtered through Miren's professional and mythic priorities. Spatial choreography remains clear across her movement from limb to limb and the child's ascent. The crack between flagstones serves as the closure site, charging the final image with place-specific logic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: preserve the valley's "color of wonder" so apples taste like "first light" again. The child's arrival introduces secondary pressure (their mother's tired apples, the window turned toward grayness), and Miren's response—tapping jar to seed, pruning silence—tightens options by gathering testimonies into the seed. One meaningful deepening: the seed becomes "hungry not for soil but for testimony," reweighting the task. Agency is present (Miren's pruning choices, the child's promise), and the planting forecloses散失 of wonder with felt cost ("careful work of keeping a path swept"). Escalation is gentle rather than sharp, fitting the Accumulative lens but preventing higher scores.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme—wonder as labor, memory as nourishment—emerges organically from pruning, seed-gathering, and the child's promise to "open the window at dawn." No thesis statements; the final image ("the valley would remember to breathe") reweights prior material without moralizing. The seed's hunger for testimony rather than soil crystallizes the conceptual cost: wonder requires active tending, not passive growth. Subtext operates in the child's cracked sugar jar and the chair "turned toward grayness," and the orchard-as-witness motif accumulates pressure across beats. Minor: one phrase, "It was not a miracle, only the careful work," edges toward explaining theme rather than enacting it, but the breach is small.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited on Miren; distance is consistent and lyric compression is pattern-taught early ("upon the hush of budding hope"). Perceptual signature is strong: Miren notices "sap and memory," "the color of wonder itself," sensory metaphors tied to her orchard expertise. The child's dialogue feels natural and goal-driven ("our apples taste tired…our window no longer catches morning"), carrying subtext of familial care. Under peak pressure (the seed's gathering, the planting), diction stays voice-coherent without register drift. Minor: a few constructions ("which was also the orchard's face, which was also the waterfall's patience") stack modifiers in a way that risks lyric overreach, though the effect remains legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high ("Each cut was a stitch, weaving between worlds"). Clarity holds through mythic compression. However, several lines loop conceptually: "weaving between worlds" appears three times with minimal reweighting; "the color of wonder" recurs without added pressure mid-text. Template cadence in places: "She [verb]…and she [verb]" structures repeat across adjacent sentences. Figurative language is dense in every beat without creating opacity, but the concentration ("threshing floor for dreams," "unblinking eye," "pupil searching") in the opening third risks overwriting. No causality breaks, so penalties remain in Q7. Applying loop/scaffold and density checks: −0.6 total.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The premise—orchard pruner as memory-keeper, seed that gathers testimony—offers a fresh synthesis of pastoral labor and mythic stewardship. The child's cracked jar, the chair facing grayness, and the seam where "worlds already greet each other" are specific, non-obvious particulars. Emotional truth (wonder as work, not miracle) avoids generic templates. Risk-taking in lyric compression and the Accumulative lens heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The piece commits fully to its metaphor of pruning-as-weaving and follows implications through to the planted seed. Proximity check: no echoes of famous lines detected. Within-band risk adjustment: +0.3 for sustained lyric coherence and bold metaphoric integration.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Miren (wise orchard pruner) is present throughout, drives two key beats (pruning branches to release scent/testimony, planting the seed in the seam), and her expertise shapes tactics. Setup by paragraph one, development in mid-beats (clipping the scar, moving limb to limb), and payoff in the planting decision. Specificity: her knowledge of "weaving between worlds" and reading the orchard's "sap and memory" make her irreplaceable. Cost: she spends the day gathering testimonies and commits to ongoing tending ("careful work of keeping a path swept"). Causal pressure is moderate; the child's arrival complicates but Miren's choices remain central. Early signal +0.6, two-beat involvement +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.6, cost +0.4, modest swappability friction −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The heirloom seed appears in four beats: opening (locket description), midpoint (opened over palm, "glow shivered"), child interaction (tapped to jar, draws loneliness and returns sunrise sliver), and planting (placed in seam, covered with moss). Setup early, development across gathering testimonies (the seed becomes "hungry not for soil but for testimony"), and payoff in planting. Specificity: its "color…of wonder itself" and capacity to gather essence are unique and irreplaceable. Cost: planting it commits Miren and the valley to the ongoing work of memory. Early signal +0.7, three-beat involvement +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.5, specificity +0.7, cost +0.5, total ~5.9 base raised by strong integration to 8.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Weaving between worlds" is named explicitly multiple times and shapes Miren's task: she prunes "not only wood but the exhaustion," moves "from limb to limb…seaming the present orchard to the ancestral one." Setup by paragraph seven, development in the pruning beats (releasing scent into the seed, gathering the child's story), and payoff in the planting site chosen "because here the worlds already greet each other." The concept alters tactics (what she prunes, where she plants) and stakes (preserving both root-world and recollection-world). Specificity: the "second world of recollection" and the seam metaphor are tied to this exact concept. Early signal +0.6, two-beat involvement +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.6, cost +0.4, minus label-only repetition −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Insatiably creative" is named once ("she felt insatiably creative, as if the orchard were asking for a new kind of gesture") but does not visibly constrain or enable a choice with cost. The trait frames her openness to the seed's gathering work, but no on-page decision turns on creativity versus another impulse. Setup mid-first-third, no clear development beat where creativity alters tactics, and no closure linkage. Label-only mention without dramatized tradeoff. Present +1.0, one-beat involvement +0.4, no causal pressure, no closure linkage, label-only friction −0.5, swappability −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Succor" appears once as intent ("she meant to succor that failing memory") and once indirectly in the act of drawing the child's story and returning "a sliver of sunrise." Setup mid-text, development in the jar-tapping beat (the seed returns light to the child's face), and payoff implied in the valley's renewed breath. The action is present but could be rephrased as "nourish" or "restore" with minor edits, reducing irreplaceability. One-beat involvement +0.4, causal pressure (the seed's return of sunrise alters the child's and valley's state) +0.8, closure linkage (valley "would remember to breathe") +0.9, swappability friction −0.6, late first appearance −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"By capturing essence" is signaled early ("Her way was by capturing essence, pruning not only wood but the exhaustion") and demonstrated across three beats: the cut releases "a scent like bread learning to rise" that "slid into the seed's glow"; the child's story is "poured…and the seed drew down the chair's loneliness"; the seed gathers "essence of every whisper" overnight. Setup by ~30%, development in pruning and child-interaction beats, payoff in the overnight weaving and valley's taste of morning. Mechanics matter: the seed's hunger for testimony and the released scents/stories alter what Miren prunes and where she plants. Early signal +0.7, three-beat involvement +1.4, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.7, cost +0.4.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The "verdant parapet beside the waterfall" is named in the opening line, grounds all action (Miren stands there, prunes, plants), and supplies the closure site: the crack between flagstones "where the waterfall's mist left bright beads." The mist and parapet grasses participate in beats ("mist breathed a radiant hush," "grasses bowed like congregants"). The waterfall's "patient syllables" anchor the mythic atmosphere and the seam's dual-world nature justifies the planting choice. Setup immediate, development across pruning and child arrival, payoff in the seam planting. Early signal +0.8, two-beat involvement +0.9, causal pressure (the seam's properties dictate planting) +1.1, closure linkage +1.3, specificity +0.6.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Upon the hush of budding hope" appears in the opening and is echoed in "radiant hush" and the valley's dawning memory, but no live clock or deadline tightens decisions. Time is atmospheric ("Today," "At dusk," "all night," "Tomorrow") rather than pressuring. Setup in title phrase, no clear development beat where time narrows options, and payoff is a promise of tomorrow's apple-tasting without urgent constraint. Lyric reprise (hush motif) +0.5, but swappability (could be "spring morning" or "early season") −0.6, no causal pressure, no closure time-constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"To preserve the color of wonder" is stated explicitly ("She had always sought to preserve the color of wonder, because without it the fruit was only sugar and weight") and dramatized through pruning choices (clipping exhaustion, releasing scent, gathering the child's story). Setup by ~25%, development in the pruning and jar-tapping beats (the seed's glow and the child's brightened face embody wonder's return), and payoff in the valley's renewed taste of morning. Friction: the motivation is declared more than it is shown in contradictory impulses. Early signal +0.6, two-beat involvement +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.1, specificity +0.5, cost +0.4, told-more-than-shown friction −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Radiant hush" is named twice (opening "hush of budding hope," "At dusk…the radiant hush settle again") and sustained through lyric compression, soft verbs ("breathed," "whispered," "hummed"), and sensory restraint (mist, grass bowing, water clapping softly). Tone modulates subtly: the child's arrival introduces urgency ("Please…our apples taste tired"), the pruning beats carry focused labor, and the dusk closing returns to stillness with the valley's renewed breath. Setup immediate, coherent through turns, and payoff in the hushed ending image. The tone charges the final line ("the valley would remember to breathe") by holding quiet pressure rather than declarative triumph. Early signal +0.8, coherence across beats +1.2, closure linkage +1.6, modulation under pressure +0.7.</comment>
