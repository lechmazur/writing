<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is specific and embodied—counting heartbeats as both coping mechanism and constraint, the porcelain shard as tactile anchor. Internal contradiction operates throughout: "I came back to fetch wisdom from failure, not to argue with shadows, yet shadows know where the hinges are." The digital ghost conversation feels slightly performed rather than discovered, and the mentor's voice shift arrives without sufficient groundwork, but the final choice to "let the signal fade until only my breath, my pulse, my choosing remain" earns the renunciation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure: the protagonist returns, confronts the ghost-echo, recalibrates the array, and achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Earned Stasis—placing the shard back "not as a wound, but as a lens cut small for carrying." Orientation anchors (opal observatory, snow, radio static, lone protagonist) land by the third paragraph. The closure reweights the opening's "stubborn metronome" counting into "courage to continue anyway" with felt cost: the mistake is not erased but integrated. One meaningful deepening occurs when the ghost shifts from the protagonist's voice to the mentor's, altering the protagonist's understanding of culpability.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The opal dome, frost-webbed eyepiece, spilled ink saucer, and porcelain shard function as micro-setting that constrains choice: the protagonist scrapes frost to see, reads ink patterns to translate machine data, uses the shard as both wound-reminder and working tool. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—"snow settling like fine ash," "ink crawls toward the heat"—and reflects the protagonist's technical and reflective priorities. The observatory's isolation and the array's blindness shape the stakes throughout, and the final image of the gleaming opaline dome charges the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: repair the array and reckon with the failure that scattered the team. Pressure accumulates through the ghost's accusation ("You left the sky disordered"), the protagonist's confession ("I chased a false aurora and saturated the sensors"), and the recalibration sequence that forces confrontation with "regret charted in frequency and fill." The mentor-ghost's reframing—"you merely believed yourself big enough to, and that faith blinded you"—narrows options and the protagonist's final choice to align the dish and let the signal fade is agency expressed as renunciation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the mistake (overexposure that burned the archive), the scattered team, the broken teacup, the counting compulsion. The porcelain shard shifts from symbol of failure to "lens cut small for carrying," and the mentor's line "remember what ghost you refuse to feed" reweights the protagonist's relationship to culpability without moralizing. The closing image—"the courage to continue anyway"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to whether wisdom can be fetched from failure, grounded in the protagonist's choice to stop arguing with echoes and live with what remains.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature: technical detail filtered through regret, heartbeat-counting as rhythmic anchor, and a bias toward interpreting ephemeral patterns. Diction remains consistently lyric-inflected ("milky colors smoldering beneath rime," "midnight solace") without register drift. The digital ghost's dialogue initially mirrors the protagonist's voice then shifts to the mentor's laugh and vowels—a purposeful focalization move that dramatizes the protagonist's projection dissolving. Free indirect handling of the ghost's speech is clean, and the prose modulates under pressure without losing texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high: "They filed my name among the gone, a death certificate error survivor returned to sign for packages and passwords" does character, stakes, and world-building in one sentence. Rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language ("fingernail moon," "rough cartography of regret") is voice-motivated. Minor template cadence in the recalibration sequence ("I recalibrate… then defragment… rethreading") and a faint paraphrase loop between "I came back to fetch wisdom from failure" (twice stated) slightly dull momentum mid-piece. No loops touch the closure unit, and the final lines propel cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of "digital ghost" with observatory failure, ephemeral ink-reading as diagnostic method, and porcelain shard as both wound and tool feels specific and non-obvious. The "death certificate error survivor" frame freshly inflects the return-to-scene-of-failure trope. The mentor's voice arriving through the protagonist's own ghost is a strong turn grounded in prior setup. Risk is evident in the lyric compression and the quiet ending, which trusts image over explanation. The piece commits fully to its premise without hedging or explaining away ambiguity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The "death certificate error survivor" status frames the protagonist's isolation and the fact that "the server kept the echo," enabling the ghost encounter. This identity motivates the return and the choice to let the signal fade at closure, altering tactics twice: initial confrontation with the ghost, then the decision to stop feeding it. Present in setup, middle confrontation, and ending choice.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The porcelain shard appears in three distinct beats: introduced as artifact from the night of failure, used to scrape frost from the eyepiece to see, placed beside the ink saucer to refract light and enable pattern-reading, then returned to the pocket "not as a wound, but as a lens cut small for carrying" at closure. Its meaning is reweighted on the page, it enables a key tactic (clearing the frost), and the final reprise charges the ending with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The digital ghost shapes the central confrontation: it delivers the accusation that the protagonist "left the sky disordered," provides coordinates for recalibration, and shifts from the protagonist's voice to the mentor's, altering the protagonist's understanding. The ghost's existence depends on the archive and the protagonist's error, and the choice to "let the signal fade" at closure directly addresses the ghost, foreclosing that relationship with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Heartbeat-counting recurs in five beats: opening ("stubborn metronome"), during the ghost's accusation ("twenty-one, twenty-two, twenty-three"), pacing the recalibration ("one, two, three, like steps over ice"), and the closing line ("there will still be this counting"). The trait functions as anxiety management and rhythmic anchor, constraining the protagonist's attention under pressure and shaping the ending's tone, though it does not directly alter a tactical choice.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Defragment" is signaled early in the protagonist's request to the ghost ("Show me how to defragment what we broke"), performed on-page ("I recalibrate the receivers, then defragment the storage, rethreading packets"), and enables the resolution of archived data that reveals "stars once thought dead." The action is specific to the technical premise, non-swappable, and causally necessary for the array repair that closes the protagonist's arc.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Ephemeral ink patterns are introduced early ("my odd method, through ephemeral patterns in spilled ink, to translate machine coughs into human breath"), used in the middle recalibration sequence ("I read them like river stones, a sequence I once misread now turning its face"), and the ink's response to the shard's refraction enables pattern-reading. The method is specific, non-swappable, and shapes the protagonist's diagnostic approach across three beats.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The opal observatory provides isolation (enabling the solo confrontation), the dome's frost forces the shard-scraping tactic, the eyepiece and dish are the tools of recalibration, and the snow's muffling hush shapes the "midnight solace" tone. The observatory's array is the site of failure and repair, and the final image of the gleaming dome charges the closure. Setting constrains choices and supplies resources throughout.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"After the radio static clears" recurs as temporal anchor in the opening, middle ("After the radio static clears again, the ghost arrives"), and closing line, framing the narrative as iterative confrontations. The phrase structures the piece's rhythm and suggests ongoing recurrence beyond the page, but does not impose a live ticking clock that narrows options within the single encounter.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The motivation "to fetch wisdom from failure" is stated early, dramatized through the protagonist's confrontation with the ghost and the recalibration work, and tested when the mentor reframes the failure ("you merely believed yourself big enough to"). The protagonist's final choice—to stop aligning to the ghost's angle and let the signal fade—is a renunciation that accepts partial wisdom with visible cost, foreclosing the pursuit of total absolution.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Midnight solace" is established early ("The hour tastes of midnight solace, a quiet so complete it rings") and maintained through the piece's reflective pacing, the mentor's gentle reframing, and the closing image of watching "for a wiser kind of dark." Tone modulates under the ghost's accusation (the protagonist tastes iron, pulse quickens) but returns to solace at closure, charging the final image without flattening into uniform mood.</comment>
