<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Sera's voice is distinct and her motivation (restore the harbor) is clear, but interior contradiction is largely absent—she moves through the labyrinth with poetic confidence rather than embodied struggle. The final choice (leaving the plate, carrying the tether) feels thematic rather than earned by on-page cost that forecloses a path. Embodiment is present ("metal sings against hemp") but emotional states are often asserted through lyric labels ("hauntingly optimistic," "orchid solace") rather than shown through contradictory impulses in scene. The piece tilts toward accumulative/textural mode, where reflection and description dominate over moment-to-moment decision pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story employs an accumulative/textural lens with lyric compression, and the closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis + Charged Poise): Sera opens the sluices, the harbor refills, and the town answers with "small, continual yeses." Cost is implied (she leaves the plate, carries the tether) but not viscerally felt on the page—the final image is more symbolic than causal. Orientation anchors ("I am Sera," "the harbor has thinned," "the labyrinth mouth") arrive early, satisfying the Orientation Test. The escalation is textural (deepening ritual detail) rather than causal narrowing, appropriate to the lens, but the cost legibility is soft: the reader must infer sacrifice rather than see it embodied in a choice that forecloses options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The labyrinth setting is vivid and layered—"rust and thyme," "flood lines tattooed on its teeth," mirror-water basins—and the plate acts as a micro-setting element that charges the final altar moment. Spatial choreography is mostly clear (tether, mooring spire, altar), though the canyon's internal geography occasionally floats. The setting does constrain choice: the chalk map guides moves, the socket accepts the plate, and the sluices open in response to Sera's ritual. The final image (plate at the altar, tether strung on the pier) ties setting to closure, satisfying the 9+ gate for this category.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (restore the harbor) is signaled early, and the escalation follows an accumulative path: Sera moves deeper into the labyrinth, interprets carvings, sews names, and performs a ritual that opens the sluices. One meaningful tightening occurs when she presses the plate into the socket and the chamber opens, narrowing the path forward. However, cost is muted—there is no live trade-off or visible price paid on the page; the resolution feels granted by the labyrinth's acceptance rather than driven by Sera's agency under pressure. Coincidence does not resolve, but the ritual's efficacy is asserted rather than tested.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme (community restoration through attention and shared precedent) emerges organically from the chalk map, name-sewing, and the tether's final communal use. The final image—"small, continual yeses"—offers a resonant answer to the question of how to carve a path from ruin to reverence without stating a moral. The plate and tether function as motifs that constrain choice and charge the closure. Minor slip: "orchid solace" and "hauntingly optimistic" occasionally drift toward label-speak, but the thematic synthesis is strong enough to reach the mid-7s.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The voice is lyric and controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature: "the rope now hums a measured prayer," "small persistence and shy thunder." POV is stable single first-person; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated but mostly consistent with Sera's poetic weaver persona. Minor deduction: under peak stress (entering the labyrinth, opening the chamber), the voice maintains its lyric register without compression or rhythmic shift, which slightly flattens urgency. The prose reads as purposeful compression taught early, satisfying the experimental tolerance, and the final lines recharge prior images ("hauntingly optimistic," "small, continual yeses") without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language is mostly coherent ("anemones tuck in like closed eyes," "nets hang like gray rain"). However, density dips in the middle third with near-paraphrase: "I cannot breathe their absence without doing" followed by "so I sew their names" repeats the same emotional content. Template cadence in the final third: "I am still…still…and the rope now…" stacks parallel constructions without added pressure. Minor register drift: "orchid solace" and "continual yeses" feel slightly elevated for peak beats. No severe loops, but accumulation of these artifacts prevents entry to the 8+ band and disallows 9+ globally per the Patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of sleepwalking chalk routes, labyrinth ritual, and communal tether-naming is specific and non-obvious. The "overlapping paths" method and the storybook plate as ritual key feel fresh, not template-derived. The piece commits fully to its lyric-ritual premise and follows through to a coherent closure. Risk-taking (non-linear backstory layering, lyric compression) heightens thematic stakes without obscuring clarity, earning a small within-band bonus. Transformation test passes: the emotional arc depends on these exact particulars—remove the chalk map or the plate, and the closure logic breaks.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Sera frames the story, carries the tether, sews names, and places the plate at the altar. Her choices (follow the chalk map, sew names, press the plate) drive at least two beats and shape the ending. However, many moves are poetic observation rather than decision under pressure—she reads, interprets, and performs a ritual that succeeds without visible friction. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, but limited causal pressure and swappability (another determined character could follow the same steps) cap the score in the mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The plate is wrapped in sailcloth, threaded into the tether, used to project gulls onto walls, pressed into a socket, and left at the altar—touching at least four beats. It shapes the middle ritual and charges the final image. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.2, causal pressure +0.8 (the socket accepts it, opening the chamber). Deduction for slight swappability: another ritual object could serve similar function with minor edits, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Broken precedents" frames the inciting motivation ("we have lived too long amid broken precedents") and the resolution ("broken precedents had made us lonely; shared precedent remade us brave"). The concept shapes the dominant stake and the thematic reconfiguration at closure. Early signal +0.6, closure linkage +1.4, but middle development is thin—it's echoed more than dramatized in tactical choices, limiting causal pressure. Score lands in the mid-6s for strong setup and payoff with weaker middle integration.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Hauntingly optimistic" is labeled twice ("I am hauntingly optimistic," "I am still…hauntingly optimistic") but never constrains or enables an on-page choice with visible cost. It reads as thematic decoration rather than a trait that alters tactics or final image. Early signal +0.3, closure reprise +0.4, but no beat involvement or causal pressure. Ornamental use −0.8, label-only −0.3. Score trends low-mid band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sewing drives the story: Sera sews the tether from orphaned lines, threads the plate through it, sews names into the tether in the chamber, and the community later uses the tether for teaching. This action appears in at least three beats and defines the method of restoration. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.5, causal pressure +1.2 (the sewing opens the chamber and creates the final communal tool), irreplaceability +0.6. Strong integration across all gates.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The overlapping sleepwalking paths method is explained early ("I overlapped those ghost routes on sailcloth and found their crossings matched the canyon's vanished stair"), guides Sera's entry and navigation, and is invoked at the climax ("the overlapping routes braid into a single clear stride"). Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, causal pressure +0.6 (the method enables access and navigation). Slight swappability: another map or guide could serve similar function, capping the score near 6.0.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The labyrinth is signaled early, supplies the ritual space, constrains Sera's path (chalk map, sockets, altar), and breathes at the end in response to the town's "yeses." Early signal +0.7, three beats (mouth, chamber, altar) +1.4, closure linkage +1.3, causal pressure +1.0 (the labyrinth must "respect" the ritual for success), irreplaceability +0.5. The setting actively shapes tactics and charges the final image, satisfying high-band integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the tide pools empty" frames the inciting moment and recurs in the final paragraph ("When the tide pools empty again, we will return"). The timeframe anchors the opening and ending but does not tighten choices in the middle—Sera's journey feels untimed, with no clock pressure. Early signal +0.5, closure reprise +0.7, but no beat involvement or causal pressure. Lyric reprise elevates slightly, but lack of tactical constraint holds the score in the low-mid band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The motivation "to carve a path from ruin to reverence" is stated early and drives Sera's journey into the labyrinth and the ritual at the altar. It frames the dominant stake and the thematic resolution. Early signal +0.7, closure linkage +1.2, but the desire is declared more than dramatized in conflicted micro-choices—Sera moves with lyric confidence rather than visible friction between wants and costs. Functional integration but limited embodied struggle caps the score in the low-6s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Orchid solace" appears once in peak action ("I recite the tethered names with orchid solace, quiet and luminous as dusk tide returning") and modulates the ritual moment's tone. It is purposeful and voice-consistent but does not modulate across turns or charge the final image beyond this single beat. Single beat +0.4, causal pressure +0.3 (the tone supports the ritual's success), but late first appearance −0.4 and lack of early setup or closure reprise limit the score to mid-5s.</comment>
