<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is densely rendered through embodied perception ("my shadow refused it"), but much of the piece traffics in abstraction—"periodically eternal," "labyrinth of self"—that relies on poetic claim rather than contradictory impulse acting in scene. The final choice to "lower, a grain at a time" and walk rather than fly reads as earned renunciation with visible cost (surrendering flight, erasing the seed), yet the journey feels more like guided meditation than character under pressure making micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. Motivation remains coherent but the stakes feel contemplative rather than urgent, limiting the weight of the closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece establishes pattern early (drop/ripple interval, procedural generation, rain-guided path) and teaches its lyric recursion through the viaduct walk. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the protagonist lowers, lets the tablet erase, and walks without urgency—a renunciation that forecloses flight with visible cost ("erasing the seed I had already harvested," "no urgency to fly"). The orientation is deliberately oblique but coherent by midpoint; causality operates through accumulative reweighting rather than because/therefore linkage. One meaningful deepening occurs when the tablet reveals "my own handwriting" and the message reframes conquest as surrender, which charges the final walk with cost and cadence shift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The viaduct after rain anchors spatially and sensorially ("neon guttering," "wet stone," "cooled wires") and the puddles function as micro-setting: they rearrange to prescribe sequence, constrain the glide, and release "back to chance" at closure. The rain-tablet interaction (water chasing grooves, sanding smooth) is tactile and purposeful. However, the piece leans heavily on atmospheric abstraction ("darkening brightness," "caustic starlight") that creates mood without concrete constraint, and the middle arch moment feels more symbolic postcard than lived spatial pressure. The body and tablet together charge the final image, meeting the 9+ gate criterion, but pervasive lyric vagueness prevents full command.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: conquer the labyrinth of self by charting the suspended instant without breaking it. The piece delivers one meaningful deepening when the tablet reveals the protagonist's own runes and message, reframing conquest as surrender and altering tactics (lowering instead of flying). Cost is visible: erasing the seed, relinquishing flight, accepting the ground. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure coheres through rain-guided sequence, timeline sliding, and shadow refusal, culminating in the choice to lower and walk. Agency is present (following puddles, lowering, erasing the tablet) but the stakes remain abstract and contemplative; no antagonist or external friction sharpens the choice, keeping escalation intellectualized rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—self-conquest through surrender, flight as repetition, trust in absence—emerges from the viaduct walk, tablet runes, and the drop/ripple interval without overt statement. The final image ("no urgency to fly, only the patience to begin where I had avoided ending") offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the labyrinth question, reweighting prior material through the act of lowering and walking. Subtext operates in gesture (shadow refusal, toes kissing stone, erasing the seed) and implication (gravity defier learning when to surrender gravity). The piece resists moralizing and embraces complexity, though the highly lyric register occasionally edges toward abstraction ("subtraction made room") that risks generic universality. One hairline slip: "do not outrun what follows you" reads slightly didactic, but it's framed as carved message rather than authorial intrusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>First-person voice is distinctive and consistent: lyric compression, patterned syntax ("no grander than breath finding a snag"), and philosophical diction ("procedural generation," "caustic starlight") create a singular perceptual signature. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. The narrator's way of noticing is selective and metaphor-laden, fitting the reflective stance. However, the piece strains credibility with phrases like "periodically eternal" and "darkening brightness" that feel more thematic gesture than lived perception, and the elevated register remains unvarying under pressure—no compression or syntactic shift when stakes tighten. Purposeful lyric mode is taught early and held, but the voice risks opacity when poetic vocabulary ("covenant with the ground," "choreographies back to chance") obscures concrete action.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm is controlled and sentence openings vary, supporting the lyric design. Information density is high in key beats (tablet warming, puddles rearranging, shadow returning). However, the piece exhibits pervasive overwriting: nearly every sentence deploys figurative language ("sleeping cicadas," "ferns opening under caustic starlight," "arguments finally out of words") without pattern-teaching payoff, creating a density that obscures rather than propels. Mixed metaphors appear ("puddles were altars," "timelines fanned beneath my feet," "corridor inside me") that shift vehicle mid-image. Register drift into abstraction ("procedural generation," "periodically eternal") clashes with embodied action in peak beats. Paraphrase loops are present: "I did not live forever, but I lived again and again" restates without adding pressure. Applying overwriting density (−0.5), register drift (−0.4), and loop (−0.2) totals significant line-level debt, though the closure image ("rain on my tongue and no urgency to fly") remains clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of gravity defiance, procedural generation, fractured timelines, and the drop/ripple interval as philosophical meditation on self-conquest feels purposeful and non-obvious. The piece commits to its lyric premises and follows implications (shadow refusal, timeline sliding, tablet erasure). The final turn—that conquest means lowering rather than rising—is earned by prior particulars and feels inevitable in hindsight. However, the core frame (mystical journey toward self-understanding via symbolic object and repeated lives) echoes widely used writing templates; transformation arises from the specific viaduct/rain/tablet mechanics and the gravity-defier lens, but the emotional arc (seeker learns to surrender control) remains familiar. Risk-taking in lyric compression and dense metaphor is bold but occasionally obscures rather than heightens, preventing full originality credit.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Setup: introduced obliquely in opening ("gravity defier earns faith"). Development: gliding along puddles, rising "a finger's width," lowering "a grain at a time" constrain middle beats. Payoff: the choice to lower and walk rather than fly charges the closure ("surrender gravity," "no urgency to fly"). The trait drives the central question (when to fly, when to ground) and the final renunciation. However, "gravity defier" functions more as thematic label than embodied constraint with visible tradeoff; the piece tells us the character can hover but doesn't show stamina cost, tool dependence, or external friction that would make the ability irreplaceable. Two gates met (setup, payoff); middle use is abstract. +0.8 early signal, +0.5 causal pressure (lowering choice), +1.2 closure linkage, −0.6 late concrete use, −0.5 ornamental middle. Band: mid-6s for thematic integration with one decisive beat.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setup: introduced early ("clay pressed into my palm"). Development: water chases grooves to make "script of rainlight," runes warm "like coals under ash," protagonist recognizes own handwriting, message reframes task. Payoff: tablet pressed to wet rail and rain sands it smooth, erasing the seed. Three gates met. The tablet drives two distinct beats (revelation of runes, erasure) and participates causally in closure by being destroyed with cost. Specificity is high (ancient, runes, procedural seed). +0.6 early signal, +0.9 two beats, +1.2 causal pressure (generates path, then erased), +1.4 closure linkage, +0.6 specificity, +0.4 cost connection (erasure). No major frictions. Band: high-7s for essential multi-beat use with closure participation and visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setup: "fractured timelines fanned beneath my feet" appears early. Development: timelines slide and rearrange ("some darkening brightness collapsing into others"), branches show falling and refused room, tuning occurs via stepping. Payoff: "timelines stopped sliding" when protagonist lowers. Three gates met. The concept shapes middle imagery and is named at closure, but its mechanics remain abstract—what makes timelines fracture, how does stepping tune them, what cost attends alignment? The piece uses "fractured timelines" as atmospheric claim rather than tactical constraint; the protagonist's choices don't hinge on timeline-specific rules. +0.5 early signal, +0.4 one beat (tuning), +0.5 closure mention, −0.7 ornamental (description without action pressure), −0.5 swappable (could be "parallel paths" with minor edits). Band: mid-5s for present but mechanically vague.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Setup: "periodically eternal, a loop that ends on the hour and starts on the echo" appears mid-first-third. Development: used to explain retracing ("I lived again and again in the same suspended instant") but not dramatized as constraint in middle beats—no on-page moment where the loop resets, interrupts, or costs the protagonist an option. Payoff: "instant loosened, and time resumed" mentions the trait's end but doesn't show how it shaped the walk. One gate met (setup); missing middle development and concrete closure participation. The trait functions as poetic label rather than embodied mechanic. +0.5 early signal, −0.8 ornamental (no action pressure), −0.6 summary-only (told, not shown), −0.5 swappable. Cap 4.6 for missing middle development. Band: low-4s for label without dramatized cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setup: "I had come to retrace what I kept losing" appears early. Development: the entire viaduct walk enacts retracing (following puddles, recognizing own runes, revisiting the instant); the action drives middle beats and the protagonist's tactics. Payoff: "begin where I had avoided ending" at closure reweights retracing as forward motion. Three gates met. The action is causally central and irreplaceable—removing "retrace" would collapse the structure. +0.7 early signal, +1.4 three beats (arrival, recognition, walk), +1.3 causal pressure (shapes tactics), +1.2 closure linkage, +0.6 specificity. No major frictions. Band: high-7s for essential multi-beat integration driving closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Setup: "procedural generation, using inputs I did not own" appears early. Development: "Every step unfurled from a seed the rain buried in the tablet, branching possibilities" and "generated pattern" describe the method, but the mechanics remain abstract—what inputs, how does the seed function, how does stepping differ from not-stepping under procedural logic? Payoff: "erasing the seed I had already harvested" at closure. Two gates met (setup, payoff). The method is named and thematically present but not enacted with visible constraint; the protagonist follows puddles, but any guidance metaphor could replace "procedural generation." +0.6 early signal, +0.8 closure linkage, −0.7 ornamental (description without action pressure), −0.6 swappable. Band: low-4s for present but mechanically inert.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setup: "glowing viaduct after rain" introduced early. Development: puddles rearrange to prescribe sequence, neon gutters, arches provide spatial structure, middle arch is destination, wet rail receives tablet at end. Payoff: viaduct hums and protagonist walks "counting arches" at closure. Three gates met. The setting supplies resources (puddles, arches, rail) that alter tactics and charges the final walk. Specificity is high (post-rain, glowing, arches, wet rail). +0.7 early signal, +1.1 two beats (puddle sequence, middle arch), +1.3 causal pressure (guides path), +1.3 closure linkage (walk, rail, arches), +0.7 specificity. No major frictions. Band: low-8s for essential multi-beat use driving tactics and closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setup: "between the drop and the ripple" introduced in opening line. Development: the interval frames the protagonist's detachment and the suspended instant ("hourglass sliver"), and lowering occurs within that window. Payoff: "instant loosened, and time resumed" at closure. Three gates met. The timeframe is poetic and specific, shaping the protagonist's stance and charging the final release. However, it functions more as lyric frame than tactical clock—no moment where the interval threatens to close or costs the protagonist an option. +0.7 early signal, +0.6 one beat (lowering within interval), +0.9 closure linkage, +0.5 specificity, −0.4 ornamental middle (present but not pressuring). Band: mid-6s for lyric reprise with closure charge but limited tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Setup: "to conquer the labyrinth of self" appears early. Development: the desire drives the viaduct walk, tablet consultation, and retracing; the message reframes conquest as not outrunning, and lowering becomes the tactic. Payoff: "corridor inside me that no longer insisted on ladders or wings" and "begin where I had avoided ending" resolve the motivation with visible cost (relinquishing flight). Three gates met. The motivation is causally central and shapes the final choice. However, "labyrinth of self" remains abstract—what specific fear or need does the protagonist conquer? The piece tells the desire but doesn't dramatize competing wants (fly vs. ground) until the final beat. +0.7 early signal, +0.9 two beats (message, lowering), +1.1 causal pressure, +1.2 closure linkage, −0.5 ornamental middle (told more than dramatized). Band: mid-6s for thematic integration with decisive closure beat but limited friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Setup: "low, darkening brightness" introduced early, recurring as "darkening brightness" in multiple beats. Development: tone modulates through "cooled wires," "caustic starlight," "warnings from futures," "darkness brightened without glare," maintaining coherent oxymoronic tension. Payoff: "darkening brightness that taught me to read by absence" charges the final image. Three gates met. The tone is specific, purposeful, and pervasive, shaping perception and final realization. It functions as more than mood—teaching "by absence" reweights the protagonist's stance. +0.8 early signal, +1.2 two beats (recurring imagery), +0.9 causal pressure (shapes perception), +1.5 closure linkage (teaches by absence), +0.7 specificity. Band: high-7s for pervasive tonal coherence that charges closure image with thematic weight.</comment>
