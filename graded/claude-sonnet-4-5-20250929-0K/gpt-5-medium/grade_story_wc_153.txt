<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is specific and voice-consistent, with embodied emotion ("fierce tenderness cracking my ribs like kindling"). However, the motivation to "find the moment before deciding" remains abstract; no on-page micro-choice demonstrates contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The wound that "heals in moonlight and reopens at dawn" is poetic but never constrains a present action with visible cost. The final choice to "share the hinge and let it breathe us" is earned thematically but lacks a decisive forfeiture or on-page alteration of tactics.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates pressure through interleaved reflection and present sensory anchor (skiff, lantern, shard, spirits' voices), deepening the narrator's stance from evasion to accountability. Orientation anchors arrive by the first paragraph (mangrove labyrinth, skiff, spirits). Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the narrator commits to "share the hinge and let it breathe us," reweighting the dominant stake (apology and relational repair) with felt cost—acknowledging shame and the risk of vulnerability. The cost is conceptual and relational, legible in "let silence not be armor" and the decision to speak the unsent letters aloud to the grove, then carry that act home. One meaningful deepening occurs when the narrator moves from seeking reversal to accepting "healing is not reversal, only a readable surface where new sentences can risk arriving."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The mangrove setting, blackwater mirror, lantern fog, and condensation messages are vivid and POV-filtered, creating atmosphere. The shard functions as a recurring object that charges the final image ("let the shard's edge lie quiet upon my skin"). However, the environment does not constrain a present choice—navigation is symbolic, not spatial. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, but the micro-setting (body, tool) needed to reach 9+ is present without forcing a tactical trade-off on the page.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: the narrator seeks to witness the moment before the failed apology and carry that honesty back to Mara. Pressure accumulates through reflection and the spirits' counsel, culminating in the vow to "practice on water, answering ripples with stillness." One meaningful deepening occurs when the narrator shifts from wanting to "change" the past to wanting to "witness honestly." Agency is present but oblique—the narrator's choices are internal and preparatory rather than a decision that forecloses a live option with immediate visible cost. The escalation fits the Accumulative lens but lacks a sharp on-page trade-off at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the interplay of the shard, the unsent letters, and the hinge metaphor: repair requires vulnerability, not reversal. The piece resists tidy resolution; the narrator returns home "and not decide, not yet," embracing process over outcome. The final image—"I will share the hinge and let it breathe us"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and implication throughout. The shard and wound recur with shifting meaning, charging the closure without forced motif.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and lyric, with controlled metaphor and rhythmic density ("throats full of unsent letters clearing themselves without ever breaking"). POV remains stable in first person; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated but consistent with the meditative, symbolic register established early. However, sustained figurative density across most sentences risks overwriting in a high-pressure piece; here the lyric mode is taught and the closure remains legible, so no penalty under the experimental add-on. Filter verbs ("I think," "I understand") appear but fit the reflective stance. Distance and focalization are clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense and occasionally risks mixed metaphor ("the hinge sighed shut" pairs oddly with "the cathedral gave us its tooth"). Paraphrase loops appear: "I was only saving my fear" closely restates prior confession without added pressure. Template cadence in the middle third ("I ask… / They cannot… / So I practice…") flattens momentum briefly. Clarity holds, and the final image is clean, but pervasive metaphor in peak beats triggers −0.5 under the overwriting check. Information density is high; rhythm supports the meditative pace.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The premise—using a physical journey through a spirit-inhabited mangrove to confront a relational failure—synthesizes lyric meditation and symbolic quest in a specific, non-obvious way. The shard, condensation messages, and wound that tracks lunar cycles feel inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in structure (accumulative, reflection-heavy) heightens thematic stakes without obscuring clarity. However, the "spirit guide" frame and metaphor-laden apology journey echo familiar templates; transformation arises from voice and specificity rather than a wholly fresh angle.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The cryptic medium frames the narrator's identity and justifies the symbolic journey. The role shapes one key beat: seeking the spirits' counsel and receiving the directive "let your wanting be small enough to hear her wanting." However, the cryptic medium trait does not constrain on-page choices with visible cost; it remains a label for the narrator's reflective stance. Present across all three gates (setup, middle, closure), but causal pressure is limited.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The gargoyle's rainspout shard is handled in multiple beats: carried as pendant, dangled as plumbline, held to lantern, and finally lies quiet on skin at closure. It anchors the cathedral memory, tracks the wound, and returns in the final image reweighted as a tool for practice ("let the shard's edge lie quiet"). Early signal, beat involvement (three touches), and closure linkage are strong. However, the shard does not narrow options or impose a visible cost in action; its role is symbolic charge rather than tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Unsent letters frame the central stake: the narrator failed to speak and now seeks to repair that silence. The concept shapes two beats—remembering drafts "sleeping like minnows" and vowing to "speak them, here, then carry the speaking as proof of breath"—and directly informs closure ("I will share the hinge"). Early signal, middle involvement, closure participation all present. However, the letters are not handled or written on the page; the element remains thematic rather than tactile or causal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The wound that "heals in moonlight and reopens at dawn" is mentioned three times but never constrains or enables an on-page action with cost. At closure, "my wound closes by degrees, a small white door learning how to stay open," but this is metaphorical summary, not a choice-altering event. The attribute is poetic but ornamental; swappable with any cyclical marker of unresolved pain.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The action "evoke" drives the spirits' role: they "sing to evoke each glimmering phrase," and the narrator asks them to "evoke" the past hour. The spirits' counsel triggers one major beat—"they teach my hands to stop leaving before they answer"—which shapes the narrator's closure stance. Early signal, middle involvement, closure participation all present. However, the mechanics of evocation remain abstract; the action does not impose a visible constraint or tactical cost on the page.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Messages in condensation on windows appear in three beats: fog writes "slow, patient syllables," threads a sentence of counsel ("let your wanting be small enough"), and droplet words "fracture into a halo of near-answers." Early signal, middle involvement, and closure participation are present. However, the method is passive—the narrator reads rather than acts—and the messages do not narrow options or impose a visible cost. The mechanics matter thematically but not tactically.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The mangrove labyrinth inhabited by singing spirits frames the entire journey and supplies the spirits' counsel, which shapes the narrator's stance at closure. Early signal, middle pressure (spirits ask what the narrator seeks), and closure participation (spirits teach the narrator's hands) are present. However, the setting does not impose spatial constraints or tactical trade-offs; navigation is symbolic rather than a puzzle that alters choices. The spirits' role is advisory, not obstructive.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The timeframe "in the space where an apology waits unspoken" is named explicitly and frames the narrator's entire quest. It appears in setup, motivates the middle reflection, and charges the closure decision to "share the hinge and let it breathe us." However, the timeframe is conceptual rather than a live clock; no ticking pressure or deadline forces a choice within the on-page window. The element is thematic scaffolding, not a tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The motivation to "find the moment before deciding" is stated early, drives the narrator's inquiry to the spirits, and evolves at closure into the vow to "not decide, not yet" but instead "share the hinge." The desire is dramatized in two beats: seeking the spirits' counsel and practicing stillness on water. However, the motivation remains abstract; no on-page friction between competing wants with visible cost. The evolution is thematic rather than a decision under duress.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Fierce tenderness is named three times and woven throughout: "fierce tenderness cracking my ribs like kindling," "fierce tenderness threading every note," and the narrator's shame over "tenderness hoarded." The tone modulates from self-accusation to tentative hope, coherent across turns and charged at the final image ("small white door learning how to stay open"). The phrase risks becoming a label, but embodied instances (ribs cracking, roots learning forgiveness) ground it. Tone supports the closure effect without stating a moral.</comment>
