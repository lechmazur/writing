<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is concrete and voice-particular ("disbelief is not an exit but a question with chairs"), with embodied emotion ("my hand wrote it confidently") and contradictory impulses (skeptic who remains, offers tea). The motivation to "sculpt space for reflection without surrendering reason" drives micro-choices under pressure. Internal conflict is somewhat dramatized in the tile scene, though the final shift toward belief feels slightly under-earned in causal terms. Lio functions as secondary pressure but his arc is light; the relationship crucible could be sharper.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Orientation anchors (stargazer's tower, whale migration, narrator as auditor) are clear early. The piece accumulates density through journals, magic square, whale spirals, and Lio's shell until the "room" materializes as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—two chairs set, griefs exchange coats, gravity shares its center. Cost is felt (narrator names losses, professional clean-hands posture softens) and the final image reweights "skeptic with mercy" as Earned Stasis with visible cost. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length; closure lands cleanly under the lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The tower is vivid ("stone rib cage facing constellations"), micro-setting details (parapet, transit scope, roof's horizon) constrain choices (laying the tile under the scope, aligning corners to the whale road). Whale migration functions as temporal and atmospheric pressure; the breaching pod at midnight aligns with the magic square columns, charging the closure image. Sensory hierarchy is selective (spume, starlight, tiny salts). The "room" that opens is abstract but purposeful, serving as metaphorical setting that enables the final beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: whether entangled memories can be made coherent, whether the tower "keeps her voice." The narrator's agency is decision and endurance (offers tea, transcribes, sits at the chair to "test the room"), with the cost being professional distance surrendered ("I rarely do because my job prefers clean hands"). Escalation is modest—one meaningful deepening when the protagonist names losses and griefs exchange coats—but pressure accumulates through the tile mechanics and Lio's question. Coincidence (whale breach timing) complicates but the protagonist's transcription and seated choice drive the turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: listening as friction that warms frozen passageways, patterns coupling distant shores, discipline as the unheard symphony becoming "music enough to steer by." The magic square tile shifts from skeptical curiosity to functional metaphor without overt statement. The final image (door open, skeptic with mercy, tending the unheard symphony) offers a resonant answer to whether sorrow can listen to sorrow. Earned wisdom arises from the transcription and shared chair moment. No thematic echo or moralizing; the ending reweights "courageously kind" as lived stance rather than label.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and lyric ("the sea inhaled and exhaled," "griefs written sideways," "question with chairs"), with controlled metaphoric density that modulates under pressure. POV is stable first-person; perceptual signature is selective (notices ink, spirals, sums) and character-specific. Dialogue with Lio is minimal but purposeful ("I do not traffic in ghosts," the nickname whisper). Free indirect ease when transcribing. Some elevated diction ("entangled memories, not as mysticism but as the way currents couple distant shores") borders on essayistic but remains voice-motivated. No head-hopping; psychic distance shifts intentionally.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high (each line advances character, atmosphere, or concept). Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("stone rib cage," "whales rose, leaving spirals of air," "entangled memories"). Minor overwriting in peak beats: "the sums on the tile cooled into balance" and "the walls hummed like patient lungs" stack metaphor. A few template-adjacent stems ("I told him... then offered," "Lio asked... and I said") in quick succession. No paraphrase loops or major scaffold; proofreading is clean. The density occasionally obscures immediate causality but not fatally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of stargazing tower, whale migration, magic square tile, and transcription as grief-work is specific and non-obvious. The "unheard symphony" and "room" imagery feel earned rather than imposed. The narrator's position as "sympathetic skeptic" with "mercy" offers a fresh angle on epistemic humility. Emotional truth (naming losses, griefs exchanging coats) anchors the lyric frame. Some philosophical phrasing ("disbelief is not an exit but a question with chairs") risks abstraction but the particulars (tea, blankets, shell, ink) ground it. The ending commits to its premise without retreat.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The "sympathetic skeptic" is present throughout (first paragraph motivation, refusal to "traffic in ghosts," final "skeptic with mercy"). The character makes key choices: offers tea/blankets, transcribes, lays the tile under the scope, sits at the chair to "test the room," names losses. The final turn—keeping the door open, tending the archive—traces directly to the skeptic's earned shift. Early signal, beat involvement (journal transcription, tile alignment, room test), and closure participation are strong. The shift from "I did not believe" to belief-adjacent action is slightly soft causally, preventing higher score.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The magic square tile appears early (parapet, inherited from Ana), is handled in multiple beats (laid under transit scope, corners aligned, shell placed in center, sums close at midnight breach), and its mechanics matter (numbers "breathe," sums steady the pen, "making discipline"). It shapes the transcription and the room's opening. Closure linkage is present but indirect: the tile's sums "cool into balance" as the whales turn, but the final image pivots to the narrator's stance rather than the tile itself. Specificity (inlaid numbers, Ana's claim, arithmetic witness) is high. Causal pressure evident; near-indispensable to the method.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Entangled memories" is signaled early (Ana's claim, not to erase but to let sorrows listen), shapes the transcription stakes (Lio's mother's voice, narrator's losses), and the room scene dramatizes it (griefs exchange coats, friction warms passageways). The concept constrains tactics (following integers, drawing geometries, naming losses) and participates in closure (the room exists because patterns overlap). Swappability is low; removal would break the method. Slightly abstract at moments but on-page work (transcription, shared chair) grounds it. Strong beat involvement and closure presence.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Courageously kind" is stated early ("I have always tried to be courageously kind") and demonstrated in visible actions with cost: offers tea/blankets to Lio, transcribes rather than dismisses, sits at the chair despite skepticism, names own losses (surrendering "clean hands" professional distance). The trait constrains the choice to remain ("disbelief is not an exit") and enables the closure stance ("skeptic with mercy"). Label-only risk is mitigated by enacted choices. The final paragraph restates it without fresh pressure, limiting top score. Causal link to key beats is moderate; closure echo is present but slightly redundant.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Transcribe" is the protagonist's job and motor action: transcribes journals, draws geometries under the tile, writes the mother's nickname ("my hand wrote it confidently"), draws the whales' arc. The action shapes multiple beats (pattern discovery, shell spiral, whale breach alignment, room opening). The narrator's role as transcriber defines the method and stakes. Closure turn (keeping the tower's door open to "transcribe" more journals) traces directly to this action. Irreplaceable; the profession and mechanics are specific. Strong causal pressure and beat involvement; closure participation is solid though slightly backgrounded in the final image.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Through forgotten patterns" is signaled early (patterns in journals, tidal scratches, ink drawings), developed in the middle (path tugged by numbers, following integers like footprints, whale arc aligning with magic square columns), and shapes the room's opening (sums closed, door waited years). The method is specific (magic square sums, geometries drawn by wind/spume/starlight) and non-swappable. The closure effect (room opens, sums cool into balance) depends on the pattern convergence. Mechanics matter and are dramatized, not merely claimed. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage; the final image ("unheard symphony") echoes the method without restating it mechanically.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The "stargazer's open tower" is anchored early (stone rib cage, parapet, curious archive, roof's horizon) and constrains choices (climbing stairs, laying tile under transit scope, offering the roof's view to Lio). The tower's archive defines the narrator's job and the town's relationship. The setting provides resources (journals, tile, transit scope) that affect tactics and outcome. The "room" that opens is metaphorical but tethered to the tower's function (space for reflection). Micro-setting (parapet, stairs) alters access and shapes beats. Closure participation is moderate; the final image emphasizes the narrator's role more than the location, but the tower's continuity (keeping the door open) is present.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"During whale migration" anchors time early (distant flukes, patient metronomes) and recurs in key beats (whales rose leaving spirals, pod breached at midnight, whales turned north at dawn). The timeframe supplies atmospheric pressure and the midnight breach aligns with the magic square closure, charging that moment. The migration functions as a deadline softly (whales leaving = season ending) but does not tighten tactics sharply. Swappability is moderate; another seasonal marker could serve similarly. Closure linkage is present (dawn, whales turn north as Lio leaves shell) but not indispensable. Lyric resonance is solid; causal tightening is light.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"To sculpt space for reflection without surrendering reason" is stated early and drives the narrator's choices: remains in the tower despite disbelief, offers tea and horizon to Lio, lays the tile to test it, sits at the chair, keeps the door open at the end. The motivation is dramatized through friction (skeptic versus mercy, clean hands versus naming losses). The room that opens is the literal answer to the motivation, and the final stance (tending the unheard symphony) fulfills it with cost (professional distance softened). Strong beat involvement and closure participation; the desire is coherent and conflicted.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>"Unheard symphony" appears early ("like an unheard symphony rehearsing in another room"), is developed ("discipline is how the unheard symphony becomes music enough to steer by"), and charges the final image ("tending the unheard symphony"). Tone is lyric, patient, and accumulative throughout; it modulates subtly under pressure (the room's hum, the walls' patience) without breaking. The metaphor threads through key beats and reweights the closure stance. Coherence is strong; the tone does not flatten or clash. Slightly abstract but purposeful; the recurring image is irreplaceable to the thematic resonance.</comment>
