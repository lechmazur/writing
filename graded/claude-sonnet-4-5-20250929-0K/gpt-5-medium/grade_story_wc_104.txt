<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's "chained liberator" identity and patient strategic approach come through consistently, but her interiority remains abstract and label-driven rather than embodied. The phrase "staggering grace" recurs as description rather than showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Her motivations are declared ("She came to plant resilience") but the cost of her choices—the weight of the vow—is asserted more than dramatized through micro-decisions that reveal hierarchy of values. The chain functions more as metaphorical marker than constraint that genuinely shapes her tactics under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (Mara, carnival prize center, wall demolition) arrive early and remain stable. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through lyric repetition and image layering, with a cadence shift at closure when Mara distributes seeds and the metaphor crystallizes. The closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—her carrying seeds forward with "chained liberator" identity intact reweights the opening dust image with visible cost (she remains bound, on the move, work unfinished). One meaningful deepening occurs when she descends to the vault and the abstract mission becomes tactile parcels, altering her immediate task and the story's texture.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The carnival prize center supplies concrete objects (piano bench, ticket conveyor, plush avalanche) that enable and constrain Mara's tactics; the setting is functional rather than ornamental. Spatial choreography remains clear through the descent and return. The seed vault's "rain held in jars" scent and the "dry hills...cracked like lips" create a sensory through-line that charges the ending when children will "trace maps along the fissures." Micro-setting (chain, keys, arrow) recurs and the final image links soil texture to the opening dust, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that setting constrains choice or charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (retrieve seeds to plant resilience) is signaled early and pursued with one meaningful tightening when enforcers appear and Mara jams the conveyor, forcing her to accelerate under pressure. The scavenger-enforcer obstacle provides external escalation, and Mara's patient sorting of keys under time pressure shows agency. However, the enforcers are dispatched easily (plush avalanche), reducing the felt cost of the confrontation. The ending crystallizes her ongoing mission with visible tactical choices (chain-sling, seed distribution), but the cost reads more conceptual (endless labor) than a trade-off that forecloses a live option on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of resilience as patient labor emerges organically from Mara's actions and the seed/dust imagery; no overt thesis statement appears. The final image—"palms lined with seed dust, a patient strategy moving like weather"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the implicit question of how hope persists after collapse, reweighting the opening "dust the color of old tickets" with undeniable pressure. Recurring motifs (chain, keys, dust-to-seed, staggering grace) accumulate rather than mechanically repeat. The piece resists tidy resolution: Mara's labor continues, success uncertain, moral complexity intact (she steals, impedes enforcers, but for communal survival).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and tightly bound to Mara's perceptions. Lyric compression and elevated diction ("iron links ghosting her wrist," "counterfeit crowns") are pattern-taught early and sustained without head-hopping. No dialogue appears; perceptual signature is consistent (strategic observation, tactile focus on objects, metaphors drawn from weather and growth). The heightened register matches the mythic-present tone; diction never drops into mundane or diagnostic language. Purposeful elision (how she learned of the vault, her backstory) does not withhold facts she knows in the moment; the narrative stance commits fully to lyric accumulation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully with lyric parallelism ("She is patiently strategic," "She is a liberator," "She will reach it") that coheres as voice rather than artifact. Information density is high: most lines advance setting, action, or image. Minor loop detected: "staggering grace" appears three times with near-identical phrasing, and "She is..." stem recurs without sufficient variation in the opening third, creating template cadence that slightly dulls momentum. No mixed metaphors or clarity breaks. The piece leans heavily on figurative language (almost every sentence carries metaphor or elevated image), which risks overwriting but remains legible and voice-consistent throughout. Penalty capped at −0.4 for non-closure loops per the accumulation rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of post-collapse resistance, seed-vault retrieval, and carnival setting offers a fresh angle; the piano-bench key puzzle and arrow-as-tool avoid generic tropes. "Chained liberator" paradox and the patient, iterative nature of Mara's mission (planting as ongoing rather than completed heroism) provide emotional specificity. The lyric-present frame and accumulative structure take purposeful risk that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. However, the "teaching children to press seed packets to their hearts" moment edges toward sentimental convenience, and the enforcers function as stock obstacles. The core premise transforms familiar elements (archive quest, scavenger dystopia) through specific world detail (carnival, ticket conveyor, drought-bred varietals) and sustained lyric voice.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara as "chained liberator" appears in the opening paragraphs, drives the vault descent choice, and recurs in the closing lines ("chained liberator, pockets rusted with keys"). Her decisions (enter carnival, decode keys, jam conveyor, descend, sort seeds, distribute them) create every major beat. The chain itself is handled and knotted as a sling, constraining and enabling her actions. All three gates met with causal pressure and closure linkage; the character is indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Arrow with strange fletching is found in the piano bench alongside keys, notched into the ticket conveyor gears to jam the enforcers' path, and noted again as "a compass she will return for when there is time to aim." Setup and middle-development gates met; it enables one key beat (impeding pursuit). However, it does not appear in or shape the ending, and the "compass" future use is declared rather than dramatized. Two beats with causal pressure but no closure participation caps the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clandestine seed vault is signaled via "old rumors" early, drives Mara's entire mission, furnishes the trapdoor/descent beat, and directly shapes the ending when she distributes packets and plans planting with children. All three gates met. The vault's contents (drought-bred varietals) supply specific tactical choices and the conceptual heart of the closure image. Removing the vault would collapse the story's logic and stakes entirely.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Patiently strategic" is declared in line 6, demonstrated when Mara times steps to demolition rhythm, sorts keys twice under pressure, and weaves between cases during pursuit. The trait constrains her approach (no rushed action) and the cost is implied (time spent sorting while enforcers close in). Setup and development gates met, with tactical influence. However, the cost is not sharply legible on the page as a visible trade-off, and the trait could be replaced by "careful" or "methodical" without major structural change. Mid-band for functional integration without indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Impede" drives the middle beat when Mara jams the conveyor with the arrow, forcing enforcers to stall and giving her time to finish decoding. The plush avalanche also impedes pursuit. Early middle presence, causal pressure on two beats. The action shapes tactics but does not appear in the ending; the closure centers on distribution and ongoing labor rather than obstruction. Two gates (setup implicit in mission framing, development strong) with clear causal work, but no closure participation limits the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Method "by decoding the arrangement of keys left in a piano bench" is signaled when Mara opens the bench, demonstrated when she sorts keys "by size and rust, hears intervals in their teeth," and pays off when "A pattern emerges: three long, two short, a rest; the bench bottom slides, revealing a trapdoor." All three gates met. The method shapes one key beat (vault access) and the melody "hums in her bones as spacing guides" at the end, offering lyric closure linkage. However, the mechanics remain abstract ("hears intervals") rather than tactile, and the method could be replaced by another puzzle without major change. Functional across beats with lyric reprise, but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Abandoned carnival prize redemption center is anchored in the opening, furnishes the piano bench / ticket conveyor / plush objects that enable Mara's tactics, and provides cover via "glass cases where porcelain fish still grin." Setup, development, and implicit closure participation (she slips out through the carnival frame into the citizen crowd). The setting supplies resources and constraints across multiple beats; removing it would require wholesale rewrite of tactics and tone. Strong integration just shy of indispensable due to the ending's shift to outskirts hills, which could theoretically begin elsewhere.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"When the wall comes down" opens the story, recurs ("Outside, the wall comes down with a roar," "Above, stone keeps falling"), and provides the noise that "veils her" and grants "the cover it needs." Setup, development (demolition as tactical clock), and closure presence ("Behind them, the wall collapses into relic"). The timeframe tightens decisions by creating urgency and sensory cover. All three gates met with causal pressure. The wall's collapse bookends the action and charges the before/after image at closure, approaching indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation "to plant resilience in dry soil" is declared early ("She came to plant resilience in dry soil"), drives every choice (vault retrieval, seed sorting, distribution), and crystallizes in the ending when she places seeds in elders' and children's hands and pictures "dry hills taking these seeds like stories." All three gates met with strong causal pressure and closure participation. The desire is dramatized through tactile actions (sorting, knotting chain, teaching children) with visible cost (ongoing labor, enforcers, exile to outskirts). Friction between want (immediate planting) and cost (patient strategy, evasion) is present but could be sharper. Near-indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Staggering grace" is introduced early ("slips inside with the staggering grace of someone who has practiced falling and rising"), recurs at the demolition beat ("she moves with that staggering grace, each step a decision"), and closes the piece ("Every step staggers and settles, grace not as polish but as fidelity"). The tone modulates from opening lyricism through tactical urgency (enforcers) to quiet resolve at closure. Coherent across turns with purposeful cadence shift. The final image charges the phrase with conceptual weight (grace as fidelity under duress). All three gates met; tone shapes voice and ending but could be rewritten with another tonal throughline without breaking logic.</comment>
