<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The translator's motivation is concrete and embodied through the coral fragment and cast-reading; the shrewdly innocent boy's dual-labeled boats crystallize the conflict. The mother's struggle with the Reka word for shelter and the uncle's arrival create genuine pressure. However, the translator remains more conduit than agent—observations dominate over difficult choices that foreclose paths. The boy's waking grin is charming but the translator's arc lacks a visible cost or renunciation that would push this higher.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accretes meaning through the cast's smudged notes, coral grooves, and shared anxieties, then reweights them in the mother's repetition of the Reka word and the uncle's nod. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3 (translator, atrium, boy wheeled away). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the rain-treaty moment and coral-as-gift reconfigure the conflict without explicit resolution, and the cost is felt in the mother reaching for the uncle's sleeve. The final image of the translator leaving "my hand ungloved so the coral's memory keeps speaking" charges prior material. One meaningful deepening occurs when the boy's boats are read by both families, tightening the shared stake.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium grounds action throughout; the coral fragment functions as micro-setting, recurring in hand and later placed at bedside. The cast itself becomes setting-as-archive, constraining the translator's method. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "rain ticking like type," "kestrels coil into sleep like commas." The hospital palms and monitors provide spatial coherence. The coral's grooves guide the translator's pauses and charge the final image, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that setting constrain choice or charge closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: brokering peace between the mother and uncle through the boy's cast. The translator's task is clear from line 5, and pressure tightens when both adults arrive separately. However, escalation is muted—no resistance or reversal tests the translator's approach; the surgeon's good news and the mother's gesture feel earned but not hard-won. Agency is mostly observation and interpretation; the act of "stitching a small script" and offering the coral are choices, but they lack visible friction or a moment where the translator must forfeit something. The cost is implied in the rain-treaty's fragility, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—healing through shared vulnerability—emerges organically from the boy's boats labeled "Also Us" and the cast's blurred ink. The coral fragment shifts from war relic to "lighthouse-sized gift," a non-literal answer to the question of peace. The translator's line "we unknot weather in other people's chests" avoids sermonizing by being filtered through the boy's comprehension. The final image of leaving the hand ungloved lets the coral's memory speak, offering resonance without a stated moral. No thematic echo or prompt-label intrusion; subtext operates cleanly in gesture and object.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>First-person present tense sustains a meditative, lyric register; diction is controlled and specific ("lotus-hearted ache," "pelagic syllables"). Psychic distance remains stable; the translator's perceptual signature—reading grooves, testing translations under breath—is consistent. Compression is purposeful ("deep as a tidepool") and taught by the opening's rhythm. No head-hopping. Minor dip: the boy's dialogue ("what translators do") and the translator's reply feel slightly expository, and "shrewdly innocent" is told rather than shown in action, but voice remains distinct throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information density is high; nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or stakes. Rhythm varies naturally, and figurative language is vivid without stacking ("kestrels coil into sleep like commas"). However, several lines verge on overwriting: "a lotus-hearted ache that is somehow bearable" elevates diction without clear POV motivation, and "war-bell dulls to a gong of rain" mixes metaphors. The opening's mist/coral/vents breath is strong, but mid-story the prose occasionally prioritizes texture over propulsion. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; grammar is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise—translator as peace-broker via a child's cast—is fresh and specific, avoiding stock reconciliation plots. The coral fragment as tactile dictionary and the boy's dual-labeled boats offer non-obvious synthesis. The choice to frame closure as "fog lower like a treaty we can read only by touch" resists tidy resolution. Risk: the lyric density and reflection-heavy mode could alienate, but the piece commits fully and the ending's resonance feels earned. Slight penalty for the "lotus-hearted ache" line, which reads as aesthetic ornament rather than lived detail.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The translator appears in every beat, frames the coral and cast work, and delivers the ending's gesture. However, most action is interpretive—reading, testing translations—rather than decision that narrows options. The choice to offer the coral at bedside is a turn, but it arrives late and feels confirmatory rather than costly. Present across setup, middle interpretation, and closure; causal role is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The brain coral fragment is introduced in line 1, traced for patrol routes in line 7, turned in hand as punctuation in line 27, offered to the bedside in line 31, and recalled in the final line. It constrains the translator's method (grooves hold pauses) and charges the closure image. Three distinct beats plus closure linkage; high specificity and irreplaceability. Cost connection is implied (memory-sized artifact from a cratered lagoon). Strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Shared anxieties are the story's engine: "hunger stitched between two signatures," the cast as map of shared anxieties, and the translator's line "their shared anxieties are not signs of weakness, but of weather sensed in common." The concept shapes the translator's method and the families' gradual trust. It drives two beats (cast-reading, waiting-room script) and underpins closure when the room "unclenches." Solid causal role; cost is the vulnerability required to admit shared fear.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Shrewdly innocent" is attributed to the boy in line 8 and recalled in line 34 ("that shrewdly innocent grin"). However, the trait is told rather than demonstrated in action—his smile when rain smudged ink and his question about translators are charming but don't show strategic naivety constraining a choice. Label-only use; no visible tradeoff. Present in setup and closure reprise, but functional role is weak.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Unknot" appears in the translator's explanation to the boy (line 10) and motivates the method of reading the cast. The action is signaled early and frames the translator's approach, but it's more metaphor than dramatized tactic. The story could substitute "translate" or "interpret" without structural loss. One beat involvement (the explanation) plus thematic echo; modest causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Decrypting smudged notes on the cast is introduced in line 13, developed across lines 14–18 (hunger, reef name, storm cloud, cartoon boats), and deployed in the waiting-room script (line 25). The method shapes the translator's tactics and provides the evidence (boats labeled "Also Us") that persuades the families. Early signal, two beats, and closure linkage. Specificity is high; swapping for another method would require rewiring the boy's role.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium at twilight anchors the opening and recurs ("mist climbs the hospital palms," "rain ticking like type along the atrium ceiling"). It provides atmosphere and the fog/treaty metaphor at closure. However, the setting doesn't constrain a tactical choice—action could occur in any hospital room. Lyric reprise is strong, but causal pressure is low. Present in setup and closure; modest integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the anesthetic kicks in" is signaled in line 2 and bounds the boy's absence, creating urgency for the translator's task. However, the clock is never dramatized—no ticking countdown or race against the boy waking. The surgeon's arrival and boy's waking occur without time pressure altering tactics. Setup gate met; development and payoff are weak. Functional but not tight.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The motivation "to graft new meaning onto old wounds, not to seal them shut, but to let them hold rain without drowning" is stated in line 21 and dramatized through the cast-reading and coral-offering. It drives the translator's method (reweighting the cast's ink, stitching the script) and charges the closure (the rain-treaty, leaving hand ungloved). Told once, then enacted across two beats and closure. Cost is visible in the fragility of the peace. Strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The tone of "lotus-hearted ache" is coherent throughout—meditative, lyric, tinged with sorrow and hope. It modulates subtly when the mother repeats the Reka word (warming) and when the room unclenches (tension easing). The final image of rain folding the night and the ungloved hand sustains the ache without resolving it. Charged final image; purposeful modulation under pressure. One minor slip: "lotus-hearted ache" is named once (line 30), which risks on-the-nose articulation, but the tone itself is earned.</comment>
