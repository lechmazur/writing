<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist shows a distinct perceptual signature filtered through the "dueling philosopher" lens, and micro-choices during the fencing sequence are embodied rather than merely declared. However, interiority occasionally tilts toward abstraction ("turn questions into destinations," "waiting was the most muscular verb") that reads more like thematic declaration than character-particular thought under pressure. The mechanical arm functions credibly in the duel but its emotional weight or trade-off is not foregrounded when stakes peak, limiting the cost visibility at closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive early and clearly (atrium, brook, protagonist with mechanical arm, waiting for courier). The inferred lens is Hybrid-Situational with lyric texture: pressure accumulates through the sundial puzzle and Rook's arrival, then the climactic fencing beat narrows options and the floor-gate revelation offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the three signatures admit defeat-and-passage simultaneously with conceptual cost legible in "the invitation to lose and proceed simultaneously." One concern: the courier's non-arrival and the geometry-unlocking feel slightly convenient rather than earned by prior causality, though the piece teaches a pattern of indirection early enough to support it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The glass atrium and brook are anchored early and used purposefully: light through panes enables the needle-card compass trick, and the sundial's primer-and-shadow work depends on the noon slice. The floor's geometry directly constrains the climactic choice, charging the final image when "the floor untied itself like a careful knot." Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through the philosopher's perceptual priorities, though the setting occasionally serves as backdrop rather than active resistance in mid-beats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—decoding the sundial to find the destination—is signaled early and tightens through Rook's challenge, then the fencing duel narrows options with visible physical and conceptual cost. Agency is clear: the protagonist's mechanical-arm parry and decision to "step into his line" and speak the invitation shifts the standoff from combat to treaty. One meaningful escalation occurs when Rook lunges at the map and the protagonist blocks, then offers passage terms; the "three signatures" requirement makes the cost of inclusion legible and forecloses pure victory.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme ("a philosophy worth steel is an address, a way to fence with time until it opens") emerges organically from the needle-card navigation, the sundial's coded angles, and the fencing-as-dialectic structure. The final image—stepping into the question, "each step erasing the need for an answer"—offers a resonant, non-literal reconfiguration without moralizing. Subtext operates consistently in the metaphoric overlay (fencing with patience, questions as destinations), though one late line ("So I learned...") nearly tips into thesis statement and slightly dilutes the otherwise oblique resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and lyric ("Light skittered across panes and water, a dignified chaos that kept time on the pulse in my throat"), with a philosopher's perceptual filter shaping diction and metaphor throughout. POV remains first-person and stable; no head-hopping. However, elevated register persists uniformly even during the high-tempo fencing sequence, where compression or syntactic fragmentation might better reflect adrenaline—"We fence" launches into measured exposition rather than clipped perception. Dialogue (Liese's and Rook's brief lines) is functional but not strongly differentiated in idiom; the narrator's voice dominates at all stress levels.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm and syntax vary purposefully, and imagery is concrete ("foil wrapped in a newspaper like a long bread roll," "warm air rose...smelling of rain on chalk and apple cores"). Clarity is generally high. However, figurative density approaches saturation in several paragraphs—nearly every sentence in the opening third carries a metaphor or simile—without clear pattern-teaching or payoff, risking ornamental accumulation. A few constructions slip toward purple register ("sequins," "the room returned to dignified chaos; glass threw sequins, the brook confided, and we breathed like metronomes adopting jazz") that momentarily prioritizes lyricism over propulsion. No major loops or scaffold, but information density occasionally dips when metaphor restates rather than advances.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of dueling-as-philosophy, the needle-card compass, and the sundial cipher is specific and non-obvious, avoiding template fantasy or mystery structures. The mechanical arm and "diplomatically fierce" anthropologist bring fresh detail, and the atrium's geometry as a literal door is an inventive visual turn. Risk is present in the lyric register and the refusal to stage a conventional climax-resolution, though the piece remains legible. The transformation test is mostly satisfied: swapping names and setting would require reworking the entire metaphoric architecture and the sundial's role.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Setup: protagonist identified in opening lines. Development: mechanical arm "hummed with old mathematics" and parries during the duel, calibrating angles that constrain Rook's thrusts; the decision to block Rook's lunge at the map and speak the invitation is a key turn. Payoff: present in the final treaty ("three signatures") and descent into the geometry. The arm's specific advantage (anvil-like meeting of blade) shapes one tactical beat and the closure negotiation, though the character's philosopher identity does more causal work than the arm itself. Two gates solid; closure linkage via the blocking move and signature moment.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Setup: unfolded early, described as "compass, mirror, apology." Development: aligned with pane seam to catch noon light, tipped onto sundial to chisel shadow into meaning; held "like a minor planet, a glinting decoy that bent his tempo" during the duel. Payoff: the sundial-and-needle trick produces the floor geometry that enables the ending. Three beats (setup, sundial solve, duel decoy) with causal pressure in two. The card is irreplaceable for the light-angle mechanics and charges the closure indirectly by enabling the map; slight gap in direct final-image presence prevents higher score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setup: signaled obliquely in "we knew the message lay..."; "Lines of brilliance leapt like notes in a hidden overture." Development: the overture "blossomed complete" when sundial, needle, and primer align, creating the floor-gate. Payoff: the revealed geometry is described as the overture's completion, and the group steps into it. The concept shapes the puzzle-solving stakes and reweights the closure image (music as spatial passage). Swappable with "hidden message" or "cipher" with minor edit cost, and the overture metaphor does not constrain tactics as sharply as the sundial itself; thematic resonance is strong but mechanical necessity is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setup: Liese introduced as "diplomatically fierce and calm as an anthropologist at a border." Development: she rearranges the sundial during the duel, contributing to the proof; she speaks "with a diplomat's mercy, the fierce kind that grants honor without permitting excuses" to offer Rook the treaty. Payoff: her voice and stance enable the three-signature resolution. The trait is embodied in two actions (sundial work, treaty offer) with visible social cost (inviting the loser into passage), but could be rewritten as "tactful and decisive" without breaking logic. Label-plus-action rather than unique constraint.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setup: fencing metaphor present from opening ("dueling philosopher"); literal fencing begins midpoint ("We fence"). Development: the duel with Rook is the story's longest sustained beat, testing wrists, parrying, riposte as argument; the protagonist's block-and-invitation move is the key turn that shifts stakes from combat to passage. Payoff: the fencing resolves into the treaty and geometry-unlock; the final paragraph echoes "fence with time until it opens." Three beats, high causal pressure, shapes closure directly. Swapping for another combat form would require rethinking the question-as-dialectic metaphor and the entire thematic architecture.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Setup: mentioned early ("we knew the message lay via the coded angles in a half-painted sundial"). Development: Liese places the sundial on the table, the protagonist aligns the needle card to cast shadow onto it, Liese reads the resulting lines, then rearranges primer and numbers to produce the floor-gate silhouette. Payoff: the sundial's final shadow "threw a new shadow onto the floor...a geometry that demanded a traveler," enabling the ending. Method is signaled, mechanics are shown on the page across multiple beats, and the sundial is irreplaceable for the angle-and-light puzzle that unlocks passage. All three gates strong; only slight swappability (could use another cipher device) prevents top band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setup: anchored in opening sentence. Development: glass panes enable the light-slice trick with the needle card; the floor tiles receive the sundial's final shadow and "untied itself like a careful knot"; the brook's cadence matches Liese's voice and persists as the closing ambient proof. Payoff: the atrium's architecture (glass, floor geometry) is essential to the sundial solve and the gate's appearance; the final line returns to the brook. Environment constrains and enables the central puzzle and charges the final image. Minor dock: the atrium could be replaced by another windowed indoor space with similar light access, though the brook's symbolic role is specific.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setup: "waiting for the courier who might never arrive" and "Waiting was the most muscular verb in our profession" signal temporal stakes early. Development: the narrative unfolds in a single continuous scene (waiting → puzzle → Rook's arrival → duel → resolution) with implicit time pressure (noon light window for the sundial). Payoff: waiting is thematically reweighted at closure ("the courier might have smiled, relieved of the burden of arrival by our acceptance of departure"). Time as endurance shapes tone and setup, but does not tighten tactics beat-to-beat; no countdown or visible deadline forces faster choices. Lyric reprise qualifies for mid-band; stronger causal clock absent.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Setup: stated early ("I had come here...to turn questions into destinations"). Development: the protagonist's choices (using the needle card, fencing with Rook, offering the passage-invitation) all enact the desire to navigate by inquiry rather than answers. Payoff: the final lines ("We stepped down...and walked into the question we had built, each step erasing the need for an answer") crystallize the motivation and deliver on it with cost (departure as renunciation of fixed answers). The motivation is embodied across beats and shapes the closure's conceptual repricing. Slight friction: the desire is often told in thematic voice rather than dramatized through conflicting wants; cost is conceptual and felt but not viscerally embodied.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Setup: "dignified chaos" named in opening paragraph ("Light skittered...a dignified chaos that kept time on the pulse in my throat"). Development: tone oscillates between lyric precision and kinetic action (sundial puzzle, fencing duel) without tipping into pure chaos or pure formality; "For a moment the room returned to dignified chaos; glass threw sequins, the brook confided, and we breathed like metronomes adopting jazz." Payoff: the tone charges the final image—order and disorder intertwine as the floor geometry "untied itself like a careful knot" and they step into departure. Coherent modulation under pressure with purposeful return at closure; the phrase recurs with reweighted meaning and the prose rhythm enacts the concept.</comment>
