<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The translator's professional stance and occupational idiom ("I translate what skylines say to shadows") are coherent and voice-specific. Interior motivation is present—honoring overlooked histories—but remains more articulated than contradictory; no on-page impulse tests commitment during the peak lens/painting beat. The child's recovered name functions as a micro-choice that forecloses a path, though the renunciation lacks visible struggle or cost in the moment. Embodied emotion is sparse; much interiority is poetic assertion rather than contradictory sensation under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the market stroll, lens ritual, and name recovery build density toward a final image where speaking the child's name reweights the painting's anonymity with felt cost ("suddenly the scene quit drowning in anonymity"). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the name's return charges the frame and steadies the market wind), cost is relational and conceptual (the painter "lowered his eyes, hearing what he had hidden"). Orientation anchors who/where/when by ~90 words without penalty. One meaningful cadence shift occurs when the lens "tasted the light" and fed coordinates, deepening the ritual's stakes. Minor elision: the precise mechanism of how letters "rose like fish" is lyric compression taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The suspended market—rope bridges, glass/copper stalls, "weather held in linen"—is vividly micro-set and constrains the translator's ritual (the lens catches "the last saffron of evening" to activate the painting). Sensory hierarchy filters through professional bias: pigments "mixed with river ash and berry salts" anchor craft rather than tourism. The lighthouse lens fragment functions as recurring object-setting, charged at open and close, shaping the final name-recovery choice. Spatial choreography remains coherent across the span; the painter's stall and the market wind interweave with the protagonist's stance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—honoring an overlooked child's history—is signaled early and tightens when the lens reveals coordinates and the protagonist speaks them back into the canvas. One meaningful deepening: the act of naming forecloses anonymity with relational cost (the painter nods, the frame is tied with sailcloth bearing her name). Agency is decision and renunciation (choosing to speak the name rather than sell or withhold). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; coincidence does not resolve. Minor deduction: the painter's complicity and the child's erasure are told more than tested on the page, limiting escalation texture.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—recovered names as sustenance, witnessing as vocation—emerges through the lens ritual and the child's tidewater coordinates without direct statement. The final image (name on sailcloth, scene no longer drowning) offers a resonant, non-literal answer: memory persists through patient attention and articulation. Subtext operates in gesture (the painter "lowered his eyes") and silence (the child "practiced survival" twice before holding fast). The "eternal instant" recurs purposefully, reweighting the opening's "elusively tangible" into closure's embodied pause. No thematic echo or moralizing in the final third.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: the translator notices "anchors of intuition" and translates sensory coordinates (tar, iron, nets) through professional idiom. POV distance is stable first-person, no head-hopping. Diction is lyric and elevated ("varnish became tidewater," "oars in their locks") but stays voice-consistent; no unmotivated register drift. Minor deduction: filter verbs cluster in peak beats ("I felt the market tilt," "I saw the hooks") where immediacy would benefit from direct sensation. Dialogue with the painter is brief, natural, and goal-driven ("I asked...not to buy it, but to return it"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully at the lens-touch moment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings shift across the piece. Information density is high in the lens-painting sequence ("Letters rose like fish, shy, silver"). Minor loop present: "eternal instant" appears twice with similar phrasing in the final third without added pressure, triggering −0.2. Template cadence runs in the middle third ("I spoke...I tasted...I asked...I leaned") across four lines, applying −0.4. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "absence were a harbor" is fresh, though "beacon humming without sound" verges on oxymoron without clarifying payoff. No grammar or continuity breaks. Clarity remains high; propulsion is steady if occasionally slowed by descriptive layering.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The between-worlds translator premise and lighthouse-lens ritual synthesize archival recovery with lyric compression in a fresh angle; not a template plot. The suspended alchemist's market and painting-as-archive transform familiar "lost history" tropes through specific craft detail (pigments, river ash, sailcloth). The final turn—name spoken, frame tied, market steadied—feels earned in hindsight by prior lens-work and coordinates. Emotional specificity (the child "let me borrow her sight") avoids generic templates. Proximity check clean; no close echoes of famous lines. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, meriting +0.3 within band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Present in first line, drives the lens ritual (middle beat), and completes name recovery at closure. The translator's professional idiom shapes all choices; decisions (holding the lens, speaking coordinates, writing the name) alter tactics and foreclose the painting's anonymity. Cost is relational (the painter's nod) and conceptual (the market steadies). Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.5 = ~4.7 base; strong coherence across arc lifts to 6.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Introduced in first paragraph ("wrapped in linen at my chest"), reappears in the lens-painting ritual (catches saffron, tastes light, feeds coordinates), and returns at closure (pressed against canvas margin to raise letters). Used in three distinct beats with evolving function; irreplaceable mechanics (fragment's former focusing role enables name recovery). Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.5, specificity +0.8 = ~5.7 base; strong reprise and cost connection lift to 7.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Signaled early ("anchors of intuition, those quiet weights that keep meaning from floating away"), constrains tactics (the anchors "tightened, tethering me to that hidden shore"), and recurs at closure ("I felt its patience lean over the roofs"). Not mere theme; the concept shapes the protagonist's stance and enables the final name recovery. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +1.0 = ~3.2 base; lyric coherence and undeniable pressure at end lift to 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Present in first paragraph as descriptor of the lens ("elusively tangible, like a memory you can touch only when not looking"). Reappears thematically in the "eternal instant" moments but does not demonstrably constrain or enable on-page actions with visible cost. Early signal +0.4, ornamental use −0.7, swappability −0.5 = ~2.2 base; thematic coherence and lyric reprise in the closure paragraph nudge to 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Introduced at midpoint ("I unfastened the linen from the lens"), directly enables letter-gathering and name recovery, and redefines the painting's state at closure. The unfastening is the hinge that shifts the lens from inert object to active tool. Late first use (mid-scene) −0.3, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.4, irreplaceability +0.7 = ~4.1 base; decisive cost and charged final image lift to 7.4.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Signaled early in title and first third ("histories breathed through hidden details in paintings"), shapes the lens-painting ritual (varnish becomes tidewater, crane silhouettes remember wrist tilt), and enables name recovery at closure. Mechanics are clear and matter: the protagonist reads glimmer, tide line, and brushstroke absences to extract coordinates. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.3, specificity +0.6 = ~5.1 base; strong reprise and irreplaceability lift to 6.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Introduced in opening line, provides the stall location and vendor (the painter), and the market wind "braided with my voice" at closure to steady the bridges. The elevated setting supplies social context (alchemists trading intangibles) and a spatial constraint (the "far span" stall). Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, mild causal pressure +0.6, closure linkage +0.9, specificity +0.5 = ~3.6 base; coherent atmospheric charge and final wind-image lift to 6.5.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Signaled at midpoint ("Between childhood and now, I had learned how to keep still while moving") and recurs in the child's memory and the lighthouse keepers' departure. Does not tighten decisions or alter tactics; functions as thematic frame without live pressure. Mid-scene signal −0.3, ornamental use −0.6, swappability −0.4 = ~1.7 base; lyric coherence across the arc and thematic resonance lift to 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stated in first third ("I had work to do to honor overlooked histories"), drives the lens ritual and name-seeking choice, and is satisfied at closure when the child's name "held fast" and the painter tied it to the frame. Friction between want (recovery) and cost (patience, not being paid in coin) is present but muted. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.1, closure linkage +1.4, modest cost connection +0.4 = ~4.9 base; strong coherence and dramatized payoff lift to 7.1.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Signaled early ("elusively tangible") and recurs explicitly at two closure beats ("the eternal instant again, and I felt its patience lean over the roofs"; "we stood inside the stretch of time that does not move"). Tone is coherent lyric stasis throughout, modulates minimally with pressure (the market tilts, then steadies), and charges the final image with undeniable patience. Early signal +0.5, two-beat reprise +0.9, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.4 = ~3.0 base; strong lyric payoff and conceptual cost lift to 6.3.</comment>
