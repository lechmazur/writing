<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's dimensional homesickness and waiting-as-binding drive interior contradiction, and the final choice to "interiorize the garden" is earned by prior causality. However, the guardian remains more cipher than character—her decisions (offering the pendant test, teaching frostbite reading) emerge from archetype rather than individuated motive. Interiority is densely figurative but occasionally slides into label-only abstraction ("dialect of erasure") without embodied cost in the moment. The core renunciation (leaving by not leaving) forecloses external departure with visible cost, meeting the Earned Stasis threshold.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its lyric-episodic pattern early (frozen garden, unwritten books, off-season stars) and sustains pressure through density increase and motif recurrence. Orientation anchors (frozen garden, mist, sundial, guardian) arrive by line 3; the "through the veil of sleep" frame is clear. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration via Earned Stasis: the protagonist interiorizes thresholds and carries them, reweighting the opening homesickness with companionable ache and reciprocal friendship with uncertainty. One meaningful deepening occurs when the pendant's bead "keeps a sliver of my breath," raising the cost of belonging elsewhere. The lens holds without contradiction, and cost is legible in the final image of thinned day and uncertainty as companion.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The frozen garden, mist, and sundial constrain multiple choices: the sundial's "frozen mid-confession" shadow is placed on the protagonist's palm and interiorized, the mist "writes a syllabus on my coat sleeve," and the pendant's bead refuses to cross "where the mist begins," establishing spatial and metaphysical boundaries. Sensory selection is purposeful—"light pools like breath on glass," "smells of vellum and salt"—and filtered through the protagonist's dimensional displacement. The garden evolves from arrival ("late") to teaching (frostbite reading) to departure (interiorization), and spatial choreography (center sundial, guardian's approach, pendant radius) remains coherent. The environment charges the final image when "the world outside fits inside," fulfilling the 9+ gate for Q3.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—how to address dimensional homesickness and exile by certainty—is signaled early and tightens when the guardian asks "what I will give to stay." The protagonist's empty hands and offer to wait raise the cost (waiting as "binding, like thread pulled through a wound"), and the pendant's tithe (keeping "a sliver of my breath") narrows options by creating a visible price for belonging elsewhere. One meaningful deepening: the shift from "lost, but not geographically" to "carry doorways the way others carry luck" reweights the stake from exile to portable thresholds. Agency is renunciation (leaving by not leaving) with on-page cost (day "thinner for a breath"). Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, though the escalation is more layered than propulsive.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—friendship with uncertainty, interiorizing thresholds, and the boundaries of light—emerges organically from action (waiting, reading by frostbite, the pendant test) and charged images (sundial's arrested shadow, bead that refuses to spill, mist as syllabus). The final image offers a resonant answer: "uncertainty sits beside me like a new friend" and "carrying thresholds like books, and books like thresholds" reweight the opening exile without stating a moral. Subtext operates consistently in gesture and silence (guardian's nod, laughter as margin note, pendant unclipped to "weigh my intent"). No thematic echo or sermonizing mars the ending. The piece invites reflection through purposeful ambiguity (what the library guards, why the moon was mistaken for a hinge) while maintaining specificity in every beat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: the protagonist notices via metaphor ("light pools like breath," "memory smokes like ice"), and diction remains elevated but consistent throughout ("dialect of erasure," "foggy lucidity," "syllable on my coat sleeve"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully—tighter during the pendant test, wider during the guardian's teaching—and the voice holds under emotional pressure without register drift. The guardian's brief dialogue ("what I will give to stay," "to cross is to forget, but to interiorize is to carry") carries distinct idiom and advances plot. No head-hopping, filter-verb stacks, or POV leakage. Minor note: some metaphors approach density ceiling ("cultist's pendant," "small sunrise with an old accent") but remain legible and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and lengths create momentum ("I say... She tells... I show... She nods"). Information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "She smells of vellum and salt, and her eyes catalogue me as if I were a misfiled season" layers sensory detail, metaphor, and relational dynamic). No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Figurative language is dense but coherent in most beats; however, the cluster "boundaries of light," "charter of the library," "pilgrims mistook the moon for a hinge," and "where a page must end for mercy" in consecutive lines risks overwriting without clear causal linkage between vehicles. Grammar and tense are clean, and the final line ("uncertainty sits beside me like a new friend") resolves by image with charged callback. Clarity holds throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of library-as-sanctuary, dimensional homesickness, and "interiorizing exteriors" as method feels specific and non-obvious. The feral guardian "shaped by stacks and winter, all tenderness taught by wolves" and the pendant enclosing "a bead of dawn" that refuses to cross the mist offer fresh inflections on familiar curator/threshold-crossing material. Emotional specificity—"little climates clinking like secret glasses," "waiting is binding, like thread pulled through a wound"—avoids generic templates. The piece commits fully to its lyric-episodic premise and resists the safety middle by choosing dense figuration and quiet closure over plot mechanics. Transformation test: the arc (exile → teaching → portable belonging) depends on this exact constellation of library, garden, and interiorization; swapping names would strip the thematic coherence. Risk-taking in structure (mosaic-episodic, no external antagonist) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The guardian appears early (line 9), constrains the protagonist's path by asking "what I will give to stay" (middle beat), and teaches "to read by frostbite" and grants the pendant test, which narrows options when the bead "keeps a sliver of my breath." She approves the protagonist's final answer about following "whichever stream forgets me last," shaping the closure stance. Present in setup, middle, and ending; two distinct beats (the ask, the pendant test) with causal pressure. However, her own motives and interior remain opaque—she acts more as threshold-function than individuated character, limiting irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The pendant is introduced early ("Around her throat hangs a cultist's pendant"), handled in the middle beat when the guardian "unclips the pendant to weigh my intent" and the bead asks "where home is," and returns with reweighted meaning at closure when it "keeps a sliver of my breath, a tithe to belonging elsewhere" and brightens as the protagonist leaves. Three beats, causal pressure (the bead's question narrows the protagonist's response), and closure linkage (the tithe charges the cost of interiorization). The pendant's unique property—the bead refuses to cross the mist—matters. High integration; nears indispensable but the protagonist's arc could theoretically function with a different test object.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The concept is signaled early (line 7: "aligning the boundaries of light with unspoken rules") and recurs with increasing specificity: the bead's dawn "refuses to cross the line where the mist begins," the guardian teaches "where the boundaries of light refuse to translate," and the ending respects "the boundaries of light, because respect is how edges hold." The concept shapes tactics—the protagonist learns to "adjust the heart to focus" when vision blurs—and charges the closure image when "the pendant brightens, casting a careful radius." Present in setup, middle, and ending; drives at least two beats (the bead's refusal, the teaching); essential to the thematic and tactical arc. Very strong integration; removing the concept would collapse the library's logic and the protagonist's method.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The attribute is introduced in line 4 ("I am dimensionally homesick") and recurs at the midpoint ("I am dimensionally homesick again, but the ache is companionable") with reweighted affect, then is resolved at closure when the protagonist carries thresholds and "uncertainty sits beside me like a new friend." It constrains the protagonist's opening stance (border-crosser, address edited out) and enables the final choice to interiorize rather than depart. Two beats, clear cost (the ache persists but becomes companionable), and closure participation. The trait is specific and irreplaceable; the arc depends on this exact displacement.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The action is signaled early (line 8: "I have come to make friends with uncertainty" by waiting) and is tested in the middle when the protagonist offers "my willingness to wait" and learns "waiting is not inaction here; it is binding." The action recurs at closure: "I will wait beside the runoff and listen for spines clicking" and "We sit with the sundial's arrested shadow." The action redefines options—waiting becomes binding rather than passivity—and the protagonist's stance crystallizes around it. Present in setup, middle, and ending; drives multiple beats; causal pressure (the guardian nods approval, the pendant test follows); indispensable to the arc. Removing waiting would unravel the protagonist's transformation from exile to patient reciprocity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The method is introduced early (line 5: "I practice interiorizing exteriors, folding each horizon inward until it whispers my name") and tested in the middle when the protagonist places "the sundial's confession on my palm, and I interiorize its exiled noon until it becomes memory." The method resolves at closure: "I leave by not leaving, interiorizing the garden, the mist, the waiting, until the world outside fits inside." Three beats, causal involvement (the method is taught, practiced, and executed at closure), and the final image depends on it. The method is irreplaceable—no near-synonym would carry the same recursive logic—and the cost (day "thinner for a breath") is visible. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The garden is introduced in line 1 ("frozen garden in mist") and is present throughout: the sundial at its center constrains the protagonist's teaching, the mist writes a syllabus and "carries weight" of other versions, and the guardian teaches "to read by frostbite" within it. The garden pressures choices (arrival late, offering to stay, learning its methods) and charges the closure when the protagonist interiorizes it ("carrying the garden, the mist, the waiting"). Setup, middle, and ending; causal pressure (the garden's rules shape the protagonist's method); essential to the arc. Removing the garden would strip the spatial and metaphysical anchor for the transformation.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The timeframe is established in line 1 ("Through the veil of sleep, I arrive") and bookends at closure ("Through the veil of sleep again, I return to my waking"). It frames the action as liminal but does not tighten decisions or tactics within the episode—no live clock pressures the protagonist's choices. The frame supports tone and setting but is functionally replaceable with another liminal marker (e.g., twilight, threshold crossing). Present in setup and ending; lyric reprise reweights slightly (the protagonist now "carrying thresholds like books"); however, no middle development or causal pressure. Mid-band: functional but not essential to escalation or closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The motivation is signaled in line 8 ("I have come to make friends with uncertainty, because certainty exiled me") and dramatized in the middle when the protagonist offers empty hands and willingness to wait, then answers the bead's question about home ("a room made of thresholds") and learns "friendship with uncertainty requires reciprocity." It resolves at closure: "uncertainty sits beside me like a new friend." Three beats, friction between want (belonging) and cost (thinned day, sliver of breath kept by pendant), and the protagonist's final stance crystallizes around it. Present in setup, middle, and ending; causal pressure; essential. Removing the motivation would collapse the arc's coherence.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The tone—foggy lucidity, elevated but concrete—is established early ("Light pools like breath on glass, and beyond its pale edges the air refuses to decide") and holds through turns: the guardian's teaching is delivered in the same register ("waiting is binding, like thread pulled through a wound"), and the closure maintains it ("the day is thinner for a breath, but it holds"). The tone modulates subtly with pressure (tighter during the pendant test, more expansive during the teaching) and charges the final image without breaking. Coherent and purposeful, but the static elevation (consistently metaphorical throughout) trends mid-high rather than high. Strong but not indispensable; a different tonal register could theoretically carry the same arc.</comment>
