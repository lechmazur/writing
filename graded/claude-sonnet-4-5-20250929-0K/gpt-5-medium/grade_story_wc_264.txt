<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The freight guard's choices drive the arc: humming the charm, engaging the archive, deploying the lantern spores. Embodiment is strong ("cold breaths of not yet, brushing my knuckles"), and the final renunciation of dreams for duty ("I am busy, and sometimes I am occasionally everywhere") forecloses rest with visible cost. Interiority remains vivid and idiosyncratic throughout. Minor: the archive's motivations remain opaque, limiting the relationship crucible, but the single-POV focus holds.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the guard's charm gradually coaxes the archive from "occasionally everywhere" to "almost," culminating in spore deployment that transforms the train into a "greenhouse moving north." The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis + Charged Poise): the guard accepts dreamless duty as the cost of cultivating sparks, visible in "I am busy, and sometimes I am occasionally everywhere, exactly where sparks are needed." Orientation anchors by line 3 (freight guard, rail, glowing dune). One meaningful deepening suffices at this length, and the ending image reweights the opening's desolation with patient labor.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The glowing dune constrains action (opens the archive when it sings, plants quiet in the guard's boots) and charges the closure ("the dunes forget our hymns but keep their color"). Sensory specificity is exceptional: "glassy throats," "pale blue," "cold fire." The chess clock and crate function as micro-setting that structures the central negotiation. Spatial choreography is clear throughout (rail, cars, couplers, axles, sand).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: awaken and stabilize the archive to cultivate sparks in the unlit corners. Pressure tightens through humming → clock gesture → whispering charm → spore deployment, each narrowing the archive's instability. The final cost is legible: the guard remains dreamless, "a placeholder for restored woods," trading rest for motion. Agency is visible in micro-choices (flip the clock, choose the shortest night, carry spores to axles) that alter the archive's state.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—patience and ritual labor against erasure—emerges through specifics: the charm learned from a dead signalman, sparks needing quiet to learn their names, the train becoming a greenhouse. The ending offers a non-literal answer: motion is also soil, and the guard's wakefulness is the condition for renewal. No moralizing; the final image ("the train rolls on, carrying its stitched together morning") reweights the opening's desolation with earned hopefulness rooted in prior action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is singular: "divergent archive that refuses to settle," "two faces with dead eyelids," "seeds learning to be embers, embers rehearsing to be rivers." POV modesty holds (inference reads as inference: "I realize," "I know better"). Purposeful compression ("tendencies: seeds learning to be embers") is taught early and sustained. Diction stays within the guard's lexicon—technical-mystical, post-catastrophe patience—without register drift. No dialogue to judge.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Information density is high: most lines advance image, action, and theme simultaneously ("I flip the chess clock toward it, and the hands, still speared at twelve, reflect the dunes like two blind fish"). Rhythm modulates with pressure (short commands during deployment: "I carry them to the unlit corners"). Minor figurative density in the middle third (wave functions, lattice of probability, not yet/almost) approaches ornament but remains anchored to the charm's mechanics. No loops or scaffold; propulsion is steady.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Post-apocalyptic rail-guard premise is familiar, but the synthesis—archive as shy animal, charm via wave functions, chess clock as temporal negotiation, spores as lantern-lungs—feels specific and non-derivative. The freight train as greenhouse and the guard as "occasionally everywhere" offer fresh inflections. Risk: the lyric-accumulative mode could obscure stakes, but the piece commits fully and the closure image ("stitched together morning") justifies the tonal gamble. Transformation test passed: swap names/places and the arc collapses.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Present throughout; drives all key beats (humming, clock flip, whisper, spore deployment); shapes closure ("I take my place at the coupler"). Cost: dreamlessness, endless labor. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Introduced early (paragraph 5), handled twice (flip toward archive, sweats a tick), charges the ending indirectly (archive sleeps, clock breathes). Enables temporal negotiation ("Midnight has no edges"). Strong but not indispensable; the charm and spores carry more causal weight.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Central stake; present from paragraph 3; drives all middle beats (quivers, spills images, replies with corridor of nights, opens to release spores); shapes closure (archive sleeps, spores travel). Removing it breaks the story's logic entirely.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Introduced paragraph 4 ("occasionally everywhere"), dramatized in final third ("I am occasionally everywhere, exactly where sparks are needed"). Enables the guard's distributed presence and aligns with the archive's initial instability. Cost: fragmentation of self. Essential to closure image.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The charm structures the entire arc: learned from dead signalman (paragraph 10), deployed via humming/whispering (paragraphs 9, 21), enables archive negotiation and spore release. Final paragraph: "I hum another charm." Indispensable; swap it and causality collapses.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Signaled paragraph 10 ("archive heard better through wave functions"), invoked paragraph 21 ("charm moving through wave functions like a tide climbing stairs"). Shapes the charm's mechanics and the archive's engagement. Present across beats but could be abstracted to "sympathetic resonance" with minor edits; specificity elevates but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Present from opening line; triggers archive opening ("archive opens when the dunes sing"); plants quiet in guard's boots (paragraph 34); charges closure ("dunes forget our hymns but keep their color"). Micro-setting that alters tactics and final image. Removing it breaks spatial logic and thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Frames the entire premise (opening line); creates scarcity that motivates cultivation. No live clock tightens individual beats, but the post-catastrophe condition shapes all stakes. Present in closure indirectly (train as greenhouse, "restored woods"). Essential context but does not constrain beat-level tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stated explicitly (paragraph 13), dramatized through all choices (humming, deploying spores to "unlit corners," "exactly where sparks are needed"). Conflict between cultivation and dreamlessness visible in final cost. Removing it breaks the guard's entire arc.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Present from title implicitly; stated paragraph 9 ("fractured lullaby"); modulates through patient negotiation (paragraphs 16–27) and final hymn (paragraph 38). Tone charges the ending ("no newborns cry to be lulled" / "patient with bandaged ears"). Coherent and purposeful throughout; shapes emotional register of closure.</comment>
