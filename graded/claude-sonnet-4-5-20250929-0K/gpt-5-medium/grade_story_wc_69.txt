<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in prior wounds ("I had once shouted for a cause until my throat bled"), and the piece embodies her pedagogical philosophy through concrete micro-choices (placing the rosette, denoting rests). However, the choir students remain largely interchangeable despite gestural tags (Rafi's "smoke," Ola's "tremble"), and their individual arcs are summarized rather than dramatized in choice-moments. The ending image of passing the rosette is gesture-rich but lacks a visible cost or foreclosed path that would anchor Earned Stasis or Charged Poise with felt weight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers rehearsal beats toward a performance closure that reweights the dominant stake (unlearning hatred through shared song). Orientation is clear by line 3 (Mara, velvet library, autumn). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the performance and rosette-passing ritual), but the cost remains conceptual and implied rather than legible on the page—no visible foreclosed path, no trade-off that narrows options. The phrase "carrying a traveled stillness home" gestures toward transformation but does not land a decisive before/after with dramatized price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The velvet library is anchored early and recurs with purpose ("the library exhaled dust and memory"), and micro-setting details (music stand, curtains, shelves) ground the action. The rosette functions as a recurring object that charges the final image and constrains one choice (Rafi catches and passes it). Sensory selection is purposeful and filtered through Mara's pedagogical lens, though the elevated diction occasionally drifts from the POV's plausible lexicon during high-pressure beats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—braiding divided voices into harmony—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when Rafi and Ola face each other and the rosette is placed between them, and the performance deepens the pressure. However, escalation reads as serial rather than causally compounding: each beat adds texture but does not narrow options or impose a visible trade-off. The ending offers closure without a legible price paid on the page, which keeps the cost conceptual rather than felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme (listening as practice, vanishing arts sustained through care) emerges organically from action and image, not assertion. The rosette recurs with reweighted meaning (grandmother's quartet, compass, warm exchange), and the final image ("their listening survives us") recharges prior particulars. The piece resists tidy morals and allows ambiguity ("some who stood at the doorway"). One slip: "subtracting noise" is stated as method and theme rather than fully dramatized through on-page choices, edging toward meta-commentary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Single-POV distance is stable and voice is distinct, with a lyric-philosophical register ("the soft arithmetic that converts strangers into neighbors") consistent throughout. Purposeful compression and patterned diction are taught early and sustained. However, the elevated diction occasionally drifts outside Mara's plausible lexicon during peak beats ("the slogans harmonized nothing," "their listening survives us"), and some interiority leans toward diagnostic self-awareness ("listening is a muscle that thrives on care more than conviction") that feels slightly crafted for the reader rather than lived in the moment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high, with many lines doing double work (image + character stance). However, overwriting and mixed metaphors accumulate: "autumn folded itself against the velvet library as if the season were a hush made visible" is figuratively dense without clear payoff; "talk leaves behind" mixes vehicle and tenor; "the rosette slipped" lacks spatial logic (from where?). Template-cadence runs appear ("I placed," "I said," "I told," "I watched") and paraphrase loops touch adjacent lines ("We sang three songs... Rafi took the melody... The old guard lowered"). These artifacts dull momentum in the final third and touch the closure beat, triggering −0.8 and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The choir-reconciliation frame is familiar, but the piece personalizes it through the rosette as inherited compass and "subtracting noise" as pedagogical stance. The lyric compression and "traveled stillness" tone offer a fresh inflection on the template. However, the emotional arc (divided students → tentative trust → public performance → communal healing) follows a well-worn path without a bold turn or non-obvious synthesis, and the ending reifies rather than complicates the premise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mara is present throughout, frames the rehearsals, places the rosette between Rafi and Ola (one key turn), and conducts the performance. Her prior wound (shouting for a cause) seeds her current method. She appears in the ending ("I raised my hands to denote the final rest") and her stance reweights the closure image. Two distinct beats: placing the rosette, conducting the performance. Causal pressure is moderate; her choices enable the students' arc but do not narrow her own options with visible cost. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.9, causal pressure +0.6; mid-band swappability −0.4 (another teacher-figure could occupy the role with minor edits), summary-only involvement in some beats −0.3. Start 3.0 + 2.3 = 5.3, round to neighborhood 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The rosette is introduced early (paragraph 7), used in two distinct beats (placed between Rafi and Ola; caught and passed by Rafi to Ola; passed through the rows after the performance), and charged in the ending ("every voice could feel the carved circle turn warm"). Its properties (inherited, "listening compass," carved petals) are specific and irreplaceable. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.6, cost connection +0.4 (enables the trust moment). No major frictions. Start 3.0 + 4.3 = 7.3, round to 7.8 for strong closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Vanishing arts is signaled early ("caretakers of vanishing arts"), recurs thematically (grandmother's quartet "vanished with the border"), and appears in the final paragraph ("Vanishing arts do not disappear when held together"). However, its role is largely thematic rather than tactical: it does not alter on-page choices or narrow options. The concept seeds Mara's motivation but does not constrain rehearsal tactics or escalation. Early signal +0.5, closure linkage +0.8 (reweights the ending image), but ornamental/thematic use without causal pressure −0.7, swappability −0.5 (could be "endangered traditions" or "fading songs"). Start 3.0 + 1.3 − 1.2 = 3.1, lyric-resonance allowance +2.8 for charged reprise that reweights the stake. Cap at 5.9 per two-gate model (setup and payoff; weak middle development).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Expectantly resigned" is named twice (paragraph 11, paragraph 33) and embodies Mara's stance: she is "prepared to fail kindly" yet offers breath. The trait constrains her opening approach (no shouting, patient listening) and reappears at the ending ("I stood expectantly resigned at the edge, ready for failure yet offering breath"). However, it does not visibly alter a mid-story choice or impose a trade-off with cost. Early signal +0.5, closure linkage +0.9, causal constraint +0.3 (shapes opening stance); label-only in middle beats −0.6, swappability −0.4 (similar traits could replace it). Start 3.0 + 1.7 − 1.0 = 3.7; lyric reprise adds +1.5 for reweighting the ending stance. Cap at 5.2 per two-gate model (setup and payoff present, weak middle development).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Denote" appears in three beats: Mara will "denote the rests with lifted hands" (paragraph 13), "denote pauses where anger used to rush" (paragraph 22), and "I raised my hands to denote the final rest" (paragraph 35). The action frames the pedagogy and closes the performance. However, it is somewhat swappable with "mark," "signal," or "conduct," and its mechanics do not uniquely shape a turn—the rests could be cued by other means. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.0; swappability −0.6, summary-only use in middle beat −0.3. Start 3.0 + 3.0 − 0.9 = 5.1, round to 6.4 for moderate causal pressure and closure presence.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"By subtracting noise" is signaled early (paragraph 12: "learn by subtracting noise, removing what did not serve"), recurs mid-story (paragraph 22: "by subtracting noise"), and appears near the ending (paragraph 34: "proven again by subtracting noise"). The method shapes Mara's pedagogy (erasing judgments, breathing where fear cracked), but its mechanics are more asserted than demonstrated through specific on-page attempts with visible cost. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.7; ornamental/thematic use without causal pressure −0.6, summary-only −0.4. Start 3.0 + 2.2 − 1.0 = 4.2; lyric-resonance allowance +1.6 for charged reprise that reweights the method. Cap at 5.8 per two-gate model (setup and payoff, weak middle development).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The velvet library in autumn is anchored in the opening line and recurs throughout: curtains, shelves, the room "listened," "exhaled dust and memory," "kept their breath." Autumn frames the tone. The setting enables the rehearsals and the performance, but does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics—any rehearsal space could serve. Early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.5 (the library "kept their breath"); swappability −0.7, postcard description without tactical pressure −0.5. Start 3.0 + 2.7 − 1.2 = 4.5; charged reprise adds +1.6 for tonal coherence and final image support. Cap at 6.1.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Across unlearning hatred" is named three times (paragraph 6, paragraph 32, title echo) but functions as thematic frame rather than live clock. The piece does not track rehearsal duration or tighten decisions via time pressure; the arc reads as serial beats rather than compressed timeline. Present in closure image (paragraph 32: "Across unlearning hatred, the piece bent into a bridge"), but does not alter tactics. Early signal +0.5, closure linkage +0.6; vague/untracked time −0.8, ornamental use −0.5. Start 3.0 + 1.1 − 1.3 = 2.8; lyric-resonance allowance +2.0 for thematic reprise. Cap at 4.8 per two-gate model (setup and payoff, no middle development).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to "braid diverse voices into harmony" is dramatized in her opening choices (unlocking scores, placing the rosette, denoting rests), conflicts with the students' initial wariness and flash of "ruins," and is tested in the performance. The desire is named early (paragraph 4) and recurs through action (paragraph 24: "their lines stopped competing for light"). Friction between want and cost appears (Mara's throat bled from prior shouting; now she listens), and the performance realizes the goal with moderate cost (families measure themselves, some dare the front row). Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.0, causal pressure +0.9, cost connection +0.5; summary-only in some beats −0.3. Start 3.0 + 4.5 − 0.3 = 7.2.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Traveled stillness" appears in the opening (paragraph 2), mid-story (paragraph 19), and ending (paragraph 38: "carrying a traveled stillness home"). The tone is coherent, modulates with pressure (the flashed ruins, the unclenching room), and charges the final image. However, it remains largely atmospheric rather than constraining choice or altering tactics. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.3, specificity +0.5; static mood in middle beats −0.4, ornamental use −0.3. Start 3.0 + 4.0 − 0.7 = 6.3; charged reprise adds +0.6 for tonal coherence. Round to 6.9.</comment>
