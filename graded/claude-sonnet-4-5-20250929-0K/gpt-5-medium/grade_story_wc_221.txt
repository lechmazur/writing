<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is concrete and specific—"blessed pariah the board tolerated," "confusion into exploration"—and embodied through the sketching ritual. Internal contradiction operates in the simultaneous pride and isolation of being right. The manual-safety decision and its aftermath ground motivation in visible cost (blackout, board scrutiny, social exile). Minor deduction: the grandmother's teaching and family custom feel more expository than lived contradiction shaping a present choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): the protagonist constructs a "navigable field where confusion once thrashed" through layered sketches, establishing a vein of intention as true north. Cost is conceptual and felt—she accepts the pariah role, transforms solitary drawing into devotion, and meets dawn "with steady eyes" after refusing perfection. Orientation is prompt (deck, post-shutdown context anchored by ~100 words). One meaningful deepening: the compass rose shifts from ornament to four-armed map (past/present/elsewhere/return), reweighting the anniversary custom and foreclosing drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The observation deck as micro-setting constrains perception (time-peeled constellations, glacial ink-drying) and charges the final image where dawn arrives "from several directions at once." The compass rose applique and sketchbook physically anchor choices (spreading the book, adjusting the circle, dating with the blackout number). Sensory detail is filtered through lyric attention—"cars as beetles dragging time," "dust hesitated between falling and floating"—without postcard excess. Spatial choreography of ledge, glass, corridor remains coherent throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: establishing true north amid temporal dilation and social exile. One meaningful tightening occurs when "the stars were not where they should be" and the protagonist realizes the compass rose maps temporal axes (past/present/elsewhere/return), then decides to layer anniversary sketches to chart drift. Agency is choice and endurance: she refuses perfection, names a new custom, and constructs a navigable field from confusion. The blackout as prior cost shapes present tactics (solitary ritual, temporal patience). No explicit antagonist; pressure arises from disorientation and the need for devotion-as-anchor.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: finding orientation through devotion to pattern rather than fixed points, accepting pariah status as the price of being right, and building meaning from layered observation. The compass rose shifts from heirloom to map of temporal devotion without overt statement. The line "We will not fear the dark we carry" and the final navigable field offer a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of how to hold true north when external reference drifts. No moralizing; the ending reweights prior material (blackout, grandmother's teaching, family custom) with conceptual cost legible in the protagonist's solitary vigil and acceptance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable and controlled; perceptual signature is lyric and time-aware ("hours passed in the language of the deck," "a stretch and a fold"). Diction is elevated but voice-motivated and consistent—"blessed pariah," "echoed silence nested in the seams of the glass"—with syntactic variety that modulates pressure (short declaratives at realization beats, longer accumulations during observation). No dialogue; interior monologue stays character-bound. Figurative density is high but coherent and pattern-taught (time as organism, stars as petals, map as devotion).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes with charged images. Information density is high—most lines layer description, interiority, and thematic weight. Minor deductions: "echoed silence" recurs four times across opening and closing without added pressure; a few figurative vehicles stack densely in mid-passage ("petals unfolding too slowly to believe," "patient animal," "flowered from the sun") risking coherence under speed-read. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; grammar and tense are clean. Propulsion is lyric-accumulative rather than causal, appropriate to the lens.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of time-dilation setting, pariah status, and family ritual as navigational devotion feels specific and non-obvious. The compass rose's reframing from cardinal directions to temporal axes (past/present/elsewhere/return) is a fresh inflection that transforms a familiar heirloom trope. The piece commits fully to its lyric-accumulative premise without retreat, using the observation deck's physics to literalize the protagonist's search for orientation. Risk: high figurative density and non-linear time handling succeed without obscuring clarity or closure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Present throughout; the protagonist's decision to layer anniversary sketches and redefine the compass rose axes drives the closure beat. Two-gate participation (setup and payoff) with middle development present but softer. Causal work: the pariah status frames isolation, enabling the solitary ritual; the blackout decision anchors her moral calculus. Closure linkage strong ("navigable field," "true north I had drawn"). Swappability modest—another marginalized expert could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Introduced early (sixth line); handled in three beats (grandmother's stitching, pressed weight during drawing, four-armed map realization). Reweighted meaning at closure: from ornament to temporal map (past/present/elsewhere/return). Shapes the protagonist's final navigation choice. Specificity high (gilded, patient thread, worn gold). Minor cap: the applique enables the final understanding but does not constrain prior choices with visible cost until the realization beat.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Shapes stakes throughout: the protagonist's stated goal is to find true north, the grandmother's teaching warns against needle-only navigation, and the closing action is drawing and trusting "the true north I had drawn to keep its course." Constrains choice: realization that fixed points drift forces the layered-sketch solution. Closure participation strong—the navigable field *is* a constructed true north. Causal pressure high; irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Constraint present in every observation beat: ink dries at glacial speed, constellations peel apart slowly, footsteps would take a week, the corridor feels stretched, dawn comes slowly. Enables the protagonist's layered-sketch solution by making past and present coexist visibly. Shapes closure: "hours passed in the language of the deck, a stretch and a fold." Cost legible—patience as tactic, normal time inaccessible. Three-gate participation; high causal pressure and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Major turn: glimpsing last year's self ("my hand smaller, my hair longer, a smudge of rain where I had cried") triggers the realization that she can "stack the sky like pages" and chart drift. Setup present (time-peeled constellations foreshadow glimpse); middle beat (the glimpse itself); closure linkage (layered sketches as solution). Causal: without the glimpse, the layered-sketch tactic would lack motivation. Swappability low—another temporal anomaly could trigger the idea, but this specific embodiment (self-reflection across time) ties to anniversary and grief.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Signaled early ("Our family custom of sketching the night sky on anniversaries began with her"); mechanics matter (circle-drawing, dating with the blackout number, layering sketches). Shapes middle beats (grandmother's teaching about true north, the decision to layer sketches here "where time is long enough to hold them together"). Closure participation strong: the final sketch completes the anniversary observance and constructs the navigable field. Three-gate participation; causal pressure moderate to high.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setup immediate (title and opening line); environment constrains every perception and choice (temporally stretched observation, stars peeling apart, glimpse of last year). Enables the layered-sketch solution by making time visible and manipulable. Closure linkage decisive: "the deck would give me the axis I needed," and the protagonist can meet dawn "from several directions at once" only here. Three-gate participation; causal pressure high; irreplaceable. Cost: isolation, temporal dislocation, the price of slow observation.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Setup clear (first line: "After the shutdown"); frames the protagonist's exile and the deck's abandonment. Provides backstory causality (manual-safety decision, blackout, board scrutiny). Middle development softer—the shutdown itself does not constrain present choices as much as its social aftermath does. Closure participation present but oblique (dating the sketch "with the number of the blackout"). Swappability modest—another institutional rupture could substitute.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stated early ("I came here to turn confusion into exploration, the only prayer I believed in"); dramatized through the sketching ritual and the decision to layer observations rather than seek fixed reference. Conflicted: the protagonist's need for orientation clashes with the deck's drifting stars and her pariah status. Shapes closure: the navigable field is the successful transformation of confusion into exploration. Cost legible—solitary vigil, acceptance of drift, refusal of perfection. Three-gate participation; causal pressure strong.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Coherent throughout: "echoed silence nested in the seams of the glass," "no sound at all," "the hush of clouds," "quiet patience of distant fires." Modulates with pressure (sparse declaratives at realization beats, longer suspended syntax during observation). Charges the final image: the protagonist meets dawn and closes the book in sustained stillness. The tone's lyric quietness matches the temporally stretched setting and the protagonist's devotional patience. Minor repetition of "echoed silence" across opening and closing; otherwise integral.</comment>
