<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The crawl space dweller shows consistent interior motivation (becoming visible through service) and embodied action (felt pads, cache opening, chalk marks). However, interiority relies heavily on abstract poeticism ("fear is a lantern that reveals and burns") rather than character-specific contradiction under pressure. The girl functions primarily as a need rather than a pressure-generating presence; their non-interaction prevents relationship dynamics from testing the protagonist's commitment. The cache-driven solution feels methodical but lacks visible cost or foreclosed path at closure—he retreats "heart big as a boiler" without material consequence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly by the opening lines. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the dweller's repeated acts of invisible service build toward the girl finding the notebook, reweighting his vow to become visible. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the protagonist considers "how visibility might be crafted from service" and etches an arrow, crystallizing his method with the cost felt (remaining unseen). One cost-proof concern: the final withdrawal reads more as confirmation than foreclosure, though the arrow gesture does reconfigure his stance from passive to intentional trace-leaving.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The library setting is vividly particular: crawl space, vent lattice, pipe chases, atlas case hollow, grate behind velvet chair. These micro-settings constrain the dweller's movement and enable his cache-based solution. The outage functions as both atmospheric intensifier ("sapphire hush") and tactical enabler (lowers interference for the tape fragment). Sensory detail is purposeful—cedar, dustlavender, iron—and filtered through the protagonist's tactile focus. The northeast pipe chase and boiler riser anchor the tape's activation, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: the dweller's desire to help the girl find the notebook while remaining unseen. The outage tightens conditions, allowing the tape fragment to surface whispers. One meaningful pressure point occurs when the girl speaks "where her mother kept the blue notebook"—the tape hums, triggering the dweller's cache solution. However, escalation is gentle; the protagonist faces no live opposition or trade-off. The resolution (sliding the atlas case, withdrawing) costs him nothing visible on the page beyond enduring invisibility, which he already chose.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—service as a form of presence, invisibility as intentional craft—emerges through concrete actions: cache-keeping, chalk lattice, leaving the arrow. The final image ("visibility might be crafted from service") resists overt moralizing and instead offers a resonant question anchored in prior particulars. The tape fragment and cedar button function as earned motifs that reweight at closure. Minor slip: "become visible to those who need you" is repeated as a vow, edging toward thesis statement, though the ending complicates it by choosing continued invisibility with traces.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable and voice carries a distinct lyric texture: "velvet seam threaded by drafts," "mothcolored murmurs." However, register occasionally drifts into elevated poetic abstraction ("fear is a lantern that reveals and burns," "presence could travel through ducts and drift into choices") that feels authorial rather than interior to a crawl-space dweller. The girl's brief dialogue is naturalistic. Perceptual signature—tactile, acoustic, service-oriented—remains consistent. Psychic distance is controlled, though some metaphoric density in high-pressure beats (finding the notebook) slightly obscures immediate sensation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense ("sapphire hush," "tide pooling after night withdraws," "body a letter folded to fit"), creating a lyric texture. However, several beats loop or paraphrase: "He was a kindly methodical soul" / "kindly methodical even in joy"; "while the city's lights flicker after an unexpected outage" appears twice verbatim, the second time mid-story without pattern payoff. Overwriting is present in peak beats—"hair haloed, pockets full of catalog cards, eyes glazed with sleep and unshed worry"—stacking modifiers that slow momentum. Template cadence: multiple sentences open with "He" + verb across paragraphs. Clarity remains high overall, but density occasionally substitutes for propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The crawl-space helper premise is fresh, and the ferromagnetic tape fragment as sense-memory device offers a specific, non-obvious mechanic. The dweller's methodical cache system and chalk lattice feel particular to this character and world. However, the emotional arc—kindly invisible figure helps lost child—leans toward familiar archetype without sharp moral complication or risk. The girl's passive role (standing, speaking to the room, kneeling) keeps the turn predictable. The ending's choice to remain unseen while leaving traces is thematically coherent but lacks a bold inflection that redefines prior stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The crawl space dweller frames the piece, makes the key decision to use the tape fragment and cache, and etches the arrow at closure. Present in setup, middle (tape activation, cache opening), and payoff (withdrawal, arrow). His choices enable the girl's discovery but he faces no visible cost or trade-off on the page—remaining unseen is his baseline, not a foreclosure. The element is essential to structure but lacks the pressure or price that would elevate it above 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ferromagnetic tape reel fragment appears in setup (found months ago, tested), middle (unspooled near boiler, tugged toward Folios Room, hums at "mother"), and payoff (settles into stillness, tucked back). It enables the dweller's discovery of the notebook's location and reweights at closure when it "settled into stillness like soot." Causal role across three beats and closure linkage present. Capped below 7.5 because the tape's mechanics (sense memory indexing) are asserted rather than earned through visible struggle or cost; it solves a problem it helped identify but did not complicate.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Sense memory as concept is named and described: the tape fragment "singing a faint itch," drawing "mothcolored murmurs," offering "flavors of air and choreography of hands." It shapes the protagonist's method (testing against metal ribs, unspooling near the boiler). However, the concept remains largely ornamental—a thematic label rather than a stake-altering force. The girl's need is external; sense memory solves it but does not constrain the dweller's choices with visible friction or cost. Present in setup and middle, minor role at closure (the tape settles).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Kindly methodical" is introduced early, embodied through felt pads, chalk lattice, cache organization, and the deliberate sequence of actions. It enables the dweller's success (methodical cache system) and appears at closure ("kindly methodical even in joy"). However, the trait lacks visible cost or trade-off—no moment where kindness or method constrains him painfully. It functions as consistent characterization rather than a dilemma. Present across beats but does not narrow options with felt price on the page.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The cache (hair ribbon, graphite, cedar button) is introduced in the middle third, opened to let the tape "quiver in the aromatic dark," and triggers the dweller's understanding of where the notebook is hidden. It directly enables the climactic turn (revealing the atlas hollow) and is referenced at closure ("cache became a ledger of kindnesses"). Present in setup (mentioned as method), middle (opened, used), and payoff (thematic return). Causal pressure across two beats and closure linkage solid. Capped below 8.0 because the cache is introduced functionally rather than seeded early, reducing inevitability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Uncovering in pipe chases" is named as the dweller's method early ("This was his method") and demonstrated when he unlatches the northeast pipe chase panel and later retrieves the cache from under the atlas case. However, the method itself is more thematic frame than mechanical constraint—any hidden-helper approach could substitute. It shapes one beat (panel opening) and is echoed at closure ("answer by uncovering in pipe chases") but does not impose visible cost or tactical friction. Present in setup and payoff, functional in middle.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The shadowed library at dawn anchors the piece immediately, supplies the crawl space/vent/pipe network that enables the dweller's movement, and the Rare Folios Room/atlas case become the tactical crux. The setting constrains choices (grate behind velvet chair, ducting route) and the dawn light shift at closure ("sunrise found the bindings") charges the final image. Present across all three gates with strong causal pressure. Capped below 8.0 because while essential to logistics, the setting does not impose a visible cost—it facilitates rather than complicates.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The outage timeframe is introduced early ("city's lights flicker after an unexpected outage"), creates the "sapphire hush" atmosphere that allows the tape fragment to surface whispers without panic, and recurs at closure ("The city pulsed again, while the city's lights flicker..."). It shapes the dweller's tactics (waiting for the right conditions) and the ending's restoration of light. Present in setup, middle (tactical enabler), and payoff. Verbatim repetition mid-story without pattern payoff and the vague duration (no clock pressure) limit the score; the outage enables rather than tightens.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The motivation "to become visible to those who need you" is introduced early as a repeated vow, drives the dweller's decision to help the girl, and is reconsidered at closure ("considered how visibility might be crafted from service"). However, the motivation is told more than dramatized—no scene shows the cost of invisibility or a moment where becoming visible is genuinely weighed against remaining hidden. The final choice (leaving an arrow, staying unseen) avoids the friction the vow implies. Present across gates but lacks on-page conflicted pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Sapphire hush" is introduced with the outage, recurs as atmospheric marker ("breathing the sapphire hush as sunrise found the bindings"), and modulates the piece's quiet, watchful tone. Tone remains coherent through beats—no jarring shifts—and the hush intensifies the dweller's patient observation and the girl's solitary search. At closure, the tone charges the final image of sunrise and the etched arrow. Consistent, purposeful, and closure-linked. Capped below 8.0 because tone supports rather than pressures; it does not impose tactical cost or narrow options.</comment>
