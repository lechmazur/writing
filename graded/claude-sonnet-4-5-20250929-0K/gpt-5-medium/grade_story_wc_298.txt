<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is concrete and embodied through grandmother's burned card and micro-choices (giving name to the boy, scattering stories). Interior voice remains consistent and particular ("foolish with hope, yet the foolishness had learned how to hold its breath"). The boy's transformation from soldier's future to scholar's hush is earned through on-page action. Minor slip: the Weaver's palimpsest face borders on decorative metaphor without fully constraining choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the protagonist plants what she will never keep, accepts her ongoing role as tender of listening seeds, with visible cost (scattering grandmother's stories into roots). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraphs. The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—density increases through layered images (bone-hand, ash map, listening seeds) that reweight the "patch holes in the soul" stake. One meaningful deepening occurs when the boy's destiny is bartered and the protagonist's seam closes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard constrains choice: the bone-hand pit holds the boy, the ash map on the card guides action, roots serve as anchor for the final planting. Sensory detail is vivid and selective ("brass light pooled like thin honey," "bones chimed whenever a breeze lost its way"). The burned tarot card functions as micro-setting object, warming and hissing to enable the trammel promise. Spatial choreography remains clear across market/orchard/pit.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—patching grief's holes—is signaled early and tightens when the protagonist encounters the boy with iron shoes. One meaningful turn: bartering the soldier's future for scholar's hush narrows options and forecloses the original path with visible cost (protagonist must plant stories she'll never keep). Agency is decision and renunciation; the Accumulative lens supports pressure through density increase rather than multiple reversals. Cost is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "plant what you will never keep" and "listening seeds" answer the central question of how to mend without possessing. The final image—tending seeds, inlaying meaning to remind the dark it was seen—offers resonant closure without stating a moral. The burned card, bone-hand, and ash map recur with shifting weight. "Foolishness had learned how to hold its breath" earns its insight through prior action. No thematic echo or explicit moralizing mars the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable and locked to protagonist; perceptual signature is distinct ("air tasted of candle soot," "dusky resolve gathered in my chest, flavored with relief and the bite of risk"). Dialogue is minimal, purposeful, and carries subtext (Weaver's "Your card has teeth, but it wants a tongue"). Diction stays consistent and voice-motivated; elevated register fits the fabulist frame. Filter verbs appear but remain voice-appropriate. No head-hopping or unmotivated register shifts.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally with strong opening/closing lines. Information density is high; most sentences advance image, pressure, or character. Minor overwriting in figurative clusters: "palimpsest of old deals, inlaying meaning everywhere the shadows dared to rest" stacks metaphors in one beat. "Inlaying meaning" recurs across three paragraphs, bordering on template cadence but stays legible and pattern-taught. No paraphrase loops or scaffold. Clarity remains intact at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The bartered-destinies market in a catacomb orchard offers fresh synthesis; contracts from ivy stems and river silt, listening seeds as payment—all feel particular to this voice and world. The turn (boy's destiny swapped for scholar's hush, not silence but "a door that listened") arises from established pattern. "Fiercely gentle" applied twice risks cliché but reweights through action. Risk-taking in lyric density succeeds without obscuring causality. Transformation test satisfied: specifics of grandmother's card, ash map, bone-hand are irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist is present throughout and labeled "reckless idealist" in the opening. Two key choices driven by this trait: giving her name to the boy and scattering grandmother's stories as payment. The idealism constrains the final action (planting what she will never keep) and charges closure. Setup early, middle choice clear, ending shaped by the trait.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Burned tarot card appears in opening (carried wrapped in linen), is lifted by Weaver to reveal ash map, warms when boy presses forehead to it, and enables the trammel promise. Returns implicitly in final line ("one card still warm with a tongue"). Setup early, drives middle beats, charges closure. Irreplaceable: the burn/ash/map sequence is specific and causal.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Bartered destinies frames the entire premise and shapes on-page stakes: protagonist seeks the Weaver to trade the boy's soldier future for scholar's hush. The barter mechanics (destiny that refuses you swapped for one that thrums) define the conflict and enable closure. Present in title location (market for bartered destinies), middle action, and implicit in final resolve to "return with more names to trade." Causal and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Fiercely gentle" appears twice: as self-description ("Kindness was my blade, fiercely gentle") and applied to the boy's laugh. It enables the approach (asking with kindness, refusing to blink) and the promise that trammels cruelty but loosens hope. Constrains method but does not drive a distinct turn with visible cost separate from the core action. Setup and thematic presence solid; causal pressure moderate.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Trammel is seeded early (grandmother said the card could trammel a fate), dramatized in the climax ("I spoke the promise my grandmother taught me, in words that trammel cruelty but loosen hope"), and the card hisses as the ash map ripples. The action enables the barter and alters the boy's destiny. Setup, middle use, closure linkage all present. Swappability low but not zero—another ritual verb might serve.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Inlaying meaning" appears three times: Weaver's face described as palimpsest "inlaying meaning everywhere the shadows dared to rest," the card/ash interaction "inlaying meaning everywhere our shadows leaned," and the closing resolve to "go on inlaying meaning everywhere I walked." It names the protagonist's method and charges the final image but does not constrain a middle choice with visible cost. Lyric reprise is purposeful but mechanics remain abstract.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard is anchored early, supplies the bone-hand pit where the boy is found, and the roots into which the protagonist plants listening seeds at closure. Tree roots and bones provide tactile resources (lanterns hung from root-knuckles, bones chime). The setting constrains search, enables discovery, and is indispensable to the final planting. Setup, middle pressure, closure participation all strong.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Half-lit corridors" and "night folded deeper" frame the temporal window but do not tighten decisions. The timeframe evokes atmosphere (candle soot, lanterns, dusky resolve) and supports tone but remains vague. No live clock or urgency that alters tactics. Present in opening and closing as mood anchor; functional but not causal.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation to "patch holes in the soul that grief had chewed" is stated early, dramatized through seeking the Weaver and bartering the boy's destiny, and finds closure in the seam that closes inside the protagonist. The cost (scattering grandmother's stories, ongoing role as tender) creates friction. Desire shapes all major choices and the final image. Setup, beats, and closure all engaged.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Dusky resolve" is named late ("Dusky resolve gathered in my chest, flavored with relief and the bite of risk") but the tone—melancholy determination mixed with hope—is consistent from the opening ("reckless idealist," "stubborn patience") through the final lines ("foolishness had learned how to hold its breath"). Modulates subtly under pressure without breaking. Coherent and charges closure but not irreplaceable as a phrase.</comment>
