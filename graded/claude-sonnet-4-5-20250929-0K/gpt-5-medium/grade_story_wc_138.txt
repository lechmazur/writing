<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The immortal narrator exhibits a consistent perceptual signature—angles whispering rebellion, collecting echoes—and the desire to understand "after goodbye" drives the intrigue with Lio. The final exchange ("might forgive me later") suggests genuine character friction with visible cost (the immortal's boredom gains "edges"). However, the interiority occasionally drifts into abstract philosophizing ("goodbye is a road," "purpose is the closest thing to mortality") that reads more like thematic annotation than embodied contradiction under pressure. Lio's arrival and participation feel somewhat passive; his "face that had sworn not to forgive" is declared but his agency in the corridor remains observational.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who (immortal collector), where (prismatic escondite), and the solar storm context within the opening lines. The closure lands on-page: the amulet's curse revises its contract, the immortal gains edges/purpose, and Lio's potential forgiveness reweights the goodbye. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—density and metaphoric layering build toward the corridor revelation and the final reconfiguration of goodbye as "blueprint of the next room." One meaningful deepening occurs when the corridor appears and redefines parting as infrastructure. Cost is felt (boredom sharpened, forgiveness deferred) but remains somewhat abstract rather than a concrete forfeiture that forecloses a path with unmistakable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The prismatic escondite, obsidian mirrors, and auroral storm provide vivid sensory anchors filtered through the narrator's dimensionally aware perspective. The storm and magnetic fields enable the ritual, and the prisms "tasted his breath" and "flickered approval," constraining the attempt. Spatial choreography is mostly clear (shelf, trapezoid of mirrors, corridor). However, the escondite functions more as atmospheric stage dressing than as a feature that directly alters a choice at closure; the corridor itself does the constraining work, and the final image pivots on relational stance rather than environmental pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering what happens after goodbye—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through the storm-fed ritual, the appearance of the corridor, and the payments extracted (narrator's frost-throated memories, Lio's unforgiveness softened). One meaningful tightening occurs when the corridor demands "wages of witness," forcing both characters to surrender something. The cost is legible (the immortal's boredom gains edges, Lio's refusal is revised) but feels more conceptual than a concrete forfeiture that narrows future options. The escalation under the Accumulative lens is solid but not unmistakable; the corridor sequence deepens understanding without a sharp pivot or visible price that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The theme—goodbye as infrastructure rather than ending—emerges organically from the corridor's revelation and the final exchange with Lio. The piece avoids overt moralizing; the closing image of "goodbye is not a door closing; it is the blueprint of the next room" reweights prior material without didacticism. Subtext operates in the immortal's collected echoes, Lio's courage "of a drowning man," and the prisms as "staunch conspirators." The amulet's curse revising its contract from blood to stories provides a resonant, non-literal answer. Minor weakness: occasional phrases ("purpose is the closest thing to mortality an immortal can borrow") lean toward thematic echo, but the closure image rescues the effect.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct and stylized—lyric compression, elevated diction ("spatial mutiny," "vowels," "dialectics of things nearly born"), and a consistent perceptual signature. Psychic distance remains stable in first person; no head-hopping. The dialogue with Lio ("he might forgive me later") feels natural and advances the relational arc. However, the register occasionally drifts into poetic abstraction that obscures agency ("corners filing demands to curve," "floor and ceiling trading rumors") without clear payoff, and some figurative language clusters densely in high-pressure beats without pattern-teaching. The voice is memorable but risks decorative overwriting in moments that warrant sharper propulsion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The prose is rhythmically controlled and imagistic, with strong opening and closing lines. Sentence variety supports the lyric mode. However, multiple issues accumulate: paraphrase loops ("Hushed thunder breathed outside" / "Hushed thunder is the dialect of things that are nearly born"), template cadence in adjacent lines ("I set… I told… I wanted…"), and dense figurative stacking in peak beats ("prisms tasted his breath, fragment flashed a wound-colored grin") that blurs clarity. The Text-Artifact screen flags synonym churn around "hushed thunder" and elevated diction that drifts from the POV's immediacy under pressure. These artifacts don't obscure causality but do dull momentum in the corridor sequence, the story's highest-stakes moment.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of immortal ennui, magnetic ritual, and the metaphysics of parting feels specific and non-obvious. The corridor as cartography of unsaid farewells and the amulet's revised contract (stories over blood) offer fresh angles. The setting and method (prismatic escondite, magnetic coils during solar storm) are distinctive. However, the core emotional arc—immortal seeks meaning through connection with a former lover—touches familiar template territory, and the resolution (mutual witnessing softens old wounds) trends toward expected reconciliation. The piece transforms its premise through voice and world-building but doesn't take a bold structural or moral risk that would elevate originality into the high band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setup: present from the opening ("bored immortal who collects echoes"). Development: arranges the intrigue and performs the ritual, makes micro-choices (whispers to prisms, pays with memories). Payoff: present in the ending ("edges now… sharpened into tools"). The immortal's agency drives two key beats (setting up the ritual, summoning Lio) and the closure reconfigures their boredom. However, much of the corridor sequence is observational rather than decisional; the immortal pays tribute but doesn't face a stark choice that narrows options. The boredom gaining edges is felt cost but somewhat abstract. The element is integral but not indispensable; a different seeker archetype could occupy the role with adjustments.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setup: introduced early ("cursed amulet fragment on a trapezoid of obsidian mirrors"). Development: feeds the ritual via magnetic fields, "flashed a wound-colored grin," demands tribute. Payoff: "pocketed the cursed amulet fragment, feeling its temper cool and its curse revise its contract… now it preferred stories to blood." The fragment appears in three distinct beats (placement, activation, closure transformation) and its revision charges the ending. The curse's shift from blood to stories ties directly to the thematic discovery. Removing this object would break the ritual's mechanics and the final reconfiguration. Strong integration with visible cost and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setup: signaled early ("dimensional… angles whisper… rebellion," "spatial mutiny raised its quiet flag"). Development: the mutiny manifests as floor/ceiling trading rumors, corners demanding to curve, enabling the corridor. Payoff: "The spatial mutiny was not destruction; it was a union strike, demanding wages of witness." The concept shapes the middle beat (corridor appearance) and is named at closure. However, the mechanics remain metaphorical; it's unclear how spatial rebellion concretely constrains tactics or alters options beyond enabling the corridor. The concept enriches atmosphere and theme but functions more as backdrop than active pressure. Legible early–final reprise lifts it into mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Setup: introduced early ("dimensionally aware, which means the angles whisper to me"). Development: enables perception of geometric intrigue and facilitates the ritual ("I answered through magnetic fields to coax space into confession"). Payoff: mentioned obliquely in the ending plan ("through magnetic fields I would summon new corridors"). The trait is present and logically consistent but does not constrain a choice or impose a visible tradeoff. It reads as a label that grants the narrator magical capability without on-page cost or friction. No moment where dimensional awareness creates a dilemma or forces a sacrifice. Functional but swappable with "magically attuned" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Setup: "I had arranged a small intrigue to ensure I was not the only witness… leaked a rumor through the observatories." Development: the intrigue brings Lio, whose presence and payment (unforgiveness) are necessary for the corridor's success. Payoff: the intrigue's success enables the mutual witnessing and the relational shift at closure. The action drives two beats (Lio's arrival, the ritual) and ties to the ending. However, the intrigue itself is summarized rather than dramatized; we don't see the arrangement or its risks. The element is important but could be replaced with "summoning" or "invitation" with minor edits. Solid integration but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setup: signaled early ("through magnetic fields to coax space into confession"). Development: "We tuned the coils until the storm's red auroras braided around the fragment, feeding it… Through magnetic fields I asked space to show me its minutes after a farewell." Payoff: "Through magnetic fields I would summon new corridors when the sun grew furious." The method appears in three beats and shapes the ritual's mechanics. The storm and magnetic coils are physically present and necessary. However, the mechanics remain somewhat abstract; it's unclear how magnetic tuning differs from other magical means. The method is integral to the ritual but the specificity is ornamental rather than tactically constraining. Mid-band for presence across beats and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Setup: opening line ("The prismatic escondite hid beneath the auroral shelf"). Development: the escondite houses the ritual, its prisms "flowered in spectrum," "tasted his breath," and "flickered approval." Payoff: mentioned in passing ("the prisms had contracted") and as "staunch conspirators glad to have been useful." The setting enables the ritual and provides sensory texture. The prisms act (tasting, flickering) but don't constrain a choice; the narrator promises them exile if they obey, but no exile consequence materializes. The setting is atmospheric and present across beats but largely interchangeable with another ritual chamber. Lyric reprise and involvement in two beats lift it to mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Setup: "during a solar storm because storms make doors honest." Development: "the storm bent the planet's veins," "the storm's red auroras braided around the fragment, feeding it." Payoff: "Outside, the storm kept teaching the sky how to glow without permission." The timeframe enables the ritual and recurs at closure. However, the storm functions more as enabling condition than ticking clock; no moment where time pressure forces a rushed choice or tactic shift. The storm is narratively necessary (provides energy) but does not tighten decisions. Present across three beats with closure reprise, but passive rather than pressuring.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setup: "I wanted to discover what happens after goodbye, not to mourn what cannot die." Development: the narrator dramatizes this by summoning Lio ("he had given me the cleanest goodbye I had ever received") and conducting the ritual. Payoff: "After goodbye, we learned, the universe folds a seat for the one who watches the one who leaves… goodbye is not a door closing; it is the blueprint of the next room." The motivation drives the intrigue, the ritual, and is answered at closure with visible insight. However, the desire is stated more than conflicted; no moment where the narrator hesitates or pays an unexpected price for this knowledge. The motivation is essential to the arc and shapes the ending, but lacks friction or competing wants that would raise cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setup: "Hushed thunder breathed outside." Development: "They answered with a hush that sounded like thunder holding its breath. Hushed thunder is the dialect of things that are nearly born." Payoff: "He laughed in the same key as the hushed thunder… Outside, camouflaged in aurora, hushed thunder kept the beat." The tone recurs across four beats and charges the final image, embodying anticipation and latent power. The phrase is consistent and modulates with pressure (breath held, dialect, keeping the beat). However, "hushed thunder" is somewhat oxymoronic and risks ornamental repetition; the tone is more textural accent than structural constraint. Strong presence and closure linkage, but the element is more mood than force that alters tactics.</comment>
