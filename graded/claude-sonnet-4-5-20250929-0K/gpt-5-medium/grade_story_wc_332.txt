<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The librarian POV is consistent and the voice maintains character-particular perception throughout ("kept a watercolor palette…for catching the wash of first light"). Interiority is heavily lyric and relies on figurative language rather than embodied contradiction; the decision to "escort to its border" and "let it run into morning" shows stance but feels more declared than wrestled. The dream's agency overshadows protagonist struggle; the librarian observes and follows more than fights internal conflict. Micro-choices exist but lack visible tradeoff cost that would elevate character work into the 8+ range.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds through layered images (palette, plates, cipher) toward a final reconfiguration where the dream is "named without chains" and the library "opened its throat." Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the protagonist refuses to turn around, sustaining luminous absence as principle, and the cost is felt in renunciation ("Some absences must remain luminous"). Orientation anchors who/where/when by line 3. One meaningful deepening occurs when the sea "asked what price I set on waking" and the protagonist answers, narrowing the pursuit's nature. The lens holds and closure lands with conceptual cost; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The archipelago, library, and palette function as micro-setting that constrains choice: the sea's question forces stance, the palette wells fill "like held breaths," and the library shelves "leaned in as if listening is a structure." Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("salt footprints in the stacks," "foam" stitching islands). The palette reappears at closure to "drain…light…a slow transfusion," charging the final image. Spatial choreography across causeways and the east door remains coherent. The watercolor palette and glass plates function as tools that enable the core action and recur with reweighted meaning at the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: capture and understand the runaway dream without possessing it. Pressure accumulates through the cipher's resistance, the sea's question, and the dream's return. One meaningful deepening occurs when the protagonist answers the sea and refuses ownership, narrowing the ethical frame. Agency is decision and renunciation: opening the east door to let the dream run. Cost is legible in "I refused to turn around" and the filing under "Beginnings, knowing they would never be checked out." Escalation is textural rather than causal, fitting the Accumulative lens; no antagonist required.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: the tension between pursuit and possession, naming without chains, luminous absence. The palette, plates, and cipher recur with shifting meaning; the final image of "my ink is water" and "passage, not possession" reweights the opening hush. Subtext operates in gesture ("brushed my shoulder like fog") and the protagonist's refusal to turn. No overt moralizing; the ending offers a resonant answer through action and image. The dream's return "to be named without chains" and the library's new voice avoid tidy resolution while landing thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with consistent lyric register and perceptual signature: the narrator notices light, breath, whispers, and grammatical metaphors ("runnels revealed grammar"). Distance is controlled; no head-hopping. Diction remains within the librarian's elevated, image-soaked lexicon throughout. The prose rhythm modulates with pressure: shorter bursts during the sea encounter, longer cadences at closure. Filter verbs appear occasionally ("I saw the dream running") but remain voice-motivated. No dialogue to judge. Purposeful compression ("It left salt footprints") and recurring metaphors (light as medium) are taught early and coherent at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high and sustained across nearly every sentence, creating lush texture but risking overwriting in peak beats: "a quivering fish," "unfurled like a letter from childhood," "shelves leaned in as if listening is a structure." Mixed metaphors are rare and vehicles remain coherent. Information density is solid; most lines advance image or stance. Template cadence appears in repeated "It…" openers and "I…" stems across adjacent lines, particularly in the final third, applying −0.4 for scaffold loops. No paraphrase cycles. Sentence openings vary; rhythm is purposeful. Clarity remains high despite density; no causality obscured by prose.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of librarian, dream-cipher, sunrise photography, and watercolor palette as archival method is specific and non-obvious. The frame transforms familiar pursuit-of-dream material through the ethic of "passage, not possession" and the technical constraint of light-based capture. Emotional particularity ("escaping is a kind of address") avoids generic epiphany. The final stance—filing under "Beginnings," catalog as "sunrise," ink as "water"—feels earned and memorable. Risk is present in sustained lyric mode and refusal of conventional plot climax. Transformation test: the arc depends on these exact particulars and could not be transferred wholesale to another setting without loss.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The odd-hour librarian is present throughout, POV character who decides to pursue the dream, answers the sea's question, presses the shutter, traces the cipher, opens the east door, and refuses to turn around. Early signal (opener), multiple beats (pursuit, sea encounter, developing plates, opening door), causal pressure (answers shape tactics), closure linkage (files photographs and states final stance). Swappability is moderate—another archivist role could substitute with minor edits. Cost is tied to the character's renunciation and ongoing waiting. Strong integration but not fully indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The watercolor palette is introduced early ("kept a watercolor palette on the counter"), reappears when the sea fills the wells ("filled the palette wells until they shone"), is used to bleed dawn into frames ("From the palette, I bled…"), traces the cipher ("traced them with a fingertip wet from the palette"), and drains light into photograph and map at closure ("let the light drain from palette to photograph to map"). Setup, development (enables capture), payoff (shapes closure transfusion). Causal pressure: the palette as tool for catching light enables the core method. Specificity: watercolor wells as receptacle for light is unique. Closure linkage strong. High integration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The cipher of longing is named early ("whispers carried a cipher of longing"), drives middle action ("etched those murmurs onto glass plates"), and resolves when "the cipher…resolved into routes" that the protagonist traces. Setup (line 16), development (etching, attempting to decode), payoff (resolved lines and the dream's path revealed). Causal pressure: the cipher's resistance shapes tactics and the pursuit. Closure linkage: resolved cipher enables the dream's return and the protagonist's final gesture. Specificity moderate; another puzzle or code could substitute with edits. Cost tied to decoding effort and renunciation.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Paints with light" is present as descriptor ("islanders said I painted with light") and method (pressing the shutter, bleeding dawn into frames, draining light). Early signal (line 8), development (sunrise capture process), payoff (light transfusion at closure). The trait enables the core action and constrains method to photography. Cost: the fragile, time-bound nature of light imposes urgency. Swappability moderate—another light-based craft could replace with edits. The trait is functional and recurs but not fully indispensable; slightly above mid-band due to closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Vitalize" appears once ("whose absence I wished to vitalize") in the sea's question, naming the protagonist's goal. Setup (mid-story), no distinct middle beat where vitalization as action is attempted, payoff weak (the dream returns but vitalization is not foregrounded in closure image). Causal pressure low; the term could be replaced with "honor," "trace," or "preserve" without structural change. Closure linkage indirect—filing and ongoing waiting relate but the exact verb does not charge the final image. Functional mention, not essential.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Sunrise photography is signaled early ("Through sunrise photography, I harvested hours"), structures the pursuit (carrying camera, pressing the shutter, developing plates), and delivers the artifact that enables closure (the plates laid among atlases, light drained into map). Setup (line 10), development (multiple beats: aiming lens, pressing shutter, cooling plates), payoff (plates as medium for transfusion and filing). Causal pressure: the method produces the images that resolve the cipher. Specificity: dawn-timing and photographic emulsion are integral. Closure linkage strong. High integration but slightly shy of indispensable—another time-sensitive capture method could substitute with moderate edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The whispering archipelago is present from the opener ("whispering archipelago waited"), provides coordinates and the cipher ("archipelago whispered coordinates"), supplies the causeways and islands the protagonist crosses, and at closure "keeps breathing around the windows" and trades stories with the library. Setup (line 2), development (spatial navigation, cipher source), payoff (ongoing exchange and final breath imagery). Causal pressure: the setting's whispers drive the pursuit and its geography constrains movement. Closure linkage: the archipelago's voice persists and frames the ending stance. Specificity high—island geography and whisper-logic are unique. Strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"In the hush of improbable beginnings" opens the piece and "I begin again" closes it, framing the timeframe as cyclical/iterative. The phrase recurs in final lines. Setup (opener), no distinct middle development where the timeframe constrains a choice, payoff (returns as closure frame). Pressure is atmospheric, not clock-driven; no urgent deadline tightens tactics. Swappability high—another time-of-day or threshold phrase could replace with minor edits. Lyric reprise reweights the opening but causal role is weak. Mid-low band: present, framingly consistent, but does not narrow options or impose cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Motivation to capture the runaway dream is stated early ("I worked to capture a runaway dream"), tested at the sea encounter ("what price I set on waking"), refined ("a dream should not be owned, only escorted"), and enacted at closure (opening the door, refusing to turn, filing the photographs). Setup (line 11), development (sea dialogue, shutter press, tracing cipher), payoff (renunciation and filing). Causal pressure: the desire drives all movement and the sea's question forces ethical stance. Friction between capture and release is dramatized in choice. Closure linkage strong. Specificity moderate—another elusive goal could substitute with edits. High integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Tone of "luminous absence" is established early (salt footprints as "luminous absence," dream's presence through negation) and sustained through imagery of light, hush, breath, and translucency. The tone modulates with pressure: quieter in library, intensified at sea encounter, reflective at closure. Coherence high across all beats. The final image ("Some absences must remain luminous") charges closure with tonal recurrence and the protagonist's stance embodies the tone. Specificity high—the oxymoron is unique and integral to theme. Strong integration; tone shapes perception and choice throughout.</comment>
