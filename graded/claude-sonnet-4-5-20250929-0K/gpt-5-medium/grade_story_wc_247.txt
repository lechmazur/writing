<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Arin's interiority leans heavily on poetic abstraction rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The "joyful sorrow" and repeated gestures read more as atmospheric texture than specific psychological tension driving choices. The advisor remains a cipher—breath and whisper without distinct resistance or complication. Micro-choices exist (holding the clapper, signing to water) but feel ornamental rather than foreclosing paths with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density of lyric imagery building toward a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is present by ~120 words (harbor, pier, Arin). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—Arin walks home having "tuned" memory by mapping silence, with the promise to carry the song forward—but the cost remains conceptual and diffuse rather than sharp. The final bow and walk feel like graceful exit rather than a stakes-reweighting moment with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The harbor setting supplies vivid sensory anchors (tide hum, rope murmurs, barnacle glitter, pylon shivers) and recurs throughout, but does not meaningfully constrain Arin's choices or supply friction. The camera, bell, and boards are handled on the page, yet their material properties do not alter tactics. Micro-setting is present but decorative rather than pressuring the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—"translate silence into music"—is signaled early but remains abstract. The bell-ring and pencil sketches constitute actions, yet no genuine tightening or trade-off narrows options; Arin encounters permission and cooperation rather than resistance. Escalation under the Accumulative lens would require density increase or cadence shift that reweights the stake with cost; here the final image repeats the premise without demonstrable loss or foreclosed path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the mapping metaphor and the refrain "when no one remembers you." The final image—song as coordinate system, strangers asked to "listen with their scars"—offers a resonant non-literal answer. However, several lines verge on thesis statement ("music loves what vanishes," "song remembers you") rather than trusting image alone, and the closure paragraph risks light moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, lyric, and purposefully compressed with patterned syntax ("Here is a rest, here a bridge, here a window hosts a held breath"). Perceptual signature is present in the focus on silence, shadow, and negative space. No head-hopping; POV remains stable. Psychic distance is controlled. The recurring template cadence ("They [verb], [noun] [verb]") appears across multiple beats without full pattern-teaching, but does not obscure clarity at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout ("tide hummed like glass," "ring through milk," "bell of unstruck light") with occasional register drift into elevated diction that strains the POV's lexicon. Several adjacent lines loop conceptually: the camera's "empty belly" and "nothing was the subject" rephrase the same idea; "coordinates" and "silence contained rhythm" repeat the mapping conceit without advancing it. Propulsion is present but slowed by synonym churn. The closure image is clear despite the density.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The premise—mapping silence into music via sign language at a moonlit harbor—synthesizes multiple elements into a specific, non-generic frame. The lyric mode and compression feel purposeful rather than derivative. However, the "artist translating abstract experience" template is familiar, and the piece does not transform it through unexpected friction or complication. Risk-taking is moderate; the accumulative design heightens atmosphere without obscuring clarity.</comment>
