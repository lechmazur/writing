<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's "chivalrous thief" identity and apprentice status are told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. Interiority leans heavily on metaphor ("fear teaches but wonder persuades") that reads as writerly insight rather than character-particular thought under pressure. The final choice to swap chess pieces feels motivated by the quest structure more than by embodied internal conflict. Embodiment is present in "my hands trembled" and "my gloves shook," but the vast reflective middle distances emotion from immediate pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on the page: the board "inhales" the wrongness out, mountains return, and the sky is amended—a clear Decisive Change with conceptual cost (the protagonist has bound themselves to future travel and mending). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through the sequence of chess-piece swaps that each release weather knotted to memory. One meaningful deepening occurs when the queen reveals a letter addressed to the protagonist before birth, reweighting the stakes from mechanical repair to existential vocation. However, orientation is delayed—"who" is clear early, but "where" (inside the spire corridor) and "when" (sky is wrong, but no temporal anchor) are diffuse until the chessboard beat, pushing past the ~120-word guideline without clear payoff for the delay; apply −0.4 for orientation debt and cap Q3 at 7.0 per the test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The icebound spire, heart notch, spiral corridor, and chessboard of ice and ash provide vivid, selective detail filtered through the protagonist's cautious wonder. The pocket sundial lid constrains the method of entry and charges the final image by catching the queen's light. Spatial choreography is coherent across the ascent, corridor, board, and window. However, the spire's interior is more atmospheric than tactile—lamps "lean," squares "whisper," but the protagonist's physical interaction with the environment (cold, footing, sound) remains thin in the middle third, reducing the setting's pressure on choice. Capped at 7.0 due to orientation debt applied in Q2.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—amending the sky's wrongness by swapping weather-knotted secrets with mercy-bound promises—is signaled early and tightens through the sequence of piece swaps. Each swap (pawn, knight, rook, bishop, queen) narrows options by binding the protagonist to their catalog of thefts and future travel. The final queen swap forecloses the path of wage-seeking and crystallizes the vocation. Pressure accumulates under the Accumulative lens, with visible cost in the protagonist's "trembling certainty" and the teacher's relief. The window showing ships in the stratosphere complicates but does not resolve, consistent with Situational allowances. No redundant loops; each swap advances the board's transformation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the interplay of theft/mending, memory/mercy, and wonder/fear, all dramatized via the chess-piece swaps rather than stated. The final image—"carrying play like prayer"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of vocation without moralizing. The letter inside the queen ("embrace the unknown with open arms, and not to ask for wages") risks thematic echo, but it is framed as inherited instruction rather than author thesis, and the protagonist's response (trembling certainty, swapping with their own promise) embodies the theme in action. The "sacredly playful" mood and the board approving "my braid of penance and play" weave motif and theme tightly, avoiding the explain-everything trap.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>First-person POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature: metaphor-dense, wonder-oriented idiom ("frost caught in breath," "rain on iron"). The teacher appears only at the end with brief dialogue that feels natural and goal-driven, distinguishing his relief-heavy tone from the protagonist's lyric introspection. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("sacredly playful," "braid of penance and play") that reads more writerly than character-immediate under peak pressure, and the reflective middle softens psychic distance when urgency should tighten it. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping or tense breaks. Elision of the climb and entry mechanics is purposeful and does not withhold facts the POV knows.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense and often vivid ("thawwater leaving a tight throat," "lantern with wet wick"), but the metaphor frequency in high-pressure beats—especially the chess-swap sequence—risks overwriting without pattern-teaching or clear payoff at closure; apply −0.4 for density without full integration. Some phrases loop conceptually: "trembled" / "shook," "breath" / "sigh" / "exhale," and "swapped" echoes across six beats without fresh variation. Sentence openings vary well, and no paraphrase loops appear. The final paragraph shifts to dialogue and summary, flattening the closure image's propulsion slightly. Information density is high, but the figurative load in the middle third slows momentum when urgency is signaled.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of chivalrous thief, weather-tuning spire, and chess-piece secret-swapping is specific and non-obvious, with the pocket sundial lid and teacher inheritance adding lived-in particularity. The "apprentice of wonder" frame and the letter-before-birth twist feel fresh in combination. However, the redemption-through-mending arc and the mentor's validating appearance trend toward familiar fantasy-quest templates without a final reconfiguration that challenges the premise or introduces moral calculus beyond the protagonist's stated vocation. The "sacredly playful" tone and the board's sentient approval elevate mood, but the ending grants symmetric satisfaction—mountains return, teacher smiles, vocation affirmed—without ambiguity or counter-pressure, reducing risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The chivalrous thief identity is signaled early ("sworn to take only what harm has taken first") and frames the protagonist's decision to swap pieces, replacing wardens' hoarded weather with mercy-bound promises. This choice drives the final turn (board inhales wrongness out, mountains return) and alters the protagonist's future tactics (bound to travel and mending). However, "chivalrous" is asserted more than tested—no moment where the protagonist must choose between self-interest and the code under pressure, and the teacher's validation at the end removes friction. Setup present, development in the swap sequence, closure participation clear; causal pressure moderate; swappable with "guilt-driven mage" or similar with minor edits. Deduct −0.3 for told-only trait, −0.4 for swappability. Band guidance: two gates + causal work → 6.0–6.9 range; land mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The pocket sundial lid appears in beat one (received from sky warden, cracked constellations), beat two (coaxes spire open at heart notch), beat four (pressed to second notch, opens window), and beat five (catches queen's light, wakes bell). It enables entry, complicates the quest by revealing the wrong sky, and charges the final swap by throwing light into the rafters. Setup early, development across multiple beats, closure participation strong. Causal pressure high (narrows options, enables tactics), specificity high (cracked constellations, warden's faith crisis), cost connection present (carries warden's unfinished vow, protagonist inherits the burden). Irreplaceability strong—its exact properties (lid, constellations, light-catching) matter. Apply +0.3 early signal, +0.9 two beats, +1.2 causal pressure, +1.2 closure linkage, +0.6 specificity, +0.4 cost = base 3.0 + 4.6 = 7.6, round to 7.8 for tight integration across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The "apprentice of wonder" title is introduced early (teacher named the protagonist) and revisited at closure ("truest apprentice of wonder"). It shapes the protagonist's method—"I learn by listening to astonishment," "fear teaches but wonder persuades"—and the "sacredly playful" mood coheres with it. However, it functions more as thematic frame than tactical constraint; no beat where wonder-driven perception opens a path closed to fear-driven characters, or where the apprentice role forces a trade-off. The concept is present in the protagonist's voice and choices but does not redefine options on the page. Setup present, closure reprise strong, middle development weak (label-only). Apply +0.6 early signal, +0.8 closure linkage, −0.5 ornamental middle, −0.4 swappability (could be "student of curiosity" with minor edits). Base 3.0 + 0.5 = 3.5, but lyric reprise and thematic coherence lift to low-5s. Land 5.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Sacredly playful" is introduced mid-story ("the air was sacredly playful, like monks teaching sparrows to bow then letting them steal incense") and echoed in the board's approval of "my braid of penance and play." It characterizes the protagonist's method (swapping secrets as chess moves, treating mending as play-prayer) and modulates the tone through the swap sequence, preventing grim solemnity. However, it does not constrain a choice with visible cost—no moment where playfulness risks failure or where sacred duty clashes with levity. Setup mid-story (−0.3 for late first appearance past first third), development present in swap sequence mood, closure participation via "play like prayer" phrase. Apply +0.4 one beat, +0.5 causal pressure (enables tone, not tactics), +0.8 closure linkage, −0.3 late, −0.5 ornamental (label-only in middle), −0.3 swappability. Base 3.0 + 0.6 = 3.6, but closure phrase reweights and tone coherence is strong; lift to 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Amend" is the core action: protagonist is asked to "amend what he could not" (warden's request), swaps pieces to "amend my catalog of thefts," and the teacher says "you…gave back everything the feast had demanded." Every major turn traces to amending—entering the spire, swapping pieces, releasing wrongness, restoring the sky. Setup early (warden's request), development across all swaps, closure participation decisive (mountains return "apologizing," clouds "practice casting shadows again"). Causal pressure very high (redefines the quest from theft to restoration), specificity high (amending weather knotted to memory via mercy-bound promises), cost connection strong (binds protagonist to future travel, renounces wages). Irreplaceability strong—"repair" or "fix" would miss the ethical nuance of amending harm. Apply +0.6 early signal, +1.4 three beats, +1.6 causal pressure, +1.8 closure linkage, +0.7 specificity, +0.5 cost = base 3.0 + 6.6 = 9.6, but swappability with "restore" at cost of nuance and slight late clarity of method cap at 8.1.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The method—swapping hand-carved chess pieces with secrets inside—is signaled early ("My method tonight would be swapping hand-carved chess pieces with secrets inside, a trick learned in debt halls") and executed across five beats (pawn, knight, rook, bishop, queen). Each swap involves opening a piece, reading/responding to its secret, and replacing it with a carved piece holding a counter-promise. The mechanics matter: the board "approves," squares widen, wrongness pours out as starlings. Setup early, development across multiple beats, closure participation decisive (final queen swap triggers the board's inhalation and sky's restoration). Causal pressure very high (narrows options beat by beat, each swap reweights weather-memory knot), specificity high (hand-carved, secrets inside, counteroffer structure), cost connection strong (protagonist binds self to future mending and renounces wages). Irreplaceability strong—generic "ritual" would lose the debt-hall ethic and the chess-as-weather-game conceit. Apply +0.7 early signal, +1.4 three beats, +1.5 causal pressure, +1.7 closure linkage, +0.8 specificity, +0.6 cost = base 3.0 + 6.7 = 9.7, but round down to 7.9 due to slight mid-beat summary ("every swap sang") that distances one swap from full dramatization.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The icebound spire above the clouds is introduced in the opening line and provides the quest's destination and challenge. It "keeps the wind tuned" (world logic), contains the spiral corridor and chessboard chamber, and offers the window view of ships in the stratosphere (complication). The spire's height and isolation create urgency (sky is wrong, world dissonant), and the heart notch + bell mechanics constrain entry and closure. Setup immediate, development via corridor and board geography, closure participation strong (bell wakes, corridor locks protagonist at board, window shows mountains return). Causal pressure moderate (spire as container, not active constraint on tactics within), specificity high (icebound, above clouds, wind-tuning function), cost connection moderate (access requires sundial lid, but no environmental cost inside). Spatial choreography clear. Apply +0.8 early signal, +0.9 two beats, +0.8 causal pressure, +1.2 closure linkage, +0.7 specificity = base 3.0 + 4.4 = 7.4, but −0.1 for static interior (lamps, board) that does not alter protagonist's moves. Land 7.3.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"When the sky is wrong" is the opening temporal marker and recurs ("why the sky is wrong," window showing ocean where mountains should be). It frames the quest's urgency—morning "stopped arriving on time," weather knotted to memory—but does not tighten decisions beat by beat. No live clock or countdown; the protagonist works "with cautious abandon" but without time pressure escalating across swaps. The wrongness is repaired at closure (sky "answered," mountains return), linking timeframe to outcome, but the middle sequence could occur in any order without time cost. Setup present, closure participation strong (wrongness resolved), middle development weak (no escalation tied to duration). Apply +0.5 early signal, +0.9 closure linkage, −0.6 vague middle (no temporal tightening), −0.5 swappable ("during the crisis" would function identically). Base 3.0 + 0.3 = 3.3, but closure linkage and thematic weight (sky as moral/meteorological state) lift to 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The motivation "to embrace the unknown with open arms" is revealed late (inside the queen, letter from the wind) and retrospectively frames the protagonist's entire quest. It is dramatized in the protagonist's choice to enter the spire ("cautious abandon"), to swap pieces without knowing the board's response, and to accept the final cost (travel, no wages). The protagonist's trembling hands and gloves signal friction between fear and commitment. However, the letter's phrasing is abstract and arrives too late to shape earlier choices—prior beats read as duty to the warden rather than embrace of the unknown. Setup late (final third, −0.8), development weak (told-only in letter), closure participation strong (final swap embodies acceptance, travel promised). Apply +0.5 one beat, +0.9 causal pressure (frames final choice), +1.2 closure linkage, −0.8 late, −0.5 summary-only (letter tells motivation rather than showing friction earlier), −0.4 swappability ("to trust the wind" would work). Base 3.0 + 0.9 = 3.9, but closure embodiment (trembling certainty, renouncing wages) and thematic resonance lift to 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Cautious abandon" is introduced early ("I came with cautious abandon, wanting to help yet unsure of every step that creaked") and modulates through the story: trembling hands at opening, "sacredly playful" mood in the middle, "trembling certainty" at the final swap. The tone coheres across turns—fear and wonder in tension—and charges the final image ("carrying play like prayer"). It reflects the protagonist's internal contradiction (duty vs. uncertainty) and shapes the narrative voice (metaphor-dense, wonder-oriented). Setup present, development across beats (caution in each swap, abandon in pressing forward), closure participation strong (tone crystallizes in final phrase). Apply +0.6 early signal, +0.9 two beats (opening/middle/end modulation), +0.9 causal pressure (tone reflects stakes), +1.3 closure linkage (charges final image), +0.5 specificity. Base 3.0 + 4.2 = 7.2, but −0.1 for slight label-only middle ("sacredly playful" asserted more than enacted in word choice). Land 7.1.</comment>
