<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lyr's motivation to unmask Serane is clear and his patient orchestration demonstrates consistent character logic. The diminutive titan's choices drive key turns—arranging the books, deploying the ink pellet—but his interiority remains abstract ("regally unpretentious," "smallest of titans") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses under pressure. Serane's arc from confidence to confession shows progression, yet her emotional shifts feel telescoped; the line "tears brilliant as a forfeit" labels rather than dramatizes the cost. The final moment where Lyr "swept the fallen pride into a pan" literalizes metaphor in a way that flattens embodied emotion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story teaches an accumulative/textural lens early (library breathing, dust motes as stars, the rune of drift) and sustains it through layered imagery. Orientation anchors—who (Lyr, Serane), where (temple library), when (across shifting constellations)—arrive by ~15% but remain atmospheric rather than concrete, generating mild disorientation that resolves by midpoint without penalty since the pattern serves the lyric design. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Serane withdraws her claim, Lyr seals the scrap in a glossary, and the library's recursive calm returns—Earned Stasis with visible social cost (the prevented coronation, her public undoing). The rune of drift functions as both mechanism and thematic anchor, aligning past and present to force truth, which tightens options and charges the ending image of the ink pellet "like potential thunder."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ancient temple library is vividly realized through selective, purposeful detail: "dust motes spiraled as if stars rehearsing," the rune of drift "pale as a healed scar," shelves that slide slightly in time. The setting constrains Serane's path—she must follow the bookmarks, the library rearranges context—and the skylight fracture at her confession charges the closure. The reliquary, ink pellet, and vellum leaves function as micro-setting that drives the plot. Minor spatial vagueness (where exactly does Serane stand relative to Lyr when the pellet rolls?) and the retinue's unexplained withdrawal without orders slightly soften the choreography, keeping the score below 7.5.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—unmasking the pretender—is signaled early and drives all major beats: Lyr's cryptic messages, Serane's arrival, the guided reading sequence, the ink pellet test, and her withdrawal. One meaningful tightening occurs when the pellet rolls across Serane's finger and "ink recognized kinship," forcing confession through physical test rather than argument alone. The accumulative lens supports a deepening rather than a traditional reversal; pressure coheres as Serane moves from confidence ("glass looks stronger than it is when light flatters it") to undoing ("tears brilliant as a forfeit"). The cost is legible—she withdraws her claim, the coronation is canceled, her chosen name blurs—and Lyr's agency (arranging mirrors, deploying the pellet) forecloses her path with visible consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from action and image: truth as patient unraveling, the library as arbiter that "let them crumble with a graceful collapse of accumulated lies," the power of precise documentation ("a comma that...severed bastards from heirs"). The ink pellet and rune of drift serve as motifs that constrain choice rather than ornament. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—"Not all truths require trumpets; some rest between definitions, exact as a heartbeat measured"—that reweights prior material without moralizing. One weak line: "I did not swing blades; he arranged mirrors and waited for pride to trip" tells the strategy overtly rather than letting it emerge. The final image of the pellet "like potential thunder" charges closure with conceptual cost and implies the wider ripple of the revealed truth.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV remains stable, filtering through Lyr's patient, precise perceptual signature: "bookworm-chewed margins," "swept the fallen pride into a pan." Voice is distinct and controlled, with syntactic variety supporting the lyric accumulation. However, elevated diction occasionally strays from the focalizer's grounded idiom into ornamental register: "retinue glittered like borrowed noon," "eyelash the law's shadow," "scrolls exhaled dust like prayers." These metaphors read as authorial rather than character-particular, creating mild distance drift. Serane's single line of dialogue ("I am not what you hoped") carries appropriate subtext, and the closing cadence sustains momentum without loops.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully and figurative density is high but uneven; some images land with precision ("ink pellet rolled, leaving a dark note across her finger") while others stack without clear propulsion ("glittered like borrowed noon," "each eyelash the law's shadow," "tears brilliant as a forfeit" in quick succession). Template cadence appears in repeated "he did not X; he Y" constructions and parallel sentence openings ("Lyr waited," "Lyr stood," "Lyr cleaned"). The phrase "regally unpretentious" recurs three times without reweighting, trending toward loop. Mixed metaphor: "dust motes spiraled as if stars rehearsing their next positions, then forgot the choreography" introduces agency (stars rehearse, forget) that clashes with the passive dust-mote vehicle. The closing beats sustain clarity and momentum, mitigating non-closure artifact penalties, but figurative muddle in early and mid-beats and synonym churn ("diminutive titan," "smallest of titans," "regally unpretentious" x3) lower the score cumulatively by −0.8 within Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The premise—unmasking a pretender through bibliographic detective work and a time-shifting library—synthesizes familiar elements (wise small mentor, false heir, magical archive) into a specific, non-obvious design. The "rune of drift" that aligns pages with remembered nights and the iron gall ink pellet as kinship test add fresh texture. The accumulative/textural mode and the choice to resolve via patient orchestration rather than confrontation elevate the execution. Risk distinction applies: the lyric density and refusal of explicit exposition heighten stakes without obscuring clarity, earning +0.3 within band. However, the moral calculus (truth vs. pretense) remains straightforward, and the protagonist's flawlessness (Lyr never doubts, never errs) avoids genuine complexity, capping the score below 7.5.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lyr (diminutive titan) is present from the opening, drives three distinct beats (writing cryptic messages, guiding Serane through the library, deploying the ink pellet test), and his choices narrow her options and force the confession that shapes closure. His patient orchestration is causally essential; removing him collapses the plot. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage (he seals the scrap) +1.0, specificity (his size and role as overlooked sovereign) +0.5. No major frictions; the character is irreplaceable and cost-connected.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The iron gall ink pellet appears in setup (Lyr's last inheritance), middle development (inside the reliquary, its whisper guides reading), and payoff (rolls across Serane's finger, "ink recognized kinship," forcing confession and withdrawal). It drives two distinct beats and charges the closure image ("slept like potential thunder"). Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.2, specificity (kinship test via ink) +0.6. Minor friction: the pellet's mechanics (how it "rolled" and "climbed the skin like ivy") remain slightly vague, −0.2. Strong integration overall.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The rune of drift is introduced at ~25% ("etched into a column near the skylight"), enables the middle sequence (letting aisles slide in time, aligning pages with remembered nights), and directly shapes the confession moment ("let the rune of drift translate what must follow"). It constrains tactics (Lyr waits for the pause) and alters options (Serane cannot escape the restored decree). Setup +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +0.8, specificity (time-alignment mechanism) +0.5. Late first appearance (beyond first third) −0.3. Could have been seeded earlier for stronger integration.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Regally unpretentious" is applied to Lyr three times (opening robe description, corner desk stance, no separate action linked). It labels rather than constrains: Lyr's choices (patient, precise, non-confrontational) align with the trait, but no on-page moment tests or trades off regal bearing against humility with visible cost. The trait is present and consistent but does not drive a specific turn. Early mention +0.4, one descriptive beat +0.4, label-only use −0.6, swappability (could be "modest" or "unassuming") −0.4. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Sunder" appears explicitly ("he would guide her to sunder herself") and is enacted when Serane withdraws her claim, the library lets lies "crumble," and her chosen name blurs. The action is metaphorical (self-undoing) rather than physical severance, which slightly reduces its on-page visibility. Setup (stated intent) +0.5, payoff (Serane's withdrawal and the library's graceful collapse) +1.0, causal pressure (the guided reading and ink test force the sundering) +0.8, closure linkage +1.0. Swappability concern: "unmask" or "expose" could replace "sunder" with minor edits, −0.5. Mid-high integration with one friction.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The method (cryptic messages in library books) is seeded early ("He slipped these cryptic messages inside certain library books") and enables the middle beat (Serane follows the bookmarks through three volumes that reweight her lineage). It shapes her path but does not constrain Lyr's tactics or return at closure; the ending pivots to the ink pellet test rather than the messages. Early signal +0.5, one functional beat (guided reading) +0.4, causal enabling +0.6, no closure participation −0.6, swappability (any hidden clue method could serve) −0.3. Lyric-resonance allowance does not apply; the method is mid-story scaffolding, not a charged reprise.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The ancient temple library lost in time is present from the opening line, pressures every choice (rare patrons, sliding aisles, the rune of drift, vellum leaves, the skylight fracture), and charges the closure ("the temple library as rumor first, then law, then legend, then curriculum"). It supplies resources (books, the reliquary, spatial shifts) and constrains movement (Serane must follow the library's order). Early signal +0.7, three beats (arrival, reading sequence, confession, departure frame) +1.4, causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.4, specificity (time-lost temple with drift rune) +0.7. No frictions; the setting is indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Across the pause of shifting constellations" is introduced early (title phrase, repeated at ~20% and ~40%) and frames the library's temporal mechanic. It signals when the rune activates ("Lyr waited for that pause") and brackets the action, but elapsed time within the scene remains vague—no tightening clock presses decisions. Early signal +0.5, lyric reprise (opening → midpoint → final third) +0.6, thematic link to drift +0.4, no tactical pressure from countdown −0.4, ornamental phrasing in some uses −0.2. Functional as atmospheric frame but not a live constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lyr's motivation to unmask the pretender is stated early ("To unmask a pretender to the throne, he would guide her to sunder herself") and dramatized across all major beats: writing messages, reading the lineages, spotting the missing comma, guiding Serane, deploying the ink test. Friction between means (patience, indirection) and goal (unmasking) generates tactical choices. The ending seals the scrap in a glossary, fulfilling the motivation with visible social cost (prevented coronation). Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.2, cost connection +0.6. Minor friction: Lyr's internal conflict is minimal—he never doubts the rightness or risk of his plan, −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Tone ("graceful collapse") is coherent from the opening (the library "breathed like a sleeping bellows," dust motes drift) through middle beats ("courteous to pretenses, let them crumble with a graceful collapse," "columns did not fall; instead, the air arranged falling into a ritual of acceptance") to closure ("swept the fallen pride into a pan, and stored it gently," the ink pellet "slept like potential thunder"). The tone modulates with pressure—quiet patience, Serane's laughter turning to tears, the library's ritualized witness—and charges the final image with layered calm and latent consequence. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, coherence under pressure +1.0, closure charge +1.4, specificity (graceful rather than violent collapse) +0.6. No frictions; tone is indispensable and elevates thematic resonance.</comment>
