<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The novelist's interiority is present through reflection on their work and creative resistance, with embodied detail via the shell fragment. Internal conflict appears between market demands and artistic integrity, though the stakes remain abstract—no concrete micro-choices test this tension under pressure. The parade of cameo characters (courier, grandmother, child) are vivid but remain symbolic vehicles rather than sources of relational pressure. The ending choice to "write them as they wanted to live" reads as resolution but lacks a prior on-page moment where market pressure concretely threatened this stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure accrues through layered encounters and the river metaphor, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (the protagonist shifts from "seeking resolution" to "arranging permission"). Orientation is established early (nexus, mist, twilight, novelist carrying shell). The closure unit lands: the choice to follow the river over the market is articulated, and the final image shows emblems "weighted like consonants" ready for use. Cost is conceptual (rejecting the market's "ladder of triumphs") but not viscerally felt on the page—no on-page consequence or forfeiture that narrows options. The Orientation Test penalty is waived (anchors present); Lens ambiguity deduction is not applied (Accumulative holds). One meaningful deepening occurs (wading into the contrary current), sufficient for this length, but the cost remains asserted rather than demonstrated.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The feral nexus is anchored with vivid, selective detail: rust reeds, bloomless thistle, freight hymns, mist that "thickened like ink." Sensory selection reflects the reflective, watchful stance (visual and auditory emphasis). The river's "contrary thread" and the act of wading constrain the protagonist's ritual choice, charging the final image when they step out and "the nexus rearranged itself." The shell fragment functions as micro-setting, throbbing "like a pocketed star" and aligning with "the secret spine of water," meeting the 9+ gate requirement. Minor slip: spatial choreography is sometimes vague (where characters "drift from fog" without clear positions).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: resist market convention and collect the "shapes of different hopes." One meaningful tightening occurs when the protagonist wades into the river—a physical commitment that tests resolve. The cameo figures then offer emblems, and the protagonist chooses to accept them, which alters their creative method. However, escalation is muted: no moment where market pressure concretely threatens this choice on the page, and the emblems arrive without resistance or cost. The resolution reads as acceptance rather than earned transformation through struggle. Agency is present (the wading, the choice) but opposition is abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges clearly from particulars: the river's contrary motion, the shell's spiral, the emblems as "weighted like consonants," all cohere around artistic integrity versus market demands. The final image—"I wrote them as they wanted to live"—offers a resonant answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in the cameo figures' gestures (grandmother opening an empty case, child's ghost constellations). The piece resists binary resolution; the choice is complex and earned through accumulated imagery. Minor slip: one phrase approaches meta-commentary: "choice is a sentence, and sentences need currents to stay alive" reads slightly on-the-nose, though it stops short of full sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person, with a reflective, lyric register that suits the material. Perceptual signature is consistent: the novelist notices writerly details (pages turning, letters with "impossible stamps," emblems as consonants and vowels). Psychic distance is controlled, filter verbs are voice-motivated ("I could hear," "I realized"). Diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction under no particular stress: "solemnize my pact with the work, or else dissolve entirely" reads formal without clear character justification. Purposeful compression and imagistic patterns are taught early and hold through closure. No dialogue present; no head-hopping. The prose reflects the mind of the focalizer but some phrases feel writerly-writerly rather than character-particular.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies, with some strong imagistic compression ("mist held its breath," "river owning its braided refusal"). Information density is high in places. However, several paraphrase loops appear: paragraphs 5–6 restate the protagonist's motive with synonym churn ("collect the shapes," "quiet forms that could stand," "fragments too"). Template cadence runs in the cameo sequence: "A courier… A grandmother… A child…" across three paragraphs with identical stems. Filter-verb stacks in reflective passages ("I told," "I watched," "I felt") dull immediacy. Metaphors occasionally clash: "thickened like ink settling, a legible silence waiting for lines" mixes visual and auditory in a way that strains coherence. Apply paraphrase-loop (−0.2), template-cadence (−0.5), and mixed-metaphor (−0.4) penalties in Q7; total core deduction ~−1.1, plus artifacts touch mid-section → disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8 per artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The premise—creative pilgrimage to a liminal nexus to resist commercial demands—is a recognizable writer-as-protagonist template. The piece transforms it through specific imagery (the shell's spiral, the river's contrary thread, the emblems as linguistic units) and a lyric, accumulative structure. The cameo figures and their emblems offer fresh inflection. However, the core emotional arc (artist chooses integrity over market) remains familiar, and the piece does not fully escape the workshop-piece feel. Risk is present in the lyric mode and elliptical structure, but the stakes remain abstract and the final choice predictable. Within-band adjustment: +0.2 for structural risk and imagistic specificity, but not enough to overcome template premises.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Conflicted novelist is present throughout, frames the journey, and makes the final choice to "write them as they wanted to live." The character's conflict (market versus integrity) is setup in the opening third, developed through reflection and the wading ritual, and resolved in the ending. However, most choices are contemplative rather than dramatic—no moment where market pressure concretely forces a trade-off on the page. The ending choice feels like confirmation rather than turn. Two gates met (setup, payoff); middle development is reflective, not choice-driven. Score ~5.0 base (shapes one key choice) +0.3 early signal +0.7 closure linkage −0.2 swappability (any artist-protagonist could fill this role with minor edits) = 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Spiral seashell fragment appears in opening, returns at the river ("throbbed like a pocketed star"), aligns with "the secret spine of water," and reappears near the end ("touched the shell, felt its spiral urging patience"). Its spiral form echoes the story's structure and the "forever hallway with many doors." Three beats, early signal, closure linkage. However, it is handled passively—description and metaphor rather than dramatic use. The shell does not constrain a choice or enable an action; it is symbolic accompaniment. Score ~5.5 base (early–middle–final reprise) +0.3 early signal +0.4 two beats +0.7 closure linkage −0.5 ornamental use (no causal pressure) = 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Against the current" is signaled in paragraph 5 ("written against the current"), dramatized in the river's "contrary thread" and "contrary motion," tested when the protagonist wades in, and confirmed in the ending ("the path that kept moving against the current"). It shapes stakes (resisting market demands) and tactics (choosing the river over the ladder). Three gates met. The concept is irreplaceable—remove it and the story's central logic collapses. Score ~5.5 base +0.8 early signal +0.9 two beats +1.6 causal pressure +1.3 closure linkage −1.0 late first dramatization (river appears ~40% mark) = 7.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Lucidly watchful" is declared twice (paragraphs 4 and 36: "I was lucidly watchful" and "I watched, lucidly watchful still") but functions as label rather than constraint. It does not enable a choice or impose a cost—watchfulness is the posture, not a trade-off. No middle beat where this trait alters tactics. Setup and late reprise present, but middle development absent. Score ~3.0 base +0.3 early signal +0.3 late reprise −0.8 label-only with no causal work = 2.8, but adjust up slightly for thematic coherence → 4.8. (Alternative: strict reading yields 2.8; evaluator judgment applied here for coherent stance.)</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Solemnize" appears explicitly in paragraph 21 ("solemnize my pact with the work") and again in paragraph 34 ("the work solemnized"). The wading-into-the-river beat enacts the pact, and the cameo figures' offerings confirm it. The action drives the middle turn and shapes the ending. Three gates met. However, "solemnize" itself is narrated rather than dramatized—no ritual gestures or words that uniquely instantiate a pact; the wading could be framed as commitment without this term. Score ~5.5 base +0.3 early signal +0.9 two beats +1.4 causal pressure +0.7 closure linkage −0.9 summary-only (declared, not enacted through unique action) = 6.9.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Ephemeral cameo appearances" is signaled in paragraph 11 and enacted across paragraphs 13–15 (courier, grandmother, child) and 30 (more figures arrive). The mechanic is taught: characters "drift from fog," offer an emblem, then fade. The method shapes the middle sequence and provides the emblems that the protagonist carries into the ending. Three gates met. The mechanic is specific—remove the cameo structure and the accumulation of offerings collapses. Score ~5.5 base +0.8 early signal +1.4 three beats +1.0 causal pressure (offerings alter the protagonist's creative method) +1.3 closure linkage (emblems are "ready for breath" in the final image) −0.7 slight swappability (other encounter structures could deliver emblems) = 8.3, but check for overstatement: cameos are method, not force → adjust to 7.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Feral nexus in mist" is named in the opening line and anchors the entire scene. It provides the spatial container for all encounters, the mist "opens a pocket of visibility," and at the end "the nexus rearranged itself" after the protagonist steps out. The setting is irreplaceable—remove the nexus and the ritual has no stage. Three gates met. The nexus constrains (limits visibility, channels movement) and charges the closure (the rearrangement signals acceptance). Score ~5.5 base +0.8 early signal +1.4 three beats +1.2 causal pressure +1.5 closure linkage +0.6 specificity (feral and braided paths are unique) −0.4 slight postcard tendency (vivid but sometimes ornamental) = 10.6 → cap at practical high band with small swappability concern = 7.6.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Inside the whisper of closing pages" is named in paragraph 3 and echoed in paragraphs 23, 40, and 45. The timeframe is metaphorical (book nearing completion) rather than a live clock. It frames urgency but does not tighten tactics—no moment where dwindling time forces a choice. Setup and closure reprise present, but middle development absent. Score ~5.0 base (lyric reprise reweights) +0.3 early signal +0.7 closure linkage −0.3 ornamental (atmosphere, not constraint) = 5.7, adjust up slightly for charged final reprise → 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"To collect the shapes of different hopes" is stated in paragraph 7 and enacted through the cameo sequence (emblems = shapes) and the ending choice to "write them as they wanted to live." The motivation is setup, developed through the wading and acceptance of emblems, and resolved in the final paragraphs. Three gates met. However, the motivation is told more than dramatized—no on-page moment where conflicting hopes force a trade-off. Score ~5.5 base +0.8 early signal +0.9 two beats +0.9 causal pressure (shapes the acceptance of emblems) +0.7 closure linkage −1.1 summary-only (declared, not friction-tested with visible cost) = 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Swirling hush" is present in paragraph 2 ("swirling hush threaded the reeds") and modulates through the piece: "mist answered by opening," "hush swirled closer," and the final "legible silence." Tone is coherent, matching the lyric, reflective stance, and charges the closure image ("consonants… light like vowels, ready for breath"). Three gates met. The tone is integral—shift to declarative realism and the accumulative structure collapses. Score ~5.5 base +0.8 early signal +1.4 three beats +1.0 causal pressure (tone supports the accumulative lens) +1.8 closure linkage +0.8 irreplaceability −1.5 single static mood with minor modulation = 9.8 → check for overstatement: tone is strong but does not constrain choice → adjust to 7.8.</comment>
