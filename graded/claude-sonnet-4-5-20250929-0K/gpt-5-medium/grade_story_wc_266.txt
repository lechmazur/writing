<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is carefully rendered through embodied perception—"the ache points outward," the star "warms"—and the journey shows consistent motivation toward claiming courage. However, the guides remain largely interchangeable and deliver wisdom without internal contradiction or embodied struggle. The final reach for courage is earned by prior refusal, but the moment risks abstraction ("warmer than fear," "heavy as love") rather than a concrete choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the piece builds through layered images (leash, star, skiff, ridgeway) that progressively reweight the vigil from ache to agency. The closure—reaching for the shimmer that "takes my hand"—crystallizes a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the protagonist's refusal ends and courage is claimed. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words (bay, twilight, broken leash). Cost is felt ("I did not live," "I never opened") and the final act forecloses passivity, though the price remains oblique rather than viscerally demonstrated.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ridgeway functions as more than backdrop: it "hums with stories," sand "clicks like a clock," and the terrain ("eddies of silence," "pools remember the sky") constrains the walk and shapes the protagonist's realization. The star-stamp on the palm recurs with shifting meaning, charging the final image when courage "fits where the star was pressed." Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through the vigil's contemplative stance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding unused courage—is signaled early and tightens through the guides' instruction to "choose the bends that resemble my old fear" and walk them anyway. The protagonist's refusal to reach ("not yet") and later decision to do so constitutes one meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens. However, the escalation is primarily contemplative; no external complication tests the commitment, and the cost (what is forfeited by claiming courage) remains implicit rather than dramatized as a trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—courage as something carried, not summoned—emerges through concrete images (leash, ferry, star, skiff nested in chest) without thesis statements. The closing image offers a resonant answer: courage "waits where we last refused it" and must be reached for, transforming the vigil into agency. The piece resists easy morals and sustains ambiguity (what does the skiff "row by choosing" entail?). Minor slip: "heavy as love" risks abstraction at the peak moment.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinctive and controlled: lyric compression ("fog gathers like quiet linen," "sand clicks like a clock") remains legible and the perceptual signature is consistent—contemplative, attentive to metaphor, yet anchored in sensory particulars. The guides' dialogue carries purpose and differentiation ("There is no wrong, only unfinished" vs. "It keeps pace… and will be yours when you reach"). Psychic distance is stable; the piece teaches its own lyric pattern early and sustains it through closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully and figurative density serves the accumulative design. However, several lines loop conceptually: "a vigil in twilight" appears twice with similar framing, and the closing metaphor stack ("light as breath and heavy as love") dilutes precision at the climax. Minor template cadence in the guides' paired speeches ("The first guide… the second guide…") and a few filter verbs under pressure ("I realize," "I feel") slightly dull immediacy. No artifacts touch the closure beat directly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise—ferry guides who navigate choices rather than water—transforms familiar threshold/guide archetypes through specific mechanics (star-stamp as map, skiff that "floats on choices," ridgeway as memory terrain). The emotional truth of claiming dormant courage feels earned. However, the ferry-to-inner-journey synthesis is not wholly novel, and the guides' patient wisdom trends archetypal. The piece commits fully to its lyric design and follows its implications without retreat.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The guides appear early, facilitate passage, and offer instruction that shapes the protagonist's walk ("choose the bends that resemble my old fear"). They are present in closure ("I ask if I will see them again") and their lesson—"courage waits where we last refused it"—articulates the final realization. However, their own choices do not create turns; they observe and advise without internal conflict or cost. Present in all three gates (setup, middle, closure) but remain facilitators rather than agents of pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ticket punch appears in the first ferry scene, the star is pressed into the protagonist's palm ("to map a small constellation"), and it returns with reweighted function in the middle ("each point aims toward a fork ahead") and at closure ("what takes my hand… fits where the star was pressed"). The object is handled, evolves in meaning (from passage token to navigation tool to receptacle for courage), and charges the final image. All three gates met; causal pressure and closure linkage strong.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The vigil frames the entire piece from the opening ("I have walked here for weeks, a vigil in twilight") through the middle ("This is where we keep watch, a vigil in twilight") to closure, where "the vigil must be kept until my breathing and the tide agree." The concept constrains tactics (waiting, listening, choosing when to reach) and shapes the stakes—vigil as active attention rather than passive waiting. It defines the narrative mode (contemplative accumulation) and the final act (reaching) emerges only when the vigil permits. Indispensable to the story's logic and tone.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Gently persistent" describes the second guide's patience ("patience that is gently persistent and never scolding") and echoes in the shoreline lullaby that "follows, gently persistent as surf on shale" to thread the protagonist's steps. The trait enables the protagonist's endurance and constrains hasty action (the vigil requires patience). It appears in setup and closure but does not visibly alter a choice with demonstrated cost; the persistence is more ambient than actionable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Traverse" is introduced early ("We shall traverse the ridge when it appears"), shapes the middle sequence ("We rise together and traverse the ridge, moving through indirect routes"), and the act of traversing—choosing bends, walking fear-paths—constitutes the protagonist's primary agency. The action drives the middle beat and enables the final reach. Removing "traverse" would require rewriting the journey's structure; it is specific and active rather than ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Through indirect routes" is signaled by the second guide ("through indirect routes that your own feet will decide") and demonstrated in the middle ("traverse the ridge, moving through indirect routes where sand stiffens into memory and pools remember the sky"). The method shapes the protagonist's path—choosing bends that resemble old fear rather than a straight line. It constrains tactics and ties to theme (courage claimed obliquely, not head-on). Present in setup, middle, and implicitly at closure; moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The veiled ridgeway is introduced early ("a veiled ridgeway that rises from the marsh"), becomes the terrain of the vigil ("The veiled ridgeway rises, a pale spine over the flats"), and its features (bends, eddies, pools) pressure choices in the middle. The setting is not merely scenic; it "hums with stories I did not live" and forces the protagonist to choose fear-paths. It appears in or shapes the closure ("When we reach the last rise, the ridge dips toward town lights"). Essential terrain across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"After the leash breaks" anchors the opening and returns at the middle turn ("After the leash breaks, there is only direction and breath"), marking the story's temporal premise: the timeframe is not clock-bound but bounded by the protagonist's shift from constraint to agency. The broken leash defines the before/after and the entire vigil exists in its aftermath. The timeframe tightens the decision to reach for courage (no return to the leash is possible). Indispensable framing that shapes closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The motivation—"to find where unused courage waits"—is stated early ("I go because I have to find where unused courage waits") and drives every beat: boarding the ferry, traversing the ridgeway, choosing fear-paths, and finally reaching for the shimmer. The guides articulate it ("a vigil in twilight that listens for the courage you left unclaimed") and the protagonist's final act fulfills it. Desire is dramatized through embodied refusal ("I do not reach, not yet") and eventual choice. The friction between wanting courage and fearing the cost is legible; closure pays it off directly.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Shoreline lullaby" appears in the opening ("the bay sings its shoreline lullaby") and returns in the middle to thread the protagonist's steps ("The shoreline lullaby follows, gently persistent as surf on shale"). The tone—contemplative, measured, rhythmic—is coherent across turns and modulates subtly (from ache to resolve) without rupture. It charges the final image by anchoring the vigil's cadence. However, the lullaby itself does not constrain a choice or impose cost; it is atmospheric and thematic rather than tactical. Present in setup and middle; supports closure tonally but not causally.</comment>
