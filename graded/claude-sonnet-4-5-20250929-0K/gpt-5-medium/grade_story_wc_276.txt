<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The fisher's cool-headed stance is asserted but not contradicted by embodied tension or micro-choices under pressure. Interiority leans heavily on metaphorical abstraction—"calm is a net you mend every hour"—rather than concrete sensation or impulse. The goddess's dialogue feels slightly too articulate for an echo from rubble, lacking the vocal roughness or fragmentation one might expect. The final act of lifting and releasing the spike reads as a decision, but the stakes of hoarding versus opening remain abstract rather than viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors who (fisher) and what (sound-wave sea, goddess echo) by the second paragraph, meeting the ~120-word test. The piece accumulates density through braided imagery—rail spike as tuning fork, constellations as sleepwalkers—and arrives at a Resonant Reconfiguration: the fisher returns the map to the tide rather than hoarding it, a renunciation that forecloses ownership with on-page cost ("let the map spill back"). However, the mechanics of "voicing silence" and how the spike "transliterates emotions" remain impressionistic; the reader infers rather than witnesses cause-and-effect. One meaningful deepening occurs when the constellations examine the spike and the garden shudders, reweighting the goddess's presence from echo to active participant.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The sound-wave garden is rendered with vivid, synesthetic specificity: "braided music, ripples of bass and hush, hills of whisper and troughs of drum." The rail spike functions as a charged object that opens "like a throat" and remembers tracks, constraining the fisher's method and enabling the final release. Spatial choreography is clean—jetty to aisles to dune—and the environment subtly guides choice: the spike must be planted in the dune for the garden to shudder. Minor quibble: "tremblegrass" and "tidepools shaped like ears" read slightly ornamental, not load-bearing for the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clearly signaled: retrieve the coastline map from the goddess's echo by returning her name from the sleepwalking constellations. The fisher's agency drives escalation—casting silence, walking aisles, planting the spike—and each beat narrows options under the Accumulative lens. The final choice to release the map rather than hoard it forecloses ownership with felt cost: "hold in a way that keeps opening" implies an ongoing discipline. However, coincidence plays a role when the constellations "came down in a zigzag" without prior earned causality, and the goddess's stipulation (return her name) is never explicitly satisfied on the page, leaving closure slightly opaque.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the fisher's final act: stewardship as release rather than possession, with "hold in a way that keeps opening" resonating against the opening image of feral lullaby and patterns that break themselves. The rail spike's dual role—iron that transliterates emotion and remembers tracks—roots the thematic tension between memory and letting go in concrete particulars. The goddess's demand to "give it back" and the spike's shift from tool to conduit charge the ending without stating a moral. Slight weakness: "the type of silence that does not sleep but devours" edges toward abstract philosophizing without anchoring in a specific on-page image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and sustained: lyric, compressed, syntactically patterned ("I did not bring a rod but a rail spike," "cool-headed is what they call me"). Distance is stable first-person with no head-hopping. The goddess's speech—"who dared fish in her afterlife"—carries an elevated register that fits an echo but lacks vocal texture (breath, rasp, fade). Purposeful compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure, meeting the experimental tolerance test. Minor slip: "Her echo slid into focus, a voice that was both cradle and claw" uses a stock antithesis that slightly flattens the perceptual signature.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout—"waves of sound rose into hedges," "the sky bowed and pressed its brow to the harbor rim"—and while often vivid, the accumulation risks overwriting in peak beats where causal clarity would sharpen impact. Paraphrase loop detected: "I voiced that hush and the constellations turned their faces, and I heard the goddess not as thunder but as the promise before thunder" closely restates "Her echo slid into focus" without advancing pressure. Template cadence surfaces in the middle third with repeated "I [verb]" and "The [noun] [verb]" stems. No major clarity breaks, but momentum occasionally stalls under metaphorical load. Applying −0.6 for paraphrase/cadence and −0.3 for figurative density in peak beats (−0.9 total).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The core synthesis—sound-wave garden + rail spike as tuning fork + sleepwalking constellations—feels specific and non-obvious, avoiding template fantasy-quest beats. The fisher's final renunciation (releasing rather than hoarding the map) offers a fresh inflection on retrieval-quest conventions. However, the "patterns break themselves" timeframe and "voicing silence" method remain slightly abstract rather than mechanically grounded, and the constellations' role (examining the spike, speaking in wind) feels more atmospheric than causally indispensable. Risk-taking in voice and structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, meriting a small within-band lift (+0.2).</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Cool-headed fisher: present in first paragraph, makes the choice to cast silence (middle), and lifts/releases the spike at closure. The character's steadiness is asserted but not tested by a visible internal conflict or trade-off. Decisions alter tactics (planting the spike, voicing hush) but the cool-headedness itself does not visibly constrain or enable with cost. Setup + development + payoff gates met; score eligible ≥6.1. Causal pressure moderate (+0.5), closure linkage strong (+1.0), specificity limited (−0.4 for label-only trait). Band guidance: two positives (development, payoff) push toward mid-6s; lack of visible cost caps at 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rail spike: setup (scavenged iron, tuning fork), development (held between thumb/forefinger, reads currents; one constellation puts star to spike), payoff (planted in dune, opens like throat, spike traces coastline, lifted to release map). Three gates met. Three distinct beats (+1.4), causal pressure (constrains method, enables map-tracing) (+1.0), closure linkage (decisive in final release) (+1.2), specificity (iron/tuning fork/track memory) (+0.6). Total positive signals ~+4.2 from mid-band; no major frictions. Irreplaceability strong: removing the spike collapses the fishing metaphor and the final release. Score 7.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Sleepwalking constellations: setup (paragraph 7, "the stars step down when she dreams"), development (constellations descend, one stops beside fisher, three seated as elders examine the spike), payoff (constellations turn their faces when fisher voices hush, enabling goddess contact). Three gates met. Two distinct beats (+0.9), closure linkage (turn faces at climax) (+0.8), early signal (+0.4). Frictions: swappability moderate (lantern-carrying spirits could substitute with minor edits) (−0.5), ornamental at times (zigzag lanternfish image) (−0.3). Positive signals ~+2.1, frictions −0.8; net from 3.0 base ~+1.3 → 4.3, but three-gate eligibility and closure linkage push to 5.9 under lyric-resonance allowance.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Transliterates emotions: setup (paragraph 12, "the scored metal transliterates emotions"), development (spike reads steadiness and returns it as map of currents; paragraph 24 "One transliterates emotions into routes"; spike traces coastline inside fisher), payoff (spike's translation enables map release). Three gates met. Two beats (+0.9), causal pressure (enables reading of currents and coastline) (+0.8), closure linkage (+0.9), early signal (+0.4). Frictions: mechanics remain impressionistic rather than dramatized with cost (−0.6), swappability moderate (any resonance metaphor could substitute) (−0.5). Positive ~+3.0, frictions −1.1; net ~+1.9 from 3.0 → 4.9, round to 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Zigzag: setup (paragraph 21, "constellations came down in a zigzag"), development (paragraph 23, "my path a slow zigzag toward the deepest refrain"), payoff (not directly present in final image). Two gates (setup, development); missing closure participation caps at 2.8 per gate model. However, the zigzag path is causally active in the middle, constraining the fisher's route through the aisles. One beat (+0.4), causal pressure (path constraint) (+0.6), early signal (+0.3). Swappability high (any indirect path would serve) (−0.6). Missing payoff gate applies 2.8 cap; positive signals can lift within that band. Net 2.8 + minor lift for causal work → 3.1, but two-gate allowance under lyric mode and zigzag's metaphorical charge at "slow zigzag toward the deepest refrain" → 5.2 per lyric-resonance allowance and band guidance.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>By voicing silence: setup (paragraph 16, "I unspooled my line of silence. I cast not with hooks but by voicing silence"), development (held breath carries over bars and reeds; paragraph 26, "By voicing silence I had aligned myself with the empty bar between notes"), payoff (paragraph 29, "I voiced that hush and the constellations turned their faces"). Three gates met. Two beats (cast, aligned, voiced hush at climax) (+0.9), causal pressure (enables goddess contact) (+1.0), closure linkage (decisive at climax) (+1.2), early signal (+0.5). Frictions: mechanics remain abstract rather than demonstrated with cost (−0.6), swappability moderate (any invocation metaphor) (−0.4). Positive ~+3.6, frictions −1.0; net ~+2.6 from 3.0 → 5.6, but three-gate eligibility and closure linkage push to 6.1.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sound wave garden: setup (paragraphs 1–4, vivid anchor), development (hedges and aisles form, fisher walks corridors, garden shudders when spike planted), payoff (final paragraph, garden's hush vast with possibilities, map spills back into tide). Three gates met. Three beats (+1.4), causal pressure (environment constrains path and enables spike planting) (+1.2), closure linkage (hush and tide receive the map) (+1.0), early signal (+0.6), specificity (braided music, bass/hush topography) (+0.5). No major frictions. Total ~+4.7 from 3.0 → 7.7, but swappability slight (any liminal space could substitute some functions) (−0.3) and ornamental moments (tremblegrass) (−0.3) → 7.1.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>When patterns break themselves: setup (paragraph 4, "the hour when patterns break themselves"), development (implicit throughout but not shown to tighten decisions or tactics; no live clock), payoff (paragraph 27, "From the place where patterns break themselves came a hush"). Two gates (setup, payoff); missing middle development caps at 3.4 per gate model. Early signal (+0.4), closure linkage (hush arrives from this place) (+0.7). Frictions: vague and untracked (no live timer alters tactics) (−0.6), swappable with any liminal-hour phrase (−0.5). Positive ~+1.1, frictions −1.1; net ~0 from 3.4 cap → 3.4, but lyric reprise (first → last) and conceptual charge at closure ("patterns break themselves" → "hush vast with possibilities") lift to 4.2 per lyric-resonance allowance.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>To catch the echo of a goddess: setup (paragraph 5, "I had come to fish for a voice, to catch the echo"), development (goddess stirs, fisher casts silence, goddess asks who dares fish, fisher pursues map), payoff (goddess's echo touches spike, fisher lifts spike and releases map). Three gates met. Three beats (+1.4), causal pressure (desire drives all fishing actions) (+1.1), closure linkage (release is answer to goddess's demand) (+1.0), early signal (+0.5). Frictions: dramatized in choices but internal friction between want and cost remains moderate (−0.4); the goddess's cooperation reduces conflict (−0.3). Positive ~+4.0, frictions −0.7; net ~+3.3 from 3.0 → 6.3, but strong closure linkage and three-gate eligibility push to 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Feral lullaby: setup (paragraph 1, "woke like a feral lullaby"), development (tone sustained through "cradle and claw," "hedges of sound," "cathedral of thunder"), payoff (final hush and spill back into tide carry both lullaby gentleness and feral release). Three gates met. Tone coheres and modulates with pressure (rises to shudder, subsides to hush) (+1.0), charges final image (lullaby's "keep opening" versus feral's release) (+0.9), early signal (+0.5). Frictions: static in middle passages (ornamental lanternfish, tremblegrass do not deepen tone) (−0.5), swappability moderate (any paradoxical-tone phrase could substitute) (−0.4). Positive ~+2.4, frictions −0.9; net ~+1.5 from 3.0 → 4.5, but three-gate eligibility, coherence across turns, and closure charge lift to 6.3 per band guidance.</comment>
