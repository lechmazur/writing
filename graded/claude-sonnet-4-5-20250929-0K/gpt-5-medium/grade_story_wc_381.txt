<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The summoner's interiority relies heavily on elevated, abstract language ("inward constellations," "unlonely solitude") that distances rather than embodies. The core choice—to "unwrite the future by mapping silence"—unfolds through description and atmosphere rather than embodied contradiction or micro-decisions under pressure. The fox and brook are observed rather than forcing choices that alter the summoner's stance. Agency reads as atmospheric attunement rather than decision with visible cost; the ending declares success ("the code untied") without dramatizing what the summoner risks or loses.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who (summoner) and where (brook) early, though "when" remains atmospheric rather than clock-bound. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered imagery until the code "untied like wet shoelaces," a Conceptual Repricing moment. However, the closure cost is asserted ("room; the future exhaled") rather than made visible through a specific forfeiture or altered tactic on the page. The link between the summoner's breath and the code's dissolution reads as metaphoric equivalence rather than earned causality, limiting the felt price at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The nocturnal brook setting is vivid and consistently filtered through the summoner's attentive perception ("sleeping stars," "moonmilk," "velvet riverbed"). The origami wing and water function as micro-setting that constrains the ritual's method. However, the environment does not pressure a tactical choice or supply a resource that alters outcome; it serves as stage and symbol rather than active constraint. The final image ("the wing drifted back, unharmed") charges atmosphere but does not hinge the closure decision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—hushing a prophecy of "iron noon"—is signaled early but remains abstract; the threatened future is described rather than dramatized as a live cost. The code "balked at vanishing," a tightening moment, but the summoner's response (whispering measured breathing) does not narrow options or force a trade-off with visible price. The resolution ("the code untied") declares success without showing what the summoner spent or risked; coincidence or inherent power completes the task rather than protagonist agency under escalating pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme—listening as mercy, patience remaking the world—emerges organically from the summoner's ritual and the brook's responses. The recurring "hush" and "terrestrially cosmic" images create a pattern that shifts meaning by the end. However, the final paragraph's explicit thematic statement ("listening keeps the world from hardening") tips toward moralizing rather than letting the image speak. The piece avoids prompt labels but leans on abstraction ("room for futures") where a concrete final beat would sharpen resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Voice is consistently lyric and elevated, with a distinct perceptual signature ("mason-jar fireflies," "paper thunder," "moonmilk"). Figurative density is high and mostly coherent, though some vehicles ("tranquil blaze," "terrestrially cosmic shimmer") strain toward oxymoron without clear payoff. Distance remains stable—third-person close with atmospheric remove—but under peak pressure (the code balking), the narration sustains its lyric remove rather than compressing or modulating. No dialogue present; no head-hopping. Diction is purpose-driven and pattern-taught, though the cumulative metaphoric weight risks slowing momentum in the final third.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Figurative language dominates nearly every sentence ("sleeping stars," "velvet riverbed," "paper thunder," "moonmilk," "lantern of calm"), creating a density that, while pattern-taught early, risks oversaturation in high-pressure beats where clarity would sharpen impact. Some vehicles are mixed or contradictory ("tranquil blaze" remains unresolved; "iron noon" and "gears" are abstract threats without tactile grounding). Paraphrase loops appear: "hush" and "silence" recur without added pressure across multiple adjacent lines. Syntax varies purposefully, and information density is generally high, but the lyric mode flattens urgency when the code resists; the closure beat ("the code untied like wet shoelaces") mixes registers—colloquial vehicle in elevated frame—without clear purpose.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of ritual, prophecy-hushing, and origami as a map of silence offers a non-obvious premise. The "terrestrially cosmic" frame and the summoner's patient method create a distinct atmospheric stance. However, the emotional arc—solitary practitioner successfully completes ritual—follows a template (lone mage confronts abstract threat, succeeds through inherent skill) without transformation through specific lived cost or moral calculus. The fox and brook are evocative but could be replaced with other nature witnesses without structural loss. The piece commits fully to its lyric vision but does not take narrative risk; the summoner's success is never in doubt, and no choice forces a visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The summoner is present throughout and performs the ritual, but their choices read as predetermined steps (place wing, whisper, guide attention) rather than decisions that create turns. The character observes and enacts a known method without dramatized doubt, adaptation, or cost that alters tactics. Setup and development present; closure participation is atmospheric rather than decisional.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The origami wing appears early (setup), is placed on water to trace the map (development), and drifts back "bearing a bead of water like a planet" (closure reprise). It is handled in at least three beats and its form (folds as coordinates) matters to the method. However, its role is largely symbolic; removing it would require only minor edits to substitute another ritual object. The wing does not constrain a choice or impose a visible cost; it enables the method but could be replaced with a drawn sigil or chant.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Smoothed hush" is named early, recurs as atmosphere, and the summoner's task is to "map silence." The concept frames the stakes and the ending declares success ("the hush still required respect"). However, the hush does not constrain tactics or force a trade-off on the page; it is invoked as theme and mood rather than a mechanical or social cost. Development is thematic; closure participation is declarative. Lyric reprise reweights meaning but does not dramatize cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Terrestrially cosmic" modifies imagery (the brook's shimmer, the wing's bead) and recurs across beats. However, it functions as descriptive texture rather than a trait that constrains or enables action with cost. The attribute colors perception but does not alter options or impose a trade-off. Setup and development present as motif; closure mentions it ("terrestrially cosmic patience") without making the trait decisive.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Flow" governs the brook's responses and the summoner traces patterns in current; it is central to the ritual's method and appears in setup, development, and closure ("the brook's arithmetic relaxed into music"). The action shapes two beats and charges the final image. However, the flow is observed and guided rather than contested; replacing "flow" with "light" or "resonance" would require only modest edits. The element is well-integrated but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Mapping silence" is named early as the summoner's task, enacted through the origami wing's coordinates and traced patterns (development), and declared successful at closure ("by mapping silence, they found the seam"). The method is signaled and its mechanics—tracing without touching, guiding attention—matter to the ritual. However, the method is told and asserted rather than dramatized through visible cost or adaptation under pressure. Setup and closure present; development is descriptive.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The nocturnal haven and brook are named early, provide vivid atmosphere across all beats, and supply the water used in the ritual (development and closure). The setting shapes the method (water as medium) but does not pressure a choice or impose a resource limit. The summoner could perform the ritual at any similar brook without altering stakes. The setting is well-described and consistent but functions as stage rather than constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Amid whispered secrets" is named once in the opening and echoed in the final third ("amid whispered secrets, the brook and wing...kept counsel"). The phrase evokes atmosphere but does not function as a timeframe that tightens decisions; no clock tracks elapsed duration or imposes urgency. The element is ornamental—a mood descriptor—without causal work. Setup and closure reprise present but no development.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The desire to hush the prophecy is stated early and motivates the summoner's presence at the brook. The prophecy's code "balked at vanishing," creating friction, and the summoner persists until success (closure). However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through competing wants or visible cost; the summoner never doubts, adapts tactics under failure, or pays a price for success. Setup and development present; closure participation is declarative.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>"Tranquil blaze" is named in the opening and closing lines, framing the piece. The tone remains consistently lyric and meditative across all beats, even when the code resists. However, the tone does not modulate with pressure—the crisis beat maintains the same register as the opening—and the oxymoron ("tranquil blaze") is never clarified or charged with meaning beyond atmospheric paradox. Lyric reprise is purposeful but the tone is static rather than dynamic.</comment>
