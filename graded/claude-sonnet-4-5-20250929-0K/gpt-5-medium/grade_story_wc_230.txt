<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's trait of involuntary truthfulness generates effective internal contradiction ("I could not lie to them, so I focused on what my honesty did not have to illuminate"), and the embodied moment with the patrol—smearing clay on the eye, answering truthfully while occluding detail—demonstrates micro-choices under pressure. The girl's confession about her father's departure earns pathos through concrete detail ("felt his terror like a hive under skin"). Minor weaknesses: secondary characters (the girl, the patrol) remain functional but underdeveloped, and the final move toward "fractured grace" edges close to diagnostic summary rather than fully embodied cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece coheres through density increase and cadence shift—opening with ravine and orchard threat, layering the smuggled eye and textbook method, tensing with the patrol encounter, and closing with the girl's unburdening and the group's collective endurance. Closure reads as Earned Stasis with Charged Poise: "we learned to breathe while it looked at us from the keeper, and the orchard steadied a little, its injuries sighted but endured" registers visible cost (the unresolved pain, the precarious orchard) and forecloses easy remedy. Orientation anchors early (hanging orchard, ravine, post-empathy-virus world, truffle forager). One deduction: the inspector encounter resolves slightly too easily—they "shrugged" and left after full disclosure of contraband without dramatized consequence, reducing friction at a peak beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ravine and hanging orchard constrain action throughout: storms threaten the footbridge, inspectors refuse to cross the swaying planks, and the narrator hides the eye in a knot-hole behind thyme. The glass eye functions as micro-setting—its physical placement and concealment drive tactics during the patrol beat. The final image of the orchard "steadied a little, its injuries sighted but endured" charges closure by folding environment into emotional resolution. Sensory detail is selective and purpose-driven (moss, peat, clay, ropes of rain, blossoms beaten to paste). Minor slip: "smuggled...inside a sack of truffles packed in peat" arrives as exposition rather than shown choice, slightly reducing immediacy.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—cultivating psychological safety through the glass-eye method—is signaled early and tested in two beats: the smuggling gamble and the patrol encounter that nearly exposes the contraband, then the group session where the girl unburdens. The narrator's involuntary truthfulness forces tactical occlusion (smearing clay, careful sequencing of disclosure), and the inspector scene narrows options before the canyon thunder grants reprieve. The ending reweights cost: "Fractured grace is the only style we have left" acknowledges endurance over cure, and "until the eye grows warm from all we allow it to hold" implies ongoing, cumulative labor. One weakness: the patrol's retreat feels partly coincidental (the storm intervenes) rather than wholly earned by protagonist action, softening agency slightly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—safety as collective, honest endurance under empathy's pressure—emerges organically from the glass eye ritual, the orchard's precarious hang, and the girl's father's flight. The piece avoids moralizing; "Safety is not a barricade, it is a promise about what happens when we step inside" is voiced in-scene as teaching rather than authorial thesis. The final image ("Fractured grace is the only style we have left") answers the central question without stating a lesson, reweighting "safety" from absence-of-pain to capacity-to-witness-pain. The keeper's function—a third focal point that "allowed neighbors to feel the contour of confession without drowning"—integrates concept with practice. No thematic drift or late thesis intrusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable first-person with controlled distance; the narrator's voice is distinct ("rational odd mind," "evidence more than hope, and scent more than rumor") and the perceptual signature—forager's patience, cataloging of texture and smell—shapes rhythm. Under pressure (patrol encounter), diction compresses appropriately: "I felt truth coil up my esophagus." One register slip: "cultivate psychological safety that did not depend on secrets" and "occlude catastrophic empathy" edge toward therapeutic jargon that feels slightly elevated for a truffle forager's idiom, though the surrounding concreteness (trowel, moss, peat) anchors voice. Dialogue is minimal but functional ("clear and truthful, that we were running a group to reduce panic"). No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; opening long clauses ("The storms had planed the ravine to a grim bowl") give way to tighter beats during the patrol encounter. Information density is high: most lines carry world-building, trait disclosure, or pressure. Two artifacts reduce the score: (1) "Truth followed me like the smell of earth, because since infection I had been involuntarily truthful" loops concept across adjacent clauses without added detail; (2) several figurative vehicles strain coherence—"laughter snagged on a throat...and we learned the shape of our fractures by the notes that cracked" mixes aural and spatial metaphors without clear tenor. No paraphrase loops in peak beats; the final paragraph avoids scaffold. Proofreading clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of empathy-virus world-building, involuntary truthfulness, and the glass-eye-as-witness method feels purposeful and specific rather than template-driven. The "third focal point to occlude catastrophic empathy" is a non-obvious therapeutic mechanism grounded in pre-virus practice. The piece risks opacity (discredited textbooks, rumored cures, smuggling past inspectors) and succeeds by rooting all elements in the narrator's forager pragmatism and the orchard's literal precarity. The premise transforms the "support group in dystopia" trope through the keeper's material presence and the narrator's involuntary honesty forcing tactical occlusion. Small deduction: the empathy-virus concept leans on familiar post-pandemic/post-collapse scaffolding, though the "involuntary truthfulness" twist adds fresh friction.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The rational truffle forager's choices drive two key turns: smuggling the eye (hiding it in truffles, smearing clay during the patrol) and facilitating the group session. The forager's rationality ("trusted evidence more than hope") creates productive tension with the "rumored cures," and the decision to answer the inspectors truthfully while occluding the eye's location demonstrates constrained agency. Present in closure: "I will keep foraging, rational and honest, until the eye grows warm." Three-gate pass: setup (opening ID), development (smuggling/patrol), payoff (closing vow). Causal pressure and irreplaceability elevate the score.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The antique glass eye appears in four beats: description (waxed cloth, bubbles, copper rim), concealment (knot-hole, clay smear), use (group faces it to unburden), and closure ("until the eye grows warm from all we allow it to hold"). Each appearance alters tactics: hiding it enables survival of the patrol, using it enables the girl's confession, and the warming image charges the ending with cumulative cost. Specificity (milky iris, long bubbles) matters—no generic "relic" could replace it. Three-gate pass with strong causal and closure linkage. Irreplaceability and cost connection present.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The smuggled-relic concept shapes stakes throughout: the narrator risks inspector detection ("smelled contraband like wolves smell a frayed tendon"), the eye must be hidden under clay and thyme, and the patrol's near-discovery tightens pressure before the storm intervenes. The concept is not merely thematic—it alters tactics (the sack of truffles, the occlusion strategy) and charges the ending by representing ongoing risk ("I will keep foraging...until the eye grows warm"). Three-gate pass: setup (smuggling backstory), development (patrol concealment), payoff (closure vow implies continued contraband stewardship). Strong causal and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Involuntarily truthful trait constrains on-page action in the patrol beat: "I could not lie to them, so I focused on what my honesty did not have to illuminate" and "I told them the truth anyway, loud as rain...If they had asked to see it, I would have handed it over." The trait creates visible trade-off—occlusion becomes tactical necessity, not deceit—and charges the closure ("rational and honest"). Three-gate pass: setup (early disclosure), development (patrol), payoff (closing self-description). Cost is legible: the narrator's honesty forces riskier exposure than silence would allow. Causal pressure present.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Occlude operates in two beats: the narrator tries "to occlude the glint that would draw their hands" (clay smearing, thyme curtain) and the textbooks describe "a third focal point to occlude catastrophic empathy." The first use enables survival of the patrol; the second frames the keeper's function. However, the action is somewhat passive (hiding rather than direct confrontation) and the second mention is explanatory rather than dramatized. Two-gate pass (development and thematic closure linkage) but lacks a strong setup beat. Mid-band: functional and irreplaceable in concept, but the mechanics feel more told than enacted in the group session itself.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The method "through rumored cures in discredited textbooks" is signaled early ("textbooks I collected in a moldy crate described a method") and shapes the attempt (the glass-eye ritual: "face the eye and speak what we feared saying"). It appears in closure via "Fractured grace is the only style we have left, and I will keep foraging...until the eye grows warm," implying ongoing practice. Two-gate pass (setup, payoff) but the method's mechanics are more summarized than enacted—we see one girl's confession but not the step-by-step unfolding of the textbook's instructions. Functional but slightly ornamental in execution; the textbooks prime expectation without detailed on-page proof of efficacy.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The hanging orchard in storm-battered ravine constrains every beat: storms threaten the structure ("roots groaned against their cliff anchors like tired wrists"), the swaying footbridge prevents inspectors from crossing, and the narrator digs carefully "under the moss" for truffles while managing the group. The orchard's precarity is the story's literal and emotional frame; the final image ("the orchard steadied a little, its injuries sighted but endured") fuses setting with closure. Three-gate pass with high causal and closure linkage. Irreplaceability: no other setting could provide the physical jeopardy, the isolation from inspectors, and the metaphorical charge of "hanging" safety. Micro-setting (moss, knot-hole, thyme) also alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the empathy virus" is established early and shapes world rules (involuntary truthfulness, repurposed museums, inspectors, psychological-safety groups). It provides context for the smuggling risk and the group's need, and it appears in closure ("Fractured grace is the only style we have left" implies ongoing post-virus adaptation). Two-gate pass (setup, thematic closure) but the timeframe does not create a live ticking-clock pressure within the single evening's action—the storms and patrol provide immediacy, not the post-virus era itself. The concept is essential to motive and world logic but functions more as backdrop than active constraint in beats.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The motivation to cultivate psychological safety drives the smuggling risk, the textbook collection, the glass-eye teaching ("I told everyone it would listen without wincing"), and the facilitation of the girl's confession. The narrator's speech—"Safety is not a barricade...it is a promise about what happens when we step inside"—is voiced in-scene as pedagogy, not mere telling. Conflict arises from the patrol threat and the precarity of the method itself ("rumored cures"). Three-gate pass: setup (opening context), development (patrol and group session), payoff (closure vow to continue). Friction between want (safety through honesty) and cost (ongoing risk, unresolved pain) is legible.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fractured grace is coherent throughout: the ravine "planed to a grim bowl," the orchard creaking, the glass eye with bubbles, the laughter that "snagged on a throat," and the final assertion "Fractured grace is the only style we have left." Tone modulates with pressure—lyric density in description, tightening syntax during the patrol, breathier pacing in the group ritual—and charges the final image by naming what has been shown. The ending does not announce theme coldly; it crystallizes the established texture. Three-gate pass with strong closure linkage. The phrase "fractured grace" itself appears only at the end, but the texture is taught from the opening and the return feels inevitable rather than imposed.</comment>
