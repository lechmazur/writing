<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong interior texture and embodied craft knowledge throughout ("technically gentle" shown through action at the furnace and braids). The forgiveness arc is earned through the grandmother's bell backstory and the concrete final stance of listening. Minor: some internal contradictions blur motivation ("I had promised to return only after forgiving yourself" suggests external accountability, yet the piece reads as solitary reckoning). The protagonist's micro-choices (testing braids, clipping the card, steadying the frame) anchor pressure effectively.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—density and cadence build toward the final triangle of bells that speak names. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the protagonist stays, listens, and accepts the ongoing task with visible cost (exhaustion, sleep on the floor). Orientation is late (furnace/sanctum/aurora anchored ~15% in; "icebound sanctum" named only at line 3). The lens holds and closure lands with felt cost, but early disorientation and the slight cost-visibility gap (weariness implied more than shown) keep this from the high 8s.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The braided rope, furnace, skylight, and aurora function as integrated micro-setting, constraining each action (braid positions control shutters and light). Sensory detail is purposeful and vivid ("smell like pennies and pine sap," "breath made brief roses"). The bells' asymmetric shapes and the triangle configuration charge the final image. The icebound locale and auroral fire provide concrete environmental pressure without postcard drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving forgotten names in cast bells) signaled early and pursued through escalating technical choices. The grandmother's bell error adds visible prior cost and motivates return. One meaningful tightening: aligning aurora, card scrap, and wax to capture the transcribed memory. Agency is clear in the rope-braid manipulation and pour. Minor: the escalation reads as procedural accumulation more than a narrowing of options; coincidence (aurora timing) facilitates rather than complicates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme (repair, listening, memory preservation) emerges from concrete craft actions without overt statement. The bells as transcribed memory—"names are truer when the air must say them"—offers a resonant conceptual answer. The forgiveness motif deepens through the prior mistake and the final "stay, cast, listen, and begin again." Minor thematic echo: "because repair begins where the hand loosens its fist" leans instructive, though the surrounding particulars anchor it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: the caster's idiom blends technical precision and lyric compression ("technically gentle," "snowmelt ardor," "transcribed memory"). Second-person frame ("forgiving yourself") is purposeful and paid off at closure. Purposeful elision (the promise, the cart's fate) creates pressure without withholding facts the POV knows. Distance and focalization are stable. Syntax modulates under pressure (short clauses during the pour, longer reflection in recovery). No head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High information density; nearly every line advances craft action or reweights the forgiveness motif. Rhythm varies naturally, and figurative language is controlled ("brief roses," "aurora fell exactly where the wax waited"). Minor scaffold: "I set the crucible in its cradle and laughed once, the kind of laugh that..." meta-explains the laugh rather than trusting image. A few template cadences in the middle third ("I moved the braids again and the skylight narrowed..."). No paraphrase loops or clarity-breaking artifacts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: lost-wax casting as a literalized memory-preservation ritual under aurora, with street-organ cards as the transcription medium. The rope-braid control system and bell syllables avoid generic craft-tale abstraction. The forgiveness frame and technically-gentle ethos individuate the voice. Swappability test passes: remove any core element and the closure collapses. Minor: the icebound sanctum and aurora lean toward familiar "isolated artisan" tropes, mitigated by the specificity of mechanics and the charged final triangle.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lost wax caster's choices drive all major beats: testing braids, clipping the card, pouring bronze, hanging bells, and the final listening stance. Occupation shapes perception ("technically gentle" shown in action) and the prior bell-mislabeling mistake motivates return. Present in setup, all middle beats, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Street organ punched card scrap appears early (pocket, line 5), is clipped to frame and used to exhale into wax (two active beats), and its "transcribed memory" output (names shuffling through the horn) directly shapes the bells' speech at closure. Specificity (soot-flecked, holes as memory) is high; swapping for generic sheet music would break the transcription logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Transcribed memory is the operational concept: the card's perforations encode names, the wax captures them, the bells speak them. It shapes stakes (preserving vs. letting names vanish) and tactics (aligning horn, wax, and light). Named early and paid off in the bells' syllabic speech. Could score higher if the concept imposed a visible constraint or tradeoff on the page.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Technically gentle" is shown in action (testing braids "feeling for soft resistance," steadying the frame) and enables the protagonist to manipulate the centuries-old rope without breaking its memory. It prevents one implicit failure mode (rushing and damaging the mechanism). Present in setup and two middle beats; less visible at closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Illuminate" is the hinge action: the protagonist uses mirrored mica to direct auroral light onto the wax at the exact moment the card scrap exhales into it. This action enables the transcription and is signaled in the plan ("illuminate the rafters with auroral fire"). Active in middle beats and essential to the closure's bell-speech. Specificity (aurora as light source) is high.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Reconfiguring the braids controls furnace bellows, skylight shutters, and memory latches; the method is named early (line 8) and demonstrated across multiple beats (testing, worrying the lowest braid clockwise, easing another back, drawing the next braid, moving braids again). The rope-triangle at closure links back to the braid mechanics. Irreplaceable: no other mechanism could unify furnace, light, and breath control.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Icebound sanctum under aurora supplies the auroral fire (only available light source at night), cold that cracks ice and pressures breath visibility, and isolation that frames the solitary reckoning. The setting is named early and active in middle beats (aurora spilling in, skylight control). Minor: the sanctum itself is more backdrop than constraint; the aurora and rope are the active setting elements.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"After forgiving yourself" frames the return and is paid off in the final certainty ("I had mended what I could"). The timeframe is named in the opening and closing lines. However, it functions more as thematic bracket than live pressure; no on-page clock tightens tactics. The forgiveness is asserted at both ends rather than shown as a process with temporal cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Preserving forgotten names is the dominant stake, dramatized in every beat: the plan, the card-scrap handling, the pour, the bell-hanging, and the final listening. Friction is present via the prior bell mistake (cost of failure) and the physical/technical difficulty. The motivation shapes the ending image (bells speaking names) with visible devotion (sleeping on the floor to listen).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>"Snowmelt ardor" appears once mid-story in the laugh that "carries snowmelt ardor across the tongue and leaves it shining." The tone—warm determination amid cold, gentle intensity—coheres across the piece (breath-roses, pine-sap smell, patient moss-like growth of names). It modulates under pressure (quick shadow notes, ribs pulled by the midwife's rasp) and charges the ending (names "patient and bright"). Could score higher with earlier or more explicit tonal anchoring.</comment>
