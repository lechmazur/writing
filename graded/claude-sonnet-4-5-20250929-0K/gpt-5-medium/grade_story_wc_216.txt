<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interior texture is consistent and embodied through sensory detail ("hear the mildew where last year waited"), and the childhood cricket memory earns the final stance shift. However, the motivation to "understand the texture of time passing" remains largely abstract—announced rather than tested through competing desires or visible cost. Lio arrives as a helper rather than applying pressure, flattening what could have been a relationship crucible. The borrowed heart functions as atmospheric metaphor but never constrains a choice or forces a tradeoff on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who, where, and what early enough; the piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens by the second paragraph and holds it cleanly through closure. The capsule discovery → Lio's arrival → collaborative walking/reading → childhood memory recovery → communal calendar-building sequence shows clear causal linkage and one meaningful deepening when the footprint-letter unlocks the narrator's forgotten pulse-listening. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the narrator opts to remain in wonder-timed waiting with visible cost—abandoning numerical certainty—and the final cricket/boot posting reweights the opening silo task. Cost is conceptual and felt but not physically dramatized, which keeps the score from the high 8s.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The emerald silo is established early with vivid, selective detail ("emerald glass that glowed like bottled pasture," "wheat ghosts") and constrains action: the floor's texture enables the footprint-letter reading, and the capsule's physical seal and hinge guide the patience-based opening. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency appropriately—smell, touch, shadow-braiding replace clocks—and spatial choreography remains coherent across moves. The urn fragment's physical trembling and heat-whistle charge the final collaborative work, making environment indispensable to the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—rediscovering non-numerical time-keeping—is signaled early and drives the garage-sale encoding, Lio's arrival, and the communal calendar invention. The capsule crack and urn fragment create one meaningful tightening: the narrator must choose patience over force, foreclosing quick answers. However, Lio's collaboration introduces no friction or competing method; coincidence (someone who reads breadcrumbs correctly) advances the plot without protagonist struggle. The final choice to "not mind the waiting" carries conceptual cost but lacks a visible tradeoff or forfeited path, keeping escalation pressure in the mid-7s.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme—living faithfully in unmeasured time—emerges organically from the cricket-listening childhood memory and the collaborative walking of the letter, avoiding direct statement. The final image (worn boot description, "follow the soft thunder") offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights the opening task without moralizing. Subtext operates cleanly in the urn-fragment-as-nest metaphor and the seam-as-teaching image. Minor slip: "anticipated mysteries" in the penultimate line edges toward thematic echo, though it remains image-anchored enough to avoid heavy penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable first-person throughout with a distinct perceptual signature: sensory time-markers replace numbers, and the narrator's idiom ("borrowed heart," "waiting tasted like cedar") is consistent and voice-motivated. Psychic distance modulates purposefully when memory floods in. However, Lio's focalization is never accessed, preserving single-POV cleanness. Minor filter-verb clusters ("I could hear," "I told them") in reflective passages slightly dull immediacy but remain voice-legible. The prose compresses under peak moments without template cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information density is high: most lines advance atmosphere, character stance, or world logic. Rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language ("rivered," "time capsule breathed like a patient animal") clarifies rather than obscures. However, paraphrase loops appear: "understand the texture of time passing" is restated across three paragraphs without added pressure, and "damaged time capsule" receives near-synonym churn ("split seal," "gnawed hinge," "smeared inscriptions") in adjacent lines. These artifacts do not obscure causality but reduce propulsion slightly, triggering a −0.4 deduction under the loop-check rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The premise—encoding time in garage-sale descriptions after numbers lose meaning—is fresh and specific, avoiding template plots. The urn-fragment-as-bridge and footprint-letter mechanics feel organic to the world rather than imposed for cleverness. The cricket-as-New-Year callback transforms a familiar memory trope through tactile floor-listening. Risk is present: the piece commits to lyric accumulation over causal collision, and the gamble pays off with closure coherence. Slight demerit: the collaborative resolution leans toward comfort over hard choice, edging away from boldest possibility.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The borrowed-time timekeeper role frames the opening and drives the garage-sale encoding method; the narrator's decision to pocket the urn fragment and post breadcrumbs creates the middle turn. The final choice to "not mind the waiting" and post the worn boot closes the arc. However, Lio's arrival is coincidental, and the narrator does not face a competing pressure or make a high-cost tradeoff. Present in setup, middle choice, and ending, but causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The cremation urn fragment appears in three distinct beats: pocketing at discovery, placement on the capsule seam to awaken timelessness, and implicit presence in the collaborative calendar-building. Its curved shape, heat-whistle, and trembling texture constrain action (Lio uses it as a patch) and charge the closure image (the seam-teaching that unlocks memory). Specificity is high; a generic object could not replicate the "waning moon" shape or heat signature. Strong integration across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The damaged time capsule is introduced early, drives the middle discovery sequence (its crack and gnawed hinge require patience-based opening), and its interior contents—receipts, pocketknife, footprint-letter—enable the rediscovery of non-numerical time. The capsule's seal and seam are handled repeatedly, and its "breathing like a patient animal" metaphor charges the collaborative opening. Removing it would collapse the plot's causal spine and the closure's logic. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Suddenly timeless" manifests as the room's rivered state after the urn fragment is placed, enabling the narrator to hear past and future pollen/mildew—a perceptual shift that unlocks the childhood memory. This moment shapes one key turn (memory recovery) and primes the final communal calendar invention. However, it does not recur or constrain later action; its cost is implied rather than visible. Present in setup and development, but not explicitly in closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Rediscover" anchors the narrator's explicit want ("I wanted someone who read time…to find me"), drives the garage-sale breadcrumb strategy, and lands in the ending as the communal rediscovery project ("we built a calendar from gestures"). The footprint-letter reading is the on-page dramatization of rediscovery, and the childhood cricket memory is the rediscovered pulse. Essential across beats; swapping it for "invent" or "create" would require structural rewrites. Strong causal role and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Embedding messages in garage sale item descriptions is introduced early ("shoes that walked like months"), motivates Lio's arrival ("followed the garage sale breadcrumbs"), and recurs in the ending ("Each week we held a garage sale with impossible items"). The method's mechanics—braiding clues of pressure/scent—shape the narrator's tactics and enable the collaboration. Specificity is high; no generic communication method would preserve the tactile, non-numerical encoding. Present across all three gates with causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The emerald silo is established in the opening, houses the capsule discovery, provides the floor texture for footprint-letter reading, and remains the communal calendar's location in the ending. Its glass, wheat ghosts, and spatial layout constrain multiple actions: the floor enables walking the letter, the belly hides the capsule, the light recalls the childhood cricket moment. Removing it would require complete spatial redesign. Indispensable across setup, development, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "after numbers changed meaning" is signaled in the opening line, shapes the narrator's job existence ("the only job that still mattered"), disables ordinary timekeeping (forcing the garage-sale method), and persists through closure ("I did not mind the waiting"). It constrains tactics throughout: the narrator must use smell/touch/shadow instead of clocks, and the communal calendar invention responds directly to numerical collapse. Persistent pressure and closure participation, though the cost is conceptual rather than urgent.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The motivation "to understand the texture of time passing" is announced early, drives the garage-sale encoding and Lio collaboration, and lands in the ending ("we timed ourselves by wonder"). However, it remains largely told rather than dramatized through competing desires or visible friction. The narrator never faces a tradeoff between understanding and another urgent want, and the phrase is repeated across three beats without evolving. Present in all three gates but with limited cost or conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Tone of "anticipated mysteries" is established early ("I wanted someone who read time…to find me"), modulates through discovery beats (capsule breathing, room growing timeless), and charges the final image ("emerald silo hummed with anticipated mysteries"). The tone remains coherent through turns: wonder persists even as the narrator recovers painful childhood memory. The penultimate line makes the tone explicit, which slightly reduces subtlety but does not break coherence. Strong presence across beats and ending.</comment>
