<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's internal contradiction between control and release is embodied throughout—her hands tying knots that sigh loose, her standing still to let teaching find her. The progression from arranging to witnessing is earned through repeated micro-choices (stepping aside from the jasmine-hop braid, keeping a ledger of what she did not force). Interiority remains concrete and character-specific ("the old impulse to fix everything arrived, buttoned, polished, persuasive"). Minor slip: the community-hall speech risks slight over-articulation of the arc, though it stops short of pure explication.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through recurring plant-behavior observations, pattern breaks when Mara stops retying vines, and the cadence shifts from active reconstruction to receptive witnessing. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—"keep listening until the garden could hear itself through her"—with visible cost in renouncing her habit of command. Orientation anchors early (nursery owner, storm season, mossy trellis). One meaningful deepening is present: the shift from reconstruction to observation that forecloses the path of control.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The mossy trellis and storm-season setting constrain choices (vines untie after thunder, plants drift in the weather) and charge the final image when Mara presses the linden leaf to the post. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Mara's professional attention (runoff smell, drip metronomes, roughness blessing her palm). Spatial choreography remains clear across the nursery, hall, and return. The setting directly enables the protagonist's shift from arranging to witnessing, meeting the 9+ gate requirement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: how to tend plants (and self) through disruption. One meaningful tightening occurs when the storms prune certainties and every knot sighs loose, forcing Mara to choose between retying and releasing. The jasmine-hop braid and the ledger of what she did not force demonstrate agency through renunciation with on-page cost (relinquishing control). Escalation is driven by protagonist choices under the Accumulative lens; the cost is legible in her "small unfixing" and the vow to "take apart certainty."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: plants working out "their own calculus of angle and thirst," care as "a subtraction that leaves more life." The linden leaf recurs with shifting weight—начало as a map of untraveled roads, then crisped memory, finally a rough blessing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("the garden could hear itself through her") without stating a moral. One small wobble: "frightening them into acting like us" in the speech borders on articulating theme too directly, though it remains character-voiced rather than authorial.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistent: perceptual signature filters through horticultural attention ("roots thinking," "calculus of angle and thirst") with purposeful metaphoric density that matches the lyric-accumulative mode. Psychic distance remains stable in close third. The community-hall dialogue feels natural and advances the arc. Minor density concern: figurative language appears in most sentences of several beats, but the pattern is taught early and pays off at closure, so the overwriting screen applies only light pressure here.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual and aural variety. Information density is high (lines serve multiple jobs: "It was not a tangle but a treaty, and she signed by stepping aside"). No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Small deduction for mild register drift in a few phrases ("allotted frames," "sustaining transformation") that edge slightly above the established idiom, and one instance of near-redundancy ("reluctant metamorphosis" concept restated across multiple lines without strict necessity). Clarity and propulsion remain strong through closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The premise—tending as releasing control—transforms a familiar "letting go" arc through specific occupational detail (oregano braving the edge, mint claiming the puddle, jasmine braiding with hop). The ledger of unforcings and the image of the garden hearing itself offer fresh inflection. Risk-taking in the lyric-accumulative structure heightens coherence. Mild derivative pressure from the "control vs. release" template is overcome by grounded plant-behavior specifics and the occupational lens, but the underlying arc remains within recognizable contours.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Present early (first line), drives multiple beats (listening to roots, refusing to retie vines, keeping the ledger, speaking at the hall), and shapes closure ("keep listening"). Mara's choices—stepping aside, allowing vines to choose—create the key turns. Cost is visible in renouncing her command habit.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Appears in three beats: lands on wrist with "untraveled roads" question, crisps in pocket as "memory of wind," and is pressed to the post in the final image, reweighting prior material. Not causally indispensable (the arc could function with another recurring object), but the lyric reprise reweights the stake and charges the ending, meeting the two-gate minimum and earning closure linkage credit.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Signaled early ("reluctant metamorphosis began as a refusal to grip") and shapes tactics throughout: Mara moves from reconstruction to observation, lets the old impulse "sit in a chair and speak its case," and steadies into "a daily practice of attention." The concept directly alters her method and is named at closure, constraining the arc's options.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Named early (neighbors' observation) and demonstrated in the speech ("I am not an authority, I am a witness") and in her slow, indirect advice to customers. The trait enables her final teaching stance but does not create a visible tradeoff or constrain an earlier choice with cost. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Appears in setup (rebuilding shelves, resetting labels, tying vines) and drives the central conflict: each reconstruction sighs loose, forcing the shift to observation. The ledger of unforcings and the final vow to "reconstruct only what grows kinder" tie closure directly to this action. Removing "reconstruct" would break the arc's logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Signaled early ("every knot she tied sighed loose") and drives the protagonist's tactics: she stops retying, signs the jasmine treaty by stepping aside, and steadies into "learning by releasing control." The method is named at closure and its mechanics matter throughout. Essential to the arc's pressure and resolution.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Appears in two framing beats (after the river crosses the road, and in the return after the speech). The trellis provides spatial anchor and is present at closure ("the trellis heard, and so did the rain"), charging the final vow. Not causally active in middle beats, but the lyric reprise reweights the setting's meaning and ties to the dominant stake.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Present early (first line) and tightens decisions throughout: storms prune certainties, knots sigh loose after rumbles, the river crosses the road, and Mara lies awake during "nights brought a different lesson." The timeframe applies continuous pressure that forces the shift from reconstruction to observation. Causally active across the arc.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stated early ("here to study plant behaviors, not to command them") and tested throughout: the impulse to command clings to her, she listens as to a sullen apprentice, and the ledger records what flourished without force. The motivation creates friction between want (to understand) and habit (to control), and the resolution dramatizes the shift. Present in the closure vow.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Coherent throughout: tone is patient, observational, and accretive, matching the Accumulative lens. Modulates appropriately (runoff nights bring thickness and metronome drips; the speech softens the room). The phrase "sustaining transformation" appears late but names the tonal arc accurately. The tone charges the final image—"keep listening until the garden could hear itself"—with quiet, earned authority.</comment>
