<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The registrar's motivation is embodied through concrete actions—pocketing the lens, reading doodles, mounting the bandstand—and internal contradiction surfaces when they confess eavesdropping while claiming to serve transparency. The final choice to expose themselves publicly is earned by prior causality and forecloses the path of silent judgment with visible cost ("they can decide if the ledgers deserve me"). Minor diction slips into elevated register ("cryptic doodles...ambiguously clear") occasionally blur the POV's working-class specificity, but the core arc of cowardice-to-honesty remains grounded in micro-choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the registrar's public confession and the communal repair of the projector crystallize trust with visible cost—they risk their post and the curator/troupe visibly reconcile. The Drive Lens reads Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through repeated doodle discoveries, the lens-as-witness motif, and the gathering crowd, then breaks in the bandstand scene where transparency reweights mistrust. Orientation anchors early (registrar, forecourt, night, post-rain) and the lens holds without contradiction. One meaningful deepening (private investigation → public exposure) is sufficient at this length and the cost is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The crystal forecourt constrains the registrar's final choice—the bandstand and rain-screen setup are materially necessary for the projection—and the lens as micro-object charges the closure by enabling the doodles' revelation. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: "puddles murmuring like glass throats," "crystals listen, chiming at the edges." The post-rain setting recurs with purpose (wet screen, rain columns, bright ripples) rather than static description, and the "awnings where the last show shuttered" ties physical space to the broken projector conflict.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—thawing mistrust—is signaled early and tightens when the registrar moves from private eavesdropping to public confession, forecloses the option of remaining hidden, and risks communal judgment. One reversal (held lens → returned lens with transparency) narrows options under the Accumulative lens and the final reconciliation is earned by protagonist agency. The cost is visible: "they can decide if the ledgers deserve me" and the curator's bow with "forehead almost kisses the tarp." The escalation could press harder if earlier beats introduced a clearer immediate threat (job loss, exile), but the social price is legible and the resolution avoids coincidence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars—the lens drinking light, doodles as confession-in-disguise, the broken reel protecting a water oath—rather than assertion. The final image (water scene rolling, ripples across shoes, "the air writes it for me") offers a resonant answer to the trust/transparency question without moralizing. The registrar's arc is inextricable from the thematic question and the "ambiguously clear" motif charges the ending by validating incomplete proof as sufficient for reconciliation. No late-paragraph thesis; the story resists tidy binaries by showing trust rebuilt through vulnerability rather than courtroom certainty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: "cryptic doodles...folded into tiny boats," "my heartbeat is a drum in my wrists." The voice modulates appropriately under pressure (short clauses during the bandstand scene, looser syntax in reflection). Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("resonant hush," "persuades my bones") that stretches a night-shift worker's likely lexicon, and some figurative density in early paragraphs ("prisms...reflections...condense on benches") risks ornamentation. Psychic distance is controlled and focalization remains clean; no head-hopping. The final-paragraph lyricism ("crystals have tuned us") feels earned by the established voice rather than a sudden tonal shift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Information density is high and most lines advance character or atmosphere. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and the opening/closing images anchor the arc. However, paraphrase loops appear: "after words become unnecessary" (line 1, line 16), "agreements are etched in reflections and apologies...condense" then "confession wears a mask," and "the story arrives without voice, after words become unnecessary, and yet it persuades." Template cadence runs in early beats: "I lift...I tilt...I shiver." The final third is clean and propulsive, but scaffold in the first half costs clarity under pressure. Apply −0.6 for loops/templates per the patterned-artifact penalty pack (Q7 only).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of silent city, projector lens as truth-revealer, and doodles-as-evidence is specific and non-obvious. The registrar's occupation and the water-oath reel tie world detail to stakes organically. The ending's gentleness—"truth...gentle enough to sleep in"—transforms the trial-scene expectation into communal repair, a fresh inflection on transparency narratives. Risk-taking in the lyric voice and "after words" constraint heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The piece avoids stock metaphors and the emotional truth (eavesdropping vs. honesty) feels particular to this character and setting rather than generic template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The registrar's choices create all key turns: pocketing the lens, reading doodles, confessing publicly, mounting the bandstand. Setup is immediate (line 1), middle beats show active investigation and internal conflict, and the ending pivot (public transparency) is causally driven by their agency. The role is indispensable; no other character could substitute without restructuring the entire arc.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lens appears in three distinct beats: found under kiosk tarp, used to "lift each [doodle] with the lens, tilting it to gather whatever the puddles know," slotted in brass ring to project doodles on the bandstand. Its chipped-but-functional state and light-drinking property shape the method of revelation and charge the closure. Removing it breaks the mechanism of proof and the final communal repair.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Freed by honesty" shapes stakes on the page: the registrar moves from coward to confessor, and the line "I am also a coward, learning to be freed by honesty" directly precedes the decision to mount the bandstand. The concept alters tactics (private → public) and the closure hinges on transparency enabling reconciliation. It could score higher if the concept constrained a second on-page choice earlier, but its presence in the climactic turn is strong.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Ambiguously clear" is seeded early ("doodles are ambiguously clear, as if a confession wears a mask") and shapes the registrar's interpretation method—accepting incomplete proof. It enables the final reconciliation where "tender and ambiguously clear" evidence suffices. The trait appears in three beats and carries thematic weight, but its mechanics (how ambiguity constrains or enables a single on-page action with visible cost) remain more conceptual than physical. Setup and payoff are solid; middle development is implied rather than dramatized in a discrete choice.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Eavesdrop" drives the investigation arc: the registrar reads doodles under benches, gathers evidence covertly, and then must confess the eavesdropping publicly to validate the findings. The action redefines options at the climax—transparency requires admitting surveillance—and the curator/troupe accept the breach because the registrar owns it. Setup occurs early (line 10), middle beats elaborate the method, and the ending turn ("I chose to eavesdrop, that I feared what silence would let rot") hinges on it. Swapping "eavesdrop" for "observe" would weaken the ethical friction that charges the confession.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The doodles-on-tickets method is seeded early ("cryptic doodles on concert tickets...stuck under the crystal benches"), shapes the registrar's investigation (reading each ticket with the lens), and the projection of doodles on the tarp is the mechanism of public proof. The specificity (concert tickets, boats on puddles, annotated teardrops) makes the method irreplaceable. Setup, middle involvement, and payoff are all present; the method constrains how truth is gathered and shared.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The crystal forecourt supplies the bandstand for the climax, the puddles that "murmur" and carry ticket-boats, and the rain columns between which the lens is aimed. The wet screen is materially necessary for projection. The setting's acoustic and reflective properties ("crystals listen, chiming") charge the final image and the post-rain state enables the doodle-boats and the water-scene payoff. Removing the forecourt would require complete restructuring; the space constrains and enables the resolution.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"After words become unnecessary" frames the world (silent city, no spoken dialogue, ledgers and doodles as communication) and the ending where "the air writes it for me" pays off the constraint. The timeframe is present in setup and closure but does not tighten decisions beat-to-beat in the middle; the registrar's investigation proceeds without a live clock or escalating urgency tied to the silence. The constraint is atmospheric and thematic rather than mechanical. Lyric reprise is purposeful but middle development is thin.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"To thaw mistrust with transparency" is the registrar's stated motive (line 7) and dramatized through conflicting impulses: they eavesdrop (mistrust-generating) to gather truth, then must confess the breach to validate the evidence. The motive drives the bandstand choice and the risk of communal judgment. Friction between the want (transparency) and the cost (admitting surveillance) is on the page. Setup is early, middle beats test the motive (holding the lens "too long"), and closure hinges on it.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Resonant hush" is established in the opening ("quiet night registrar," "no one speaks aloud," "puddles murmuring like glass throats") and modulates under pressure: "the hush deepens until my heartbeat is a drum in my wrists" at the bandstand, then "our laughter stays gentle so as not to break the hush." The tone charges the final image where silence becomes communal writing ("the air writes it for me") and the city feels "aligned." The tone is coherent across beats and integral to the world-rule (words unnecessary), not merely decorative.</comment>
