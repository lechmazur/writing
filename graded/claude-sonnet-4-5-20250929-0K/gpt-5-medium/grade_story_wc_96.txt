<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is highly specific and embodied ("my pockets chime with copper syllables"), though the monthly molting trait remains label-only without constraining a single on-page choice. Lio is present but functions more as co-conspirator than pressure source; no status dynamic or genuine conflict emerges between them. The final moment ("let us practice until dawn") lacks visible cost—the narrator's personality shift is declared but never dramatized as foreclosing a path. Embodied contradiction appears ("I press my palm to my chest to keep the fragments friendly") but the renunciation or change lacks causal grounding in prior beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density and cadence build through the night's reconstruction work toward the final exchange and dawn image. Orientation anchors who (vagrant poet) and where (rusted library) by line 4, when (moon clearing skyline) by line 6—within the allowable window. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): "let us practice until dawn" crystallizes the resistance-as-practice stance with felt cost implicit in the transience framed earlier. The piece teaches its lyric pattern early and sustains it, but the cost of the narrator's imminent molting is asserted rather than made undeniable on the page, preventing higher scores.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The rusted library is vividly anchored through selective, purposeful detail: "stacks are ribs," "books breathe like sleeping beasts," door rebuilt "from a refrigerator panel and a belt." These particulars constrain choice—tarps and outlaw glue, twine and clothespins—and the final image ("morning lifts a blue lid") charges the space with conceptual weight. Micro-setting (coffee tin, pennies, battery-powered lantern) all shape tactics and the closure beat. Spatial choreography remains clear across the night's work; no tourist-catalog padding.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (forge beauty from anarchy before the next molting) is signaled by line 15 and sustained. The accumulative lens allows escalation to read as density increase and cadence shift rather than causal reversal: volunteers arrive, poems are clipped, the map is revealed, the door clicks shut. Agency is present in micro-choices (sorting, wiring, reading pennies aloud) but the final "practice until dawn" lacks a visible trade-off or foreclosed path; the resistance blooms without palpable friction. One meaningful deepening occurs when the map is opened and addresses revealed, reweighting the scope of the project.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme (beauty as practice, not treaty; resistance through accumulation) emerges organically from the night's particulars rather than assertion. The pennies engraved with verbs and the "index of need" motif recur with shifting weight, and the final image ("blooming resistance breathes, broken and bright") offers a resonant answer to the central question without moralizing. However, "blooming resistance" appears as a labeled concept early and is echoed at closure without sufficient causal development in between; the thematic pattern is taught but not fully dramatized under pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and sustained: "vagrant penny poet," "copper syllables," "the wind plays it anyway, singing in ragged octaves." Figurative density remains high throughout but is pattern-taught and voice-motivated, not arbitrary. POV is single (first-person) and stable; no head-hopping or unmotivated distance shifts. Diction occasionally edges toward elevated register ("luminous fracture," "vines of action threaded through alleys and lungs") but stays within the poet-narrator's plausible lexicon. Brief dialogue ("Beauty is not a treaty here" / "Then let us practice until dawn") carries subtext and advances the stance; rhythm modulates appropriately under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Figurative language saturates nearly every line—"rain and iron," "bodies exhale," "moon clears the skyline," "skyline has teeth marks"—creating cumulative texture but also raising density concerns. Several paraphrase loops appear: "molts personalities monthly, shedding faces like ticket stubs" and later "If I molt tomorrow, let the next self remember"; "Books breathe like sleeping beasts" and "stacks stop feeling like bones and start feeling like ribs." Template cadence runs of "We [verb]" appear in the middle third without clear payoff. No clarity breaks at closure, but the saturation and loops trigger −0.6 under the artifact pack, and the repetitive stems add −0.4, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The vagrant-poet-as-rebuilder premise and the secret-map motif offer a specific angle, and the pennies engraved with verbs are memorable particulars. The accumulative night-project structure resists template plotting. However, the "beauty from anarchy" / "practice not treaty" theme echoes familiar activist-art templates without a sharp moral calculus or cost-driven transformation; the final stance feels earnest but expected. Risk-taking in voice and structure is present, but the emotional and thematic territory does not surprise in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The vagrant penny poet is present throughout, handling pennies, sorting pages, reading aloud, and opening the map. Setup occurs in line 1; middle beats include wiring the lantern and clipping poems; closure beat includes the final exchange with Lio. However, the narrator's choices are cooperative rather than decisive—Lio "sets," "wires," "translates into motion" while the narrator observes and narrates. The molting trait is asserted but does not constrain any on-page choice. The character shapes texture and voice but does not drive key turns alone.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The coffee tin appears early (line 11), is described with specific detail (dented, rattling, false bottom), returns when the map is revealed (line 25), and is present at closure ("the coffee tin clinks closed with a sound like a page turning"). The false bottom is functional: it conceals the map and creates a beat when opened. However, the tin does not constrain a choice or force a trade-off; it is a container for the map rather than an independent pressure point. Beats: introduction, opening, closing. Closure linkage is present but passive.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Blooming resistance" is introduced by name in line 13, shapes the middle beats (rebuilding without asking, calling stray hands), and returns in the final image ("The blooming resistance breathes, broken and bright"). The concept drives the dominant stake and tactics on the page—volunteers arrive, poems are strung, the door is rebuilt—but the resistance blooms without visible friction or cost. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. The concept is more thematic label than causal constraint; it frames action but does not narrow options under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The molting trait is introduced in line 2 ("This body molts personalities monthly"), mentioned again in line 15 ("before my next molting makes me a stranger to my own fire"), revisited in line 29 ("I watch my current personality glow and crack"), and invoked at closure ("If I molt tomorrow, let the next self remember"). However, it never constrains an on-page action or forces a choice with cost. The trait is ornamental: it adds texture and metaphor but does not alter tactics or outcomes. Setup present; development and payoff are mention-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Rebuild" is the core action signaled in line 14 ("We will rebuild the library without asking"), executed across multiple beats (wiring lantern, sorting pages, raising brackets, guiding hands, door from refrigerator panel), and named again at closure ("We rebuild the door"). The action shapes the middle third and culminates in the door's click ("almost a promise"). Removing "rebuild" would collapse the narrative into observation. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met; causal pressure is present. The action is essential but shares agency with Lio and the volunteers, preventing a higher score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The friendship origin ("We met years back, sorting books at a prison library") is established in line 7 and provides backstory context for the bond between the narrator and Lio. The shared history ("learning which words catch") primes the collaborative rebuilding. However, the prison library is not revisited or used to constrain a present choice; it is setup-only, mentioned once and never developed. The friendship itself is functional throughout, but the specific method (sorting books at a prison library) does not shape tactics or return with reweighted meaning.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The rusted library is anchored early (line 4), described with vivid particulars (stacks as ribs, tarps and outlaw glue, fence as harp, refrigerator-panel door), and pressures every choice: volunteers arrive "there," poems are clipped to fence and shelves, the map is left "where others can find it," the door click seals the space. The setting provides tools (battery, twine, clothespins) and constraints (stacks need straightening, door needs rebuilding). Setup, development, and closure participation are all strong. The library is indispensable to the story's logic and final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"As the moon clears the skyline" is introduced in line 6, the moon "climbs higher" in line 20, and "finally drops" in line 34, creating a bracketing arc from arrival to dawn. The timeframe shapes pacing and the sense of a single night's work, but it does not tighten decisions or create urgency—no clock-driven pressure forces a choice. The timeframe is present across all three gates (setup, development, payoff) and contributes to atmosphere, but it functions more as a scenic anchor than a tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motive "to forge beauty from anarchy" is stated explicitly in line 15 and restated at closure ("let us practice until dawn"). The motive drives the rebuilding action and shapes the dominant stake, but it is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices. The narrator never faces a moment where beauty and anarchy pull in opposite directions or where forging beauty costs something the narrator is reluctant to pay. Setup and payoff are present; middle friction is absent. The motive is functional but not tested under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Luminous fracture" appears once as a phrase in line 18 and as a tonal marker throughout: "broken and bright," "ragged octaves," "ghost of copper," "bloom and crack." The tone is consistent across turns—lyric, accumulative, charged with both fragility and light—and modulates subtly under pressure (quieter at the map reveal, more declarative at closure). The final image ("broken and bright, as morning lifts a blue lid") charges the tone with full weight. Coherence and modulation are both present; the tone is integral to the piece's effect.</comment>
