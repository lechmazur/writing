<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interior voice is consistent and character-particular, with embodied contradictions ("I am the one who burns bridges carefully"). The teaching moment with the first student dramatizes stance through micro-choices (counting seconds, widening the seam). However, the student remains abstract—"a girl and a crater"—and her arc feels more symbolic than psychologically specific. The narrator's motivation to "teach suffocating to breathe" stays at the level of poetic assertion rather than grounded in a personal wound or need that evolves under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens by midpoint and holds it through closure. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first ~100 words. The closure—stepping aside so the girl "could cross unescorted"—functions as Earned Stasis with visible cost (the narrator's solitude and the ritualized waiting). The cost is legible on the page ("that was the prayer I wanted"), and the lens holds without contradiction. One meaningful deepening occurs when the student places her palm on the narrator's, linking through scars, which reweights the earlier solitary stance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The sanctuary's spatial elements—bare feet, the hush, the door without a house, the doorknocker ring—are filtered through the narrator's perceptual idiom ("cool as moonwater"). The scars function as micro-setting, constraining the teaching method ("Linking through scars was the only way the sanctuary spoke"). The final image of the girl crossing unescorted charges the space with the cost of letting go. The ashen bridges and the big sky recur with shifted weight, grounding the closure in tactile particulars.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—teaching the suffocating to breathe while honoring the cost of leaving—is signaled early and tightens through the lesson with the student. The doorknocker's chill and the scars provide persistent constraints that shape tactics. Agency is renunciation: the narrator steps aside, foreclosing the role of escort. The tightening is visible when the student's readiness ("no longer smoke but silhouettes") alters the narrator's next move. Cost is felt: the girl's refusal to look back confirms the lesson's success and the narrator's solitude.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the enacted particulars: burning bridges with stewardship, teaching breath through scar-linking, stepping back as the culminating act. The doorknocker ring and the scars recur with shifted meaning, charging the closure without overt statement. The final image—"the girl returned alone and breathing"—offers a resonant answer to the central question (how to let go without abandoning) without moralizing. The piece resists tidy binaries; the narrator's mercy is also a discipline, and the student's independence is both gift and loss.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct and consistent, with a compressed, image-dense idiom ("a body that had forgotten the muscle of drawing breath without apology") that modulates under pressure without breaking. Purposeful elision (the nature of the shapes, the student's history) is taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; the single POV remains stable. The final shift from "I kept watch" to "she crossed unescorted" tightens psychic distance in service of the closure beat. Rhythm and diction remain voice-particular throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The prose is image-dense and rhythmically controlled, with strong propulsion through the lesson sequence. However, several lines approach overwriting: "the loaded emptiness, which weighed enough to ground us, but left room for a bird to land" stacks metaphors without clear vehicle coherence. "I clarified" and "I told the shapes" filter key moments that could carry more immediacy. Minor paraphrase loops appear ("I kept my gaze on her," "I kept watch"). The closure beat is clean, but density in the middle third occasionally blurs causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The frame—teaching through scars in an ashen sanctuary after burning bridges—is specific and non-obvious. The doorknocker ring and the scar-linking method avoid stock symbolism through tactile embodiment. The risk of lyric compression is managed; the pattern is taught early and the closure lands without gimmickry. However, the "shadow keeper" and "tender work" tropes echo recent literary fashion, and the emotional arc (mentor steps back, student crosses alone) follows a recognizable template. Transformation is present but modest.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The tender shadow keeper role frames the opening, drives the teaching choice mid-story (counting seconds, widening the seam), and culminates in stepping aside so the student can cross. The role constrains tactics (the narrator cannot simply dismiss the student) and charges the closure when the narrator grants unescorted passage. Present in setup, development, and payoff; causally active across three beats.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The doorknocker ring appears in the opening third ("a doorknocker ring hung upon the door, cool as moonwater"), is lifted mid-story to invoke the shapes, and returns in the lesson when narrator and student lift it together, its chill pouring into them. It constrains the teaching method (summoning the shapes) and charges the threshold steadying. Specific tactile properties (cool, chill) matter to the ritual. Present across three beats with causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The fading threshold is introduced early ("a fading threshold that blurred the more I watched"), destabilizes during the lesson ("the threshold steadied, no longer slipping"), and is pressed at closure ("together we pressed the door until the night exhaled"). It shapes stakes (the door's instability threatens the crossing) and alters tactics (the narrator must stabilize it through gaze and touch). Cost is tied to the threshold's demand for sustained attention.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Burning bridges carefully is narrated in the opening ("I am the one who burns bridges carefully, collecting the ash") and returned to near the end ("behind me the ashes of my careful burnings stayed bright enough to read"). The attribute shapes the narrator's teaching philosophy (leave the wood intact for later travelers) but does not constrain a specific on-page choice under pressure. It primes closure but is not causally active in a key beat; more thematic than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Encroach" appears once, early: "They came to encroach on the habit of my solitude." It names the shadows' pressure and triggers the narrator's decision to teach rather than vanish into ritual. The term is specific and voice-apt, but its single use limits beat involvement. It initiates the turn but is not developed in later moves or the closure image. Functional setup, modest development.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Linking through scars is signaled early ("the old scars wake, pathways opening"), used mid-story ("Linking through scars was the only way the sanctuary spoke"), and enacted at closure ("She placed her palm on mine, linking through scars"). The method constrains the teaching (only scars allow translation) and enables the final press on the door. Mechanics matter: the scars must be touched to communicate. Present across three beats, causally essential.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The ashen charcoal sanctuary is anchored in the opening and recurs as the space where bridges are burned, scars are read, and thresholds are pressed. The bare feet, the hush, and the big sky constrain the ritual's tone (no walls, exposed). The sanctuary's memory ("the sanctuary did not forget") pressures the narrator's return. It charges the closure by grounding the unescorted crossing in this specific, starlit emptiness. Micro-setting (scars, door) alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"After cutting off all contact" frames the return but does not tighten decisions on the page. Time is vague: "the hour ended" and "when the lesson ended" mark transitions, but no live clock pressures the teaching sequence. The prior severance primes the narrator's solitude and the stakes of reconnection, yet it remains backstory. Functional setup, minimal development, no closure participation beyond thematic echo.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"To teach suffocating to breathe" is stated early and drives the teaching beat (count seconds, widen the seam, anchor one breath to another). The desire is dramatized through the narrator's refusal to let the student vanish and the lesson's embodied steps. However, the motivation is asserted more than it is conflicted; no on-page friction tests the narrator's commitment to this work. Present in setup and development, echoed at closure, but not foregrounded in the final image.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Loaded emptiness" is introduced late in the first half ("We stood inside the loaded emptiness, which weighed enough to ground us") and recurs at closure ("the hush refill the sanctuary"). The tone—weighted silence that holds pressure—modulates through the lesson (the night exhales, the stars listen) and charges the final solitary wait. Coherent across beats; the paradox of full void shapes the atmosphere and final stance. Strong closure linkage.</comment>
