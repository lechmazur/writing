<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The machinist protagonist shows occupation-specific perception (chain pacing, valve tuning) and makes on-page choices under pressure. Interior voice is distinct and consistent ("machines are only honest when they are allowed to care"), with embodied contradictions visible in the trembling hands and "delicate balance of receiving and refusing gratitude." However, the decisive choice to tune the gates feels more like technical problem-solving than a choice that forecloses a path with visible personal cost; the protagonist's values are dramatized but the final adjustment doesn't force a genuine trade-off on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (amphitheater, volcano, council gathering) arrive within the first ~100 words. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through sensory density, the envelope discovery, the hidden sluice revelation, and the chain measurement, culminating in a tuning that harmonizes competing claims. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—the protagonist achieves equilibrium and pledges transparent logging, foreclosing further secrecy with conceptual cost legible in "encrypted compassion still needs lungs to become weather." One meaningful deepening occurs when the envelope's residue reveals the forbidden union, reweighting the stakes from simple water allocation to compassion-as-code. Minor causality softness: the child's two appearances feel slightly coincidental rather than causally motivated.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The amphitheater's breathing rhythm recurs purposefully and shapes the closure image ("as the building breathes, I breathe with it"). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: "powder that frets the air like pale pollen," "sugar bitterness," "grit that smelled of both markets and ash beds." The antique surveyor's chain constrains the solution—its "measured sag traced the true compromise line the mountain would accept"—charging the final tuning with spatial and mechanical specificity. Spatial choreography (terraces, stage slit, pit, pipes) remains coherent throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early and sustained: harmonize water flow (traders) versus geological safety (ash-keepers). Pressure tightens when the protagonist discovers the hidden sluice and must decide whether to expose the lovers or honor their encrypted compassion. The final tuning represents a meaningful choice that reconfigures the system, though the cost reads more as technical obligation than personal sacrifice. The envelope discovery provides one solid reversal that narrows options. Agency is present but tilts more toward problem-solving competence than a decision that forecloses a live emotional or moral path with felt cost on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—fairness as engineering, compassion encoded in systems—emerges organically from the envelope investigation, the lovers' hidden work, and the final transparent tuning. The closing image ("encrypted compassion still needs lungs to become weather") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates strongly in the blank envelope, the child's averted gaze, and the protagonist's choice to name no names. The recurring motif of breathing (building, protagonist, gratitude through pipes) reweights the premise at closure. Minor slip: "make the code readable to those willing to touch the gears" edges toward thematic statement rather than pure implication.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout: technical vocabulary (catenary, sluice, culverts, valves) fused with lyric compression ("voices braided with fear and stingy hope," "dappled resolve"). POV remains stable first-person with consistent psychic distance. The narrative certainty matches what the protagonist can plausibly infer from physical evidence (adhesive analysis, chain measurement). However, sustained metaphorical density—nearly every sentence carries figurative language—creates register drift during peak action beats ("gratitude traveling through pipes the way forgiveness travels through families") that slows momentum and reads slightly elevated beyond the immediate scene pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere, character stance, or world logic. Figurative language is pervasive and mostly coherent, but the density becomes a momentum drag in high-pressure beats: "dappled resolve flickered across the sunshafts, mottling my tools as if the mountain approved and disapproved in the same breath" front-loads lyricism where clarity and propulsion are needed. Template cadence appears in parallel structures: "rock must sleep, said the ash-keepers; and my own heart thrummed between them" / "the traders frowned, then nodded when the hum turned to a rhythm." Paraphrase loop: "The building breathes" recurs as a stem across multiple paragraphs without adding new pressure each time. No major syntax errors or clarity breaks, but the overwriting in peak moments justifies moderate deduction per the Overwriting Checks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise—encrypted compassion decoded via envelope adhesive to resolve a water-allocation conflict inside a volcano—offers a non-obvious synthesis of detective procedural, speculative craft, and civic mediation. The surveyor's chain as both measuring tool and metaphor for equilibrium feels specific and purposeful. Risk-taking in the lyric-compressed voice and the refusal to villainize either guild adds depth. However, the core structure (discover hidden corruption, decode evidence, propose fair solution, gain consensus) follows a familiar problem-solving template. Transformation is present in the adhesive-analysis method and the lovers' subplot, lifting the piece above derivative but not into rare territory.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The machinist is present in every beat: pacing the ellipse, heating adhesive, setting the chain, tuning the gates. Choices create key turns—analyzing the envelope shifts the problem from allocation to compassion, measuring with the chain defines the compromise, pledging transparency reweights the council's stance. Setup, development, and closure all feature the machinist's agency. Causal pressure is strong and the role is irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The chain appears in three functionally distinct beats: initial arrival and symbolic coiling, pacing the ellipse to hear pressure, and the climactic sag-trace that defines the catenary compromise line the mountain will accept. Its antique status and specific mechanics (brass links, measured sag) matter to the solution. Setup, development, and closure all feature the chain with escalating causal weight. It charges the final tuning and could not be swapped for a generic tool.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Encrypted compassion shapes the envelope investigation and the protagonist's choice to protect the lovers by naming no names. The concept is signaled mid-story ("encrypted compassion carried not by ink but by residue") and recurs at closure ("encrypted compassion still needs lungs to become weather"), reweighting the resolution. However, it appears relatively late (past the first third) and functions more as thematic lens than a constraint that narrows tactics in multiple beats. Lyric reprise elevates it, but mid-story introduction and limited causal pressure in the middle cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Slyly heartfelt" is named twice: the envelope's delivery and the protagonist's truth-telling to the council. In both instances it describes tone rather than constraining action with visible cost. The trait does not enable or foreclose a choice; it flavors how information is conveyed. Ornamental use without causal pressure keeps it in the mid-band despite setup and closure presence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Trembling occurs twice with different causes and consequences: first when the adhesive seals the protagonist's fingertips (triggering recognition of the encryption method), second when receiving the child's gratitude-grit (marking the emotional cost of the resolution). Both moments are pivotal—the first unlocks the investigation, the second charges the closure. Setup and payoff are clear, and the action is irreplaceable in both beats, driving causal turns.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The adhesive-analysis method is signaled ("I understood the method at once"), demonstrated on the page ("I heated scrapings over a travel burner; sugar signatures unspooled"), and delivers the key revelation (broker-ash-keeper union). It drives the middle reversal and provides the evidence that reframes the conflict from corruption to compassion. Setup, development, and closure participation are all present, with strong causal linkage and specificity that makes it irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The amphitheater-inside-volcano is anchored in the opening line and recurs throughout with functional detail: cracked steps host the council, the stage slit hides the secret sluice, the bowl's acoustics matter ("vendors laughed again, their echoes circling"), and the breathing rhythm structures both the protagonist's work cadence and the final image. The setting constrains choices (where to measure, where the hidden valve can hide) and charges closure ("as the building breathes, I breathe with it"). All three gates with high causal and atmospheric integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"As the building breathes" recurs as a rhythmic anchor across the story, framing the opening, middle work, and closure. It establishes a living, cyclical time rather than a ticking countdown, matching the accumulative lens. The phrase modulates with scene pressure (cold rhythm at dusk, slow inhalations during tuning) and charges the final image. However, it does not tighten decisions in a way that alters tactics—no moment where the breathing rhythm forces a faster or slower choice. Lyric cohesion and closure presence earn mid-to-high band; lack of tactical pressure prevents higher score.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Harmonizing conflicting values is the explicit mission from the council and drives every major choice: pacing to hear pressure distribution, investigating the culvert alteration, analyzing the envelope to understand the hidden compassion, and tuning the gates to a catenary compromise. The motivation is dramatized in the protagonist's internal friction ("my own heart thrummed between them"), tested in the decision to protect the lovers, and resolved in the transparent tuning pledge. Setup, development, and closure all center this motivation with strong causal pressure and visible cost (foreclosing secrecy, accepting ongoing labor).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>"Dappled resolve" is named once mid-story and echoed in the closing paragraph ("an accord wearing dappled resolve the way a tree wears shade"). The tone is present throughout: the protagonist's wavering between decisiveness and doubt, the interplay of light and shadow imagery, the tentative consensus-building. Tone modulates with pressure (uncertainty during investigation, steadiness during tuning) and charges the final image with ambiguity that feels intentional. Closure linkage is strong, but the tone's causal role in forcing choices is indirect, keeping it in the 7.0 neighborhood rather than higher.</comment>
