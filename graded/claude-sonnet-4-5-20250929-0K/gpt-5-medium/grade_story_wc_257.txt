<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's grief and creative paralysis ("the metal would not take a polish") anchor strong interiority with visible cost. Micro-choices—opening drawers, soldering clasps where visitors hesitate—ground the shift from personal mourning to teaching grief rituals. The final stance crystallizes without therapy-speak: "to illuminate what refuses itself, and to wait." A small slip: the mother's question ("what the curtains meant") invites slight over-articulation, though the answer remains imagistic enough to hold.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly in opening lines (observatory, tin of beads, "after Devin died"). The Drive Lens reads Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through repeated origami placements, visitor scenes, and the lily projection deepening across uses. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): the protagonist settles into an open-ended vigil ("to wait") with visible cost (rock bottom acknowledged, ongoing solitude). One visible cost: the protagonist remains alone, tending an observatory that may never fill. The structure uses a two-phase shard (past grief → present ritual) within one contiguous window, legible under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The observatory's physical details (cracked telescope cradle, planetarium mechanism, projector window) constrain and enable ritual work on the page. The lily projection charges multiple beats (tattoo stencil pressed, mother's daughter outline, fingerprints warming glass). Micro-setting through beads, wire, and vellum tools shapes the protagonist's craft choices. Spatial choreography is clean; no teleporting props. Sensory selection is purposeful ("curtains of intention...light found dust like a river finds silt") and filtered through the protagonist's jeweler-mourner lens.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: transforming personal grief into a communal grief practice. The protagonist's agency manifests in leaving origami invitations, conducting wire-tracing rituals, and soldering clasps at hesitation points—each narrows options toward sustained vigil rather than closure or escape. One meaningful deepening: the mother's visit crystallizes the ritual's purpose ("intention honors even the broken plans"). Visible cost: the protagonist forgoes closure ("I will be here as long as the curtains lift"), accepting solitude and ongoing work. No false reversals; pressure coheres under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through craft particulars: "mourning jewelry is not about the dead; it is about those still here, learning a second anatomy." The lily's recurring projection shifts meaning from personal loss (Devin's stencil) to communal ritual (mother's daughter, fingerprints on glass). Subtext operates in the protagonist's refusal to cry ("I did not cry; I clicked a switch") and the mother's question answered by image rather than thesis. The final lines offer a resonant, non-literal answer ("a lily that sings") to the central question of how to live with unfulfilled plans. No authorial moralizing; wisdom accrues from wire-tracing and solder work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voice carries distinct perceptual signature rooted in craft ("metal remembers being rock," "a hinge between a before and an after"). POV modesty holds: the protagonist infers others' grief without head-hopping. Diction remains stable in register (jeweler-mourner idiom) with purposeful lyric compression ("ardor subdued as a red star"). Brief dialogue feels natural and goal-driven; the mother's question advances plot without exposition. One small slip: "without irony" in the penultimate paragraph flags self-awareness slightly above the established voice, though it does not break distance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high: most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "People hired me to set grief in metal" anchors profession, tone, and thematic frame). Rhythm varies; sentence openings shift purposefully. No paraphrase loops or template cadence in peak beats. Figurative language ("curtains of intention," "lily rose on the dome") remains coherent and voice-motivated. Minor register drift: "subdued as a red star" reads slightly elevated against the plain-spoken surrounding prose, and "coordinates in the margin of my heart" edges toward poetic convenience. Clarity and propulsion stay strong; no artifacts touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of mourning jewelry, planetarium mechanics, and grief ritual feels specific and non-obvious. The origami-coordinate invitation system and wire-tracing practice transform familiar grief-processing tropes through craft particulars. Risk: the accumulative, open-ended structure (no neat resolution) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The lily stencil's dual function (personal memento → communal projection) anchors freshness. One proximity concern: "curtains of intention" as a phrase risks abstraction, though the story grounds it in projected light and visitor interaction. Transformation test: plot and emotional arc depend on the observatory setting and jeweler's tools; swapping either would break the logic.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The mourning jeweler's choices create key turns: leaving origami figures (initiates ritual), conducting wire-tracing sessions (middle beat), and settling into ongoing vigil (closure). The craft identity shapes perception ("metal remembers being rock") and tactics (soldering clasps at hesitation points). Present in setup (paragraph 1–3), middle (origami placement, visitor scenes), and closure ("keeping watch with a lily that sings"). Causal pressure: the jeweler's shift from personal paralysis to communal practice narrows options toward sustained work rather than escape. Visible cost: ongoing solitude and rock-bottom acknowledgment.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The tattoo stencil on vellum appears in setup (found in box, drawn by Devin), drives middle beat (pressed to projector window, lily rises on dome), and charges closure (fingerprints warming glass, "lily that sings"). Used in three distinct beats: retrieval, projection for self, projection for mother's daughter. The stencil's fragility ("fragile as breath") and dual function (personal memento → communal tool) make it irreplaceable. Visible cost: pressing it to the projector risks damage but enables the ritual. Specificity: vellum's translucency and the lily-Lyra design matter to the projection mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The "curtains of intention" concept shapes stakes and tactics: the protagonist uses projected light to materialize visitors' grief coordinates, enabling the wire-tracing ritual. Present in setup ("curtains of intention" named when the dome fills with light) and middle (mother asks "what the curtains meant"). Constrains choice: the ritual depends on the projection mechanism; without it, the protagonist could not conduct the practice. Visible cost: maintaining the vigil requires staying at the observatory. One friction: the phrase risks abstraction, though the story grounds it in projected dust and light mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Genuinely artificial" describes the planetarium dawn ("a genuinely artificial dawn turning slowly on brass"). Present in setup (mechanism wakes, dawn turns) but does not constrain later choices. The artificiality enables the projection ritual, yet the story could function with "artificial" or "mechanical" alone. No visible tradeoff tied specifically to the "genuinely" qualifier. Functional but replaceable: the phrase adds texture without altering tactics or closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The action "illuminate" drives setup (protagonist clicks the switch, dome fills with light), middle (lily projection for visitors), and closure (the lily glows faintly where fingerprints warmed the glass). Major turns trace to this action: switching on the projector enables the shift from personal mourning to communal ritual. Visible cost: illumination requires staying at the observatory, maintaining the vigil. Specificity: the mechanics of projection (stencil pressed to window, light filling dust) make the action irreplaceable. Swapping "illuminate" for "activate" would weaken the thematic resonance but leave structure intact, so mid-high band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Leaving origami figures with coordinates inside initiates the ritual practice (paragraph beginning "I began leaving origami figures"). Shapes middle tactics: the protagonist places figures at bus stops, clinics, lobbies; visitors arrive at the observatory following coordinates. Closure linkage: the ongoing vigil depends on continued placements ("I will be here as long as the curtains lift"). Visible cost: the work is unpredictable ("Some nights no one came") and requires sustained effort. Specificity: the origami-coordinate system is irreplaceable; a simpler invitation (flyers, ads) would not carry the same craft signature or thematic weight.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The timeless observatory pressures choices and supplies resources: the protagonist retrieves hidden keys, uses the planetarium mechanism, and conducts rituals in the dome. Present in setup (protagonist arrives, finds keys, wakes mechanism), middle (visitor sessions), and closure (protagonist stays, turning off dawn, listening to mechanism settle). The setting enables the projection ritual and frames the vigil as an endurance act. Visible cost: staying at the observatory means ongoing solitude. Specificity: the observatory's mechanics (projector, dome, brass mechanism) are irreplaceable; no other setting could host the lily projection ritual.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"After hitting rock bottom" anchors the timeframe in setup (opening line and paragraph 2: "pawned my last commission") and charges closure ("This is the work I have after hitting rock bottom"). The timeframe tightens decisions: the protagonist has no other resources or options, so the vigil becomes necessity rather than choice. Visible cost: the protagonist accepts ongoing solitude and unresolved grief. The phrase recurs in first and final thirds, reweighting the dominant stake. No live clock, but the "after" framing makes the vigil an endurance act with felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The motivation "to teach withering to bloom again" is dramatized through wire-tracing rituals, soldering clasps, and explaining grief as "a hinge" (paragraphs beginning "The city had been calling me"). Shapes middle choices: the protagonist opens drawers, gives wire and vellum, explains metal memory. Closure: "to illuminate what refuses itself" restates the motivation with visible cost (ongoing vigil, no closure). Friction between want and cost: the protagonist desires transformation but accepts incremental, uncertain work ("Some nights no one came"). Specificity: the motivation ties grief practice to craft, making it irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Tone "subdued ardor" coheres through turns: quiet action verbs ("I did not cry; I clicked a switch"), restrained metaphors ("heat under a long winter"), and the protagonist's calm explanations to visitors. Modulates with pressure: the mother's question deepens tone without spiking it. Charges the final image: "the smallest, truest heat" and "a lily that sings" crystallize the subdued-ardor balance. Rhythm and diction support the tone throughout; no tonal breaks. The phrase "subdued as a red star" makes the tone explicit and purposeful, elevating coherence.</comment>
