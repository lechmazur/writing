<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interior is specific and embodied—the feather's barbs enumerating syllables, the stone's warmth as recognition—and the motivation to recover buried language drives on-page choices. However, interiority leans heavily on poetic abstraction ("your rooms are the feelings you refuse to name") that reads more like theme statement than lived contradiction. The seer remains functionally static, serving as guide without her own stakes or visible cost. The final choice to "seed my tongue with my old consonants" feels asserted rather than earned through prior struggle with a specific, lived tradeoff.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors arrive by the second paragraph (bookstore, mountain, narrator seeking the seer). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the protagonist speaks "my first true hello" and the mountain answers, reweighting home as practice rather than place. Cost is conceptual—burying the accent forfeited talents—but the final image makes the reconfiguration undeniable. One meaningful deepening occurs when the stone triggers the courtyard vision and the narrator confronts the buried accent. Minor deduction: the seer's nightly "substitution" introduces a reality-warping mechanism that complicates but does not causally enable the closure, adding texture without tightening options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The labyrinthine bookstore is vivid and purposeful: "Footpaths narrowed into aisles, aisles curled into cul-de-sacs of dictionaries," and the floor's exhalation creates lived-in spatial texture. The lost language stone constrains the protagonist's choice—touch it to unlock memory—and charges the final image when the courtyard materializes. The mountain's "hidden thunder" modulates pressure throughout. Minor slip: the "shame-encyclopedias" and corridor "shaped like a question mark" veer toward symbolic convenience, introduced late without prior anchoring, but do not obscure the closure beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: recover "the shape of home" and "lost rooms." Pressure coheres through the Accumulative lens: feather on tongue, stone vision, seer's nightly substitution all deepen understanding. One meaningful tightening occurs when the stone reveals the buried accent and its cost. Agency at closure is present—the protagonist chooses to seed tongue and steps—but the escalation reads more as accumulation of metaphor than a narrowing of options or trade-off between competing goods. The seer warns "hold fast" during substitution, suggesting danger, yet no visible price is paid for that moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—home as practice, forgiveness of silenced voice—emerges organically from the stone vision and the courtyard callback. The final image, "spoke my first true hello," offers a resonant answer without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the seer's cryptic guidance and the feather's enumeration. Minor deduction: "Your home has the shape of your mouth, and your rooms are the feelings you refuse to name" reads as overt thematic statement mid-climax, bordering on moralizing (-0.3 per guideline). The "shame-encyclopedias" and "forgiven mistakes" risk abstraction, but the courtyard of cracked jars grounds the concept in a concrete image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Voice is lyric and consistent: "mercury-glass seer," "bellows," "vowels," "measurements of light." POV remains stable first-person throughout, with no head-hopping. Psychic distance is controlled. The seer's dialogue—"We read via the texture of a feather here"—is distinct and voice-driven. However, register drifts into elevated, nearly academic diction ("cartography of forgiven mistakes," "pregnant with possibility") that occasionally strains against the narrator's embodied present-tense experience. Under peak pressure (stone vision), compression is acceptable, but phrases like "do not think of your address, think of your first shadow" read more as authorial direction than lived thought.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high and mostly coherent: "ivy made of pages," "dictionaries muttered," "loaves of night." However, overwriting clusters in several beats—"mercury in her eyes stilled, reflecting a clean horizon," "seed like a sky before rain, the air pregnant with possibility"—where metaphor stacks without advancing pressure (-0.5). Paraphrase loop appears: "I would seed my tongue... seed my steps... seed the mountain" repeats the seed construction across three lines without variation (-0.2). No filter-verb stacks or template cadence. Information density is generally high, though some lines ("hidden thunder traveled through the stacks, and a shelf shifted, sighing its assent") add texture without propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The mercury-glass seer, lost language stone, and bookstore-as-mountain synthesis offers a fresh angle on recovery-of-voice narratives. The feather-as-reading-tool and nightly reality substitution are inventive particulars. However, the core arc—protagonist seeks guide, confronts buried shame via mystical object, reclaims voice—follows a recognizable template. Transformation is partial: the courtyard callback and "home as practice" reframe the premise, but emotional beats (laugh at accent → bury it → recover it) remain predictable. The story commits fully to its lyric premise, and risk-taking in voice elevates, warranting +0.2 within band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The mercury-glass seer appears early (paragraph 10), enables two key beats—placing the feather and guiding to the stone—and is present at closure ("watched from the threshold"). Her choices (feather, mirror, nightly substitution) directly enable the protagonist's recovery. However, she remains functionally static; her own stakes are absent, and "nightly substitution" adds spectacle without altering the protagonist's tactics. Strong causal role in two beats and closure linkage push toward 7.0, but lack of irreplaceability (any mystical guide could serve) and no visible cost tied to her choices cap at 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lost language stone is introduced mid-story (paragraph 17), handled in two beats (touch and vision, then gathered by seer), and its vision—courtyard, buried accent—directly shapes the protagonist's closure choice. Its "sheen like water watching itself" and the warmth as "recognition" are specific and irreplaceable properties. Strong causal pressure (+1.0), closure linkage (+1.0), two beats (+0.9), but late first appearance (-0.3) and modest specificity in final image (stone not present at threshold) limit top-band entry.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Buried talents are signaled early ("talents that grew wild in silence," paragraph 22) and frame the protagonist's motivation. The concept constrains the middle choice (confront the stone) and is named at closure ("your buried talents are surfacing"). However, the phrase "buried talents" reads as label rather than dramatized cost; the talents themselves are never specified or embodied in action. Thematic presence is strong, but causal pressure is indirect—the concept is more answer than active constraint. Lyric reprise (early seed → closure callback) qualifies for ~6.0 range.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Substitutes reality nightly" is introduced mid-story (paragraph 7, reiterated 32–35), dramatized once when shelves shift and biographies migrate, but does not constrain the protagonist's choice or impose visible cost. The substitution adds atmospheric texture and forces the protagonist to "hold fast," yet no tactics change as a result, and the protagonist's journey proceeds identically with or without it. One beat involvement (+0.4), some specificity (+0.3), but no causal pressure or closure linkage, and easily swappable with generic mystical-realm instability (-0.6).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Seed" is introduced mid-story (paragraph 30), drives the protagonist's final declaration ("I would seed my tongue... seed my steps... seed the mountain"), and is present in closure framing ("a seeding of each day"). The action redefines the protagonist's stance from recovery to active practice. Strong closure linkage (+1.2), one major beat (+0.4), but late first appearance (-0.4) and the declaration reads more as poetic summary than embodied action with visible cost. The specificity of "seed" over "reclaim" or "restore" adds irreplaceability (+0.5).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Via the texture of a feather" is introduced early (paragraph 14) and used in one key beat: the seer places the feather on the protagonist's tongue, and "its barbs enumerated my forgotten syllables." The tactile method is specific and irreplaceable. However, it appears in only one beat, does not return at closure, and the mechanics (how barbs enumerate syllables) remain unexplained. Early signal (+0.5), one beat (+0.4), causal pressure in that beat (+0.8), but no closure linkage (-0.7) and no second use caps at mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The labyrinthine bookstore on the mountain is introduced in the opening line, provides spatial texture throughout ("aisles curled into cul-de-sacs," "floor sloped, then lifted"), and charges the final image when the corridor "shaped like a question mark" leads to the courtyard. The setting enables the journey structure and the seer's presence. Strong setup (+0.7), multiple beats (+1.4), closure linkage (+1.2), and causal pressure (the labyrinth must be navigated, the mountain "makes room" for talents) push toward 8+. Minor deduction: some late-added features (shame-encyclopedias, question-mark corridor) feel ornamental (-0.3).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After remembering becomes painful" is signaled in the opening (paragraph 2) and frames urgency, but time itself does not tighten decisions or constrain tactics on the page. The protagonist's journey unfolds without a live clock; the lantern "burned thin" hints at duration, but no choice is forced by time pressure. Setup (+0.5), thematic presence as frame, but no middle constraint or closure participation. The timeframe is more atmospheric label than active story pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"To understand the shape of home" is stated early (paragraph 12, "You want the shape of home"), drives the protagonist's choice to seek the seer and engage the stone, and is resolved at closure ("home was not a dwelling but a practice"). Strong causal role across two beats (+0.9), closure linkage (+1.0), early signal (+0.6). However, the motivation is told more than dramatized—friction between wanting home and fearing the cost of memory is implied rather than embodied in a live on-page tradeoff. Cost connection is conceptual but not viscerally felt (-0.3).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Hidden thunder" is introduced early (paragraph 4, "the tone of everything inside held hidden thunder") and modulates throughout: "hidden thunder traveled through the stacks" at the stone vision, and the mountain "answered" at closure. Tone remains coherent—restrained menace beneath lyric surfaces—and charges the final image. Strong setup (+0.7), multiple beats (+1.0), closure linkage (+0.9). Minor deduction: tone is more consistent than dynamic; no marked modulation under peak pressure, and the phrase "hidden thunder" risks becoming decorative label when repeated without evolving sensory texture (-0.4).</comment>
