<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The calligrapher-forger POV is filtered through consistent poetic perception—heritage rose thorns, unlinking strokes—but interiority remains abstract and label-driven ("wisely enduring," "calibrated treason") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The mentor relationship supplies motive, yet the protagonist's final choice to leave the scroll unfinished feels more thematic assertion than earned renunciation with visible cost. Emotional progression stays contemplative throughout; no degradation under stress or genuine struggle tests the stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a lyric pattern early—marble sanctuary, dripping stalactites, aurora—and accumulates pressure through layered invocations of forgiveness, unlinking, and mercy. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the protagonist leaves a margin blank and plants the thorn, refusing completion with conceptual cost ("the only honest room"). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening lines. One meaningful deepening occurs when reading the mentor's halted words reweights the mission from completion to forgiveness.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The marble sanctuary under aurora supplies concrete sensory anchors—stalactites dripping, green veils, columns like seashells—that are filtered through the calligrapher's professional lens (letters, margins, breath between strokes). The rose thorn, key, and scroll case function as micro-setting elements that constrain choices: the key "opens" silence, the thorn "kisses" thumb to yield ink. Spatial choreography remains clear across moves (approach, case opening, planting thorn, exit), and the aurora's rhythm tempos the final strokes, charging the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—to forgive the unfinished work—is signaled in paragraph two and deepens when the protagonist realizes the mentor "feared mercy offered too quickly becomes another whip," narrowing the mission from completion to acceptance. Agency manifests as renunciation (leaving the verdict margin blank, planting the thorn) with conceptual cost made legible: "the only honest room." Pressure accumulates through lyric recurrence (dripping stalactites, unlinking, pearl twilight turning marble to pages) rather than causal turns, consistent with the Accumulative lens. No antagonist or reversal required; the tightening is a single reweighting that forecloses the option to finish.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—mercy as restraint, forgiveness as incompletion—emerges organically from the calligrapher's unlinking practice and the mentor's abandoned scrolls without direct statement. The final image (blank margin, planted thorn, letters breathing) offers a resonant answer to the central question: justice and mercy require patience, not closure. Subtext operates in the metaphor of unlinking strokes to free wrists, and the confession/blessing pair. Minor slip: "I measured the harm I refused" borders on thematic echo, though it remains embedded in the character's professional idiom rather than prompt language.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single-POV first-person maintains stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature: calligraphic metaphors (cursive, flourish, skeletal letters), architectural filtering (columns as seashells, nave exhales), professional lexicon (nib, stroke, tempo). Diction remains elevated and consistent—"wisely enduring," "calibrated treason," "pillowy light"—fitting a literate forger's voice. No dialogue to evaluate. One register slip: "I speak aloud to the absent mentor and to the city" toggles into direct address ("I did not betray you") without embodied context, flattening psychic distance momentarily. Compression and patterned syntax (parallelism, lyric fragments) are taught early and sustained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout—heritage rose thorn as nib, key with no apparent lock, unlinking strokes—and while many images are purposeful (thorn remembers hands, key hums with aurora), several metaphors stack without advancing pressure: "lock is a silence waiting," "door opens without swinging," "time is the small space grief needed." In peak beats, metaphoric vehicles occasionally violate physical logic (How does a key lower into a "cradle of air"? How does time become "the small space grief needed"?). Template cadence appears in runs: "I [verb]… I [verb]… I [verb]…" across paragraphs 18–20. Paraphrase loop: paragraphs 16–17 restate "forgiveness of the unfinished" without new detail. Apply −0.8 for density + coherence friction and −0.4 for template cadence in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The calligraphy-forger protagonist and the unlinking-as-mercy conceit offer a fresh synthesis, and the heritage rose thorn as living nib is a memorable particular. The moral calculus—calibrated treason, harm measured to the millimeter—feels specific to this character's craft. However, the mentor's unfinished treatise and the exile-return frame echo familiar writerly premises (the abandoned manuscript, the prodigal artist), and the transformation is more thematic than structural: removing "calligraphy" and substituting another art form would leave the emotional arc largely intact. Risk-taking in lyric compression is present but does not fully compensate for the derivative scaffold.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Calligraphy forger: Present early (paragraph 2); shapes the professional lens (unlinking strokes, measuring flourishes) and the core action (reading/blessing scrolls). Development beat: realizing the mentor's apology mid-scene. Closure: writes confession and blessing, plants thorn. Two gates clear (setup, closure); middle beat is weak (realization, not choice). Causal pressure moderate: the forgery skill enables the blessing but does not narrow live options with cost on the page. Swappable with "manuscript restorer" or similar artisan role without major edits. Score: setup +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, moderate causal pressure +0.7, swappability −0.6, base 3.0 → 5.5, round to 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Heritage rose thorn: Setup paragraph 3 (nib that remembers pruned hands); used paragraph 19 (kisses thumb, dips ink); planted paragraph 25 (into fissure, memory loosens to roots). Three gates (setup, middle, closure). Beat involvement: two distinct uses (nib for ink, planted artifact). Causal pressure light: enables the ink-blessing but does not narrow options. Closure linkage strong: planting the thorn is the final physical act before exit, reweighting it from tool to root/legacy. Specificity moderate: "heritage rose" particularizes it, but a quill or stylus could serve the nib function with minor edits. Score: setup +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure +1.2, specificity +0.4, swappability −0.5, base 3.0 → 5.5, lyric reprise +0.7 → 6.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Calibrated treason: Setup paragraph 2 ("my purpose tonight"), elaborated paragraphs 4–5 (measured ink, flourishes weighed for justice), restated paragraphs 11 and 20. Theme-present but does not create turns: the protagonist's past treason motivates exile and return, yet the on-page mission (forgive unfinished work) does not require treasonous action. No middle choice shaped by calibration; closure (leaving margin blank) enacts restraint but the "calibrated" precision is claimed, not demonstrated with visible cost. Swappable with "careful dissent" or "principled rebellion." Score: setup +0.5, mentioned in closure paragraph +0.3, thematic only −0.7, swappability −0.6, base 3.0 → 5.5, round to 5.4.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Wisely enduring: Label applied to mentor (paragraph 7) and echoed in final blessing (paragraph 19 "both wisely enduring"). No on-page action constrained or enabled by this trait; it functions as character summary. The protagonist's endurance (exile, patient return) aligns thematically but is not dramatized as a choice with visible tradeoff. Missing middle development and closure participation gates. Score: setup (mentor label) +0.3, thematic echo −0.5, label-only −0.7, missing gates cap 3.4, base 3.0 → 3.1, no positive lifts beyond label, clamp at setup-only neighborhood → 4.8 acknowledging the thematic thread without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Unlink: Setup paragraph 2 (lies inside seals, truths inside lies), method explained paragraph 10 (unlink strokes for mercy, separate letters for breath), applied paragraph 17 (to spare a life you unlink the line). Development: realization that unlinking was the mentor's restraint. Closure: protagonist leaves margin unlinked (blank verdict). Three gates clear. Beat involvement: two (explanation, application to mentor's scrolls). Causal pressure strong: unlinking as practiced method shapes the final choice (blank margin = unlinked verdict). Irreplaceability moderate: "unlink" is metaphorically precise for calligraphy but "erase," "omit," or "leave blank" could substitute with edits. Score: setup +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure +1.4, causal +1.2, specificity +0.5, swappability −0.6, base 3.0 → 7.0, round down to 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Key with no apparent lock: Setup paragraph 8 (rests beside scrolls, hums with aurora), used paragraph 14 (lowered into cradle of air to open case), returned paragraph 22 (placed back on pillow of light). Three gates. Beat involvement: two (opens case, returned). Mechanics matter: the key's paradox (no lock, opens silence) is thematically apt for a story about restraint. Causal pressure light: the key grants access to scrolls but does not narrow options or impose cost; any opening mechanism (latch, breath, touch) could serve. Swappable with minor metaphor adjustment. Score: setup +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure +0.8, mechanics matter +0.6, swappability −0.7, base 3.0 → 5.1.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Marble sanctuary under aurora: Setup paragraph 1 (location, sensory anchors), developed throughout (stalactites tempo strokes paragraph 20, nave exhales paragraph 22, aurora streams across ceiling paragraph 20). Three gates. Beat involvement: three or more (entry, scroll reading, ink-blessing, exit). Causal pressure moderate: the setting's ritual atmosphere supports the contemplative mission but does not force a tactical choice; the dripping stalactites metaphorically tempo the work without constraining it. Closure linkage strong: the aurora and marble-as-pages charge the final image. Micro-setting (body/tool) also present (thorn, key). Specificity high: "marble sanctuary under aurora" is irreplaceable for tone. Score: setup +0.7, three+ beats +1.4, closure +1.5, moderate causal +0.8, specificity +0.7, base 3.0 → 8.1, small swappability concern (chapel, temple) −0.4 → 7.7, round to 7.3 acknowledging strong atmospheric work without hard constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>As stalactites drip: Setup paragraph 1 (timeframe cue), echoed paragraph 9 (stalactites counting hesitations), paragraph 20 (stalactites tempo strokes), paragraph 26 (stalactites drip as protagonist exits). Lyric reprise across four mentions. No middle choice tightened by time pressure; the dripping functions as ambient rhythm, not a countdown. Closure: the tempo metaphor persists but does not alter the decision to leave or the margin's blankness. Missing development gate (no choice constrained by time). Swappable with "as candles burn," "as snow falls." Score: setup +0.4, lyric reprise +0.6, atmospheric only (no tactical pressure) −0.8, missing middle gate −0.5, cap 4.6 for missing middle, base 3.0 → 3.7, reprise lift +0.5 → 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>To forgive the unfinished: Setup paragraph 2 ("my purpose tonight is to forgive the unfinished"), developed paragraph 6 (mentor's unfinished work as punishing exile), realization paragraph 16 (purpose is forgiveness not completion), enacted paragraph 24 (leaving margin blank). Three gates clear. Beat involvement: three (arrival purpose, reading scrolls, leaving blank verdict). Causal pressure strong: the motivation narrows the mission from completion to acceptance, forecloses the option to finish. Friction between want (complete the work) and cost (mercy requires restraint) is present but more told than dramatized in a contested choice. Score: setup +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure +1.6, causal +1.3, friction present but under-dramatized −0.8, base 3.0 → 7.2, round to 6.9.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Pearl twilight: Setup paragraph 1 ("quiet of pearl twilight"), echoed paragraph 20 ("pearl twilight turning the marble to pages"). Tone consistent: hushed, reverent, reflective throughout; no modulation under pressure (the protagonist remains contemplative from entry to exit). Closure linkage: the pearl-twilight image charges the final tableau (marble as pages, letters breathing). Two gates (setup, closure); missing middle modulation. Static mood trends mid-band per guidance; the lyric reprise elevates. Swappable with "silver dusk," "opal light." Score: setup +0.6, closure reprise +1.2, coherence +0.5, static (no pressure modulation) −0.6, swappability −0.4, base 3.0 → 4.3, lyric charge at closure +2.1 → 6.4.</comment>
