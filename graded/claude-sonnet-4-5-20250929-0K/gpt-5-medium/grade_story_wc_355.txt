<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The protagonist's voice is distinctive and consistent—theatrical, precise, lyrical—and interiority is embodied through micro-choices (opening the window, circling the bowl, waiting before lifting the cover). Internal contradiction appears in the tension between "reluctant performer" and the overt theatrical stance, though it could deepen further. The choice to inherit Anya's promise and continue the catalog is earned by prior reflection and the clasp-opening sequence, creating visible cost (accepting a legacy of patient listening). Minor slip: the pacifist stance is declared more than tested under pressure within this single scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the protagonist accepts the promise and adds their own entry, forecloses the path of passive observation, and the cost is visible in "my throat tightens" and the dual signature. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density of silence metaphors, cadence modulation (fireworks external clock), and the final image reweights the archive motif with undeniable pressure. Orientation is clear by the opening lines (who, where, when). One meaningful deepening occurs when the clasp opens and Anya's pages teach the method, which the protagonist immediately applies. Causality is clean under the chosen lens; the tuning-frequencies method and the diary's instruction enable the final action.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The shadowed workshop, copper bowl, reed, mothwing microphone, and the diary itself function as micro-setting that constrains choices: the protagonist cannot pry, must tune frequencies, must wait for resonance. Sensory detail is vivid and selective ("rubbed graphite," "antiseptic oranges," "silence is dough"), filtered through the pacifist/archivist lens. The fireworks timeframe and the town holding breath create spatial and temporal pressure. The recurring tools (bowl, reed, microphone) charge the final image when the protagonist writes their own entry. Minor point: the workshop's physical layout is less developed than the objects within it, but this does not harm momentum at this length.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: catalog silence, honor Anya's method, open the clasp without wounding. Pressure tightens through the fireworks countdown (external clock) and the resonance attempt. The protagonist's agency is decision and endurance (not prying, waiting for agreement), and the cost is visible when they inherit the promise and commit to continuing the archive. One meaningful deepening occurs when the clasp opens and the pages instruct the protagonist, narrowing options to patient harmonics. Under the Accumulative lens, escalation reads as density increase and cadence shift that reweights the stake. Minor limitation: the conflict is largely internal and methodological; no antagonist or external resistance tests the pacifist stance directly, though the clasp's stubbornness provides material opposition.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—empathy as careful listening to the unsaid—emerges organically from the archive, Anya's notes, and the protagonist's method without overt statement. The path-to-empathy concept integrates through concrete images (hospital silence as antiseptic oranges, courtroom silence as sand, kitchen silence as dough) rather than abstraction. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "Silence before fireworks...teaches a heart how to approach without conquest." Subtext operates in the protagonist's hesitation, the clasp "embarrassed to be holding," and the dual signature. The catalog is both observation and invitation, and the protagonist's entry enacts the theme. No thematic echo or moralizing mars the ending; the concept is lived, not declared.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and sustained: lyrical, precise, theatrical, with a consistent perceptual signature (sound as touch, silence as architecture, intimacy as performance). POV is stable first-person; psychic distance is controlled. Diction remains within the narrator's plausible lexicon—archivist, musician, inheritor—without register drift. Purposeful compression and patterned repetition ("I say," "I write," "She writes") support the accumulative design and are taught early. Minor note: a few lines approach decorative lyricism ("black petal cupping breath," "mothwing microphone") that could risk overwriting, but they remain voice-motivated and legible under the theatrical-sincerity tone. No head-hopping; reflection is anchored in present stimuli (the diary, the microphone, the fireworks outside).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual and sonic variety. Information density is high: many lines do more than one job (e.g., "I am an eclectic pacifist, equal parts repairer, listener, and reluctant performer of truth" establishes role, stance, and internal contradiction). No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Minor deductions for figurative density: metaphors appear in most sentences of the opening and middle sections without always advancing pressure ("smoke around the clasp," "miniature winter ending," "moth lungs"). These remain legible and voice-motivated, but the accumulation risks slowing momentum slightly. Grammar and punctuation are clean; no pronoun ambiguity. The opening line anchors voice and stakes; the final line resolves by image and action that recharge the archive motif. One run of "She writes" × three could be tightened, but it serves the catalog rhythm.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of sound-as-touch, pacifism-as-technique, and archival inheritance feels specific and non-obvious. The premise—opening a locked diary by tuning resonance frequencies—transforms a familiar trope (inherited journal) through grounded choice and method. Emotional truth (throat tightens, promise inherited) avoids sentimentality. The fireworks frame and the varieties-of-silence concept integrate organically. The protagonist's voice is memorable and particular to this setting and task. Minor limitation: the tuning-frequencies method, while fresh in application, leans toward the clever without fully testing the pacifist stance under duress; the clasp yields without forcing a harder choice. The final image reweights prior material and feels earned in hindsight, but the arc is more confirmatory than transformative.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The "eclectic pacifist" character frames the method (not prying, tuning rather than forcing) and drives the key turn (waiting for the clasp to "remember its gentlest hinge," then writing the entry and signing with Anya's name). Setup is immediate (opening paragraph); development constrains the tuning attempt (middle beats); payoff appears in the dual signature and the commitment to continue the archive. The trait enables the closure choice (inheriting the promise). Swappability is moderate: a careful archivist or gentle restorer could fill the role with edits, but "pacifist" sharpens the stance and integrates with the empathy theme. Cost is visible (throat tightens, accepting the legacy). Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.4; late mild descriptor of pacifist method in action rather than tested under duress −0.3; still reaches 6.8 due to strong closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The locked diary clasp is present in setup (paragraph 6), drives the middle attempt (tuning frequencies to open it), and its opening is the pivotal turn that enables the protagonist to read Anya's instructions and complete the arc. It appears or is referenced in at least four beats (bench, tuning attempt, the click, lifting the cover). The clasp's resistance to three generations of hands and its "embarrassed" relaxation personify the object and charge its role. Removing it would break the story's logic and closure. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.6, specificity +0.7, cost connection +0.4; no frictions. Reaches 8.4 (high essential band) due to indispensability and multi-beat causal work.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The "path to empathy" concept is introduced via Anya's belief (paragraph 8), shapes the protagonist's method (listening to what stays unsaid), and is enacted in the final entry ("teaches a heart how to approach without conquest"). It appears in at least three beats (Anya's note, the protagonist's tuning attempt, the final writing). The concept constrains tactics: the protagonist must not pry, must listen, must wait for resonance. It charges the closure by transforming the abstract path into a concrete practice (the archive as invitation). Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.4, specificity +0.5; slight abstraction (the concept is more thematic frame than object-level constraint) −0.2. Reaches 7.2 due to strong closure linkage and embodied practice.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Intuitively descriptive" is present as Anya's trait (paragraph 9: "Her notes are intuitively descriptive, full of metaphors that lean close without touching the wound") and adopted by the protagonist in the final paragraph ("I turn to a blank leaf and begin my entry, intuitively descriptive, precise, and kind"). It appears in two beats and constrains the writing method (metaphor without invasion). The trait enables the final action and charges the closure by teaching the protagonist how to continue the archive. Early signal +0.5, one beat +0.4, causal pressure +0.6, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.3; label-only in first mention −0.3, late second mention (final third) −0.3; still reaches 6.1 due to closure participation and method inheritance.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Recover" is the protagonist's stated goal (paragraph 10: "I want to recover the gap she left"), shapes the tuning attempt (paragraph 36: "recover lost silences from damaged tapes using patient harmonics"), and is enacted in the final writing (recovering the archive's continuity by adding an entry). It appears in three beats and drives the closure choice. The action is specific to this story's stakes and method; swapping it for "restore" or "complete" would weaken the empathy-through-listening frame. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.4, specificity +0.6; no major frictions. Reaches 7.6 due to strong causal work and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"By tuning frequencies" is introduced early (paragraph 14: "I will open this clasp by tuning frequencies"), demonstrated in the middle beats (circling the bowl, the reed answering, the mothwing translating), and succeeds at the turn (paragraph 29: "When tone and clasp find agreement"). It appears in at least four beats and is indispensable: removing this method would break the pacifist constraint and the story's logic. The mechanics shape the protagonist's attempts and the closure. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.5, closure linkage +1.5, specificity +0.8; no frictions. Reaches 7.9 (essential across beats and ending) due to unique mechanics and multi-beat causal work.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The "shadowed workshop under stars" is present in paragraph 2, anchors the scene throughout, and provides the tools (bench, bowl, reed, microphone) that enable the tuning method. It appears in setup and supplies resources that affect outcome (the protagonist cannot pry in this space; they must use the available instruments). The workshop's stillness and the window to the fireworks outside create spatial and temporal pressure. Early signal +0.7, one functional beat (supplies tools) +0.4, causal pressure +0.6, closure linkage (the writing happens here) +0.8, specificity +0.4; static description in places −0.3; still reaches 6.4 due to resource provision and closure grounding.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "in the final stillness before fireworks ignite" is present in the opening line, creates an external clock that modulates pressure (the protagonist collects the hush, the fuse scratches, the first bloom breathes light), and charges the final image (the sky keeps blooming as the protagonist writes). It appears in at least four beats (opening, recording the silence, the fuse, the workshop shaking, the closing sky). The ticking clock tightens decisions (must open the clasp and write before the fireworks end the moment). Early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (urgency) +1.0, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.5; slight vagueness (exact duration unclear) −0.2. Reaches 7.1 due to strong temporal constraint and closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The motivation "to catalog the varieties of silence" is stated early (paragraph 4), drives the recording attempt (paragraph 17–20), shapes the tuning method (listening without wounding), and is fulfilled in the final entry (paragraph 43–44). It appears in at least four beats and is dramatized through choice (not prying, waiting, writing). The desire conflicts with the difficulty (the clasp resists, the fireworks approach) and carries cost (inheriting the promise, continuing the archive). Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.1, closure linkage +1.4, cost connection +0.5; slight tell-heavy framing in opening −0.2. Reaches 7.3 due to strong dramatization and closure fulfillment.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The tone "theatrical sincerity" is announced early (paragraph 5: "I say that aloud, with theatrical sincerity, because belief works better when heard"), modulates through the piece (addressing the night as an audience, the clasp's "embarrassed" relaxation, the pages' "candlelit steadiness"), and charges the final image (the dual signature, the window opening as the sky blooms). The tone is coherent across beats and intensifies under pressure (the protagonist's throat tightens, yet the writing remains precise and kind). It shapes the voice (performative yet earnest) and the method (intimacy as performance). Early signal +0.8, present across all beats +1.4, causal pressure (shapes voice under stress) +1.0, closure linkage +1.5, specificity +0.7; no frictions. Reaches 7.8 due to pervasive integration and closure charge.</comment>
