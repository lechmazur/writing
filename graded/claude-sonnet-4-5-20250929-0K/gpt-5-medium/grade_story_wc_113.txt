<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The musician's interiority is consistently voiced through lyric perception ("inspiration here is more a tide than a blaze"), and micro-choices under pressure are present (shouldering the door, tilting the lantern, raising the baton). However, the protagonist remains reactive—following instructions decoded from the program rather than generating goal-driven decisions that narrow options through internal conflict. The final act of conducting silence feels more like ritual compliance than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost, and no contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening lines. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered imagery (program stains → constellation maps → portrait → batons), and the final beat—conducting rests until the portrait softens and the program rearranges into dawn—reconfigures the dominant stake (breaking the drowning loop) with a cadence shift. Conceptual cost is legible: the musician must honor silence and step only on reflections, a constraint that shapes tactics. One tightening is present (the discovery that the score is "a choreography for silence"), but the closure leans on atmospheric repricing rather than a decisive action that alters options with felt emotional price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The flooded opera house is rendered with vivid, selective detail (swollen boards, lanterns hung like tired moons, sandbags puffed like lungs) and the environment constrains choice: the musician must step on reflections only, and the portrait's mouth opens only when light/water/print align. The recurring interplay of water, lantern light, and reflection charges the final image (the house rests as the water settles). Spatial choreography is coherent throughout, and micro-setting (the program, the beads, the portrait) functions as setting that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—unraveling the ghost's code to disrupt the drowning loop—is signaled early and tightens once when the program reveals the instruction to step on reflections only. The protagonist's obedience (tilting the lantern, conducting rests) advances pressure under the Accumulative lens, and the resolution (the portrait softens, the program rearranges, the house rests) shows a visible change. However, agency is passive: the musician follows instructions rather than generating choices that trade off competing goods. The cost is implied (the musician must conduct silence, honoring the ghost's terms) but not viscerally felt as a forfeiture or renunciation that closes a live option.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the recurring image of "in between spaces"—pit/stage, silence/sound, memory/presence—and the final image (conducting rests until they turn to breaths, the house resting) reweights prior material without overt moralizing. The ghost's request for a conductor and the instruction to step on reflections only integrate with the thematic question of how silence and memory coexist. The ending's resonance is quiet and purposeful, offering a non-literal answer to the central question. Minor deduction: "lately inspired" is mentioned but not dramatized as a tension that complicates the thematic arc.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The voice is distinct and consistently lyric: "inspiration here is more a tide than a blaze," "I turn pages as if turning pond lilies," "a wordless conversation conducted in drips." Psychic distance is stable, and perceptual signature (noticing the negative shapes between letters, the reflection-constellations) is character-particular. Purposeful compression and patterned diction (parallelism, accretive phrasing) are taught early and sustained. Minor deduction: a few lines lean toward decorative elaboration without advancing pressure ("a tender seam," "crazed into river deltas"), and the final paragraph's repetition of "in between spaces" and "wordless conversation" echoes the opening without fresh charge.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally, and figurative density is high but largely coherent ("lanterns hung like tired moons," "door that swells," "print align"). Information density is strong: most lines advance image, atmosphere, and plot. However, several beats rely on template-stem cadence ("I [verb] and [noun]" appears across multiple sentences in the middle third), and a few metaphors wobble (the portrait "unbuttons" into a door—mixing clothing and architecture—then the musician "crosses by placing weight in the in between spaces, on glints not water, on breath not word," which stacks abstractions without concrete anchoring). Paraphrase loop: the closing lines repeat "in between spaces" and "wordless conversation" without added pressure. No single artifact touches the closure beat decisively, so deduction remains modest.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of flooded opera house, water-stain divination, and the ghost-conductor premise is specific and non-obvious. The frame (conducting silence to break a drowning loop) feels purposeful, and the ending's image (rests turning to breaths, the portrait smoothing) grows from prior particulars. However, the ghost-code-unraveling premise echoes familiar templates (haunted-place investigation, cryptic instructions decoded), and the transformation relies more on atmospheric accumulation than a bold structural or moral choice that redefines stakes. The piece commits fully to its lyric mode, but the emotional arc (passive obedience → ritual completion → relief) does not depart from expected beats.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setup: present from the opening. Development: the musician makes embodied choices (shouldering the door, tilting the lantern, raising the baton). Payoff: the musician conducts silence in the final beat, and the house rests. The character drives all beats and is indispensable to the closure. However, the musician's decisions are reactive—following decoded instructions rather than generating turns through internal conflict or competing goals—so causal pressure and cost connection are modest. Score: early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.0, limited causal pressure +0.3, reactive agency limits irreplaceability −0.4 = ~5.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Setup: introduced early ("antique opera program rescued from a drowned velvet seat"). Development: the program's water-stain shapes guide the musician across multiple beats (decoding the instruction to trace the curtain, projecting the score onto the door). Payoff: the program's stains rearrange into "a coda shaped like dawn" at closure. The object is indispensable: removing it would erase the decoding mechanism and the closure image. Score: early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.5, causal pressure +1.0, specificity +0.7 = ~7.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Setup: the phrase "in between spaces" appears early ("I think of in between spaces where music lives"). Development: the concept shapes the instruction to step on reflections only and informs the list "between pit and stage, between seat and aisle, between face and mask." Payoff: the final line returns to "the between" as the place where ghosts breathe. The concept constrains tactics (the musician must avoid disturbing sound) and charges the closure image. Score: early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.2, causal pressure +0.8, thematic charge without unique physical cost +0.4 = ~6.9.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Setup: mentioned in the opening third ("I am lately inspired, but inspiration here is more a tide than a blaze"). Development: the trait is not revisited or shown to constrain or enable a choice. Payoff: absent from the closure beat. The attribute is ornamental: removing it would not alter plot, tactics, or the final image. Score: present +0.3, swappable and ornamental −0.8, no causal work −0.5 = ~3.2.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setup: the motivation to "unravel the code" is stated early, and disruption is implicit in breaking the drowning loop. Development: the action of conducting rests ("I beat rests until they turn to breaths") occurs at the climax and is the mechanism that softens the portrait and releases the house. Payoff: the disruption is complete ("together we disrupt the loop of drowning"), and the house rests. The action is indispensable and defines the closure. Score: early signal +0.5, closure action +1.6, causal pressure +1.2, specificity +0.6, irreplaceability +0.7, late explicit label "disrupt" appears only at climax −0.3 = ~7.6.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setup: introduced early ("Water damage creating images stains its pages, blooms of ink that look like moth wings"). Development: the method enables decoding across beats (wings become notes, shapes ripple into letters, the program projects the score). Payoff: the stains rearrange into dawn at closure. The method is the primary means of communication and indispensable. Score: early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.2, causal pressure +1.0, specificity +0.5, slight swappability (any divination method could serve) −0.3 = ~6.4.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Setup: anchored in the opening lines ("flooded opera house lit by flickering lanterns"). Development: the setting pressures every choice (knee-deep water, swollen door, flat flood, lanterns that flicker and alter the program's shapes). Payoff: the lanterns steady and brighten at closure, and the water settles as the house rests. The setting is indispensable: removing it would erase the plot's constraints and the closure's charge. Score: early signal +0.7, three or more beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.6, causal pressure +1.4, specificity +0.7, irreplaceability +0.8 = ~8.3.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Setup: the phrase appears in the opening and closing ("amid the hush of unstruck chords"). Development: the timeframe recurs thematically but does not create a ticking clock or narrow choices. Payoff: the phrase returns at the end as a descriptive anchor. The element functions as tone and frame rather than a temporal constraint that alters tactics. Score: lyric reprise +0.5, thematic charge +0.4, no causal pressure on decisions −0.6, no middle development −0.5, swappable with any ambient descriptor −0.4 = ~4.1.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Setup: stated early ("I came to unravel the code left by a ghost"). Development: the motivation drives all investigation beats (reading the program, following the curtain map, entering the hidden room). Payoff: the musician fulfills the ghost's request by conducting silence, and the code is resolved. The motivation is indispensable. Score: early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.3, causal pressure +0.9, specificity +0.5, no on-page friction between want and cost (the musician obeys without visible sacrifice) −0.6 = ~6.7.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setup: introduced early ("a wordless conversation conducted in drips, in glints, in pauses between creaks"). Development: the tone is sustained through implication, gesture, and silence across all beats (the program "asking me to answer wordlessly," the instruction to step on reflections only). Payoff: the final line ("It will not need words, only room for ghosts to breathe in the between") charges the closure image with the tone. The tone is coherent, modulates with pressure, and indispensable to the piece's atmosphere and thematic effect. Score: early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.5, coherence and modulation +1.0, specificity +0.6, irreplaceability +0.7 = ~7.4.</comment>
