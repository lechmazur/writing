<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to learn "the language of old buildings" is concrete and drives weekly engagement with the tutor. The progression from borrowed sugar to shared ritual feels earned through specific actions (kettle heat, desk seal pressed into wax). The final choice to accept the seal and "keep listening" carries visible cost—the narrator becomes custodian of the building's grammar and the tutor's elliptical promise. Interior contradiction appears when the narrator both desires answers and accepts ellipsis ("I did not interrogate the grammar"), though the final direct question ("Are you dead") arrives late and the tutor's non-answer maintains ambiguity without full resolution of the narrator's stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece builds through weekly tea sessions, roof meeting, and meteor-shower closure, each beat adding density to the "agreed upon lies" frame. Orientation anchors who (narrator, tutor), where (building stairwell, neighbor's door, rooftop), and when (weekly sessions → meteor shower night) by the first fifth. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the seal-press ritual on the rooftop stone yields the building's first legible sentence, the narrator accepts custodianship, and the tutor's departure under meteor light reconfigures the relationship from student/tutor to co-sentences "looking for a wall to hold us." Cost is felt in the narrator's new obligation ("keep listening…do not be cruel with truth") and the tutor's sigh "like wood does when it remembers rain," signaling his fade into the building's memory. One mild causality gap: the building's sudden ability to speak after the seal-press feels under-prepared, though the prior lessons ("listen by asking me to stay silent") seed it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The stairwell's "syntax of weight and habit," rooftop garden with rosemary planters, and meteor shower create a coherent micro-world. Spatial choreography is clean: door knock → hallway tea → rooftop ascent. The antique desk seal pressed to coping stone constrains the closure choice—its impression in wax becomes the medium through which the building speaks, charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "heat from his kettle made the hallway gentler," "planters of rosemary lifted their small green prayers," "wax…warmed like a small obedient star." The building as animate setting (breathing, remembering rain) is consistent and voice-filtered. One minor slip: the transition from weekly indoor sessions to the rooftop lacks a temporal cue, though the meteor shower anchors the night.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: learning the building's language, signaled in paragraph one. Escalation under Accumulative lens: borrowing sugar → weekly lessons in listening → rooftop ritual during meteor shower → seal-press that elicits the building's sentence. The narrator's agency is tested when they "interrogate" the tutor's nature and accept the seal with its custodial obligation, foreclosing the path of passive curiosity. Cost is legible: "keep listening even when the roofs look at the meteors and forget us" binds the narrator to an open-ended duty. One friction: the tutor's revelation that both are "sentences looking for a wall" and the building's cooperation in the architect's lie arrive as exposition rather than dramatized pressure, slightly softening the escalation's immediacy.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme—language as shelter, lies as architecture, memory embedded in built space—emerges through the seal ritual, the stairwell's "syntax," and the building's confession ("we are all full of rain"). The final image answers the central question non-literally: the narrator receives the seal and the injunction to "not be cruel with truth," reweighting truth and fiction as reciprocal shelters. Subtext operates in the tutor's dual claim ("dead language tutor" / "also a dead language tutor") and his metaphoric self-description as "Only as much as the Latin in the cornice." The piece avoids moralizing; the building's sentence and the architect's courtyard lie demonstrate ethical ambiguity without forced balance. One slip: "agreed upon lies" is stated twice as a phrase, nudging exposition, though each instance ties to concrete ritual (umbrella metaphor, seal pressed before difficult talk).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single first-person POV with stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature: the narrator hears "syntax of weight and habit" where others hear creaking, notices "paint forgot to cling," and translates gestures into grammatical terms. Diction is controlled and voice-particular throughout ("ellipsis inviting an answer later," "an address in dusk"). The tutor's dialogue carries subtext and indirect pursuit: "every language invents its weather" and "we are both sentences looking for a wall" reveal philosophy through metaphor without explaining. One register slip: "diagnostic self-awareness" appears in rubric language but the narrator's interiority avoids therapy-speak. Psychic distance tightens appropriately under the meteor shower's pressure. Free indirect style is clean; tense and stance remain stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings shift naturally. Information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "He kept an antique desk seal on the table, heavy and carved with a crest of ivy, and he pressed it into wax before we spoke of anything difficult" introduces object, ritual, and emotional threshold). Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent: "steam turns to rain on cold glass," "small obedient star," "cathedral" rooftops. Two artifacts lower the score: paraphrase loops appear ("agreed upon lies…a grammar of respectfully held illusions…an ethics of sheltering"), and elevated diction occasionally drifts from the narrator's established voice ("strangling and embracing at once" reads slightly precious for a narrator seeking plain syntax). The final image is vivid and propulsive, but mid-story beats carry faint template cadence in the weekly-lesson summary paragraphs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise—learning a building's language through a tutor who may be dead—offers a fresh synthesis of haunting, architecture, and linguistic metaphor. The desk seal as mediator between human and structure is specific and purposeful. Transformation test passes: swapping names or setting would collapse the stairwell's grammar and the cornice's Latin. Thetutor's dual phrasing ("dead language tutor" / "also a dead language tutor") is a memorable inflection. Risk-taking in the meteor-shower ritual and the building's sudden speech heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. One friction: the "agreed upon lies" frame and the architect's courtyard story echo familiar magical-realism templates (sentient architecture, cooperative illusion), though the seal-press mechanics and the building's first sentence ("we are all full of rain") add specificity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The tutor appears in beat one (door knock), teaches weekly, reveals his dual nature, and hands over the seal at closure. His choice to pass custodianship and his sigh "like wood…remembers rain" alter the narrator's path. Present in setup, middle lessons, and rooftop closure; his decisions (ritual of gravity, handing the seal) create turns. Swappable with another liminal guide only with structural edits. Causal pressure +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, two gates +0.9, specificity +0.5. No late penalty. Minus −0.3 for summary-only use in the weekly-lesson paragraphs.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The seal appears in beat two (tea table), is pressed into wax before difficult talk (ritual), and is pressed to rooftop stone to elicit the building's sentence at closure. It constrains the ending: without the seal, no impression, no building speech. Present in setup (tea table), middle (ritual of gravity), and closure (stone press). Three beats, causal pressure (seal → wax → sentence) +1.6, closure linkage +1.5, irreplaceability +0.7, early signal +0.6. No significant frictions.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Agreed upon lies" is named in beat one (first lesson), elaborated ("a facade is a face and a lease is a vow"), and returned at closure ("one of our agreed upon lies, that I was a tutor and you were a student"). It shapes the narrator's acceptance of ambiguity and the building's cooperative illusion (architect's courtyard lie). Present in setup, middle elaboration, and closure reprise. Two beats +0.9, thematic pressure +0.8, closure linkage (phrase returns) +0.7, early signal +0.5. Minus −0.4 for exposition-heavy delivery (stated twice without dramatized cost in those beats).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Patiently nimble" describes the tutor's hands with cups and strainers in beat one. It does not recur or constrain a later choice; the tutor's patience appears thematically (ellipsis, ritual) but "nimble" remains label-only. Present in setup, absent in middle and closure. One beat +0.4, ornamental −0.7, swappable −0.6, no causal pressure. Setup only, no closure participation cap at 2.8 waived by functional setup presence; remains low for single decorative mention.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Interrogate" appears when the narrator asks "Are you dead" at the rooftop climax, breaking the agreed silence. The tutor's response ("Only as much as the Latin in the cornice") and subsequent custodianship transfer depend on this question. Present in closure, drives the tutor's final revelation. One beat +0.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.4, specificity +0.6. Late appearance (final third) −0.6, no setup or middle development. Strong closure work rescues the score despite late arrival.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Borrowing sugar (beat one) transitions to weekly tea sessions (beats two–three), which become the frame for lessons in listening and the ritual of gravity. The method shapes middle beats (kettle heat, strainer work, seal pressed before difficult talk) and enables the rooftop meeting. Present in setup (sugar knock), middle (weekly teas, seal ritual), and indirectly at closure (custodianship transfer continues the pattern). Two beats +0.9, causal enabler +1.0, early signal +0.6, closure link (pattern culminates) +0.9. Minus −0.2 for summary compression of the weekly sessions.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The rooftop garden with rosemary planters and meteor shower frames the closure ritual. The coping stones provide the surface for the seal press; the meteor light makes "each rooftop garden a cathedral" and the tutor "an address in dusk." Setting pressures the narrator's question and acceptance. Present in closure only (final third), but transforms prior material. One beat +0.4, causal pressure (stone surface enables seal-press) +1.1, closure linkage +1.6, specificity (meteor shower, rosemary prayers) +0.7. Late appearance −0.6, no setup or middle. Strong closure charge mitigates late penalty.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade><comment>Required element is "None."</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrator's desire "to learn the language of old buildings" is stated in paragraph one, pursued through weekly lessons (tilting head toward pipes, feeling timber tighten), tested when the building finally speaks via seal-press, and crystallized in the custodial obligation ("keep listening"). Present in setup (explicit statement), middle (listening lessons), and closure (building's sentence, seal acceptance). Three beats +1.4, causal driver +1.4, closure linkage +1.5, early signal +0.7. Minus −0.4 for friction between stated motivation and the narrator's passive acceptance of ellipsis until the rooftop question—motivation could show more internal conflict earlier.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Mysterious familiarity" coheres throughout: the stairwell speaks in drafts, the tutor is both alive and "dead," the building keeps lies "when we forget them," and the seal's impression reveals what was always there. Tone modulates with pressure—calm in tea sessions, charged under meteor light—without breaking. The final image (tutor in meteor light, building's breath, narrator's custodial silence) fuses mystery (tutor fading, building animate) with intimacy (shared grammar, handed seal). Present in all beats, charges closure, +1.8 closure linkage, +0.8 coherence, +0.6 modulation. No significant frictions.</comment>
