<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Iria's motivation is clear and consistent—she refuses false comfort and commits to methodical rebuilding—but interiority remains somewhat abstract and declarative rather than embodied. The sailor's arrival and bow feel efficient but his interior life is thin; he exists primarily to witness and assist. Micro-choices are present (lighting lanterns, grinding kelp, placing the bottle) but emotional contradiction is muted; Iria's resolve never wavers under genuine internal pressure. The final palm-against-bottle moment attempts embodiment but the "proof enough" phrasing tilts toward summary rather than dramatized cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece assembles a mosaic of acts—lighting lanterns, writing charters, ringing the bell—that increase density and shift cadence toward collective action by the end. Orientation anchors who (Iria), where (paper-lantern cove), and when (after the last wish) within the opening lines. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the faint ticking in the amber bottle and the phrase "no one needed wishes anymore" reweight prior material with conceptual cost (the end of miracles, the start of labor). The cost is felt in the shift from magic to sweat, though the final image is more asserted than viscerally shown.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The cove is vivid and specific—abandoned lanterns, beached skiff, warped timbers, pilings—and setting details anchor most beats (kelp ground into ink, shells slipped into tide). The amber bottle, bell, and physical tools (maps, notebooks) constrain Iria's tactics and charge the final image. Minor slip: "paper-lantern cove" is named but the lanterns themselves bob "abandoned," creating slight disconnect; the cove's lantern-identity is decorative rather than a live constraint. Spatial choreography is clean; the quay, skiff, and square remain legible throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: coax life back without divine mercy, rebuild through labor and trust. Pressure accumulates as Iria moves from solitary acts (lighting three lanterns, writing invitations) to collective action (sailor arrives, scattered people called, meal and sweeping). One meaningful tightening: the bell's ring summons the townsfolk, transforming solitary conception into witnessed, accountable labor. Cost is conceptual—wishes rejected, ease refused—but felt in the shift from wish-granting to the "first market arguments." Agency is consistent (Iria's refusal and methodical conception drive every beat) though the sailor's convenient arrival softens protagonist sole-agency at the turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—labor, trust, and the rejection of false comfort as the foundation of community—emerges organically from Iria's concrete acts: grinding kelp, writing charters, placing the bottle, ringing the bell. The amber bottle and the bell function as charged objects that return with reweighted meaning (the bottle's "faint ticking" as proof of invisible work begun). The final image ("no one needed wishes anymore") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Minor slip: "large things are made of small rooms and open doors, not of thunder" tilts slightly expository, though it remains grounded in the character's voice. The phrase "reimagine an entire civilization from the habits of how hands meet" is direct but earned by prior particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Iria; distance modulates purposefully between close interiority and observational remove. Voice carries distinct texture: "the bay carried only the sigh of spent miracles," "poorly punctuated," "not a performance but a rehearsal that never ends." Dialogue is minimal (the sailor's two lines) but functional and carries subtext (debt, labor, desire). Perceptual signature is present—Iria notices alchemical particulars (kelp, amber, cisterns)—but some high-register abstractions ("obligations of neighbors who might not yet have faces") drift slightly above the character's embodied moment. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Minor register slip: "conceptual integrity" and "plausible futures" read slightly elevated for in-scene thought.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Clarity is strong; no causality-breaking loops. However, several phrases repeat conceptual content without added pressure: "rejects false comfort" appears twice, "the amber bottle with no opening" recurs identically, and "prices must first exist" is both stated and immediately echoed by "future children arguing about prices." Template-cadence check: "She lit...She ground...She wrote...She set" in the middle third approaches mechanical parallel without taught pattern. Figurative language is vivid ("faded thoughts," "ghost town revival only if the living learn their lines") but occasionally dense without payoff ("the air thickened with plausible futures"). No major artifacts touch closure. Minor filter-verb density in reflective passages ("she reminded herself," "she heard").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The ghost-town-revival premise is familiar but transformed through the specific alchemy frame, the amber bottle with no opening as conceptual anchor, and the method of "working memory" as scaffolding for collective trust. The conceit—revival without divine aid, through labor witnessed—feels earned rather than imposed. Voice and sensory choices (kelp ink, storm-polished bell, shells as invitations) are particular to this world. Minor limitation: the sailor's arrival and the scattered people's return feel slightly convenient; their readiness to return lacks friction or cost. The ending image (faint ticking, no more wishes) is resonant but does not take bold structural or perspectival risk. Transformation test passes: the emotional arc depends on these exact particulars (alchemist, bottle, bell, charter-as-song).</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Iria is present throughout and her choices create all key turns: lighting lanterns, writing the charter, ringing the bell, summoning the townsfolk. Setup clear in opening lines; development across multiple beats (conception, invitation, collaboration); closure directly shaped by her agency (placing palm on bottle, declaring the time of wishes ended). Cost is conceptual but visible: she forecloses ease and commits to labor. Specificity high (alchemist who "rejects false comfort," "ground kelp into ink"). Swappability low; her alchemical identity and methodical conception are irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The amber bottle appears early ("an amber bottle with no opening"), is handled/used in at least three beats (set in the center as clock-heart, gazing at its light to hold plans, passed like a candle at the meal, palm placed against it at closure), and returns with reweighted meaning (the faint ticking as proof of invisible work). Setup, development, closure all present. Causal pressure moderate: it frames the collective imagination but does not narrow a live choice under duress. Specificity high ("no opening," "held the city as a problem and as a promise"). Irreplaceable: removing it would collapse the conceptual anchor of the revival.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Ghost town revival" is the dominant stake from the opening and shapes all tactics: Iria returns to a deserted cove, conceives a way to coax life back, rings the bell to call scattered people, and by the end the cove "no longer resembled a memory." Setup immediate; development across beats (planning, inviting, collective action); closure directly tied (people sweeping, first market arguments). Causal pressure solid: the concept constrains method (no wishes, only labor) and alters options (from solitary to witnessed accountability). Specificity moderate: the revival is concrete (ovens, wells, benches, disputes danced) but the ghost-town frame is familiar.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Rejects false comfort" is stated twice ("she rejects false comfort swirling like smoke" and "he knew her work, that she rejects false comfort") and shapes Iria's baseline stance: she refuses wishes, refuses ease, commits to hard labor. Setup clear; development implicit (every choice embodies the rejection); closure participation indirect (the ending declares "no one needed wishes anymore"). Cost is conceptual—she forecloses divine shortcuts—but no single on-page action dramatizes a trade-off between comfort and hardship with visible friction. The trait is more label than lived constraint. Swappability moderate: "refuses shortcuts" or "chooses difficulty" would serve nearly as well.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Conceive" is the stated action ("began to conceive a way") and Iria's conception drives the arc: she conceives the plan, writes the charter, places the bottle, plots firebreak gardens, teaches the sailor to count thoughts. Setup early; development across multiple beats (planning, writing, plotting, teaching); closure tied (the faint ticking is proof "something invisible had started"). Causal pressure solid: conception shapes all tactics and the final image. Specificity moderate: the action is intellectual/methodical rather than physical, fitting the alchemist frame. Swappability low: "plan" or "design" would flatten the intellectual texture.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Through working memory" appears explicitly twice: "sorted the problems out loud, step by step through working memory until the sequence held" and "taught the sailor to count aloud his thoughts, to stack them through working memory like nets on a drying rack." Setup mid-story (~30%); development in one teaching beat; closure participation absent (the final ticking does not invoke the method). The mechanics are named but not shown constraining a live choice under pressure; it reads as method-label rather than dramatized constraint. Swappability moderate: "methodically" or "step by step" would serve. Cost absent: no scene shows the method failing or imposing friction.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The "paper-lantern cove" is named in the opening and anchors all action: the quay, abandoned lanterns, beached skiff, pilings, fish market site, and the square where disputes are danced. Setup immediate; development across beats (lighting lanterns at the fish market site, slipping shells into tide, ringing the bell on the quay); closure tied (sweeping the square, the cove "no longer resembled a memory"). Causal pressure moderate: the cove provides resources (lanterns, skiff, timbers) and the spatial layout guides action, but no single environmental constraint forces a tactical shift. Specificity solid: "paper-lantern" is evocative and recurring lanterns charge the imagery. Micro-setting allowance applies.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"After the last wish is granted" is stated in the opening ("the first evening after the last wish is granted") and frames the stakes: the era of wishes has ended, forcing labor-based revival. Setup immediate; development implicit (every act rejects wish-logic); closure directly tied ("the time of wishes had ended," "no one needed wishes anymore"). The timeframe does not create urgency or tighten a live clock; it is conceptual backdrop rather than active constraint. No on-page moment shows time pressure altering a choice. Swappability moderate: "after the age of miracles" would serve. Cost is thematic (wishes lost) but not tactical.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"To reimagine an entire civilization" is stated explicitly late (~70%): "she had returned to reimagine not only the town, but to reimagine an entire civilization from the habits of how hands meet." Setup absent (motivation declared late); development retrospective (all prior acts fit but were not framed as civilization-scale); closure participation moderate (the ending's collective labor and "plausible futures" align). The phrase is large and abstract, diluting specificity. Cost is conceptual (the scale of ambition) but not dramatized as a live trade-off. Swappability moderate: "rebuild the community" would serve. The motivation is told rather than shown in contradictory want/fear tension.</comment>
