<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interior is richly embodied through concrete objects (black sand, coin) that ground her emotional arc, and her choice to teach the boy through grafting rather than scolding shows character-particular compassion. The father's backstory is efficiently threaded through present action and shifts her stance ("unlearned his purpose and kept his skill"). However, the reflection-heavy middle section ("she wanted to prove that scars can sing") abstracts motivation into theme-speak rather than dramatizing conflicted choice, and the boy's agency remains underdeveloped—he nods and follows but does not resist or complicate her teaching with his own need.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece anchors orientation quickly (dunes, lagoon, her role) and commits to an Accumulative/Textural lens: the coin-swing ritual, black sand sprinkling, and grafting action layer pressure through recurring objects and gestures. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the boy's smile signals forgiveness-by-wind, the coin is pinned where drafts test it, and she becomes "the opposite of a fuse." Cost is conceptual and felt—she carries the tide's engine and measures days by songs released—but the final image's reweighting is oblique; the cost of this teaching (time, vulnerability, the weight she continues to carry) is stated more than shown in a decisive closing beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon and volcanic textures (kelp-drift, cooled lava, black sand) are vivid and selective, filtering through the protagonist's firefighter attention. The coin and sand function as micro-setting tools that constrain her ritual choices and charge the grafting beat. Spatial choreography is clear (she kneels, the boy stands behind, the seedling is grafted into a stump), and the sea-lettuce fringe and gull-runes anchor the locale without catalog excess. The lagoon's obsidian skin as "a throat clearing before speech" ties setting to theme without heavy symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving scars can sing, teaching the boy through ritual—is signaled early and deepens when she lets the coin touch water and speaks her name and father together. The boy's arrival adds a secondary pressure, and the grafting act narrows her tactic from passive listening to active teaching. However, the boy's conflict is muted (he nods, he smiles) and his scar-listening does not resist or test her method; the escalation reads as accumulation of gestures rather than a choice under pressure that forecloses a path. Cost is present but diffuse: she carries the tide-engine, measures days by songs, but no single beat forces a trade-off that makes the price vivid on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—unyielding compassion, scars that sing, grafting calm onto fear—emerges through concrete action (coin pendulum, black sand constellation, olive seedling) without overt thesis. The final image ("the opposite of a fuse, a graceful delay") reweights the father's arson and her firefighting into a coherent stance. The piece resists moralizing and invites reflection through layered particulars. A single thematic echo appears ("the sound of healed edges… a tone that remembers without burning"), but it is earned by the prior ritual and does not collapse into prompt language or sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Voice is lyric and consistent, with a perceptual signature anchored in firefighter alertness and poetic compression ("kelp-drift peace," "obsidian folded tight as night"). Psychic distance is stable, and the protagonist's way of noticing (wind, scars, fire metaphors) is character-particular. Dialogue is minimal but purposeful when present. However, several lines drift into elevated register that exceeds the POV's likely lexicon under pressure ("unyielding compassion," "a compass that pointed toward the burning and then beyond the smoke"), and the final paragraph's summary ("she would answer alarms and she would answer water") tells theme rather than trusting the image to close.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm is controlled and varied, with strong concrete nouns (obsidian, kelp-drift, sea lettuce) and minimal filter verbs. Information density is high in ritual beats (coin-swing, sand-sprinkling, grafting). However, paraphrase loops appear in the middle third ("she wanted to prove… if water could turn glass… then her town could hold") and the final paragraph restates the tide-engine metaphor without added pressure. Template cadence runs through several lines ("She came because… She found… She stepped… She did not accuse"), and the phrase "unyielding compassion" recurs as a label without fresh embodiment. No artifacts touch the closure beat, so high-band entry remains possible, but the loops and scaffolding reduce propulsion in the middle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of arsonist's daughter turned firefighter, volcanic black sand as ballast, and coin-as-pendulum is specific and non-obvious, grounding the premise in sensory particulars. The grafting ritual and obsidian lagoon avoid generic redemption arcs. However, the core frame—teaching a boy who played with fire through symbolic ritual—echoes familiar mentorship templates, and the emotional arc (trauma transmuted to teaching, scars that sing) follows a well-worn path. The piece transforms through its lyric texture and object specificity, but the underlying structure is recognizable without bold risk that heightens stakes or subverts expectation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The arsonist's-daughter firefighter is seeded early and shapes her motivation (unlearned purpose, kept skill), drives the middle choice to teach rather than scold, and anchors the closure image (opposite of a fuse). Her decision to graft the seedling and wrap it with red thread is causally tied to her history. Setup, development, and payoff are all present. However, her agency in the grafting beat is shared with the boy, and the closure pivots more on the tide-engine metaphor than on a final choice tied to her daughter-of-arson identity. Causal pressure +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, irreplaceability +0.5, but swappability friction −0.4 (a firefighter without the arson heritage could perform similar teaching).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Black sand appears in three beats: backstory gift, sprinkled as crescent on the lagoon, and resting by the hose rack at closure. It constrains her ritual choice (she uses it to mark the water) and reappears with reweighted meaning (ballast, reminder of faces needing care). Setup, development, and payoff are present. Early signal +0.5, beat involvement (three beats) +1.4, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.6. However, the sand's role in the grafting beat is passive (it floats, it "rode barely above"), and its presence at the hose rack is ornamental rather than causally active. Cameo-closure friction −0.7, ornamental use in final beat −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Unyielding compassion is named explicitly ("grafted to a new root called unyielding compassion"), reappears at closure ("an engine of unyielding compassion"), and shapes her choice not to scold the boy. It frames expectation and participates in the ending. However, the concept is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choice—she does not face a moment where compassion costs her something immediate or where unyielding stance forecloses another path. Setup +0.5, closure linkage +0.9, but label-only treatment −0.8, summary-only use −0.5, swappability −0.5 (generic kindness could replace it with minor edits).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Gracefully alert appears in the opening sentence and is embodied in her controlled kneeling and coin-handling. It reads as label-plus-gesture rather than a trait that enables or constrains a high-stakes choice. The attribute does not shape a turn or impose visible cost. Setup +0.4, beat involvement (opening gesture) +0.4, but label-only friction −0.8, late-appearance penalty waived (present early), swappability −0.6 (calm professionalism could substitute).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Grafting is seeded early (her skill learned from father, unlearned purpose), enacted on-page with the boy (splitting bark, placing seedling, wrapping with red thread), and participates in closure (the grafted hope wrapped in thread, the vow touching earth and water). The action alters the boy's stance (he smiles as if forgiven) and embodies the story's central metaphor. Setup +0.7, beat involvement (two beats: father backstory, on-page grafting) +0.9, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.4, specificity +0.7, cost connection +0.4. No major frictions; the action is irreplaceable and drives the arc.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The foreign coin on red thread is introduced early, used twice (swung to read wind, touched to water as tuning fork), and reappears at closure (pinned above the station door). It constrains her ritual choices and charges the final image. Setup +0.6, beat involvement (three beats) +1.4, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.6. However, the coin's mechanics are somewhat decorative—it swings west, declares the sea a friend, but this reading does not alter her next move in a visible way. Ornamental friction −0.5, swappability −0.4 (another divinatory object could replace it with minor edits).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon is signaled early, shapes the middle ritual (she kneels at its edge, touches it with the coin, hears its chiming answer), and participates in closure (the lagoon answered again when clouds flocked lower). The setting's properties (obsidian skin, singing water) enable her proof that scars can sing. Setup +0.7, beat involvement (three beats) +1.4, causal pressure +1.1, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.8. Minor friction: the lagoon's response is atmospheric rather than a hard constraint that blocks or forces her choice (−0.3 ornamental use at closure transition).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The migration of clouds appears in the opening and closing sentences and is tied to the lagoon's singing. However, the timeframe is vague—clouds migrate, but no clock tightens decisions or tracks elapsed time on the page. The element frames atmosphere but does not constrain tactics or escalate pressure. Setup +0.4, closure linkage +0.6, but ornamental use −0.7, swappability −0.6 (a generic day or weather condition could replace it), no beat involvement in the middle.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation to prove scars can sing is stated explicitly, drives her trip to the lagoon, and is echoed in the teaching moment ("the sound of healed edges"). It shapes her choice to teach rather than scold. Setup +0.6, beat involvement (two beats: her private task, the teaching) +0.9, causal pressure +0.7, closure linkage +0.8. However, the desire is told more than dramatized—she does not face friction between this want and a competing cost or fear that would test her commitment. Label-only friction −0.5, summary-only use −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Kelp-drift peace appears in the opening ("kelp-drift peace clung to the air") and closing ("In that kelp-drift peace, she became the opposite of a fuse"), framing the arc and modulating with the ritual's quiet intensity. Tone is coherent through turns and charges the final image. Setup +0.6, closure linkage +1.3, specificity +0.5. However, the tone is static—no visible pressure shift or tonal friction that tests the peace against urgency. Single static mood friction −0.4, ornamental reprise −0.3.</comment>
