<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interior is consistent—landscape astrology as lens, the desire for belonging—and micro-choices (holding the feather, synchronizing breath) are embodied. However, the final realization ("belonging is a rhythm you listen for") edges toward label-speak rather than embodied discovery, and the emotional arc resolves too tidily without sufficient on-page cost or contradiction acting simultaneously in scene. The relationship with Rin is collaborative but lacks pressure-testing friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive by the opening (who, where, when). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered imagery (silt constellations, glass fronds, memory engine) and the closure reconfigures the protagonist's maps from "destinations" to "companions" with a cadence shift in the final lines. One meaningful deepening occurs when the algorithm invites rest and the protagonist realizes belonging as shared rhythm. Cost is felt but oblique—the piece signals consent and patience rather than a sharp forfeiture—qualifying as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The underwater city is vividly specific (seaweed hatch, glass fronds, corroded port, cracked observatory dome) and micro-setting details (burnt feather as conductor, kelp-wrapped copper) constrain the method of entry. Spatial choreography is clear across moves. The setting charges the final image: "the city felt almost native" and the protagonist's maps "breathe with me," directly tying environment to closure stance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>One dominant stake—learning the rhythm of belonging—is signaled early and sustained. The mid-story tightening occurs when the sentinel algorithm tests their breath-sync and grants access, narrowing options (pass or fail). The ending reweights the sunrise from threat to consent, a meaningful deepening. However, no sharp trade-off or visible loss appears on the page; the algorithm simply "invited us to rest," lowering tension rather than escalating cost, and the protagonist's final insight arrives without friction or sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—belonging as shared rhythm rather than nativity—emerges organically from action (breath-syncing with nodes, algorithm asking what they seek, final map reconfiguration). The burnt feather recurs with shifted meaning (patient memory → conductor → quill signature). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "belonging is a rhythm you listen for until you can hum it back without fear" and "maps that know when to put the pencil down." Subtext operates in image (fish as drowsy stars, walls stop measuring) without overt thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: "landscape astrologer, reading ridgelines and trenches the way others thread stars into maps." Diction is purposefully lyric and compressed ("shadowseam wonder," "beach breath," "tides in bone"). However, elevated register pervades even high-pressure beats without modulation, and some lines ("spotting the first fireflies of summer in the drifting plankton glow") blur clarity. Free indirect distance with Rin is clean; no head-hopping. Experimental compression is taught early and pays off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout: "constellations of silt and wire," "glass fronds swayed like thought," "silver skein," "fish whirled like punctuation." In peak beats (sentinel test, memory engine interaction), metaphor stacks risk opacity: "shadowseam wonder, all half-light edges" reads ornamental rather than propulsive. Template stems appear: "I am…," "We…," "The…" open multiple consecutive sentences without purposeful pattern. Paraphrase loops: "luminous respite" is named, then explained as "not a retreat…but a world agreeing to breathe with you," then reiterated in the final lines. Information density is moderate; some lines do double duty, others linger. No major causality breaks, so artifacts stay in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis—landscape astrologer meets underwater archive, breath as key, belonging as rhythm—is specific and non-obvious. The burnt feather's transformation across uses (fire survivor → carbon conductor → quill) feels earned. However, the emotional arc (outsider seeks belonging, finds consent through patience) follows a familiar template, and the final insight ("belonging is a rhythm you listen for") edges toward platitude despite the lyric delivery. The underwater setting and algorithmic sentinel add freshness, but the stakes and resolution remain mediated by convenience (algorithm simply invites rest) rather than bold risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The landscape astrologer vocation frames perception throughout ("reading ridgelines and trenches," translating slopes into sky, drawing maps). It enables the protagonist to "read the floor" when the city asks, and the final choice to draw "maps that know when to put the pencil down" reconfigures the trait. However, no key turn traces directly to astrology as method; the occupation flavors voice more than it constrains action. Present in setup, middle interpretation, and closure reprise, but swappable with another observational craft.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The burnt feather appears in three functional beats: handed as key (setup), held against port as conductor (middle action), set down like a quill for algorithm recognition (closure). Its carbon property matters ("took to carbon like a patient memory holds light," algorithm recognizes "signature of ash and storm"). Removing it would break the entry mechanism and the archive's thematic link to memory surviving fire. Specificity and causal pressure earn high-band entry, though cost tied to the feather itself is implicit rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Luminous respite" is named early as the protagonist's goal and redefined at the memory engine: "not a retreat from the world, but a world agreeing to breathe with you." The concept shapes the dominant stake (what respite means) and the closure reweights it from threat-avoidance to consent. However, it functions more as thematic framing than as a tactical constraint; no mid-story choice hinges on respite versus another option. Present across setup, middle insight, and ending, but primarily resonates rather than pressures.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Softly ingenious" labels Rin's makeshift fins in the opening and recurs in the final line to describe the maps ("softly ingenious and kind"). No on-page action is constrained or enabled by ingenuity as a trait; the phrase colors description without mechanical consequence. The closure reprise reweights the phrase thematically, but no visible cost or choice traces to it. Present in setup and ending, absent in middle development; remains ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Captivate the sentinel algorithm" is announced as the procedural gate, enacted through the shared exhale ritual, and succeeds when "the nodes pulsed back, counting with us as if we belonged." The action drives the major turn (access granted) and the thematic proof (belonging via synchronization). Removing it would collapse the entry mechanism and the story's central test. High integration across setup, middle execution, and thematic closure, with specificity (breath-timing) that resists easy substitution.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The shared exhale is taught by the elders, signaled as method ("we needed to captivate…it still opened to seekers who breathed on time"), and executed in the key beat: "We lowered our regulators and made a shared exhale spotting the first fireflies of summer in the drifting plankton glow." Its mechanics matter—timing must match the nodes—and it enables the algorithm's acceptance. Present in setup instruction, middle enactment, and thematic echo (synchronizing inhales at rest). Specificity (fireflies, plankton glow) resists substitution, though the final cost is tied to the outcome rather than the method itself.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The forgotten underwater research facility provides spatial pressure (hatch, data garden, heart lab, cracked dome), resource constraints (corroded port, rusted vents), and the memory engine that tests the protagonists. The setting's abandonment and semi-functional systems shape tactics (rewiring with kelp-copper, using the feather as conductor). The closure hinges on the city's consent: "the city felt almost native," "algorithms unlatched the doors." Micro-setting (observatory dome, grating) charges the rest scene. Specificity and causal involvement across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Until sunrise" is declared as deadline in the opening ("I had until sunrise, before the rip tides woke") and returns at closure ("When the eastern water brightened, the algorithms unlatched the doors"). However, no mid-story beat tests the clock; the protagonists rest beneath the dome with no visible time pressure, and the ending arrival of dawn functions as permission rather than threat. The shift from "threat" to "consent" reweights the frame thematically, but elapsed time never tightens tactics. Present in setup and ending; absent in middle pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation—"to learn the rhythm of belonging without pretending to be native"—is voiced to the algorithm, dramatized through the breath-sync test, and resolved in the closure realization: "belonging is a rhythm you listen for until you can hum it back without fear." The desire drives the entry attempt and shapes the algorithm's hospitality. Friction appears between wanting inclusion and fearing intrusion ("guide others here only if the city wished to be a home"). Cost is conceptual (foreclosing false nativity) rather than a sharp loss. Strong setup, middle choice, and thematic payoff.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Shadowseam wonder" as tone is established early ("all half-light edges, all hush between broken systems that still murmured of purpose") and sustained through imagery (glass fronds, drowsy stars, murals waking). The tone modulates slightly under pressure (tremor as "tired applause," engine sigh as "beach breath") and charges the final image ("luminous respite kept breathing through our chests," "old city answer yes"). Coherent across beats with cadence shift at closure, though the lush lyricism remains steady rather than sharpening under peak stress.</comment>
