<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is vivid and particular—"bruised awe lived under my ribs," the mother's words as "a useful gear"—and the work is embodied through glove-feel and filing. However, the protagonist's stance remains static across the entire piece; there is no visible internal contradiction or choice under pressure that forecloses a path with cost. The final action (singing the lullaby) feels predetermined rather than wrestled from competing impulses, and no meaningful change or renunciation occurs on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive quickly (lighthouse, adjuster role, dusk setting). The piece follows an Accumulative lens: density builds through nested images and the final sung vow crystallizes a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). However, the closure cost is conceptual and implied rather than felt on the page—no line shows what the protagonist forfeits or risks by singing, and the outcome (riots pause, soldier blinks) remains off-stage and reversible. Under the Cost proof test, I cannot point to an exact sentence where the protagonist's own options narrow or a price is paid, triggering a −0.5 deduction in Q2.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse interior is sensory and specific: hush pane, nested gears, bevel tooth, the puppet on the sill. The body (thin gloves, scars used to listen, pulse filed gentler) and recurring object (puppet head) both constrain on-page choices—the protagonist consults the puppet before winding the springs—meeting the 9+ gate requirement. Spatial choreography is clear throughout, and the setting charges the final image when the beam turns and the world "pressed its cheek to the glass."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (delay doomsday, vouchsafe heartbeats) is signaled early and remains coherent. One on-page tightening occurs when the needle leans and the brass tooth bends, forcing the protagonist to file it and wind the springs. However, the resolution is not driven by a choice under pressure—the protagonist's actions are procedural and unopposed. The off-stage outcomes (riots pause, soldier sets down rifle) are told rather than shown, and no visible cost alters the protagonist's own options on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: the hush as shelter not absence, "fail singing" as the puppet's counsel, the lullaby that names and forgives storms. The final sung vow offers a resonant answer to the central question (how to grant "time enough to choose") without moralizing. The piece resists tidy resolution—"I am not a hero, only a caretaker of a delicate delay"—and the ending image (hand on the beautifully flawed machine, waiting) reweights prior material. Minor penalty for one moment of near-philosophizing: "If salvation comes, it will arrive disguised as time enough to choose."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled: "a throat filling before a final, impossible song," "driftwood saints," "beautifully flawed" as both attribute and gear. POV distance is stable; perceptual signature is consistent (the adjuster notices gears, teeth, weights, the puppet's eye as witness). Purposeful compression and patterned diction ("nested patterns," "hush that was not absence") are taught early and coherent. No dialogue present; focalization remains clean throughout. The lyric intensity remains legible under pressure without obscuring causality.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout—nearly every sentence carries metaphor or elevated diction—without clear pattern-teaching or payoff that justifies the load. Examples: "a cathedral of time," "breath of oil," "bruised awe," "calculus of mercy," "kernel spring," "probability of goodbye." In peak beats (the final winding and singing), the figurative language does not compress but instead expands into abstraction ("hush concentrated like a rainstorm," "syllables like constellations"), reducing propulsion. Apply −0.5 for density without adequate payoff and −0.2 for register drift in a few peak moments ("vouchsafe," "elegies"). No loops or scaffold detected; information density is high when metaphor is stripped.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of doomsday clock + lighthouse + hush-swallowing glass + puppet counsel is specific and non-obvious. The nested-gears mechanism and the sung vow that alters behavior across distances offer fresh inflection on familiar end-of-world material. However, the emotional template—solitary keeper maintaining a fragile barrier against catastrophe—follows a well-worn structure. The ending (riots pause, minister forgets doctrine) relies on told outcomes rather than on-page dramatization, reducing inevitability. The piece commits fully to its premise but the risk-taking is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The doomsday clock adjuster is present throughout, frames the premise, and performs key actions (tuning gears, filing the tooth, winding springs, singing). However, the role is procedural rather than decisional—no on-page choice alters tactics or forecloses a path. The adjuster executes a predetermined ritual rather than wrestling between options. Two gates present (setup, closure participation via the sung vow) but middle development lacks a pressure-driven choice.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The broken puppet head appears in three beats: washed up on first night, mouth moving when hush swallows thunder, and consulted on the sill before the final winding. Its grin and missing eye recur with evolving meaning ("driftwood saints," "If you must fail, fail singing"). It is handled on the page and its counsel ("begin") shapes the protagonist's stance. All three gates present; causal pressure is moderate (it prompts but does not constrain); closure linkage is present but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The pane of hush is introduced early ("lens cut from a pane of hush, a glass that swallowed sound"), used in the middle (swallows thunder, quiets the sea), and pivotal at closure (the protagonist speaks "against the pane, measuring syllables"). It shapes tactics—the lantern's function depends on it—and alters outcomes (the beam's effect on riots and soldiers). All three gates present; causal pressure is high; the concept is irreplaceable and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Beautifully flawed" is introduced as the mother's phrase, applied to the protagonist, and later to the machine ("I rested my hand on the beautifully flawed machine"). It functions thematically (forgiveness of fractures) and enables one on-page action (filing the bent tooth gentler by filing pulse gentler). However, it does not constrain a choice or impose a visible cost. Two gates (setup, closure reprise) but middle development is weak; the attribute is more lyric echo than causal driver.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Vouchsafe" appears in the mission statement ("vouchsafe the world a few more unbroken heartbeats") and frames the protagonist's purpose. It is enacted through the final sung vow. However, the action itself is not dramatized with cost or opposition—it succeeds off-stage. Setup and closure gates present; middle development is absent. The word choice is elevated and specific but the action is not irreplaceable (could be "grant," "ensure") and does not drive a turn.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Through nested patterns" is introduced early (gears nested within gears, nested patterns in the mechanism) and recurs at closure ("Through nested patterns the lighthouse spoke"). The method shapes the protagonist's work (tuning teeth, winding nested springs) and is causally active in the final beat. All three gates present; the method is specific and irreplaceable. However, its mechanics remain abstract—how nested patterns translate sung vows into distant effects is unexplained—capping the score below 7.5.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The hidden lighthouse at dusk is anchored early, supplies the gears and hush pane that enable the protagonist's work, and frames the closure image (window opened, world presses cheek to glass, beam turns). All three gates present. The setting provides resources (the mechanism, the isolation) and pressures choices (the needle leaning, the old tooth bending). Dusk coloring ("sky browned early") charges the atmosphere. The setting is essential to stakes and indispensable to the ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Across the hush of time's final ripple" appears late (final third) as part of the sung vow. It does not tighten decisions or impose a deadline; the timeframe remains abstract and untracked. The piece gestures toward apocalyptic urgency ("needle leaned," "politics learned thunder again") but no clock runs. Missing setup and middle gates; closure participation is present but ornamental. Late introduction and swappability ("across time's edge," "before the end") cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To whisper a lullaby across a thousand lifetimes" is introduced as the protagonist's charge and enacted at closure when the lullaby is sung. The motivation is dramatized through preparation (tuning, filing, winding) and the final act. However, there is no friction between wants and costs—no on-page moment shows what the protagonist sacrifices or risks to sing. Two gates (setup, closure); middle development is present but not conflicted. The desire drives action but lacks visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Bruised awe" is introduced early ("lived under my ribs") and modulates across beats: exhaustion ("tired as a lighthouse"), defiance ("fail singing"), tenderness ("I thought of the ones not yet born"), and waiting. The tone is coherent through turns and charges the final image (resting hand on the machine, waiting with it). The tone is specific, purposeful, and irreplaceable—no other descriptor fits the blend of wonder, weariness, and resolve. All three gates present; tone integration is strong.</comment>
