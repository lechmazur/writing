<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The mapkeeper's interior is distinct and embodied through concrete gestures—echo chamber stone handling, breath-counting, finger-tracing ice scripts. Micro-choices accumulate purposefully: placing the stone, aligning it to flow, tapping in a circle. The final stance (tending the bloom, stone in hand, reading ice) emerges as earned endurance that forecloses wandering in favor of this learned motion. Agency reads as attention and technique under pressure, apt for the character's role, with visible cost in the sustained effort and knowledge burden.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its pattern early—lyric compression, fragment-sentences, hammered images—and holds it cleanly through closure. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid): the bloom closes, the beings learn where to be quiet, the mapkeeper commits to tending the pattern with stone and chart. Cost is legible on the page—sustained vigilance, the map now a responsibility, the ongoing need to read ice—and the final image reweights the opening premise without moralizing. One meaningful deepening (the bloom's planting and the beings' softening) tightens the dominant stake under the accumulative lens. Orientation anchors who/where/when early enough for comprehension.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The harmonic caves constrain choice throughout: archways become bells, corridors hold or amplify sound, ice fractures encode pressure. The echo chamber stone functions as micro-setting, scored and glowing, handled in multiple beats and shaping the planting action. The "corridor that sang low enough to hold a human heartbeat" enables the protagonist's core action, and the calcite rib provides the anchor for the stone's placement. Sensory hierarchy reflects professional priorities—sound pressure, resonance mapping, crack patterns—without touristic catalog. The final beat ("outside, the sky rang thinner") uses environmental shift to charge the closure without symbolic overreach.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled immediately: find the quiet in the storm before maps break into useless echo. Pressure accumulates through the beings' arrival, their overfull abundance, the caves' instability, and the mapkeeper's need to plant the bloom without precedent. One meaningful tightening occurs when the protagonist places the stone, breathes with the corridor, and the beings draw closer with "cores troubled by memories of windless skies"—the moment that narrows options and forces technique under scrutiny. The bloom's taking and the beings' softening constitute the turn, and the cost is visible: ongoing tending, the map now holds their hinge, hands remember the motion. Escalation under the accumulative lens reads as density increase and pattern break (fizzes dimming to slow aurora, cracks softening) that reweights the stake with undeniable effort.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: the tension between storm and stillness, abundance without home in measured passages, the collaborative forging of repose. The bloom of hush is not explained but dramatized—echoes folding into seeds, canceling waves lifting without rising—and its function (give storms rooms to pass through like weathered guests) reweights the opening premise without stating a moral. The final image ("they do not leave; they learn where to be quiet") answers the central question non-literally, and the mapkeeper's commitment to tending integrates the thematic arc with the character goal. Subtext operates in gesture and silence: the nod that pretends confidence, the beings' softening "as if their brightness remembered shade," the taste of less brine/more sleep in the ice scripts.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Single POV maintained cleanly with stable psychic distance. Perceptual signature is character-specific: the mapkeeper notices resonance, fractures, echoes, pressure maps—a technical idiom consistent with the role. Diction remains controlled and purposeful ("shy hieroglyphs of pressure," "grazed its surface like rain over a bridge," "blue to the tongue, clear to the bones") with compression that reads as voice-motivated rather than ornamental. Free indirect style is clean; narration stays within the focalizer's plausible lexicon (technical yet lyric). Under peak stress—beings hovering, ribs clattering—syntax tightens without losing coherence or abandoning the established rhythm. No head-hopping; the beings are rendered from outside through their effect on the protagonist's body and perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character stance, or the planting action. Figurative language is dense but coherent—"patient breathing," "wandering faults," "letters hammered by voices," "bloom of hush"—and the vehicles remain internally consistent. Rhythm varies purposefully with longer lyric constructions in setup and tighter beats during the planting sequence. Minor scaffold appears in runs of similar stems ("I learned," "I told them," "I marked") that read template-adjacent, applying −0.3 in Q7 but not touching the closure beat. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; clarity remains high throughout. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and reconfigure the premise cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The premise—mapkeeper of silences meets energy beings whose chorus destabilizes stone—is a specific, non-obvious synthesis of fantasy world-building and lyric craft problem. The "bloom of hush" as planted stillness, echoes folding into seeds, waves canceling into petals, transforms familiar magical-object tropes through concrete sensory detail and technical micro-choices (tapping in a circle, aligning to flow, breathing with the corridor). The beings are rendered freshly—"overfull," "fizzing," "troubled by memories of windless skies"—avoiding stock elemental archetypes. The final turn (they learn where to be quiet, the mapkeeper tends the bloom) feels inevitable in hindsight and risks a quiet, non-climactic ending that nevertheless lands with undeniable cost and commitment. Emotional specificity avoids template arc.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ripple-mark mapkeeper is present throughout and drives all key turns: examining cracks, placing the stone, tapping in a circle, tracing ice scripts, marking the corridor on the chart, deciding to continue tending. Setup early (first paragraph), development across middle beats (reading ice, planting the bloom), and payoff in closure (would keep tending, stone in hand, reading ice for its next request). The character's choices narrow options and alter tactics at every turn. Causal pressure is strong; the mapkeeper's agency is technical and embodied, shaping the bloom's success and the beings' learning.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The echo chamber stone appears in setup (paragraph 8), is handled across multiple beats (catching calls, curling them back, placed under throats of rock, set against calcite, tapped in a circle, lifted when the petal closed), and charges the closure (lifted warm, light answering pulse, carried outside). Its specific properties—scored surface, glow, cooling/warming, ability to catch and fold echoes—enable the bloom planting and cannot be swapped. The stone's state evolves (glow thickens to milk, grows cooler, warms again) and those changes drive tactics. Cost is tied to the stone's use (sustained effort, learning its placement). Indispensable to story logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The bloom of hush is the protagonist's explicit goal and the story's culminating action. Setup by paragraph 5 ("find the quiet in the storm"), developed through the planting sequence (paragraphs 24–31: echoes folding into seeds, widening petal of canceling waves), and payoff in closure (the bloom holds their hinge, protagonist commits to tending it). The concept shapes stakes (prevent maps from breaking into useless echo), alters tactics (choosing where ice is thickest, tapping in a circle), and reweights the ending (storms do not vanish but learn where to be quiet). Visible cost: ongoing vigilance, the map now a responsibility. Irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Gently luminous" appears early (paragraph 5: beings described, paragraph 9: echo chamber stone "gently luminous"). The trait constrains perception and enables action—the stone's glow thickens to milk, allowing the protagonist to watch inner veins and tremor maps, and its light answers the protagonist's pulse in closure. However, the luminosity itself does not create a visible tradeoff or cost; it is a property that supports the stone's function rather than a constraint the protagonist must work around. Present across beats but mid-band for causal pressure and cost connection.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Conjure" appears explicitly in paragraph 15 ("I learned to conjure a stillness by placing the echo chamber stone") and implicitly in the planting sequence (paragraphs 24–31: tapping, breathing, folding echoes). The action is signaled, developed through specific mechanics (stone placement, breath-counting, tapping in a circle), and results in the bloom's taking. Setup mid-story, development across the planting beats, payoff when the bloom lifts and the beings rest. Causal role is strong but the late signal (not until paragraph 15) and the fact that "conjure" could be replaced by "create" or "plant" without major structural change keep it from the highest band. Cost visible in sustained effort and technique mastery.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Examining crack patterns in ice" is introduced early (paragraph 12) and shapes the protagonist's diagnostic method. The fissures are read as "shy hieroglyphs of pressure," and the protagonist listens for the note that made ice fork. This method enables choosing the corridor where ice is thickest (paragraph 23) and tracing the softened scripts post-bloom (paragraph 33). Setup, development (reading fractures like roads toward a sleeping city), and closure participation (hands remember the motion, reading ice for its next request). The method matters and alters tactics but could be replaced with another diagnostic technique (listening to echoes, testing resonance) without breaking story logic. Strong but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The harmonic caves are named in the opening line and shape every beat: air sounds like metal under rain, archways become bells, drip lines bud ice, corridors sing low or high, calcite ribs provide anchor points. The caves' instability (resonance storms) drives the protagonist's goal, and the environment supplies the resources (ice fractures, throats of rock, the corridor that holds a heartbeat) that enable the bloom planting. The setting constrains choice (where to place the stone, which corridor to use) and charges the final image (the caves blessed me, the map now holds their hinge). Indispensable; the caves are the crucible, not backdrop.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the energy beings arrive" is established in the opening (paragraph 4: "This chapter begins after the energy beings arrive") and maintains pressure throughout. The beings' ongoing presence creates urgency (their choruses make stone unsteady, maps risk breaking into useless echo) and shapes the protagonist's tactics (must find quiet before damage spreads). The ending reweights the timeframe ("after the energy beings arrive, they do not leave; they learn where to be quiet"), making the temporal marker integral to closure. Setup, development (beings hover near during the work, draw closer, soften), and payoff. The timeframe does not function as a ticking clock but as a state-change that forces new technique; this is sufficient under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to find the quiet in the storm" is stated explicitly (paragraph 7: "My work was to find the quiet in the storm before our maps broke into useless echo") and dramatized across the planting sequence. The protagonist's desire is tested under pressure—beings hovering, ribs clattering, uncertain whether the technique will work—and the friction between want (restore harmonic stability) and cost (sustained effort, learning new methods, ongoing responsibility) is visible on the page. The protagonist tells the beings "without words" (paragraph 27), and the beings' softening validates the goal. Closure links tightly: the bloom is planted, the map holds their hinge, the protagonist commits to tending. Setup, development, payoff; causal pressure strong; cost legible.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Hammered repose" is introduced in paragraph 2 ("We called that feeling hammered repose, a calm forged by blows we could not see") and recurs implicitly in the final movement (paragraph 37: "all of us hammering our repose into something we could carry"). The tone—patience under pressure, stillness earned through blows—modulates appropriately: lyric and meditative in setup, tightening during the planting, softening when the bloom lifts, then resolute at closure. The phrase charges the final image by linking the opening's conceptual frame to the protagonist's earned endurance. Coherent through turns, purposeful reprise, and the tone choice (calm forged, not given) supports the theme. Strong but the tonal consistency could be slightly more varied under peak stress to reach the highest band.</comment>
