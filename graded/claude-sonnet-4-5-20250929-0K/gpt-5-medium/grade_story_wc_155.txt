<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation ("rediscover lost joy") is stated rather than embodied in contradictory impulses. Interior monologue is stylized and dense but lacks moment-to-moment embodied emotion under pressure—lines like "I am a mural artist, vivid by temperament" read as self-narration rather than lived contradiction. The final choice to "paint the gaps tomorrow" acknowledges continuation but does not foreclose a path with visible cost on the page. Micro-choices (threading film, holding the shard as color key) are present but feel directed by the concept rather than character struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first paragraph; the piece unfolds as a single continuous scene in accumulative/textural mode. A meaningful deepening occurs when the knowledge network corrects the damaged frames, reweighting the film from "merely exposed" to "revealing." Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image of "a ribbon in the fog" reweights the quest with undeniable conceptual cost (the work is ongoing, not complete). The lens holds, but the cost is oblique—no on-page forfeiture of a live option—limiting high-band entry.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The fog, orchard remnants, and wells function as micro-setting that constrains the projection work and charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and selective: "fog hung from branchless trees like old theater curtains," "citrus ghosts and the slick rot of barrels." The fresco fragment and film reel are handled tactilely across beats, grounding the abstract "painting with light" in physical action. Spatial choreography is clear; the tripod, stump, and wells anchor movement without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—rediscovering lost joy—is signaled early but remains abstract. Pressure accumulates through the collaborative correction of the festival images, a meaningful tightening that narrows the protagonist's solitary method into communal work. However, no on-page reversal forecloses a prior option; the ending promises continuation ("paint the gaps tomorrow") without a visible price paid in this window. The mirror maker's suggestion to reverse the final frame is a micro turn but does not raise cost or narrow options under accumulative pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the interplay of light, memory, and communal correction rather than stated thesis. The fresco fragment's "laughing pomegranate" recurs with shifted weight, mentoring tone and reminding the narrator to "leave room for laughter." The final image—"its trail was a ribbon in the fog"—offers a resonant non-literal answer to the quest without moralizing. However, the thematic question remains oblique; "pensive mirth" is asserted more than dramatized through contradictory particulars, and the ending's conceptual repricing lacks the visceral cost that would charge it fully.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, lyric, and consistent: "I paint with light, bending it as if brush and breath." Perceptual signature is selective and metaphor-laden throughout, matching the mural artist's sensibility. Distance remains stable; no head-hopping. Minor filter-verb density ("I felt pensive mirth") slightly dulls immediacy in one beat, but the compression and patterned diction are taught early and serve the accumulative design. The "knowledge network" collective ("they") briefly shifts from singular focalization but remains anchored to the protagonist's perception without true multi-POV drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high and mostly coherent ("fog made my studio, the lanes my corridor"), but several beats stack metaphors without advancing pressure: "fog-bitten," "cotton air," "soft bells" cluster without propulsion. Template cadence is minimal, but paraphrase loops appear: "the film, once merely exposed, became revealing, like fruit opening willingly" restates the prior correction sequence. Lines like "joy is more obedient when applauded" veer into aphorism that flattens momentum. Proofreading is clean; rhythm varies but occasionally sags under ornamental phrasing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—collaborative light-projection art restoring a fog-lost festival via communal memory—is specific and non-obvious. The fresco fragment as color key and the film's reversal into a loop elevate the concept beyond stock "artist finds inspiration" arcs. However, the core emotional journey (solitary creator → communal joy) follows a familiar template, and the lyric style occasionally favors texture over fresh insight. The "knowledge network" and "crows taught to applaud misfortune" add inventive detail, but the transformation test reveals that substituting medium or setting would not fundamentally alter the arc.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The mural artist protagonist makes on-page choices (threading film, projecting onto fog, using the fragment as color key, reversing the final frame) that shape multiple beats and the collaborative restoration. However, these choices feel exploratory rather than narrowing options with cost. The character is present throughout and drives the sequence but does not face a decision that forecloses a path. Mid-band: functional across beats, but closure participation is oblique.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The fresco fragment appears in the opening (setup), is used mid-scene as a color key to "mentor my tones" (development), and the final line recalls its lesson about leaving "room for laughter" (closure participation). It constrains tone and method in two distinct beats. However, its causal pressure is light—removing it would weaken thematic resonance but not break the plot. Strong lyric reprise with moderate integration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The exposed film is introduced early (setup), drives the central collaborative correction sequence (development across multiple beats), and is gathered at the end, its "trail" reweighted as the path to joy (closure). The film's damaged state creates the need for the knowledge network, shaping stakes and tactics throughout. Removal would collapse the central action. Causal pressure is strong, and it participates in the closure image.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Paints with light" is introduced early and recurs as method throughout: "I paint with light, bending it as if brush and breath," threading film, projecting onto fog. It enables the projection work but imposes no visible constraint or cost—other artistic means could serve the plot with minor edits. The trait is thematically consistent but functionally replaceable. Mid-band: present across beats but lacks irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Display" structures every major beat: projecting the damaged film, inviting correction, displaying gestures from the knowledge network, showing the final reversed loop. The collaborative display drives the reweighting of the festival images and delivers the closure wreath image. Removal would erase the plot's method and payoff. Strong causal pressure, beat involvement, and closure linkage; the action is indispensable to this exact story.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The knowledge network is signaled early ("thin as ivy and stubborn as root"), invoked explicitly when the narrator sends "a pulse through the mesh," and provides the corrections that transform the film. It shapes the middle collaborative sequence and alters the protagonist's solitary method. However, its mechanics remain abstract—"ears at wells, fingertips on bricks"—and it does not impose a visible cost or constraint. Strong development role but lighter closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ruined orchard district and thick fog anchor every image, provide the projection screen ("the fog made my studio"), and charge the final metaphor ("a ribbon in the fog"). The fog constrains visibility and supplies the medium for light-painting; the wells and stump position bodies and tools. The setting is inseparable from method, tone, and closure. High beat involvement, causal pressure, and closure integration; removal would collapse both logistics and atmosphere.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Within the fold of a daydream" is mentioned in the opening and closing ("within the daydream fold time kinked"), but the timeframe remains abstract and does not tighten decisions. No clock pressures choices; the daydream fold licenses indefinite extension ("we stayed noon-bright") without cost. The element provides tone but does not constrain action or alter tactics. Present in lyric reprise but functionally ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The motivation "to rediscover lost joy" is stated at the start, drives the projection work and communal collaboration, and reappears in the final line as a realized trail. It shapes the protagonist's method (holding the fragment as reminder, following gestures) but is not dramatized through conflicting desires or visible cost. The ending acknowledges continuation rather than arrival. Lyric presence with moderate beat involvement; lack of on-page friction limits the score.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Pensive mirth" is named once mid-story ("I felt pensive mirth, the smile that sits cross-legged on a question") but pervades the voice: playful metaphor ("crows taught to applaud misfortune"), whimsy ("tangerine cart was a temple of tasting"), and gentle reflection without resolution. Tone modulates subtly with the collaborative work and returns in the final image's open-ended trail. Coherent through turns, charges the ending, but the single direct label slightly reduces elegance.</comment>
