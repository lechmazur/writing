<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's voice is consistent and distinctive—"I am a guarded druid, taught to keep my face calm"—with strong embodied detail in the physical work of mapping currents and handling the seed. Internal contradiction appears in "my guarded heart unbends one unmilitant notch," suggesting cost. However, the mayor remains largely a passive prop; his reactions are told rather than shown in choices, and the crowd functions as scenery. The finale's emotional shift feels slightly rushed given the weight of corruption revealed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its pattern early—expanding circles, layered imagery—and builds density through the descent into the lake's well of lost things. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration: the mayor breathes the truth, the orchard unspools, and the protagonist pockets a coin as "receipt for deliverance." Cost is visible in the mayor's trembling and the crowd's shift from spectators to witnesses. Orientation anchors clearly by the opening lines. One meaningful deepening occurs when the seed eats the lie and the truth stands "like a soldier at ease."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The swirling orchard vortex is vividly rendered—"trees grow from anchored boats and apples orbit like moons"—and actively constrains the protagonist's search through expanding circles. The kelp lines, bone whistles, and raft choreography are tactile and specific. The lake's well of dropped objects (coin, photograph, key) functions as micro-setting that encodes social pressure. The final image of "apples settle into ordinary halos" charges the closure by marking the curse's release. Spatial coherence holds throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: recover the frozen confession to expose the mayor's lie. The protagonist's method—expanding circles—tightens when the eighth circle brushes "a cold thread," then escalates as the seed is deployed and the hooks of frozen words twitch. The mayor's corruption (bribes, drowned orchard) materializes on the page with visible cost: his trembling, the crowd's witnessing. Agency belongs to the protagonist's choice to use the seed and guide it through the current. One clear reversal when the lie is chewed away and the truth "stands between us."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the opposition between performance and truth: the mayor's failed magic trick versus the lake's refusal to let deception thaw. The flesh-eating seed functions as thematic hinge—it consumes only lies, leaving "the bone of the truth intact." The final image of mirrors turned face-down and the protagonist's receipt coin both resonate without stating a moral. "Warlike serenity" modulates from the protagonist's guarded discipline to the truth "without a sword," answering the central question through image rather than sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The voice is distinct and controlled: elevated diction ("unbloomed," "unmilitant notch") remains consistent with the druid's archaic, formal register. POV is stable throughout; no head-hopping. However, some constructions strain clarity—"the orchard begins to turn the sky like a crank" reads more decorative than functional. The mayor's interiority is withheld appropriately until the climax, but his single moment of hearing himself could be more embodied. Perceptual signature is strong: the protagonist catalogs lost things "by the ache they leave behind."</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high—nearly every sentence carries metaphor—and several clash or overreach: "the lake stops pretending," "the orchard begins to turn the sky like a crank," "the lake unbloomed" pile ornament without clarifying causality. Template cadence appears in the repeated "I [verb]" and "The [noun] [verb]" stems across multiple beats. Information density is generally strong, but the opening paragraph front-loads imagery that doesn't all pay off. Paraphrase loop: "guarded druid" and "warlike serenity" recur without added pressure. No clarity breaks at closure, so caps remain moderate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The core synthesis—lost-thing finder meets frozen confession in cursed lake orchard—feels fresh and specific. The flesh-eating plant seed that consumes only lies is a vivid, non-obvious solution tied to character method. The orchard-as-repository of dropped secrets (coins, photographs, keys) transforms the fantasy-detective frame. However, the "guarded druid" and "warlike serenity" lean slightly toward stock mystical-warrior language. Risk-taking in structure (dense lyric accumulation) heightens stakes without obscuring closure, earning modest bonus consideration within band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The guarded druid protagonist makes the key choice to deploy the seed, guides it through the current, and hauls the confession to the surface. These decisions drive the middle escalation and enable closure. "My guarded heart unbends one unmilitant notch" shows visible cost. Present in setup, development, and payoff with causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The flesh-eating plant seed appears in the pouch early, is deployed at the turn ("I drop the flesh-eating plant seed into the current"), chews the lie while sparing truth, and "floats spent" at closure. Its unique property—eating only lies—is irreplaceable and drives the resolution. Two distinct beats (deployment, result) plus closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The frozen confession is the story's engine: the mayor's words crystallized into "delicate hooks" in the lake create the dominant stake. Recovery and thawing structure the entire quest. The protagonist discovers it, the seed acts upon it, and the mayor breathes it fully at closure, ending the curse. Setup, development, and payoff all hinge on this concept.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Finds lost things" frames the protagonist's skill and explains the hire, but its mechanics largely overlap with the expanding-circles method. The catalog "by the ache they leave behind" is evocative yet doesn't constrain a specific choice. Present in setup and thematically at closure ("receipt for deliverance"), but the attribute itself doesn't create visible trade-offs or costs on the page.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Unbend" appears twice: "I unbend from my crouch, letting my spine rise like a mast" (physical) and "my guarded heart unbends one unmilitant notch" (emotional). The physical act enables the turn when the protagonist angles into the cold thread; the emotional act signals closure cost. Two beats, but swappable with "straighten" or "release" without deep structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Expanding circles structure the entire search: "My method is simple: I work through expanding circles"; "the eighth circle brushes a cold thread"; the seed is guided "through expanding circles again, this time threaded within the radio hush of words." Setup, repeated development, and closure participation. The method is specific, irreplaceable, and shapes tactics under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The swirling orchard vortex at the cursed lake's heart is setup, active middle pressure (apples slow and listen, branches hold lost objects), and closure payoff ("the orchard unspools from its whirl... apples settle into ordinary halos"). It constrains navigation, supplies the well of secrets, and its calming marks resolution. Environment drives choices and charges the final image; irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"After the magic trick fails" sets the inciting past event and frames urgency—the town wants truth recovered now. However, no live countdown or time pressure tightens tactics during the search itself. The timeframe anchors the story's start but doesn't escalate choices in the present action. Present in setup; minimal development or closure sharpening.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"I want it for a different reason, to discover what mirrors don't show when they shine like threats" is stated early but never dramatized through a conflicted choice. The protagonist's actual goal—recovering the confession and exposing the lie—dominates every beat. The mirror curiosity neither constrains action nor creates visible friction with cost. Told rather than enacted.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Warlike serenity" is announced in the opening ("anchored in warlike serenity") and returns when the truth stands "like a soldier at ease, stern, still, but without a sword, pure warlike serenity." The tone modulates through pressure—guarded calm, rising intensity, then earned stillness—and charges the closure image. Coherent across the arc and tied to the protagonist's discipline. Setup and strong payoff.</comment>
