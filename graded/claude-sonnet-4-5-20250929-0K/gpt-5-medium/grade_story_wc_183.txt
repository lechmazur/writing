<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The "chimera twin discoverer" self-concept operates primarily as a metaphoric lens rather than a grounded psychological stance with contradictory impulses acting in scene. Interiority relies heavily on abstract poetic constructions ("trapped freedom," "unkindled solace") rather than embodied thought particular to this character. The final renunciation ("one hand letting go of the ledger while the other planted the empty jar") gestures toward split identity but arrives through conceptual assertion rather than earned tension between wants. Micro-choices exist (holding the card to light, pouring soil) but lack visible cost or foreclosed alternatives that would anchor agency.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph; the carnival ship and fog establish place immediately. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered images (carousel, funhouse, ferris wheel, prize room) toward a final reconfiguration when the protagonist releases the jar and the garden "spelt nothing, which was everything." Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (the self "unclasped," one identity relinquished), but the cost remains conceptual and oblique—no concrete forfeiture or tactical narrowing is legible on the page. The "narrative threads" method and recursive "as memories alter" refrain teach a pattern, yet causality stays loose: the card's mechanics (how green reflections "mapped constellations") and the garden's arrival feel convenience-driven rather than motivated by prior choices.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The carnival ship supplies rich atmospheric anchors: barnacled ticket booth, salt-furred prizes, paint-stripped carousel horses. Spatial choreography remains coherent across decks, hatch, prize room, and bow. The emerald swatch card functions as a micro-setting object that constrains the protagonist's path (held to bulbs, horses point toward hatch, held against horizon to reveal garden), satisfying the 9+ gate for Q3. Sensory detail leans heavily visual; fog, cold soil, and "bruise-colored circle of hush" add texture, but taste and kinesthetic sensation are underused during physical moves (climbing, pouring).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—find the garden of forgotten names—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the not-mine voice reveals "the price was that you would forget," introducing a trade-off between discovery and twin-self. The protagonist's final act (pouring soil, breathing to wake "unkindled solace," planting the jar) enacts agency, yet the garden's approach feels externally granted rather than earned by protagonist decision. Escalation under the Accumulative lens reads as density increase (booth voice, carousel gesture, jar discovery, shore appearance) rather than narrowing options, and no live tactical cost or forfeited path is dramatized—"one hand letting go" remains metaphoric.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme—identity as chimera, the cost of memory and naming—emerges through recurring images (emerald card, jar of soil, garden of names) and the motif of "trapped freedom." The final image ("leaves shook and spelt nothing, which was everything") offers a non-literal answer that reweights the search, but the answer relies on paradox rather than earned resonance from concrete particulars. "As memories alter" repeats as a structural refrain, teaching the accumulative pattern, yet its thematic payoff stays abstract. No single on-page choice crystallizes the protagonist's hierarchy of values with visible trade-off, so theme floats above the action rather than being forged by it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable first-person with consistent psychic distance; no head-hopping. Voice carries a distinct lyric-metaphoric texture ("carousel bells," "hearth unlit," "compass that pointed toward whoever I would become"), and the register stays elevated throughout without unmotivated drift. The "not-mine voice" from the booth introduces dialogic interplay within a single consciousness, handled clearly. Filter verbs ("I sensed," "I felt," "I wondered") appear but remain voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy excessively. Perceptual signature leans abstract-poetic rather than character-particular; diction (e.g., "blissfully aberrant," "filaments of rumor and rumor's mother") reads ornate but consistent, avoiding template cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Figurative density pervades nearly every sentence in high-pressure beats (final third): "bruise-colored circle of hush," "garden leaned in to listen, a shoreline bending its ear," "unkindled solace woke like dawnfire." While poetic, the stacked metaphors obscure immediate causality and dull propulsion; the reader must decode vehicle logic (how leaves "spelt nothing") rather than tracking concrete action. Synonym churn appears in adjacent lines: "trapped freedom" repeats; "recapture," "discoverer," "chimera twin" cycle without advancing new information. Paraphrase loops: "As memories alter" opens three separate paragraphs, restating temporal fluidity without added detail. Template cadence: several beats open "I [verb]" across successive sentences. Applying patterned-artifact penalties (−0.6 for density in final beats, −0.4 for loops, −0.4 for template stems) and the final-third artifact presence triggers the global 9+ disallowance and caps high-band entries at 8.8. No egregious grammar breaks; punctuation is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The carnival-ship-as-memory-labyrinth premise offers a fresh synthesis, and the emerald swatch card as permission/compass adds specificity. "Chimera twin discoverer" and "garden of forgotten names" read as inventive conceits, though execution leans toward ornament (the labels recur without being dramatized through conflicting micro-choices). The final move—pouring soil, planting the jar, releasing one self—feels earned in hindsight by prior setup (jar labeled with "a name that might once have been mine"), satisfying transformation rather than late invention. Emotional truth is present but abstracted; the story commits fully to its lyric-metaphoric mode without retreat. Risk-taking (non-linear accumulation, surreal nested identities) heightens thematic ambition, though clarity suffers under figurative load. No close echo of famous lines detected; voice reads singular.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The "chimera twin discoverer" character frames the opening ("I had introduced myself") and the ending ("my chimera twin discoverer self unclasped"), bracketing the arc. Two beats involve decisions tied to this identity: accepting the booth's bargain and choosing to "speak my history through narrative threads." However, these choices feel theme-driven rather than grounded in contradictory impulses or visible cost; the character functions more as a metaphoric vessel than an agent whose trait constrains tactics. Early signal (+0.5), two beats (+0.9), closure linkage (+0.8), but swappability (could be "seeker" or "wanderer" with minor edits, −0.6) and lack of visible cost tied specifically to the chimera/discoverer tension (−0.5) limit the score. Gate check: setup present, middle choice weak, closure participation metaphoric. Caps at ~4.9 for missing strong middle development; band guidance and positives place it at 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The emerald swatch card appears early (paragraph 4), is used in three distinct beats (held to dim bulbs to map constellations, touches carousel horses' eyes prompting them to point, held against horizon to reveal the garden), and participates decisively in closure by becoming "a compass that pointed toward whoever I would become." Early signal (+0.7), three beats (+1.4), causal pressure (card enables path discovery, +1.2), closure linkage (+1.5), specificity (emerald hue and "permission" framing, +0.6). Swappability slightly elevated (another colored object could serve, −0.3). Gate check: all three gates satisfied. Total positive ~+5.1; baseline 3.0 + 5.1 - 0.3 = 7.8, but the card's role in the final beat is metaphoric (reframed meaning) rather than causally decisive (no visible cost tied to its use), so I adjust down to 7.2 within band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Unkindled solace" is introduced mid-story (paragraph 6, "I sensed an unkindled solace"), reappears in the prize room (jar holds "the unkindled solace sleeping in it"), and is activated at closure ("I breathed until the unkindled solace woke like dawnfire"). Setup borderline (not in first third, −0.3), two beats (+0.9), closure linkage strong (+1.6), but the concept functions thematically—waking solace is the resolution, not a stake that shaped tactics or created cost. No visible constraint or choice alteration tied to "unkindled" as a property. Late first appearance (−0.3), ornamental in middle beat (−0.5), summary-only activation (breathing "woke" it, but no dramatized friction, −0.4). Gates: setup weak, middle ornamental, closure participation strong. Baseline 3.0 + 0.9 + 1.6 - 0.3 - 0.5 - 0.4 = 4.3, but lyric-resonance allowance for charged reprise lifts it to 5.9 within the 5.5–6.3 band for thematic reweighting.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Blissfully aberrant" appears once (paragraph 9, describing the booth voice's proposed route). Label-only mention (−0.3), no visible constraint or enabled action, no cost tied to the trait. The attribute colors tone but does not alter tactics or narrow options. Gates: setup absent (appears in second third), no middle or closure involvement. Introduced late (−0.4), ornamental use (−0.8), swappable (−0.6). Baseline 3.0 - 0.3 - 0.4 - 0.8 - 0.6 = 0.9, but the phrase does frame the booth voice's character and contributes minimally to the surreal atmosphere; I round up slightly within the ornamental band to 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Recapture" is the protagonist's declared plan (paragraph 7, "to recapture the path hidden in the card"), appears in the prize-room beat ("the old obsession to recapture a childhood prize"), and is enacted at closure ("recaptured only the silence of a name unsaid"). Early signal (+0.6), three beats (+1.4), closure linkage (+1.3), but the action is abstract—no concrete object or person is recaptured on the page, and the mechanics (what does it mean to "recapture" via narrative threads?) remain vague. Swappability high (could be "recover," "rediscover," "trace" with minor edits, −0.7), and the final use is metaphoric summary (−0.4). Gates: all three present. Baseline 3.0 + 0.6 + 1.4 + 1.3 - 0.7 - 0.4 = 5.2, but the action does define the protagonist's method and shapes two key turns (prize room, closure), so I adjust up to 6.7 within band for moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Through narrative threads" is the declared method (paragraph 7, "weaving rooms and footsteps into chapters," and paragraph 16, "stitching my footsteps through narrative threads"). The method is mentioned in the climax (paragraph 24, "I spoke my history through narrative threads"), but its mechanics are never dramatized—no scene shows the protagonist weaving or stitching in a way that alters tactics or creates friction. Early signal (+0.5), two beats (declaration and climax, +0.9), closure participation (+0.8), but method is told rather than shown in action (−0.6), and it resolves a problem (reaching the garden) it did not help create earlier (−0.8). Gates: setup present, middle absent, closure participation summary-only. Baseline 3.0 + 0.5 + 0.9 + 0.8 - 0.6 - 0.8 = 3.8, but the method does frame the protagonist's approach, so I hold at 4.1 within the functional-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival ship in fog is established immediately (paragraph 1) and supplies the primary setting across all beats. The setting constrains movement (decks, ticket booth, hatch, prize room, bow) and the fog/bay creates atmospheric pressure. The ship "kept adjusting its corridors like a host setting a table" (paragraph 11), suggesting active constraint, and the final beat occurs at the bow where "the ship could not dock" yet the garden drifts closer (paragraph 22), creating spatial tension. Early signal (+0.8), all beats unfold here (+1.4), causal pressure (corridors adjust, ship cannot dock, +1.0), closure linkage (bow setting charges the final image, +1.2), specificity (carnival details, +0.5). Gates: all three satisfied. Baseline 3.0 + 0.8 + 1.4 + 1.0 + 1.2 + 0.5 = 7.9, but the setting functions more as atmospheric backdrop than active constraint—no choice is visibly altered by carnival props or fog mechanics—so I adjust down to 6.4 within band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"As memories alter" is the refrain timeframe, appearing in paragraphs 3, 11, 18, and 24. It signals temporal fluidity early and recurs at key turns (bay folding time, echo aging, shelves rearranging, garden listening). Early signal (+0.6), four beats (+1.4), closure linkage (the garden leans in "as memories alter," +0.9), but the timeframe is thematic rather than tactical—no decision is tightened by a ticking clock or deadline. The phrase teaches a pattern of recursive time, which the piece commits to, so it shapes the narrative mode. Swappability moderate (another temporal phrase could serve, −0.4), and no visible cost tied to time pressure (−0.5). Gates: setup strong, middle recurrence strong, closure participation thematic. Baseline 3.0 + 0.6 + 1.4 + 0.9 - 0.4 - 0.5 = 5.0; lyric-resonance allowance for pattern-teaching lifts it slightly to 5.1.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The goal "to find the garden of forgotten names" is declared early (paragraph 5) and sustained across the arc. The protagonist seeks the garden via the card, booth, carousel, and prize room, and the garden appears at closure. Early signal (+0.7), all beats serve this goal (+1.4), closure linkage (garden revealed, +1.5), but the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants—no on-page friction between the desire and a competing need (e.g., fear of forgetting) is tested in a choice with visible cost. The booth's warning ("the price was that you would forget") introduces potential friction, yet the protagonist proceeds without visible hesitation or trade-off. Gates: all three satisfied. Baseline 3.0 + 0.7 + 1.4 + 1.5 - 0.6 (told-only friction) = 6.0; the motivation does unify the arc and prime the ending, so I adjust up slightly to 6.3 within band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Trapped freedom" is introduced early (paragraph 2, "my curiosity felt like trapped freedom") and recurs at key beats (paragraph 14, "That bargain crawled over my skin like a net, a trapped freedom"; paragraph 22, "Trapped freedom thrummed in my ribs"). The tone is consistent and modulates under pressure (tightening in the bargain beat, thrumming at the bow). Early signal (+0.6), three beats (+1.4), closure linkage (the ship "released and held" in the final paragraph echoes the paradox, +1.0), specificity (the oxymoron charges the metaphoric texture, +0.4). Gates: all three satisfied. Baseline 3.0 + 0.6 + 1.4 + 1.0 + 0.4 = 6.4, but the tone remains static (a single mood of paradoxical constraint) rather than modulating into new emotional territory, and no choice is visibly shaped by "trapped freedom" as a felt constraint (−0.7). Adjusted to 5.7 within band.</comment>
