<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The cartomancer's interiority is filtered through the apprentice's observation, creating distance that dilutes emotional specificity. The steadily curious trait receives label-only treatment without constraining choices or creating visible costs. Micro-choices exist (accepting currencies, choosing routes) but lack internal contradiction or embodied emotional struggle. The final beat with the bandmate woman shows purposeful methodology but no character change or renunciation with felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly within the opening lines. The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered client visits, each reweighting the cartomancer's methodology until the final "chorus that will let her sing alone" reprices solitary practice as communal echo. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing with cost implied through the woman's isolation transformed into sustainable solo performance. One pressure tightening (cryptocurrency crash → barter economy) narrows client resources and forces methodological adaptation, satisfying the length's escalation requirement.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The rain-beaded skylight loft, measuring tape stretched across floors and into streets, and the mural under peeled paint create tactile spatial choreography that constrains movement and charges discovery. Sensory detail (wet cardboard and basil, coins washing in a sink) is selective and voice-filtered. The tape's physical hiss along floorboards and its street extension force the historians' bodies through the city, making setting a co-agent in the ending's discovery and the final client's metaphorical ribbon festival.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—mapping cultural patterns that survive floods of belief—is signaled early and coheres through client visits. Escalation operates through the Accumulative lens: each client (phone screens, historians, bandmate woman) deepens the methodology's application. The cryptocurrency crash tightens resources, forcing barter and reweighting value systems. The final client's "chorus that will let her sing alone" offers a meaningful deepening but lacks a visible price paid on the page; cost remains conceptual rather than dramatized through forfeiture or embodied consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete work: value persists beyond currency collapse, cultural memory hides under rent's coat, solitary practice requires communal echo. The measuring tape and cards accumulate meaning through action (tracing spidered screens, stretching to street corners, becoming ribbon festival) without symbolic announcement. The final image—"finding the chorus that will let her sing alone"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to how cultural patterns survive, reweighting individual practice as echo of collective work. No thematic statement mars the ending; particulars carry the weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The apprentice's first-person POV maintains stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature (curiosity filtered through touch and ledger-keeping). Diction remains consistent—"onyx-ink," "reverse engineering," "weave"—though occasional register drift toward elevated abstraction ("inherited mystery, not designed to be solved but to be carried without spilling") weakens voice-grounding. No dialogue appears, so naturalism and subtext bullets do not apply. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during street walks and widens during reflective teaching moments, serving emotional beats without head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative density (rain "stitched," light "pooling," city "sounded like coins washing") appears in most sentences of several beats without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering overwriting penalty. Paraphrase loops are minimal, but template cadence appears in stacked "She said/taught/told me" constructions across teaching beats. Information density is high; most lines advance methodology or client work. The final image's "ribbon festival" metaphor charges prior tape-work but earlier metaphoric vehicles occasionally mix (stitching rain, absorbing ink, multiplying paths) without clear coherence, applying figurative muddle deduction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise—cartomancy as urban methodology after economic collapse, measuring tape as divination tool—offers a fresh synthesis of fortune-telling tropes and infrastructure mapping. Specific, verifiable detail (phone screen shatter points overlaid on school routes, mural palette under rent paint, barter replacing cryptocurrency) grounds the fantastical frame in embodied work. The transformation from predictive fortune-telling to cultural archaeology through physical measurement feels earned and non-obvious. Risk-taking in structure (mosaic client visits, reflection-heavy apprentice frame) heightens thematic coherence without obscuring clarity, meriting modest bonus within band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The cartomancer appears throughout, frames methodology, and makes key decisions (accepting all currencies, asking historians to choose with elbows, instructing final client work). However, most choices are enacted *through* the apprentice's hands or described in summary teaching moments rather than dramatized as on-page turns. Present in closure (instructs final client) but does not personally alter tactics there; the apprentice remains the executor. Two gates (setup, closure instruction) but middle development is indirect.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Measuring tape appears in multiple distinct beats: introduced with ruler and compass as methodology tool, traces phone screen angles to find trouble corner, stretches from loft window to street to reveal hidden mural, becomes "ribbon festival" metaphor in final client work. Its physical properties (hissing along floorboards, taut-holding, length quantifying hope) constrain and enable tactics. Present in closure beat, reweighted as metaphor. Three gates satisfied; causal pressure and specificity earn high placement.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Reverse engineering" is named early, repeated across client work (caravan from wreckage, carnival from receipt, chorus from bandmates' scatter), and shapes the methodology's stakes—reconstructing cultural patterns from fragments. It constrains approach (not predicting futures but multiplying paths) and is present in closure framing ("finding the chorus that will let her sing alone" as reverse-engineered community). However, the mechanics remain abstract; the concept is asserted more than dramatized through irreplaceable specificity. Three gates present but causal pressure is thematic rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Steadily curious" appears once in the opening as label-only trait ("I was steadily curious, the kind of apprentice who learns by touch as much as by reading"). It does not constrain or enable any specific on-page action with visible cost; the apprentice's learning-by-doing could proceed identically without this descriptor. No middle beat dramatizes curiosity forcing a choice or creating friction. Absent from closure. Setup gate only; ornamental use.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Confide" appears once: the cartomancer confides in the rain "as if it were her grandmother, both patient and untranslatable." This moment establishes her relationship to inherited practice but does not create a turn or redefine options. The confiding is described rather than dramatized; we do not witness the content or consequence. Easily swappable with "murmured to" or "spoke to" without structural loss. Setup gate only; middle and closure absent.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Multiplying paths" is named, demonstrated (phone screen shatter points, gig/basement/rooftop routes layered until tape becomes ribbon festival), and functions as the core method across all client work. It shapes tactical attempts (overlaying cracks, stretching tape, testing routes "until the left hand knows the right hand's story") and is present in the closure beat ("tested them by multiplying paths until the measuring tape was a ribbon festival"). Three gates satisfied; mechanics are signaled and matter to outcomes. Causal pressure is solid but the phrase itself is slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The rain-beaded skylight loft anchors all client sessions, provides spatial continuity (cards on table, tape stretching from window to street), and its threshold (down stairs, out into dusk) enables the mural discovery. Rain stitching glass opens and persists as atmospheric constraint. The loft as workspace frames methodology. Present in closure (final client session). Three gates; setting constrains movement and charges atmosphere but does not directly alter a high-stakes tactic at closure beyond serving as stable workspace.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"After the cryptocurrency crashes" is named early and tightens resource constraint (clients shift from coin questions to barter: recipes, poems, rooftop time). It motivates the economic reframing and the news ticker closures (coffeehouses, hackspaces). However, the timeframe does not create urgency or a live clock that alters tactics within the story window; clients arrive serially without time pressure. Setup and middle gates satisfied (barter economy affects choices) but absent from closure. Functional constraint but replaceable with any economic collapse.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"To map cultural patterns that survive floods of belief" is stated explicitly ("we were trying to map cultural patterns that survive floods of belief") and demonstrated through each client's work (tracing erasure, recovering murals, reconstructing bandmate networks). It frames the dominant stake and constrains method (not fortune-telling but archaeology). Present in closure (finding chorus = mapping scattered pattern). However, the motivation is more asserted than dramatized through friction or cost; the apprentice and cartomancer face no on-page conflict about *why* to map or what mapping costs them personally. Three gates but pressure is thematic rather than deeply conflicted.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Inherited mystery, not designed to be solved but to be carried without spilling" is named and operationalized through family history (caravans, ash-ink), card method (absorbing light, giving only shape), and the apprentice's teaching (cultural patterns as language not omen). Tone is coherent—reverent, methodical, archaeologically patient—and modulates subtly (urgent during street walk, contemplative during teaching). It charges the final image (carrying scattered chorus forward as solo practice). Three gates; tone shapes every beat's cadence and supports closure's resonance without static repetition or forced mystery.</comment>
