<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The locksmith carries a consistent interior goal—to repair not just locks but time and memory—but the story operates at such elevated metaphoric distance that micro-choices under pressure remain abstract. Emotional embodiment is sparse: we are told of "driftwood nostalgia" and "breath" but never shown contradictory impulses acting in scene. The protagonist adjusts gears and springs without visible internal conflict or a dramatized cost that forecloses a path. The ending declares mutual repair but does not earn it through prior struggle or a hierarchy of values tested on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The piece presents a continuous journey—locksmith enters frozen library, navigates to mirror hall, adjusts clocks, reaches reading room, leaves—with clear spatial progression. Orientation anchors (who, where, timeframe) arrive early enough. The accumulative lens holds: lyric density builds toward the final trade ("the library had repaired him as much as he had repaired it"), and the closure image reconfigures the opening motif of repair as reciprocal exchange. However, cost remains asserted rather than dramatized; no specific forfeiture or visible price shapes the final image, only the claim of mutual attention.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The frozen library, frost librarians, hall of mirrors, and tide-like reading room are vividly rendered with sensory specificity—"rime," "cedar warmth," "kelp-like ribbons of vellum." The setting actively shapes the locksmith's path: prophecies hidden in checkout cards guide navigation, mirrors respond to the uncapped bottle, clocks steady when he applies remembered shoreline cadence. The body and tools (gloves softened by breath, gear wheel filed to a notch) function as micro-setting elements that constrain action. The final image of the library creaking "like old boats rubbing hulls" charges closure with tactile resonance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—learning repair as a rhythm of attention rather than single motion—is signaled early and coheres throughout. Pressure accumulates via lyric density and the sequence of adjustments (uncapping bottle, tuning clocks, filing gear wheel). However, no on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows live options with felt cost; the protagonist succeeds at each step without error or trade-off. The mirrors "turn from ice to water to window" without resistance, and the master volume appears as reward rather than challenge. Agency reads as attentive application, not decision under duress.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The theme of repair as reciprocal rhythm emerges organically from the locksmith's tactile work and the tide metaphor seeded early ("waves as if they were broken clocks"). The final image—"the library had repaired him as much as he had repaired it"—offers a non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. Subtext operates in the recurring driftwood and shoreline motifs, and the cedar-breath memory dramatizes inheritance of patient attention. However, the thematic statement at closure borders on direct articulation rather than pure image, and the symmetry of mutual repair feels slightly too tidy.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a consistent lyric-textural register with distinct perceptual signature—"hauntingly bright," "eyelash click of tiny springs," "harbor hum." Single-POV distance holds without head-hopping. Diction stays grounded in craft vocabulary (tumbler, gear, latch) while reaching for metaphor (kelp-like vellum, lampshades as small moons). However, the prose exhibits mild register drift into elevated abstraction at peak beats ("question wearing metal," "tide of attention"), and psychic distance remains narrow throughout, rarely modulating with pressure. No dialogue appears; the piece is entirely internal and descriptive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and imagery is specific—"breath of warm cedar," "palm-sized wheel filed to a notch." However, pervasive figurative density slows momentum: nearly every sentence stacks metaphor without clear causal linkage ("library hum like a patient harbor," "dawn spilled...like milk poured into ink"). Paraphrase loops appear: "repair was not a single motion but a rhythm of attention" echoes "tide inhaling and exhaling the shoreline of brokenness" without added pressure. Template cadence runs through the middle third with repeated "he [verb]" stems. These artifacts dull the closure image and trigger the Q7 penalty pack: −0.8 for density without pattern-teaching, −0.3 for paraphrase loops, total −1.1, landing at 5.9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The combination of eclipse locksmith, frozen sky-library, and tide-repair metaphor offers fresh synthesis, and the piece commits fully to its lyric premise. The transformation test passes: plot and arc depend on the locksmith's occupation and the library's vertical isolation. However, the "repair as reciprocal attention" core resembles widely used contemplative-craft templates. The story elevates the material through specific tactile detail (gear teeth, cedar scent, kelp vellum) and the shoreline-memory anchor, yet the ending's symmetry ("repaired him as much as he had repaired it") leans toward safe philosophical closure rather than risk. Within-band risk distinction does not apply; no bold structural choice heightens stakes beyond lyric accumulation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The lunar-eclipse locksmith is present throughout, frames expectation early, and drives multiple beats (entering library, navigating via prophecies, adjusting clocks, filing gear wheel, leaving key). However, choices feel observational rather than decisive under pressure; he succeeds at each adjustment without error or competing impulse. No visible cost ties to his identity as eclipse locksmith—eclipse timing never constrains action or alters tactics. The character enables the journey but does not transform or face a trade-off that closes a path. Setup + Development + Payoff gates met; causal pressure low; closure linkage present but passive. Band guidance: two beats + closure presence + early signal (~+2.1) minus swappability and lack of cost linkage (~−1.3) = 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The clockmaker's gear assortment appears early, is handled across multiple beats (carried, set on lectern, breath into gloves to feel brass teeth, adjusting springs, filing palm-sized wheel), and shapes the ending when the filed wheel is left among the mirrors as "steadying heart." Specificity (eyelash click, brass teeth) matters. However, the gears function as general toolkit rather than unique enabler; similar tools could replace them with minor edits. Setup + Development + Payoff gates met; two beats + closure linkage + early signal (~+2.4) minus mild swappability (~−0.5) and no tight cost connection (~−0.0 since tool use is dramatized) = 6.9.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The hall of mirrors structures the central sequence: it guides the locksmith via reflected intentions, responds to the cedar breath, houses the clocks he tunes, and provides the passage to the reading room. Mechanics matter—mirrors show snowfall when the bottle must be uncapped, then turn "from ice to water to window" as clocks steady. The concept constrains tactics (must interpret reflections, must apply cedar warmth) and charges the ending when the filed wheel is left "among the mirrors." Setup + Development + Payoff gates met; three beats + causal pressure + closure linkage + irreplaceability (~+4.5) minus no direct cost tied to mirror-navigation (~−0.2) = 7.6, rounding 7.6.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The attribute "hauntingly bright" appears twice: describing the frost librarians early and the dawn at closure. It frames tone but does not constrain or enable any on-page action with cost. The librarians' brightness is observed, not interacted with; the dawn's brightness signals resolution but does not alter tactics. Setup + Payoff gates met (no middle development); lyric reprise reweights atmosphere (~+1.2) minus ornamental use and lack of causal pressure (~−1.1) = 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The action "uncap" (the small bottle at his throat releasing cedar warmth) is signaled by prophecy midway, executed at the mirror-crisis beat, and pivots the sequence: mirrors respond to the cedar, clocks steady, path uncurls. The uncapping is irreplaceable—no other action carries the shoreline-memory charge. However, it appears after the 40% mark, capping at 4.6. Wait—re-examining: the bottle is introduced early ("wore at his throat"), the prophecy signals its use mid-story, and the uncapping occurs in the mirror hall before the final third. Setup present; Development (prophecy advises when); Payoff (uncapping transforms mirrors). Three gates; causal pressure high; closure linkage indirect but strong. Early signal + two beats + causal pressure + specificity (~+3.8) minus mild late execution in sequence (~−0.2) = 7.2, rounding 7.2.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The method "through scraps of prophecy hidden in a library's corner" is signaled early, shapes navigation (scraps point to secret corridor, advise when to uncap bottle), and the mechanics matter—prophecies are found "on the backs of checkout cards that smelled faintly of salt and constellations," establishing tangible specificity. However, once the prophecies deliver their guidance, they vanish from the narrative; no cost ties to interpreting them, and they do not reappear at closure. Setup + Development gates met (no closure participation beyond enabling earlier turns). Two beats + causal pressure + early signal (~+2.2) minus no closure linkage (~−0.7) and summary-only use of their content (~−0.3) = 6.2.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The frozen library above clouds anchors every beat: frost librarians, stacks, secret corridor, mirror hall, reading room, and exit. The setting supplies resources (prophecies in checkout cards, lectern of rime) and pressures choices (air rings thin, mirrors reflect intentions not face, clocks shiver). The library's thaw at closure—"creaking like old boats"—charges the final image, and the reciprocal repair theme depends on the library as animate partner. Setup + Development + Payoff gates met; three+ beats + causal pressure + closure charge + irreplaceability (~+5.2) = 7.8.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The timeframe "under the soft hush of a distant morning" appears in the opening line and at closure ("dawn spilled across the stacks"), framing the journey as occurring within one morning. However, no live clock tightens decisions or alters tactics; the narrative pace is leisurely and reflective, with no urgency tied to morning's end. Setup + Payoff gates met (no middle development where time pressure matters). Lyric reprise (~+1.2) minus lack of causal pressure or tracked progression (~−0.8) and vague tracking (~−0.3) = 3.7, rounding 3.7.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to learn the rhythm of repair" is stated early and pursued consistently: the locksmith adjusts clocks, files a gear wheel, and leaves a key as acts of repair. The desire is dramatized through tactile action (breathing into gloves, feeling springs, matching cadence to tide memory). However, no on-page friction tests the motivation—no competing want or fear challenges the goal, and the learning succeeds without mistake or sacrifice. Setup + Development + Payoff gates met; two+ beats + causal involvement (~+2.6) minus lack of conflict or visible cost (~−0.8) and told insight at closure ("repair was not a single motion...") (~−0.4) = 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The tone "driftwood nostalgia" is seeded early ("carried driftwood nostalgia in his chest") and recurs via shoreline metaphors (waves as broken clocks, tide cadence, kelp-like vellum, boats rubbing hulls at closure). The tone coheres through turns and modulates subtly from quiet entry to cedar-memory warmth to final mutual-repair softness. However, the tone remains a single static mood—wistful, patient, contemplative—without sharp pressure shifts or contradiction. Setup + Development + Payoff gates met; tone charges final image (~+2.4) minus lack of modulation under peak pressure (~−0.6) and no tight cost connection (~−0.2) = 5.9, rounding 5.9.</comment>
