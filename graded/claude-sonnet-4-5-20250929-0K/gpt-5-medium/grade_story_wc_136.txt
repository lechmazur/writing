<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's identity as a "meticulous route mapper" with "analytically artistic" qualities is established through declaration rather than embodied choice. Interior states remain abstract ("trembling certainty") without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final move—folding maps, breathing, stepping forward—lacks visible cost or a hierarchy of competing values that would earn the transformation. Competence is asserted but not tested through mistakes or struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with lyric patterning. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first third. The closure unit—stepping through the mouth after laying down maps and receiving them back, then hanging unsaid words as lanterns—qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), but the cost remains atmospheric rather than legible in a specific forfeiture or altered tactic. The phantom punch and arrows recur but their mechanics do not visibly narrow options at the ending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Setting elements (cobblestones, mist, depot, train, fortress) are vivid and purposeful. The phantom train ticket punch functions as a recurring object that the protagonist uses at two key beats (raising it at the depot, pressing it into air, laying it at the fortress mouth). Spatial choreography across multiple locations (square, depot, train, platform, fortress corridor) remains mostly clear. However, the "starlit vault in mist" functions more as atmosphere than as a constraint that shapes a tactical choice at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reaching the "fortress of unspoken truths"—is signaled early. The protagonist's agency manifests in tracing arrows, using the punch, and laying down maps, but these actions do not face meaningful resistance or force a trade-off with visible cost. The mouth's challenge ("tender proof that I would listen") is met through symbolic offering rather than a choice that forecloses a live option. Pressure accumulates through atmosphere and pattern rather than escalating consequences.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of unspoken truths and avoided conversations emerges through image and action (cracks forming arrows pointing to omissions, constellations of avoided conversations, rooms shaped like unsaid words). The ending offers a resonant image—hanging unsaid words as lanterns, bowing to disappointed faces, promising kinder routes—that reweights prior material. However, the final gesture reads as resolution rather than sustained ambiguity, and the "fortress murmured approval" edges toward moral closure without earned friction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Voice carries distinct lyric texture with patterned compression ("a compass with curiosity," "dots appeared on my skinscape"). POV remains stable in first person with consistent psychic distance. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that sits uneasily with the cartographer's claimed idiom ("ramparts of listening," "unbutton them," "sheltering lid"). Perceptual signature—mapping and patterns—informs many observations but does not constrain perception under peak stress in character-specific ways.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching or payoff at closure: "arrows in pavement braided into invitations," "rooms yawned, each shaped like a word unsaid," "stones breathed like animals." Several paraphrase loops appear ("I traced them carefully" / "I followed to find"; "trembling certainty" recurs without reweighting). Template cadence runs dominate: "I [verb]" stems appear across nine consecutive sentences in the depot-to-train sequence. Register drift into abstract philosophical diction ("analytically artistic," "ramparts of listening") clashes with the practical cartographer role. Cumulative penalty: −1.4 for density + loops + template cadence in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The core premise—cartographer using a phantom train ticket punch to reach a fortress of unspoken truths—synthesizes familiar symbolic journey elements (train to otherworld, confronting avoided emotions) without a non-obvious inflection. Atmospheric details (mist, stars in puddles, conductor made of smoke) are vivid but trend toward stock liminal imagery. The ending's emotional resolution (bowing, promising kinder routes, emerging to "begin anew") follows predictable redemption architecture without transformation through specific lived cost. The hour-that-divides-bad-habits framing is ornamental rather than integrated into choice mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Setup present (first paragraph). Development: the mapper traces arrows and uses the punch at two beats (depot, platform). Closure: lays maps down at the fortress mouth. However, the mapping skill does not constrain or enable key choices with felt cost; tracing and folding are compliant actions rather than decisions that alter tactics. Swappable with "seeker" or "wanderer" with minor edits. Present across beats but functional rather than causally indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setup present (paragraph 12: "conductor left me a phantom train ticket punch"). Development: raised at depot (paragraph 18), pressed into air to open doors (paragraph 24), pressed again into fear and habit (paragraph 41), laid at fortress mouth (paragraph 51). Closure: fortress pushes it back with dialogue. The object appears in four distinct beats and returns with shifted meaning (from proof-of-absence to offering to burden). Specific cost tied to it in the fortress exchange ("patterns keep you"). Strong integration but the mechanics of "pressing holes in darkness" remain atmospheric rather than tactically decisive.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Setup implied (route mapper seeks truths). Development: "I was unraveling mysteries, starting with the cartographer behind me" (paragraph 38). Closure: the fortress challenge and interior rooms embody unspoken truths. The concept shapes the goal but does not alter on-page tactics with cost; the protagonist follows arrows and complies with challenges rather than solving mysteries through deduction or risk. Functions as thematic frame rather than active mechanic. Present and functional but replaceable with "seeking closure" or "facing fears."</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Setup present (paragraph 4: "analytically artistic, a compass with curiosity"). Development: reflection in train says "map what you refuse to measure, measure gentler" (paragraph 40). Closure: "I breathed, the way I sketch, analytically artistic and open" (paragraph 56). The trait is mentioned three times but does not constrain or enable a choice with visible cost. Label-only recurrence without on-page tradeoff (e.g., artistic impulse clashing with analytic rigor). Ornamental integration.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Setup: mouth issues challenge (paragraph 48: "It asked me to tender proof that I would listen"). Development: protagonist lays maps and punch as offering (paragraph 51). Closure: "I dared the mouth to speak" (paragraph 48) precedes the exchange; "I stepped forward, and the mouth widened into a corridor" (paragraph 57). The dare frames the climactic exchange and opens the path, but the mechanics are acceptance rather than active risk with cost. Present in closure unit and functional but not irreplaceable—"offer," "pledge," or "trust" could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Setup present (paragraph 9: "city answered with cracks in pavement forming arrows"). Development: protagonist traces them (paragraph 10), they lead to depot (paragraph 15), windows reveal them continuously (paragraph 35), they point to avoided questions (paragraph 36–37), they braid into invitations (paragraph 56). The arrows appear across six beats and guide the journey. However, their mechanics remain passive signposts rather than a constraint the protagonist must interpret or overcome. Functional guidance system but swappable with "whispers," "lights," or "echoes."</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Setup present (paragraph 7: "sky unlocked a starlit vault in mist"). Development: stars waver in puddles (paragraph 17), bent lower to seal the place (paragraph 47), protagonist hangs unsaid words on stars as lanterns (paragraph 59). Closure: "Light pooled, revealing faces I had disappointed" (paragraph 60). The setting recurs and charges the final revelation, but does not constrain a tactical choice—protagonist moves through it without environmental pressure. Strong atmospheric integration but passive rather than active constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Setup present (paragraph 5: "Upon the hour that divides bad habits and new starts"). Closure: "the hour reset, and I began anew" (paragraph 62). The timeframe bookends the journey but does not tighten decisions or create urgency within the narrative. No live clock or deadline alters tactics. Lyric frame without mechanical pressure. Ornamental reprise.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Setup present (paragraph 11: "I followed to find the fortress of unspoken truths ahead"). Development: protagonist navigates to fortress, accepts challenge, steps into corridor (paragraphs 46–57). Closure: motivation fulfilled when rooms reveal unsaid words and disappointed faces (paragraphs 58–60). The desire drives the journey and is dramatized through pursuit, but lacks internal conflict or visible friction between wanting the truth and fearing its cost. Told desire rather than conflicted choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Setup present (paragraph 8: "trembling certainty, like a sketch trembling toward completion"). Development: recurs at paragraph 32 when protagonist answers conductor "with trembling certainty." Closure: tone modulates through acceptance ("I breathed...open," paragraph 56) but does not charge the final image with ambiguity or tension. The tone reads as consistent atmospheric layer rather than a force that intensifies under pressure. Present across story but static rather than dynamically reweighted at the ending.</comment>
