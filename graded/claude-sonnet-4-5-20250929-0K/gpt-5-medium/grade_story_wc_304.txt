<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is concrete and specific to her profession, with embodied detail ("fingers trained to calm chaos") and micro-choices that reveal values (recalibrating the chip despite guild skepticism, listening to silence). Internal contradiction operates through the tension between scientific method and superstition, grief and professional duty. The mentor relationship supplies meaningful backstory that anchors present action, though the final choice to "capture one last spark" feels more like completion of ritual than a path-foreclosing decision with visible cost. Emotional embodiment is strong throughout ("my mouth pull into the small grin she taught me").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who (beautician mortician), where (skyborne grotto), and when (tonight, post-death) by the opening paragraphs. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through sensory density, the chip's activation sequence, and pattern-finding in static rather than causal reversal. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (the balm infusion captures "one last spark," the vision of shared memory reweights their relationship, and the grotto returns through cloud). Visible cost is present but muted—the mentor is already gone, so the final act preserves rather than forecloses. The lens holds, but the deepening feels more like ritual completion than a tightening that narrows live options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The skyborne grotto and aurora are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail ("aurora draped its living veils," "drips; the aurora murmured like cloth rubbed on crystal"). The setting actively constrains the ritual: the grotto floats, the aurora's light powers the emerald chip, and the environment shapes the protagonist's perceptual field. The kit, chip, and balm function as micro-setting elements that drive action. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout, and the final image of the grotto carrying them "back through cloud like a boat at harbor" charges closure with concrete atmosphere.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—capturing one last spark before oblivion—is signaled early and sustained throughout. Pressure accumulates through the ritual sequence: cleaning, placing the chip, tuning the radio, hearing the mentor's voice, infusing the balm. One meaningful tightening occurs when the chip warms and "took what was offered," then dims, foreclosing further contact. The cost is legible (the mentor's final traces are preserved but she is irrevocably gone), though the protagonist's agency reads more as witness and facilitator than as a decision that narrows her own live options. Escalation operates under the Accumulative lens via density and cadence shift rather than reversal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: the tension between science and superstition, the ethics of consent beyond death, and the beautician's art of "sculpting grace out of grief." The final image—"a seed to be planted in the guild's archive where silence is tutored to bear fruit"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The mentor's transmitted phrase ("Let them meet themselves kindly, then let them go") reweights prior material and anchors the thematic question of care across the threshold. Subtext operates in gesture (brush tapping porcelain) and the protagonist's restraint. No overt thesis statement mars the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single first-person POV is stable and controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature shaped by the protagonist's dual role (beautician/mortician) and professional idiom ("slack at the corners, hunger and laughter smoothed into the same fine mask of uncomplaint"). Diction remains within character throughout, blending technical detail with lyric compression. Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the chip activation and opening during memory. Some lines approach elevated register ("aurora sings, and within its variations the mind leaves echoes") but remain voice-motivated and legible. No head-hopping; focalization is clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies effectively, creating visual cadence through paragraph length and syntactic diversity. Information density is high, with most lines advancing atmosphere, character, or ritual action. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "I cleaned the cold from her skin, lifted lids to wash the final dust from lashes" followed immediately by similar grooming description; "The chip was barbed with tiny circuits" restates "emerald chip glittering in its glass cocoon" without advancing knowledge. Figurative density in the opening third (conch, veils, pulse, whisper-engine) risks overwriting but remains legible. The closure beat is clean. Minor scaffolding ("What I knew was simpler") slightly dulls momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of beautician/mortician with speculative technology (emerald chip as memory-capture device) and the skyborne setting offers a non-obvious angle. The piece transforms the familiar trope of communicating with the dead through specific occupational detail (cleaning, anointing, balm infusion) and the constraint of consent persisting beyond breath. Emotional truth in the mentor relationship and the protagonist's careful ritual avoids generic templates. The radio-static method and aurora-powered technology feel particular to this world. Risk-taking in the lyric compression and non-linear memory insertion heightens without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The beautician mortician is established early and drives the ritual sequence: she recalibrates the chip (choice), places it at the temple (action), tunes the radio (method), and infuses the balm (closure action). Her professional training shapes perception and micro-choices throughout. The role is present in setup, development (cleaning, listening, tuning), and payoff (balm infusion, sealing the chip). Agency is strong in execution but the final choice feels like ritual completion rather than a decision that alters her own path with visible personal cost. Two gates clearly met, payoff present but less transformative for her.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The emerald chip appears early (setup: "emerald chip glittering in its glass cocoon"), is handled in development (placed at the temple, kissed her with a green bruise, warmed and took what was offered), and shapes closure (dimmed after passing the deed, sealed and wrapped as a seed for the archive). Its specific properties—barbed circuits, consent-dependent function, aurora-powered—are irreplaceable. The chip's changing states (glittering → warming → dimming) alter tactics and charge the ending. Three gates met with strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"A threshold of stillness" is seeded early ("a tremor waiting at a threshold of stillness that mortals mistake for ending") and returns at the climax ("I felt the world shiver near that threshold of stillness"). The concept frames the beautician's work as navigating the boundary between life and oblivion, shaping her method (listening for echoes, tuning between stations) and the stakes (capturing what persists at the threshold). It constrains her approach—she must be "lucidly watchful" to detect patterns at this edge—and charges the closure when the chip dims after crossing that border. Setup and payoff are clear; middle development is more thematic than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Lucidly watchful" is established through the protagonist's method ("the aurora sings, and within its variations the mind leaves echoes if one is lucidly watchful") and enacted in her careful tuning and listening. The trait enables her to hear the rhythm in static and recognize the brush-tapping sound, constraining her to patient observation rather than forceful extraction. It appears in setup (method description) and development (the listening sequence), shaping her tactical approach. However, the trait is more label-descriptive than a source of visible tradeoff or cost—there's no moment where being lucidly watchful forecloses another option.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Infuse" is the climactic action: "I prepared the balm, ready to infuse it, to capture one last spark before oblivion" and "The words fell into the balm like warm rain" followed by "I anointed her brow and cheeks, traced her lips, and through that thin shine a memory flickered." The infusion is the method by which the spark is captured and memory preserved, making it the decisive act at closure. Setup appears mid-story (preparing the balm), development in the listening sequence, and payoff in the anointing. The action is irreplaceable—removing "infuse" would require restructuring the ritual's mechanism. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Finding patterns in static" is introduced as the mentor's taught method ("calling it finding patterns in static, as if threading constellations from snow on a dead channel") and enacted when the protagonist tunes the radio: "I tuned the dial the way she taught me, not to a station but to the ocean between, and I listened for her footsteps there. Static rose like blown salt, forming and unforming, and within it a rhythm approached." The method shapes her tactical approach (listening between stations rather than seeking a clear signal) and enables the breakthrough (hearing the brush-tapping, the mentor's voice). Setup, development, and payoff are all present, with the method's mechanics dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The skyborne grotto is established immediately ("They lifted the bier into the skyborne grotto under aurora") and its properties actively shape the ritual: the aurora provides the energy source ("The aurora brightened, pouring green fire into the grotto's stone ribs"), the cave's acoustics resonate with meaning ("The grotto resonated with slow drips; the aurora murmured"), and its floating nature isolates the ritual space. The setting returns at closure ("the grotto carried us back through cloud like a boat at harbor"), reweighting the journey. The aurora's light is essential to the chip's function, making the location irreplaceable. Three gates met with strong causal and atmospheric pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The motivation "to capture one last spark before oblivion" is dramatized from the opening (carrying the mentor's body) through every beat: recalibrating the chip despite guild skepticism, cleaning and preparing the body, placing the chip, tuning for patterns, and finally infusing the balm. The desire is tested against the constraint of consent ("the circuit would only drink what she chose to leave") and the uncertainty of whether anything remains to capture. Friction between the protagonist's professional duty, personal grief, and the guild's skepticism creates tension. The spark is captured with visible cost (the mentor is sealed away, the protagonist is "remade"). Strong setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Radiant hush" is established in the opening ("the air itself seemed to kneel in a radiant hush") and sustained through the ritual's quiet intensity: the aurora's glow, the slow drips, the whispered mechanics. Tone modulates appropriately—tightening during the chip activation ("a thin fizzle crawled"), opening during the memory vision, and returning to stillness at closure ("What remained felt near and light, like a shawl of air"). The tone charges the final image by maintaining reverence without sentimentality. Coherent through turns, with purposeful cadence shift that supports rather than disrupts pressure.</comment>
