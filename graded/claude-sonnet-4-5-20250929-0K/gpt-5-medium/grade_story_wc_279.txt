<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator's socially perceptive trait is asserted repeatedly but rarely dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The bearded man's vulnerability is prompted by the narrator's gesture, but the narrator's internal contradiction or cost in that moment remains abstract. The tile flake warms as emotional validation rather than creating a dilemma that tests the narrator's values. Interiority leans toward poetic observation rather than embodied contradiction acting in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the mandala ritual gathers voices, the tile flake shifts listening, and the final image ("emergent hush rode home in breathing") reweights the opening mist and chalk with felt cost—the assignment outlasting ritual. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the child's dictum crystallizes the unlearning's rule without decisive action, and the cost is conceptual (ongoing mess, no tidy resolution). One meaningful deepening occurs when the bearded man's confession shifts the mandala's "groove of speaking." Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening lines; no penalty applied.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The grotto's mist, limestone ribs, and acoustic properties constrain the ritual and charge the ending ("grotto's ribs seemed to breathe"). The tile flake functions as micro-setting, angling sound and shaping the group's confession dynamic. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through the narrator's perceptive lens ("lilac unease," "mist licked limestone"), though some descriptions ("delicate but sure, like dusk deciding") edge toward ornament. Spatial choreography remains clear across the sand mandala and the circle of participants.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—discovering meaning without smoothing the mess—is signaled early and shapes the mandala exercise. One meaningful tightening occurs when the narrator intercedes to redirect the bearded man's dismissive tone, unlocking his real confession and shifting the group dynamic. The tile flake's placement narrows how the group listens, foregrounding a specific vulnerability. Cost is conceptual and felt ("assignment would outlast ritual"), though no live option is visibly foreclosed on the page; the price is ongoing discomfort rather than a trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—attention distributing possibility fairly, unlearning as releasing glare so shadows can instruct—emerges from the mandala's evolution and the child's non-literal wisdom ("teeth know when to bite and when to chew"). The ending resists moralizing: the hush "rode home in breathing" reweights the opening's lilac unease without stating a lesson. Subtext operates in the tile flake's lineage (grandmother's smuggled relic) and the narrator's sideways listening. Minor slip: "ordinary magic of attention" edges toward thematic statement mid-scene, though it remains anchored in the grotto's vapor.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and lyric, with controlled compression ("belief is a kind of finger that finds seams in stones") and perceptual signature (the narrator reads "social weather" and "currents the way birds ride thermals"). Psychic distance remains stable in first person. Dialogue from the bearded man and child feels natural and purposeful. Minor artifact: slight register drift into elevated diction during peak beats ("vedic" unease, "ossified," "coaxing a heartbeat") that risks distancing the reader from the narrator's embodied immediacy, though the effect remains largely legible and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and metaphoric density is high throughout, creating a lyric texture that supports the accumulative lens. However, figurative language appears in most sentences without pattern-teaching (−0.4 for density without taught payoff): "mist licked," "lilac unease," "finger that finds seams," "landslide," "kite tugging" cluster without on-page escalation. Paraphrase loop: "socially perceptive enough to read crowds" (line 3) and "I am good at this because I am socially perceptive" (line 19) restate without added pressure (−0.2). Mixed vehicle: "belief is a kind of finger" pairs tactile with abstract in a way that momentarily obscures sense (−0.3). Information density is high, and no scaffold detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The whispering gallery tile flake as inherited acoustic tool and the unlearning ritual as structured ambiguity offer a fresh synthesis. The narrator's sideways listening and the child's non-literal interpretation ("grotto's tooth") feel specific and earned. Emotional truth in the bearded man's confession and the group's messy persistence avoids template resolution. Risk-taking in lyric compression and the refusal to tidy the mandala elevate the piece. Minor friction: the unlearning as three-day practice and the facilitator Pallas remain lightly sketched, edging toward placeholder world-building that the piece does not fully inhabit.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The whimsical chalk artist is named early, dusts arcs, draws a map, and smudges it at closure—three distinct beats. The profession enables the narrator's perceptive lens and the chalk as "listening stone" metaphor. However, the chalk itself does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; the tile flake drives the key turn. Swappability: "painter" or "sculptor" could replace chalk artist with minor edits. The final smudging participates in closure but does not carry unique cost tied to chalk work.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The tile flake appears in five beats: drawn from pocket, placed at mandala's edge to shift speaking, warmed as validation, touched by the child, and implicitly carried home in the hush. It shapes the key turn (redirecting the bearded man's confession) and charges the ending (the hush as the tile's acoustic legacy). Specificity: its curved shape, warmth, and angling property are irreplaceable. Cost: its use binds the narrator to ongoing unlearning work ("assignment would outlast ritual"). Strong integration across setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Emergent hush is named in the opening, arrives mid-ritual as "not manufactured, not commanded," and rides home in breathing at closure—three beats with clear lyric reprise. It reweights the opening's lilac unease and shapes the group's listening dynamic. However, the hush does not constrain a specific choice or narrow options; it functions more as atmospheric payoff than causal pressure. The child articulates what the hush "wanted," tilting toward thematic echo rather than on-page cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Socially perceptive is asserted three times (opening, mid-ritual, implicit in "currents the way birds ride thermals") and enables the narrator to interject when the bearded man belittles doubt. However, the trait is label-heavy without visible tradeoff: the narrator's perceptiveness never misfires, exhausts, or creates friction. No cost tied to the attribute itself; it functions as competence without complication. Swappable with "empathic" or "intuitive" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Interject occurs once, redirecting the bearded man's pebble and unlocking his confession—a key middle turn that shifts the mandala's "groove of speaking." The action enables the tile flake's effect and drives the group's deepening. However, the interject itself is brief and could be replaced with "ask" or "nudge" with minor edits; the tile placement does equal causal work. The action does not reappear at closure. Strong middle development but modest specificity and no final charge.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The sand mandala is introduced by Pallas early, the group rearranges grains throughout, and the wheel distorts into a tide map before they leave—three beats spanning setup, development, and closure. The method shapes the ritual's mechanics (speak through patterns, assemble and erase) and the final smudging by the narrator. However, the mandala could be replaced with another collaborative art form (clay, fabric) without breaking logic; its sand-specific properties (grain rearrangement, erasure) do not uniquely constrain choices. Functional but modest irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The whispering grotto is named in the opening, its acoustic ribs "seemed to breathe" mid-ritual, and the group leaves it at dusk carrying the hush—three beats with clear presence at closure. The grotto's echoing bowl and mist pressure the ritual's intimacy and validate the tile flake's angling effect. Specificity: the limestone and acoustic properties are irreplaceable for the tile's function. Minor friction: the grotto could be another resonant chamber (chapel, canyon) with edits; its whispering property is asserted more than mechanically exploited on the page.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The unlearning is named early as a three-day practice, frames the ritual's purpose (setting certainties down to soften), and returns at closure ("during the unlearning, we were not erasing knowledge"). It licenses the group's mess tolerance and the narrator's ongoing assignment. However, the three-day span does not tighten decisions or create a live clock; the piece unfolds in one session without temporal pressure. The timeframe functions as thematic context rather than escalation driver. Lyric reprise elevates slightly but no cost tied to duration.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The desire to discover meaning in the mess is stated in the opening, dramatized through the mandala exercise, and reframed at closure ("stay messy long enough for pattern to step forward"). It drives the narrator's interject and the group's willingness to distort the wheel. However, the motivation is collective and abstract; the narrator's personal friction with this desire (impatience, fear of ambiguity) remains unexplored. The cost is conceptual (ongoing discomfort) rather than a visible trade-off. Strong thematic presence but modest character-level conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lilac unease is named early ("delicate but sure, like dusk deciding"), infuses the ritual's atmosphere ("air held lilac unease"), and implicitly charges the ending's hush (unease reweighted as patient possibility). Tone modulates from hesitant gathering to vulnerable confession to quiet endurance without tidy resolution. The lilac hue recurs through the narrator's perception of mist, breath, and the group's soft voices. Strong coherence and final reprise; the tone shapes the ritual's permission structure and the closure's refusal of tidy comfort.</comment>
