<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is concrete and voice-particular ("I had practiced until my throat knew the cadence"), and the choice to witness Mara is embodied through micro-decisions (opening the telegram, tuning the scope). The shared burden concept emerges through dramatized action rather than summary. Mara's fierce urgency and the narrator's attention-as-healing stance create a credible relationship crucible, though Mara's backstory arrives mostly through exposition rather than contested choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural; the piece builds density through recurring star-reading, the telegram opens at midpoint, and closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): "through shared burdens we learned meaning" crystallizes the practice with conceptual cost (the temple as listening witness). Orientation is clean by line 4. The single meaningful deepening occurs when Mara speaks back and the inscriptions yield unexpected chambers, reweighting the decoding stake. Conceptual cost is legible in the final image of "healing travels fastest by ordinary words."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The observatory is anchored early with sensory specificity ("red lamps," "domes clicked as gears corrected drift"). The sextant, charts, and variable stars function as micro-setting that enables the decoding method. The daylily-pressed telegram serves as recurring object that constrains choice (weeks unopened, finally broken seal charges the turn). The spatial choreography of Mara laying copies beside charts is coherent and the final rewinding of the dome charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode temple inscriptions via variable stars) is signaled early and tightens when Mara arrives with her copies. The reversal occurs when the narrator realizes "the lock was our conversation"—variable stars are only the key—narrowing method and raising intimacy cost. The shared reading where Mara speaks counterpoints is the earned escalation; the closure image ("healing travels fastest by ordinary words") makes the conceptual price of vulnerability undeniable. Agency is decision and attention that forecloses solitary decoding.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme (shared burdens as practice, not object) emerges from concrete particulars: the mirror-story pilgrimage, the narrator's weeks-long delay, and the breakthrough when voices braid. The final image—"healing travels fastest by ordinary words"—reweights the entire decoding arc without stating a moral. The daylily as "proof the sun can travel by paper" and the temple-as-listener offer resonant, non-literal answers. No thematic echo or summary intrudes; the ending invites reflection through image and earned insight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled: "listening is witness," "a chronicle is a bandage that breathes." POV distance is stable; the narrator's perceptual signature (star numbers on tongue, throat knowing cadence) is character-specific. Dialogue when present feels natural and goal-driven ("I heal with words, not medicine, not miracle, just attention"). Figurative density is high throughout—nearly every sentence carries metaphor—which suits the lyric mode but occasionally slows momentum in the middle third ("room lean toward the idea, like a sleeper toward cooler sheets" reads decorative rather than urgent).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentences open diversely and information density is high. Minor paraphrase loop in lines 18–19 (both describe the inscriptions as incomprehensible to others). Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "flux became syllable, magnitude a verb" is precise. One register drift: "austere and elegant" in line 23 feels elevated for the established voice. The final paragraph stacks several closural gestures which diffuses punch slightly. No template cadence or filter-verb stacks; clarity remains high.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of celestial cartography and shared witnessing as decoding method is specific and non-obvious. The variable-stars-as-grammar concept ("flux became syllable, magnitude a verb") transforms the observatory premise through fresh inflection. The mirror-story and "healing travels fastest by ordinary words" feel earned in hindsight. Risk-taking in the lyric compression and metaphor density heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The piece resists template structures and commits fully to its premise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character present early (line 2, "lucid dream chronicler"). Drives two beats: keeping night watch over charts and the decision to open the telegram and witness Mara's reading. The chronicler's attention enables the breakthrough ("to decode temple inscriptions, we must read them aloud to someone willing to answer"). Causal pressure is moderate; the role shapes method but the choice to witness is signaled more than contested. Closure linkage is strong ("I witness best when understanding dawns and light listens back").</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Object appears early (line 6, "daylily-pressed telegram lay beside the sextant"). Handled in three beats: unopened for weeks, seal broken at midpoint, and Mara rests her forehead on it near the end. The daylily reappears in closure with reweighted meaning: "proof the sun can travel by paper." Causal pressure is moderate—it constrains timing but does not narrow options sharply. The charged reprise elevates integration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Concept shapes stakes from the mirror-story revelation (line 42, "travelers carried a mirror instead of bread") and drives the tactical breakthrough (line 49, "share the weight…the message deepens instead of breaks"). The realization that "the lock was our conversation" (line 53) and the braided reading (line 56) enact shared burdens on the page with visible cost (vulnerability, mutual naming of sorrow). Closure hinges on it: "through shared burdens we learned meaning." Irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Attribute signaled early (line 4, "I listened because listening is witness"; line 5, "Words cannot move stars, but sometimes they heal"). Constrains method in one key beat: the narrator tells Mara "I heal with words, not medicine, not miracle, just attention" (line 29), which frames the shared reading. Enables the breakthrough when voices braid (line 56). Visible tradeoff is conceptual (intimacy required) but not sharply dramatized as cost. Closure references it ("healing travels fastest by ordinary words") but the attribute feels more thematic than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Action appears throughout: witnessing the weary (line 4), Mara asking the narrator to witness her reading (line 18), and the shared reading (lines 32–57). The major turn ("to decode temple inscriptions, we must read them aloud to someone willing to answer," line 52) traces directly to witnessing as method. The narrator's promise to "keep witnessing" (line 61) and the final line ("healing travels fastest by ordinary words") make the action indispensable to closure. Three beats, high causal pressure, closure-defining.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Method signaled early (line 9, "Through variable stars alone could the pattern be solved"). Mechanics matter: "through variable stars, translate light into grammar. Flux became syllable, magnitude a verb" (lines 23–24). Shapes two attempts: tuning the scope (line 32) and taking down the stars' music (line 33). The breakthrough reweights it: "The variable stars were only the key; the lock was our conversation" (line 53). Closure line reinforces ("Through variable stars we had learned a grammar"). High specificity and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Setting anchored in line 1 ("celestial mapping observatory"). Provides resources: charts, sextant, red lamps, scope, dome gears. The observatory "accepted our urgency without drama" (line 27) and "exhaled" at the end (line 59). Mara rewinding the dome (line 63) charges closure. The environment enables the method but does not sharply constrain choices or supply obstacles. Two beats with moderate causal pressure; closure linkage is present but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Timeframe signaled in line 14 ("I waited for the hour when understanding dawns, neither night nor morning, simply arrival"). The narrator sets the clock to "Mara's dawn" (line 22) and she arrives "before sunrise" (line 26). The moment of understanding occurs when graphs steady and voices braid (lines 34–56). The timeframe frames expectation but does not create a live clock that alters tactics. Lyric reprise at closure ("when understanding dawns and light listens back") reweights the stake. Two gates (setup, closure), no middle pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation stated early (line 10, "The pattern belonged to an old temple whose inscriptions defied every scholar"; line 13, "my motive sharpened to decoding"). Drives the narrator's patient study (line 13) and Mara's request (line 18). The breakthrough ("to decode temple inscriptions, we must read them aloud," line 52) and the shared reading enact the desire with friction (vulnerability cost). Closure stores the charts and mirror-story (line 62), fulfilling the motive. Three beats, causal pressure with visible conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Tone established in line 1 ("Midnight hush pooled") and sustained through "tender quiet" (line 15), "breathing" stars (line 32), "midnight solace, not ecstasy" (line 58). Modulates with pressure: fierce urgency (line 26), surgical care (line 33), room warming (line 35). The final image—"healing travels fastest by ordinary words"—is charged by the sustained solace tone. Coherent through turns, elevates closure without static repetition.</comment>
