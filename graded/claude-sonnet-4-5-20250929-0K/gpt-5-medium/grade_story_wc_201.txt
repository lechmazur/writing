<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's proprioceptive enhancement and trauma history are conveyed through vivid embodiment ("angles mapping ribs, tendons, and the tilt of my jaw"), but the core motivation—seeking "the mathematics of mercy"—remains abstract rather than concretely tied to micro-choices. The forest encounter feels processional rather than agonistic; no contradictory impulses act in scene to test commitment. The final choice (leaving the rule etched on bark, turning toward those still turning screws) arrives without visible trade-off or foreclosed path, reading more as symbolic gesture than earned renunciation with felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes Accumulative/Textural mode through ultraviolet forest imagery and proprioceptive mapping. Orientation is clear early (who, where, when), and the prose teaches its lyric pattern. However, the closure—etching the rule on bark and carrying the forest inward—reads as Conceptual Repricing without a legible cost on the page; the protagonist simply walks away enriched, not diminished. The "mathematics of mercy" is asserted rather than derived through on-page constraint or sacrifice, and the final turn does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The ultraviolet forest is vivid and purposeful, with cobalt fire, fluorescent letters, and equations that respond to breath and posture. The setting constrains the protagonist's movements (stepping deeper paints shins, equations pluck fractions from body angles) and charges the final image (pewter strap knotted as boundary marker, trees dimming to green). Proprioception functions as micro-setting, grounding spatial choreography throughout. The caretaker's clearing and the path that "brightens like bone under a skin of night" supply concrete anchors that guide closure without postcard description.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering the mathematics of mercy to "learn when to stop the turn of the screw before a soul fractures"—is signaled early and pursued throughout. The forest's algorithm demands honesty from the body, creating one meaningful pressure point when "equations reach into that line and pluck a fraction." Yet the tightening is conceptual rather than agonistic; no live option is foreclosed, no trade-off forced. The protagonist walks away with the theorem intact, the caretaker nods approval, and the cost remains implied rather than dramatized, capping escalation at mid-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the proprioceptive mapping, the ultraviolet forest's demand for bodily honesty, and the protagonist's history of enhanced interrogation. The final image—"carrying a forest inside me that refuses to be silent"—offers a resonant answer to "when to stop the turn of the screw" without stating a moral. However, the phrase "mathematics of mercy" and "ultraviolet penance" tilt toward abstract philosophizing; the theorem is asserted ("Mercy begins where that wall first appears") rather than dramatized through a specific on-page cost. The recurring imagery (pewter mask strap, cobalt fire, equations in air) accumulates meaning but does not shift decisively at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The first-person voice is distinctive, blending lyric compression with embodied proprioceptive detail ("a set of angles mapping ribs, tendons, and the tilt of my jaw"). Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. The prose teaches its patterned diction early and maintains it through closure without lapsing into label-speak or filter-verb stacks. Under peak stress, syntax tightens ("I brace again, palms on dirt, sensing the torque") while retaining perceptual signature. The caretaker's brief appearance is handled through selective detail that preserves focalization.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high in the opening third ("proprioceptively enhanced," "survival via muscle flinch and breath timing"). However, the middle section contains minor paraphrase loops ("I remember the room… I remember the lie") and template-adjacent stems ("The forest is… I am… They brought me… I write… I follow… I leave"). The figurative density in peak beats ("leaves like applause shared by beings who photosynthesize regret") occasionally elevates register beyond immediate physical pressure. Clarity and propulsion remain intact, but scaffold patterns recur enough to prevent high-band entry.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of proprioceptive enhancement, trauma interrogation history, and an ultraviolet forest that reads bodily honesty as equations is non-obvious and specific. The premise commits fully to its logic (forest responds to breath, equations pluck fractions from posture) and avoids generic abstraction. However, the "mathematics of mercy" frame echoes familiar redemption-through-suffering templates without transforming them through an unexpected moral calculus or a non-obvious cost. The final turn—carrying the forest inward—feels inevitable but not genuinely risky; the protagonist walks away enriched rather than diminished.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The enhanced interrogation survivor character is established early (waking post-anesthesia, recalling mask and lies under interrogation) and their choices—stepping deeper, bracing, etching the rule, turning toward the valley—drive the narrative arc. However, these choices do not create sharp reversals or force trade-offs; the protagonist processes and articulates rather than deciding under competing pressures. Present in setup, development, and closure, but the causal work is diffuse.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The pewter mask strap appears in three beats: looped around wrist as "leftover tether," brushing bark mid-journey, and knotted around a branch as "boundary marker" near closure. Each use reweights meaning (tether → dream leash → limit sworn not to exceed). The final knot charges the image with cost (forfeiting the physical reminder), but the strap does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic under pressure; it remains symbolic rather than instrumental.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Ultraviolet penance is present throughout: leaves fluoresce letters when shadow passes, trees flare with remorse, cobalt fire marks honest steps. The concept shapes the protagonist's tactic (stepping deeper, writing with breath, offering the theorem) and is literalized in the forest's response. However, the penance mechanism—forest as calibration, not punishment—is asserted rather than tested through a moment where the protagonist must choose to endure or evade it. Visible in setup, development, and closure, but the stakes remain abstract.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Proprioceptive enhancement is signaled early ("a set of angles mapping ribs, tendons, and the tilt of my jaw") and used in two beats: surviving interrogation by listening to sensations, and bracing/mapping during the forest walk. The trait enables survival recall and present navigation but does not constrain a choice or impose a visible cost; it functions as background competence rather than a trade-off that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Brace" appears in three functionally distinct beats: waking and bracing on an elbow (world spins), bracing palms on dirt when chest tightens (forest flares, equations pluck fraction), and the final "brace" reference as a threshold point in the theorem. The second beat is pivotal—equations extract the ratio of intention to harm from the protagonist's posture—and shapes the closure's conceptual repricing. Removing "brace" would require restructuring the proprioceptive logic and the theorem's derivation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Remembering through trauma responses is introduced early ("plucking memory from the reflex that once kept it hidden") and demonstrated in the protagonist's recall of interrogation (muscle flinch, breath timing, heartbeats). The method shapes the protagonist's present approach (bracing triggers memory, bodily honesty feeds the algorithm) and primes the theorem. However, the mechanics remain abstract; no single beat shows the method failing or forcing a choice, and the closure does not hinge on its use.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ultraviolet forest is present in setup (canopy of cold trees, hum with unnamed color), development (leaves fluoresce letters, undergrowth paints shins, equations rise around breathing, trees flare when chest tightens), and closure (path brightens, trees dim to green as kindness). The forest actively responds to the protagonist's body and breath, constraining movement and extracting the theorem. It supplies the primary pressure and charges the final image ("carrying a forest inside me"), making it indispensable to the narrative logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The timeframe anchor ("after the anesthesia wears off") establishes immediacy in the opening line but does not tighten decisions or tactics after that. The narrative unfolds in a single continuous scene with no time pressure or clock; the protagonist moves at a reflective pace without urgency. The anesthesia reference primes the displaced/rooted tone but does not recur or constrain the middle or ending beats.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The motivation to discover the mathematics of mercy is declared early and pursued throughout (stepping deeper, writing with breath, offering the theorem to the caretaker). The desire is dramatized in embodied action (bracing, sensing torque, assigning constants) and tested by the forest's demand for honesty. However, the friction remains internal and abstract; no competing want or external obstacle forces a trade-off. The theorem is derived and accepted without visible sacrifice, keeping the motivation mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Displaced rooted tone is established in the opening ("I feel displaced, but rooted the way a graft is rooted") and sustained through proprioceptive detail ("angles mapping," "torque from shoulder to hip"), lyric compression, and the dual sensations of dislocation and embodiment. The tone modulates under pressure (shorter syntax when bracing, denser metaphor when the forest flares) and charges the final image ("roots can grow in a displaced heart"). The coherence is strong, and the tone directly supports the thematic closure.</comment>
