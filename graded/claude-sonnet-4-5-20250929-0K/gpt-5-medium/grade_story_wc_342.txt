<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's prosopagnosia is organically integrated as both trait and method—reading by edges, weights, and pressure rather than faces—and this perceptual mode drives the coin-reading and mural-painting beats. Internal contradiction appears in the tension between the artist's long-held dream and the ticking countdown, embodied in careful breath and slowed heartbeat. The final choice to sign with the coin and hide the letter is earned by prior causality with visible cost (the building falls, the artist stays). Minor deduction: the guild master's voice in the letter occasionally edges toward thematic instruction rather than character-specific idiom.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the mural holds as the building collapses, reweighting the protagonist's quest to "mirror the sky inside walls" with undeniable cost—the artist chose to stay and the room survived. The dominant lens is Accumulative/Textural, with pressure built through layered beats (search, coin discovery, pigment mixing, limit-testing) that converge in the final image of the dawn glowing on bark. Orientation anchors (tree trunk library, condemned building, face-blind artist hired to paint sky) are clear by the opening lines. One meaningful tightening occurs when the foreman grants "one more minute," narrowing options and raising the cost of staying.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The tree trunk library is vividly realized through grain, rings, carved grooves, and bark-as-canvas, and it constrains key choices: the coin clicks into a notch, the rings guide painting rhythm, the hollow protects during collapse. The body is present in slowed heartbeat, careful breath, and charcoal-dusted fingers. Spatial choreography is clear (center, nook, shelves, high seam). The coin and vials function as micro-setting objects that charge the final image. Minor gap: the foreman and workers outside remain abstract presences rather than spatially grounded figures.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—complete the mural before demolition—is signaled immediately and tightens through the foreman's countdown, the one-minute extension, and the artist's limit-testing ("I test the limit of the blue until it fractures"). Agency is clear: the protagonist chooses to stay, to layer pigment, to sign with the coin, and to hide the letter, each decision foreclosing retreat. The blast and collapse deliver visible cost, and the mural's survival reconfigures the initial promise. One tightening suffices for this length and lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the interplay of limits, memory, and survival: "discover your limits here, and put them in the paint, so the room knows them." The coin's faint indentations, the mural's layered glaze, and the final signing all enact the theme without stating it. The protagonist's prosopagnosia becomes a thematic asset—"the sky has no face, yet it has character in pressure and movement"—linking personal affliction to artistic method. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the dawn glows "quiet as a pulse, bright as a promise," reweighting the opening dream with earned cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV distance is stable and controlled throughout, with a distinct perceptual signature rooted in the protagonist's face blindness: seeing by edges, weights, grain, and pressure rather than features. Diction is purposeful and voice-consistent ("heightened stillness trembles the dust into motes," "the atlas hides as if it remembers my intent"). Rhythm modulates with pressure, shortening during the blast sequence and lengthening during the pigment layering. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks, and the interior voice remains clean under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, with opening lines establishing the hushed tone and later beats accelerating through the countdown. Information density is high: most lines advance action, character perception, or thematic image. Minor deductions: a few template stems repeat ("I test the limit of...") and some figurative language in the middle section ("the heightened stillness trembles the dust into motes," "as if windows opened inward") borders on stock metaphor without full voice-grounding. No loops or scaffold obscure causality, and the final image is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of face blindness, coin-reading, and time pressure is specific and non-obvious, transforming the "artist racing against demolition" template through the protagonist's unique perceptual mode. The coin-as-score metaphor and the mural-as-sky concept feel fresh in combination. Minor limitation: the condemned-building frame and the secret-book-safe motif are familiar beats, though the fractally precise coin and the "learning limits" angle add ingenuity. The piece commits fully to its premise and follows through without retreat.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Present from the opening and drives the key turns: the protagonist's prosopagnosia shapes the coin-reading method (seeing by edges and weights), guides the mural's execution (painting shoulders of clouds and weight of light rather than faces), and charges the final image ("the mural steady as a held gaze"). The affliction-as-asset choice alters tactics and forecloses the option of conventional portraiture.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Signaled early as "a secret book safe buried in these shelves, disguised as a cracked atlas," found in the nook, opened via coin mechanism, and its contents (vials and letter) drive the mural's pigment recipe and thematic instruction. Reweighted at closure when the protagonist hides the letter back in the atlas "for whoever finds this library after rubble." Three distinct beats; causal pressure and closure linkage are clear.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Shapes stakes and tactics across multiple beats: the guild master instructs "discover your limits here," the protagonist tests "the limit of the blue until it fractures," "the limit of time until the foreman coughs," and "the limit of stillness until even my heart slows." The final line delivers cost: "I learned my limits, and I learned the room's, and together we made a sky that could survive the fall." Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The coin's "fractally precise" pattern of "dots and arcs...small segments echoing larger spirals" enables the key action of matching arcs to tree rings and unlocking the atlas. The attribute matters: generic indentations would not have supplied the map. Constrains one major beat (coin-reading) and charges the closure (signing with the coin leaves faint indentations "that will dry like notes"). Visible tradeoff: the protagonist must coax the pattern with charcoal, spending time under deadline.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Crafting the mural is the throughline action: mixing pigments, laying glaze, layering the sky, painting clouds and light, testing limits, signing with the coin. Every major turn traces to this action, and the final image ("the mural catches a drifting slice of sky...and remembers it") depends on its execution. Removing "craft" would collapse the story's logic and closure. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Signaled early ("Guides said the book safe opens through faint indentations on a centuries-old coin, read like a star map"), the method shapes the search attempt: rubbing with charcoal, matching arcs to rings, clicking the coin into the notch. The mechanics matter and are dramatized. Closure participation: the protagonist signs the mural by pressing the coin into wet glaze, leaving faint indentations. Three beats, causal pressure clear.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The tree trunk library supplies resources (rings for the coin-map, bark for the mural canvas, the hollow's survival during collapse) and constrains choices (the room's thirst for glaze, the notch for the coin). Present from the opening, shapes multiple beats, and is essential to the closure: "the hollow holds...the mural steady as a held gaze." Removing the tree trunk would break the story's spatial logic and final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The timeframe tightens decisions throughout: "the foreman waits outside with his thumb on a radio," "workers go silent, listening for the countdown," "the foreman grants me one more minute with a raised palm," "a number reaches one," "the blast thuds." The clock is live and tracked, altering tactics (testing limits until time runs out) and charging the closure ("when the dust settles, the dawn still glows"). Essential pressure element.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The desire to "mirror the sky inside walls, to give rooms horizons when windows are denied" is stated early and dramatized through every painting beat. Friction appears between the want (complete the sky) and the cost (stay in a collapsing building). The final image fulfills the motivation with visible sacrifice: "we made a sky that could survive the fall." The motivation drives the protagonist's refusal to leave and charges the closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Heightened stillness is coherent from the opening ("The hush arrives like a held breath") through turns ("Stillness presses harder, the breath before implosion stretching like a rest") and charges the final image ("In that narrow silence, the mural catches a drifting slice of sky"). Tone modulates with pressure (dust trembles, breath chooses places, heart slows) without breaking. The tone is indispensable to the closure's resonance and is maintained across all beats.</comment>
