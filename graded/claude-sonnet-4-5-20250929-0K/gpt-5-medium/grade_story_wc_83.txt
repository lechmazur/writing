<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is vivid and character-specific ("bleak exhilaration is honest, and honesty is the only fuel I trust anymore"), with embodied emotion tied to the geode crystal's throb. Motivation is clear—hunting unused potential as a post-trauma quest—and the final vow to "remain awake, to keep the measure open and unclean" feels like earned endurance with visible cost. Minor slip: the transformation relies heavily on stance crystallization rather than a decisive micro-choice that forecloses a path; the ending reads as Charged Poise but lacks a sharper on-page trade-off.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who (drone strike survivor, night physicist), where (floating observatory), and when (during cooling cycle) by the first few paragraphs. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered sensory detail and the recurring geode motif, culminating in a cadence shift ("I swear I can feel it lift us") that reweights the dominant stake. Cost is felt in the vow to remain "open and unclean," but the closure leans toward Charged Poise without a sharper on-page consequence; the final image charges prior material yet the alteration of options remains oblique.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The floating observatory, geode crystal, and circuit breakers constrain choices and charge the closure: the narrator presses shoulder to glass, tilts the observatory, and feels the basin's unused potential "lift us." Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (moth-colored light, warm copper taste), and the spatial choreography is clean. The geode functions as micro-setting, recurring with reweighted meaning at the end, which satisfies the 9+ gate; minor slip is that the valley below remains slightly abstract despite thematic weight.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding where unused potential pools—is signaled early and tightens through perturbation sequences that narrow the search to a basin. The protagonist's agency (running the sequence, perturbing current, marking coordinates) drives escalation under the Accumulative lens. Cost is legible in the final vow to "remain awake" and the recognition that "pooling in me keeps my heart from burning up," though the price feels more conceptual than visceral; no sharp trade-off forecloses a concrete path on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—unused potential as both physical phenomenon and emotional survival—emerges organically from the hunt, the geode, and the trauma backstory without didactic statement. The final image ("a grip forming in the dark") offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material: unused might as both resource and burden. Minor slip: the line "bleak exhilaration that refuses to pretend" risks overt thematic echo, though it remains rooted in the narrator's voice and the earlier claim "honesty is the only fuel I trust anymore."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: the narrator notices heat, slack, and unspent force through a physicist's lens and survivor's oracle. Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("a name like a bruise that never quite fades," "wounded hymn"), with rhythm modulating under pressure (shorter clauses in peak moments). No head-hopping; purposeful compression and lyric cadence are taught early and sustained. Minor slip: a few filter verbs ("I see," "I feel") appear in high-pressure beats where immediacy could be sharper.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines layer image, action, and theme ("Light falls through it like rain through cathedral ruins, finding edges where edges were not"). Sentence openings vary, and the read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene needs. Minor loop: "unused potential pools" recurs across three beats with near-identical phrasing without added pressure; the figurative register is consistently elevated but never muddles sense. No causality breaks or scaffold drag; the Text Artifact Screen finds minimal friction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of trauma survivor, physicist, and oracle-through-shrapnel is specific and non-obvious; the geode-as-compass and perturbation theory as spiritual hunt avoid stock tropes. The final image—unused potential lifting the observatory—feels inevitable in hindsight. Minor derivative note: the post-trauma reckoning with ambiguous forces echoes familiar literary territory, though the floating-observatory frame and physics overlay add freshness. Risk-taking in voice and structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The survivor identity frames the narrator's motivation and perceptual lens (geode throbs, trauma as oracle). Choices in the final third—running the sequence, marking the basin, pressing shoulder to glass—are active and tied to this identity. The backstory is substantial but anchored in present stimuli (storms argue, geode answers). Setup and payoff are strong; middle development is lighter, relying more on internal stance than discrete turns.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The geode appears in at least four beats: fused in shoulder (setup), held to glass (perturb sequence), interior bell (data response), warms at closure. It constrains perception (throbs when currents argue), enables the hunt (teaches how to bend attention), and charges the final image ("keeping vigil"). Irreplaceable: no other object carries this fusion of shrapnel, oracle, and light-bending tool. Cost is tied on-page: the ache persists, and the narrator must "keep the measure open and unclean."</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Unfiltered awakening" is named twice (post-blast awakening, nightly re-awakening at console) and shapes the narrator's perceptual mode—raw arrival without gate, refusal of pretense. It drives the nightly ritual and the vow to remain awake. Middle development is thinner; the concept registers more as thematic lens than tactical constraint. Closure linkage is present but oblique: the ending "breath refusing orders" echoes the concept without foregrounding it.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Intangibly tangible" is named once (the geode as compass) and demonstrated through the oracle's physical ache paired with metaphysical knowledge. It enables the hunt by translating invisible currents into bodily signal. Setup and payoff are clear; middle beats show the trait in action (shoulder blazes corridor, tastes unresolved). Swappability is moderate: another synesthetic trait could serve, though the specificity of ache-as-pointer adds texture.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The hunt structures every beat: listening to circuit breakers, reading oscillations, perturbing currents, marking the basin. Major turns trace to hunt moves (data blur reveals basin, perturbation triggers shoulder blaze). Closure directly invokes the hunt: "the hunt that does not end in killing." Irreplaceable: removing the hunt collapses the narrative arc. Cost is present: the hunt requires the narrator to remain "open and unclean," pooling grief to avoid burning up.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Perturbation theory is named and enacted: "Small pushes reveal hidden terms, tiny nudges expose the slack." The method shapes the sequence in the final third (perturb current by a breath, listen for answer). Setup is clear; mechanics matter (knocking panel, running sequence). Middle development is lighter—theory is claimed but not continuously leveraged. Swappability is moderate: another analytical method could fit with edits, though the physics metaphor coheres with the narrator's role.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The floating observatory constrains movement (drift starboard to hover above basin), supplies resources (fans, mirrors, console, glass), and pressures choices (cooling cycle dictates timing). It recurs across all beats and charges the final image (tilts like a witness, lifted by unused might). Irreplaceable: the hovering vantage is essential to the hunt's logic and the metaphor of potential pooling below. Cost is implicit: isolation and the need to remain aloft to keep the measure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The cooling timeframe is signaled early ("circuit breakers cool") and brackets the hunt: slower cooling at the green-bruised sky signals urgency, and the vow to "remain awake" while they cool closes the piece. Time tightens decisions (mark the basin before the cycle ends) and modulates pressure. Middle tracking is lighter—elapsed time is not continuously legible. Cost is tied: the narrator must stay awake through each cycle to avoid losing the pooling.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The desire to find unused potential is named early, dramatized through the nightly hunt, and conflicted: pooling in the narrator keeps the heart from burning, but "the hush must be kept for the pooling to continue." Choices (perturb, mark, send coordinates) are goal-driven. Friction between want and cost is present: gathering the unspent will ferries grief aboard. Closure links directly: the basin's lift is both discovery and burden.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Bleak exhilaration is named explicitly ("bleak exhilaration is honest") and sustained through contradictory sensory details (laughter tries to grow where sorrow sits, breath after drowning, wounded hymn). Tone modulates with pressure: lyric density increases in the perturbation sequence, cadence tightens at closure. The final image—grip forming in darkness, not mercy but "something intangibly tangible"—charges the tone without resolving it. Coherent across beats; no flattening or drift.</comment>
