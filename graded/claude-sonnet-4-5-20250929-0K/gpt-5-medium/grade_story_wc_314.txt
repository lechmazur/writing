<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Iri's interiority is vivid and embodied—"The frozen dew crystal chimed faintly, a bell of winter inside summer"—but her motivations remain abstract. The decision to bury the reliquary and refuse to recite formulas is signaled but not earned through visible internal conflict or contradiction; we see her choose, but the pressure that narrows the choice to this specific act is told through reflection ("she felt there was neither arithmetic nor dream, but their handshake") rather than dramatized as a micro-choice under duress. The grandmother's voice arriving "not from memory, but from the math of birds and the mercy of water" risks unearned epiphany without prior on-page struggle that would make this moment credible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive early and remain stable. The closure effect is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Iri seals the reliquary "with a whisper and a steady breath" and walks out "carrying nothing but balance," crystallizing her dual commitment to logic and intuition. Cost is present but muted—she forfeits the formulas and leaves the crystal behind—yet the final image lacks a visible consequence that would make the price undeniable on the page. The ending reweights prior material but the felt cost remains oblique, preventing entry to the 7+ band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The waterfall and orchard are vividly rendered—"bark like maps, their branches sketching equations and lullabies"—and the reliquary constrains Iri's final choice: she must place it where "the flame could not reach" to preserve both frost and blossom. The setting charges the closure image through the waterfall's "copper grace" echoing her hair and vow. Minor slip: the starlings' spatial choreography ("pressed into a helix," "frozen midflight") is described but their position relative to Iri and the orchard remains unclear during the peak beat, preventing a seamless 7.5+.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—harmonizing logic and intuition—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful deepening occurs when Iri reads the starlings and realizes "her formulas would ruin the music if recited now," narrowing her options. However, the tightening is cognitive rather than dramatic: no live trade-off forces her to forfeit a concrete alternative on the page. The orchard's need is declared ("to remember, to tell the trees how to hold both frost and blossom") but the consequences of failure remain abstract, weakening the felt urgency of the final act.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—balancing logic and intuition—emerges through image and action: the reliquary's cold vs. the flame's warmth, the formulas vs. the starlings' counsel. The final image ("walked out carrying nothing but balance") offers a non-literal answer to the central question without stated moral. However, "keep the flame small, keep the crystal cold, and keep your laughter warm" edges toward thematic statement, and the closure lacks friction—no counter-reading or cost sharp enough to prevent the resolution from feeling tidy. The touch of wonder is invoked ("the touch of wonder climb her spine") but not dramatized as a constraint.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Iri notices equations and lullabies in bark, copper in light. Diction is controlled and purposeful—"sap surged with careful haste, blossoms tightened their blush"—and the prose maintains voice coherence under pressure. Minor register drift occurs in peak beats: "their handshake, their bright compromise" and "the math of birds and the mercy of water" elevate into lyric abstraction that slightly exceeds Iri's established lexicon. No dialogue is present to judge.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and rhythmically varied—"She laughed softly, a sound like seeds spilling"—with high information density in many lines. Clarity remains strong and spatial choreography tracks. However, pervasive figurative language in sequential lines ("veils," "curtains," "memory she had not yet lived," "bell of winter inside summer," "living vellum") creates textural density that slows momentum during the inciting beat and middle section. Template stems appear in the final third: "She [verb]" structures repeat across five consecutive sentences beginning "She slid," "She tied," "She laughed," "She tasted," "She stood," triggering the −0.4 to −0.6 penalty for cadence runs and capping high-band entry.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The auburn-haired alchemist harmonizing logic and intuition through a frozen crystal and starling augury offers a synthesis of fantasy elements, but the core premise closely matches the "mage balancing opposing forces" template common in speculative prompts. Specific details—waterfall mist, rootbound reliquary, copper-tinctured hair as vow—add texture, yet the emotional arc and thematic resolution do not transform the template through lived friction or non-obvious moral calculus. The ending's "balance" affirms the premise rather than complicating it, leaving the piece in the functional-but-familiar mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Auburn-haired alchemist: setup (early), development (refuses formulas mid-scene), payoff (seals reliquary at closure). Present across all three gates. Iri's decision not to recite formulas is a key turn, but the choice is cognitive rather than dramatized with visible cost—she laughs and lets the flame burn down without a trade-off that narrows other options. The "auburn" detail ties to the copper-light reprise at the end, adding lyric resonance. Causal pressure is moderate: the choice shapes the ending but could be executed by a character of any hair color or title with minor edits, limiting irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Frozen dew crystal: setup (carried in reliquary, "chimed faintly"), development (set on stone, warmed by flame sending "new lattice of colors"), payoff (sealed beneath roots at closure, "exhaled a white thread"). Present across all three gates and handled in three distinct beats. The crystal enables the orchard's renewal—"every root remembered childhood"—linking causally to the ending. Specificity is strong: its cold vs. the flame's warmth dramatizes the logic/intuition tension. However, the mechanics of how the crystal "tells the trees" remain abstract, and the cost of sealing it (forfeiting future use) is implied rather than visibly felt, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Touch of wonder: invoked explicitly in two moments—"Only the touch of wonder could make her feet follow it correctly" (middle) and "she felt the touch of wonder climb her spine" (near end). The concept is named but not dramatized: no on-page moment shows wonder constraining or enabling a choice with visible cost. It functions as thematic echo rather than stake-shaping force. Swappability is high; replacing "touch of wonder" with "intuition" or "openness" would require only synonym edits. Late middle appearance and label-only use keep the score in the functional-but-ornamental band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Secretly sentimental: setup (grandmother's teaching, "secretly sentimental" label), development (carries threadbare ribbon, ties it to branch as witness), payoff (grandmother's voice arrives at closure with counsel). Present across all three gates. The ribbon-tying is an on-page action, but its consequence is minimal—the breeze reads it without altering Iri's options. The trait enables the grandmother's voice to arrive "not from memory," but this moment is reflective rather than a choice under pressure. The cost of sentimentality (vulnerability, attachment) is implied but not visibly traded. Specificity is moderate; the ribbon is tied to Iri's past but does not irreplaceably shape the ending.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Flame: setup (coaxed from steel and flint, nested in clay cup), development (sends lattice of colors through crystal, "let the flame burn down to a patient ember"), payoff (kept small per grandmother's counsel, contrasts with crystal's cold at closure). Present across all three gates and handled in three beats. The flame enables the crystal's activation—"new lattice of colors"—and its restraint (not allowed to reach the reliquary's final nest) is tied to the ending's balance. Causal pressure is solid: the flame's warmth vs. the crystal's cold dramatizes the logic/intuition tension. However, the flame could be replaced with another heat source (candle, sunlight) with modest edits, limiting irreplaceability to the mid-6 band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Patterns in a flock of starlings: setup ("learned to read through the patterns"), development (starlings draw spiral, line, circle; later freeze midflight; Iri reads "theorem's last clause"), payoff (starlings break stillness, leave "hollow shaped like a calm question"). Present across all three gates. The starlings provide counsel that narrows Iri's choice—she realizes formulas would "ruin the music"—creating causal pressure. Specificity is high: the flock's movements are distinct and tied to alchemical/mathematical logic. However, the mechanics of how Iri "reads" them remain abstract (no clear decoding process dramatized), and the final hollow's meaning is oblique. Beat involvement is strong but the cost linkage is indirect, keeping the score in the mid-5 to low-6 range.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Hidden orchard behind kaleidoscopic waterfall: setup (early, "orchard breathing ancient freshness"), development (trees with bark like maps, roots where reliquary is buried), payoff (orchard answers with fruit, waterfall's copper grace frames Iri's exit). Present across all three gates. The orchard supplies the closure location and its root-nest constrains where the reliquary can be placed—"where the flame could not reach"—directly affecting the ending. The waterfall's "copper" light echoes Iri's hair at closure, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clear and the setting's logic (frost + blossom coexistence) ties to theme. Strong integration across beats and ending, nearing the 7.0 threshold.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Before the final transformation: invoked in opening ("before the final transformation, while choices could still sing") and near end ("Before the final transformation arrived, she sealed the reliquary"). The timeframe frames urgency but does not tighten tactics on the page—no clock, countdown, or visible acceleration of pressure. The "transformation" remains abstract; we do not see what it would entail or what Iri forfeits by acting now. The phrase functions as atmospheric framing rather than a live constraint. Swappability is high; replacing with "before the ritual" or "at the turning point" would require only label edits. Present in setup and payoff but absent from middle development, capping below 5.0.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>To harmonize logic and intuition: setup ("to harmonize logic and intuition had become her life's motif"), development (formulas on forearm vs. listening to sap and stones; starlings' counsel vs. charcoal notation), payoff ("neither arithmetic nor dream, but their handshake" and walking out with "balance"). Present across all three gates. The motivation shapes the central tension and the ending directly answers it. However, the friction between logic and intuition is declared rather than dramatized as competing wants with visible cost—Iri chooses intuition over formulas, but we do not see her struggle or forfeit a concrete benefit of the logical path. The "handshake" resolution reads tidy rather than hard-won. Causal presence is strong but cost legibility is weak, keeping the score in the mid-5 band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Ancient freshness: invoked in opening ("orchard breathing ancient freshness") and echoed through imagery—dew crystal as "bell of winter inside summer," grandmother's teaching, "sap surged," "blossoms tightened." The tone is consistent and modulates slightly: reflective in the opening, heightened during the starling-reading, settling into calm at closure. The waterfall's "simple mercies" and the orchard's "green hush" sustain the mood. However, tone does not shift under peak pressure—Iri's laughter and the final walk maintain the same tranquil register without a cadence break that would charge the ending. Coherence is strong but the final image does not reweight the tone with new urgency or cost, capping just above 6.0.</comment>
