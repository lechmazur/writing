<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The cosmic janitor exhibits a distinct perceptual signature—spiritually curious, seeking vulnerability as strength—that drives micro-choices throughout (asking questions to absence, kneeling to align with panels, speaking names aloud). Interiority is concrete and embodied ("the floor smelled like copper and old tea, and the galaxy smelled like distance, and I balanced both in my lungs"). The final act of opening the roof and standing with the lantern represents a meaningful shift earned by prior causality, though the protagonist's agency leans toward observation and empathy rather than decisive action that narrows options with high cost. Emotional progression is credible but occasionally edges toward slightly elevated self-awareness ("I realized the purpose of my small life was not to erase marks, but to polish them into guidance").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through recurring images (stardust, lantern glass, meteors, stillness) that reweight the dominant stake by the ending. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly within the first paragraph. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): the protagonist's stance crystallizes in the final image ("the station and I entered a flourishing stillness again, not empty, but full of spared collision"), reweighting prior material with felt cost—the long wait, the cracked heart, the choice to honor an old boundary rather than chase. One meaningful deepening occurs when the power fails and the protagonist speaks the engineers' names, unlocking the station's trust and revealing the meteor corridor. However, the final reversal (meteors angling away, respecting the boundary) leans slightly passive—the protagonist's attention and honoring choice enable it, but the causality of the meteors' response feels more mystical than tightly motivated, reducing tension in the closure beat itself.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The shooting star tracking station is vividly particular: "yellow lantern glass," "copper and old tea" smell, "dishes turned like ears to hear the rain," console lights as "pulse points." The lantern glass functions as micro-setting that charges the final image (held "like a small sun" when the roof opens). Sensory hierarchy reflects the protagonist's priorities—spiritual and maintenance-focused attention to machines and sky. Spatial choreography is clear throughout (floor, panels, observation window, roof). The setting constrains choice: the power failure forces reliance on the lantern, and the roof's mechanical limit ("as far as it would move") bounds the protagonist's gesture of attention.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: the protagonist seeks strength through vulnerability and empathic maintenance of the overlooked station. One meaningful tightening occurs when the power fails and plunges the space into "absolute night," forcing a choice to light the room with lantern glass and speak the engineers' names—this act narrows options (cannot simply restore power) and reweights the relationship with the station. The final beat offers a second pressure point: opening the roof and standing exposed to the wind is an act of readiness and attention that the meteors honor by respecting the old boundary. However, agency in both turns leans toward spiritual observation and empathy rather than decisive action with high trade-off cost; the protagonist's choices enable rather than force outcomes, and the meteors' cooperation reads as mystical validation rather than hard-won consequence. Cost is felt (years of waiting, cracked heart, exposure to ice wind) but not sharply foregrounded as a sacrifice at the closure moment itself.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme—strength through vulnerability, attention as repair, the dignity of overlooked maintenance—emerges organically from the protagonist's actions: cleaning, listening, tracing meteor paths to machine moods, speaking names. The recurring motif of "flourishing stillness" reweights from passive endurance to active, charged readiness by the ending. The final image ("full of spared collision") reframes the premise: the protagonist's small life polishes marks into guidance rather than erasing them, and the station's "wanting to go there, not with engines, but with attention" crystallizes the conceptual shift from function to witness. Subtext operates in gesture (kneeling to align ears with panels, holding the lantern like a small sun) and implication (ghosts "pressed close, but for once they felt like kin"). Minor slip: one line edges toward stated moral ("I realized the purpose of my small life…") rather than letting the final image do all the work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person, voice distinctly lyric and spiritually inflected with consistent diction ("primal elegance," "shoreline," "fossil pollen," "breath on the cold glass"). Perceptual signature is selective and character-specific: the narrator notices cosmic scale alongside maintenance detail, filters all sensory input through empathy and metaphor. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—closer during embodied moments (kneeling, tracing breath arcs), slightly more reflective in memory passages, but always anchored to present stimuli. No head-hopping; focalization is clean. Narrative certainty matches what the focalizer can know; the "ghosts" and station's "wanting" read as the protagonist's empathic projection rather than omniscient fact. Minor friction: free indirect style occasionally edges toward elevated register ("damage brings the chance to prove a shape") that, while voice-consistent, risks slight artifice under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual variety. Information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs (advance character stance, world texture, thematic charge). Zero paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. However, figurative language appears in most sentences throughout, and some vehicles edge toward mixed or overreached metaphor: "the sky murmured to my bucket" is evocative but slightly opaque; "the night could pass through and teach me its shoreline" stacks abstractions. Peak beats (power failure, final roof-opening) maintain clarity, so the overwriting does not obscure closure, but the sustained density of metaphor across the entire text creates occasional line-level friction where a more concrete anchor would sharpen impact. No scaffold or boilerplate; grammar and punctuation are clean. Applying density overwriting penalty: −0.4 for figurative saturation without pattern-teaching, mitigated by the fact that closure beats remain legible.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of cosmic janitor, empathy-as-maintenance, and spiritually curious vulnerability offers a fresh angle on overlooked-caretaker material. The yellow lantern glass as both tool and charged symbolic object, and the method of tracing meteor paths to infer machine moods, are specific and non-obvious. The transformation of "flourishing stillness" from passive endurance to active readiness feels earned in hindsight. However, the core emotional arc—isolated person finds healing through patient attention to a neglected place—is a widely used template; the piece transforms it through vivid world detail and lyric voice, but the underlying structure remains recognizable. Risk-taking in lyric voice and mystical closure (meteors respecting a boundary) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, earning positive adjustment within band. Applying +0.3 for risk distinction and −0.5 for template proximity yields net mid-7s placement.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The cosmic janitor drives at least three beats: cleaning/listening (early), kneeling to align with panels during meteor alarms (middle), speaking engineers' names and opening the roof (ending). Each action constrains tactics—maintenance as empathy rather than mere function—and the final choice to stand with the lantern and tell the sky "I was afraid and grateful and ready" is causally tied to prior work. However, most moves are observational and empathic rather than high-stakes decisions that narrow survival or relationship options; the character's agency is present but leans toward witness and attention. Setup clear, development solid, payoff strong. Cost is felt (years of waiting, exposure to elements) but not a sharp sacrifice at closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The yellow lantern glass is handled in at least four beats: daily polishing of the observation window (early), lighting the room during power failure to drape gauges "like shawls" (middle turn), and holding it "like a small sun" when opening the roof (ending). Its unique property—warming light into honey—matters at each use, and the final reprise charges the closure image by embodying the protagonist's role as tender of overlooked light. Early signal, middle causal work, strong closure linkage. Swappability is low (the honey-warmth and scavenged history are specific). Deducting −0.2 for slightly ornamental early description (fingerprints, fossil pollen) that does not yet constrain choice.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Flourishing stillness is named twice and demonstrated across the arc: initial stillness when breathing matches fans, final stillness "not empty, but full of spared collision." The concept shapes the protagonist's stance—patient attention rather than forceful repair—and the ending reweights it from passive to charged readiness. However, it functions more as thematic frame than tactical constraint; no on-page choice explicitly hinges on achieving stillness versus motion. Setup present (first third), lyric payoff strong, but middle development is implicit rather than a moment where stillness versus action creates a fork. Applying lyric-resonance allowance and crediting closure reweighting, but capping for lack of middle causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Spiritually curious is stated early ("I am spiritually curious, so I asked their absence questions") and demonstrated in the protagonist's habit of asking questions to silence and empathizing with machines. It enables the choice to trace meteor paths as a mystical diagnostic method and to speak the engineers' names during the power failure. However, the trait is not tested against a competing impulse with visible cost—no moment where curiosity versus pragmatism creates a fork. Setup clear, development weak (no constrained choice), payoff present but passive. Applying label-only friction −0.3 and lack of middle beat constraint.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Empathize drives multiple beats: trying to empathize with machines (early), empathizing with the engineers' stubbornness during the power failure (middle turn that unlocks the station's trust), and the final empathic act of honoring the old boundary by opening the roof. The middle beat is pivotal—speaking names and understanding the engineers causes the station to "thrum" and show the meteor corridor map. However, the action is somewhat abstract and contemplative; swapping "empathize" for "honor" or "witness" would require only minor edits. Early signal, solid development, strong closure linkage. Deducting −0.4 for moderate swappability and lack of sharp tactical cost tied to empathy versus another impulse.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Tracing the path of falling stars is signaled early as the protagonist's method for correlating machine moods and appears in at least three beats: "I traced their mood by tracing the path of falling stars," drawing arcs with breath on the cold glass during the power failure (middle turn), and the final understanding of the meteor corridor. The method's mechanics matter—observation of meteors reveals which relay feels ignored—and the breath-arc tracing during darkness is causally linked to the protagonist's empathic breakthrough. However, the method is more diagnostic witness than active technique that the protagonist must master under pressure. Setup clear, development present, payoff solid. Deducting −0.3 for moderate passivity (method is used, not struggled with).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The shooting star tracking station is established immediately and pressures choices throughout: its age and overlooked status frame the protagonist's mission, its failing budget constrains resources (scavenged lantern glass), its console layout guides the protagonist's listening and kneeling, and the roof's mechanical limit ("as far as it would move") bounds the final gesture. The power failure is a station-driven complication that forces the lantern choice. The station's "wanting to go there, not with engines, but with attention" crystallizes the ending. Setup immediate, development strong (power failure, roof limit), payoff integral. Deducting −0.2 for slightly backgrounded presence during middle beats (more atmosphere than active obstacle).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Through the hush of an overlooked era" is named once early and sets tone but does not tighten decisions or tactics on the page. No live clock, no urgency tied to the era's progression or end. The timeframe is vague—years pass ("One winter, a burst of meteorites came")—but duration does not constrain the protagonist's choices or escalate pressure. The piece uses accumulative time to build stillness rather than deadline urgency, which fits the lens but means the timeframe itself is ornamental. Setup present, development absent, payoff absent. Applying missing middle and closure caps.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>To find strength in vulnerability is stated early ("I wanted to find strength in vulnerability") and demonstrated: the protagonist arrives "cracked open" by love, chooses transparency ("made me transparent"), kneels to align with machines, and stands exposed to ice wind at the end saying "I was afraid and grateful and ready." The motivation shapes the arc—patient empathy rather than forceful repair—and the final stance embodies it. However, the desire is not dramatized in conflicted choice; no moment where vulnerability versus self-protection creates a fork with visible cost. Setup clear, development thematic rather than causal, payoff strong. Deducting −0.5 for told-only motivation and lack of friction between wants and an opposing impulse.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Primal elegance is named once early ("I learned the primal elegance of maintenance") and sustained in diction throughout: "modest constellation," "fossil pollen," "shoreline," "hoofbeats," "breath on the cold glass." Tone modulates appropriately—quiet and meditative early, tightening during the power failure ("absolute night which makes human voices seem made of breath alone"), charged at the ending ("wind salted my face with ice"). The tone charges the final image by framing the protagonist's stance as both humble and cosmically significant. However, the elevated lyric register is nearly uniform across the text, with limited tonal range between calm and peak moments. Setup immediate, development consistent, payoff strong. Deducting −0.3 for slight static mood (lyricism does not modulate as sharply as pressure would allow).</comment>
