<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The knight's interiority is vivid and specific—his embodied wariness and measured breath ground the character. The mother backstory appears abruptly in the second half without prior seeding, weakening motivation clarity. The final choice (pressing the kernel to tongue) lacks visible internal conflict in the moment; the protagonist moves through beats with contemplative passivity rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Embodied emotion is strong ("shivering bliss," visor unsnapped as "rite of honesty"), but the decisive act feels ordained rather than torn from competing wants.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (withdrawn knight, alchemical orchard greenhouse) land early. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered imagery (stage directions, constellation-trees, mother's script) and culminates in the kernel choice that reweights possibility into "homecoming." The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the knight chooses one shape of possibility, and the cost (drowning in "statistics of miracles" if he does not choose) is legible. One minor friction: the orchard's mechanics (how grafts cultivate shapes of possibility) remain abstract, relying on atmospheric accumulation rather than dramatized constraint.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting is richly specific: glass roof with rooted constellations, crucibles as lantern fruit, phosphorescent lichen, mercury sap. The orchard's alchemical logic constrains the knight's approach (he follows stage directions, climbs the bee-written ladder) and charges the closure (the kernel within the hand-shaped fruit). Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The setting operates as both laboratory and garden, a micro-world that shapes every choice and embodies the story's thematic tension between measurement and mystery.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: capturing the shape of possibility. The orchard's pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens—each beat (program whispers, armor removal, ladder climb) deepens the knight's commitment and narrows options. The cost surfaces explicitly: "choose one shape and release the others, or else drown in a statistics of miracles." One meaningful tightening occurs at the crooked ladder and kernel, where the choice crystallizes. The protagonist's agency is contemplative rather than agonized; the escalation relies on accumulation and setting invitation more than internal resistance or external antagonist.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—allegiance to tending rather than thunder, possibility as renunciation—emerges organically from the knight's armor-shedding, the mother's puppet-troupe history, and the orchard's patient science. The final image (kernel on tongue, theater bells, "homecoming") offers a resonant answer to the opening question without moralizing. The recurring motif of stage directions and marionette program reweights from navigation tool to maternal inheritance to script for a new vow. Subtext operates in gesture (gorget clasps, visor unsnapped) and the orchard's silent waiting. No thematic echo or prompt-label intrusion mars the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, filtered through the knight's sensory bias (boots clicking, cold night as palm, leaves without metal ring). Diction is elevated and lyric but remains internally consistent—no mid-paragraph head-hopping. A few lines edge toward purple excess ("darkness flocked like velvet," "geometry his instructors would have called treason if they dared to measure") without breaking voice coherence. Perceptual signature is distinct: militaristic framing (charge, clash, oaths, campaign) recontextualized through horticultural and theatrical metaphors. Psychic distance holds; no filter-verb stacks or expository intrusions flatten immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout, occasionally bordering on overwriting: "constellations that had learned to root," "sink of mercury sap," "stitched constellations," "geometry...treason if they dared to measure." Most metaphors hold, but "flocked like velvet" and "allegiance...to a compass drawn in sap" verge on mixed vehicle logic. Information density is strong—most lines do multiple jobs. No paraphrase loops or scaffold detected. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and the final line ("possibility settle into him like a homecoming") lands cleanly. Deduction for elevated-register drift in peak beats and some figurative overreach that slightly obscures immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of withdrawn knight, alchemical orchard, marionette theater program, and maternal backstory is specific and non-obvious. The frame (stage directions as cartography, trees as equations) transforms the quest trope through sensory and conceptual specificity. Emotional truth—allegiance to tending over thunder—feels earned rather than asserted. Minor swappability concern: the mother's puppet-troupe history arrives late and could be replaced by another inheritance with minor edits. The orchard's patient science and the knight's renunciation of war coheres as a singular vision, but the premise leans on literary-fantasy templates (knight seeking mystical object in enchanted place) without radical subversion.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Withdrawn knight is present early and his choices drive key beats: following the program, removing armor, climbing the ladder, pressing the kernel to tongue. The knight's renunciation of war-allegiance for orchard-allegiance shapes the arc. His observation is active (orchard shifts to his breath, trees receive his step) and his decisions alter tactics (unsnapping visor, tugging gorget). The final act (kernel to tongue) is decisive and closure-shaping. Deduction for late backstory revelation (war-weariness) that could have been signaled earlier to deepen internal conflict.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Abandoned marionette theater program appears early (carried in gauntlets), returns in the clearing (placed on fossilized pollen slab, print shimmers), and is causally active: it maps the orchard, whispers cues ("upstage right toward the sink of mercury sap"), flips its own pages to angle the knight toward the ladder. The program is also the mother's inheritance, reweighted at closure. The object shapes at least three beats and charges the ending by linking maternal guidance to the knight's final choice. Strong integration, though the program's mechanics (how stage directions become navigation) remain slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Murmured allegiance appears twice: first rising "without command" to the orchard and the script that remembered his mother, then again at the end as "murmured allegiance to mornings that require tending." The concept shapes the knight's stance shift from war-thunder to patient cultivation and constrains his final choice. It is thematically central and vocalized on the page. Deduction for the concept being summarized rather than dramatized in a high-pressure beat; the allegiance is stated more than tested.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Factually mystical is embodied in the orchard's dual nature: "laboratory disguised as a garden," crucibles as fruit, equations spliced into bark, pickers in white coats beneath cloaks. The attribute enables the knight's quest (shapes can be cultivated with precise grafts) and constrains his approach (scientific patience required). It does not create a single on-page tradeoff with visible cost; instead it colors the setting and stakes. Present early, functional across beats, but largely atmospheric rather than a limiter that alters a key choice.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Unsnap appears twice with escalating import: first the visor buckle ("rite of honesty before sacred fruit"), then the gorget clasps ("unsnap the old vow") per the cue line. The second unsnapping is a major turn—armor removal enables the knight to hear the leaves without metal and breathe "shivering bliss," marking the shift from war-allegiance to orchard-allegiance. The action is irreplaceable (substituting "remove" would dilute the mechanical and thematic specificity) and shapes the closure by making vulnerability the precondition for the kernel choice. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Through forgotten patterns is signaled early (orchard cultivates shapes "with precise grafts and patient stars," trees "eager to repeat" forgotten patterns) and returns at the climax (orchard "answered through forgotten patterns, aligning apple stars, quince comets, and pear planets"). The method enables the orchard's response to the knight's choice and the revelation of possible mornings. It shapes the mechanics of how possibility is captured. Deduction for the method remaining somewhat abstract—how patterns are forgotten and rediscovered is told more than shown in action.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Alchemical orchard greenhouse shrouded in endless night is present from the opening line, pressures every choice (trees rearrange to the knight's breath, branches braid into proscenium, ceiling resolves into film frames of possible mornings), supplies the kernel resource, and charges the closure (theater bells fill the greenhouse as reality shifts). The setting is indispensable—remove it and the story collapses. It functions as laboratory, garden, theater, and mystical crucible. Strong causal pressure, beat involvement (entrance, clearing, ladder, kernel), and closure linkage with irreplaceable specificity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>As reality shifts appears in the opening ("reality shifts and the rows rearranged themselves") and at closure ("theater bells as reality shifts"). The timeframe signals flux rather than a ticking clock; it marks threshold moments when the orchard responds to the knight's presence and choice. It does not tighten decisions with urgency or tracked pressure. The phrase is more tonal and atmospheric than a constraint that alters tactics. Present early and at closure, but the mechanics of when and why reality shifts remain vague.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>To capture the shape of possibility is the knight's stated goal from the second paragraph, drives his entry into the orchard, and is tested at the kernel choice ("choose one shape and release the others"). The motivation is explicit and shapes the arc. Friction appears on the page: the cost of choosing (drowning in miracles vs. homecoming) and the implicit renunciation of war-allegiance. Minor deduction: the motivation is told early and dramatized late, with limited on-page struggle between competing desires during middle beats. The knight's contemplative acceptance reduces friction visibility.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Shivering bliss appears explicitly when the knight removes the gorget and "breathed shivering bliss." The tone—awe mixed with vulnerability—modulates across the piece: withdrawn wariness at entry, honesty and cold exposure at visor removal, patient waiting at the clearing, and homecoming at closure. The tone is coherent and charges the final image ("possibility settle into him like a homecoming"). Deduction for the phrase appearing only once on the page; the tone is enacted more than named, which is strong, but explicit recurrence would tighten integration.</comment>
