<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's guilt and the journey toward answering it through tattooing is embodied through concrete choices: reading letters aloud, holding amber to the recorder, tattooing the woman's wrist, and finally inking himself. The backstory of leaving "a girl whose laugh had not yet begun" provides causal motivation, though the relationship between that past refusal and the present client's baby remains more symbolic than directly motivated. Interiority is vivid and specific ("my throat remembered the cold") but occasionally drifts into elevated register ("dissonance of old guilt," "waveforms") that feels more thematic than character-bound. The final self-tattooing earns closure through prior setup, but the emotional arc from guilt to tentative reconciliation could be more contradictory under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the narrator moves through a night of translation work, layering encounters with letters, recorder, amber, client, and finally self-inscription until the final image reweights the guilt motif. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis transitioning toward tentative action): the protagonist tattoos himself, accepts the amber, and commits to staying "until the dissonance finally unmade itself"—a renunciation of flight with visible cost ("I am not forgiven, not yet"). Orientation anchors are present early (tattooist, lab, letters) and causality under the Accumulative lens holds: each object and encounter adds density until the final beat. One minor cost-legibility issue: the exact nature of what the protagonist forfeits by staying could be sharper on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The laboratory setting is vivid and functional: salvaged floorboards "ringing with narratives," a cabinet with hidden letters, the recorder with "haunted firmware," and amber at the workstation. These elements constrain action (the letters dictate the tattoo glyph, the recorder translates cries, the amber charges the ink) and the "meteor hush" recurs to modulate atmosphere at closure. Micro-setting (amber, recorder, table) effectively substitutes for broader spatial detail at this length. One deduction: spatial choreography during the woman's visit is compressed—her presence "outside my booth" then immediately inside with the cabinet is minimally anchored, risking a brief float.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—hushing the dissonance of old guilt—is signaled early and pressured through escalating encounters: the letters address the narrator by name, the recorder plays back the cry he ignored, the client arrives with the cabinet as payment, and the final self-tattooing forecloses retreat. Under the Accumulative lens, each beat tightens by adding symbolic and causal weight until the protagonist's choice to "stay and listen" redefines his stance with visible cost (accepting unforgiven state, embedding the tether in his own pulse). Agency is clear in the decision to tattoo himself after the woman leaves. One gap: the woman's arrival feels slightly coincidental rather than motivated by prior action, though thematically it completes the pattern.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—atonement through presence, listening as reparation, guilt as recursive waveform—emerges organically from objects and actions without overt moralizing. The amber ("resin that could have let go but decided to hold") and the two-star glyph recur with shifted meaning: first in letters, then on the client's wrist, finally on the narrator's own arm, charging the closure image. The final lines resist summary ("I am not forgiven, not yet, but the map on my arm points inward") and offer a resonant non-literal answer. Minor slip: "guilt lives in waveforms, folding and refolding until we answer" skirts thematic echo, though the metaphor is fresh enough and the line serves to anchor the recorder's logic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable and the voice carries a distinct lyric-technical texture ("constellation tattooist," "ghosted frequencies," "meteor hush"). Psychic distance is controlled; the narrator's perceptual filter privileges sound, guilt, and symbolic resonance. Purposeful compression and ellipsis (the nature of "the scream once, small and new" is clarified only obliquely) are taught early and paid off at closure when the baby's cry and the narrator's past refusal converge. Two minor issues: register occasionally elevates beyond plausible interiority ("dissonance," "waveforms," "firmware") without full voice-motivation, and the letters' glyph being "a mark I had tattooed" before introduces slight retroactive omniscience since the narrator doesn't clarify when or on whom until the closure self-inking.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm is controlled and varied; figurative language is dense but mostly purposeful ("meteor hush," "laboratory of lost sounds," "winter hardened around the sound"). Information density is high and propulsion steady. Three distinct line-level issues lower the score: (1) Minor paraphrase loop: "I pretend the stars I prick are maps forward, but I am here to hush the dissonance" then "Now I translate baby cries" restates purpose without added pressure. (2) Filter-verb stack in mid-passage: "I thought distance would bleach the sound, but guilt lives in waveforms" uses filter + abstraction where embodied perception would sharpen. (3) Elevated diction in peak beats ("dissonance," "waveforms," "firmware," "filament of ink and the amber's light") drifts toward poetic register that isn't fully earned by the POV's established idiom, triggering minor register friction. These do not obscure closure but accumulate to −0.8 within Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of haunted firmware, constellation tattooing, baby-cry translation, and guilt-driven atonement is specific and non-obvious. The two-star glyph recurring across letters, client, and self creates fresh structural symmetry. The piece commits fully to its lyric-technical premise and follows implications without retreat. Risk-taking in voice and structure (elliptical backstory, accumulative pressure, quiet closure) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Minor deduction: the "haunted firmware" and "laboratory of lost sounds" frame, while vivid, leans toward aesthetic convenience—both elements serve symbolic more than causal function, and the recorder's translation mechanism is asserted rather than grounded in plausible detail, reducing irreplaceability slightly.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The constellation tattooist makes four key choices: reading letters aloud (activates recorder), holding amber to recorder (shifts the cry's key), tattooing the two-star glyph on the woman's wrist (delivers the word "stay"), and tattooing himself (commits to staying). Setup early, involved in all major beats, drives closure. Cost is visible (accepts unforgiven state, embeds tether in own pulse).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Amber introduced early ("Behind the glass of my workstation"), handled in two beats (held to recorder, pressed to new ink at closure), and its metaphor ("resin that could have let go but decided to hold") reweights at the ending when the insect "seemed to flex, as if choosing." It constrains the protagonist's final stance (choosing to hold) and charges the closure image. Specificity high; irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Haunted firmware (recorder that "keeps updating with the voices of the dead") is present early, translates the baby's cry in two beats, and provides the word "stay" that the protagonist needed to learn. It shapes tactics (the narrator consults it, uses its translation to guide the tattoo) and enables the closure epiphany. However, its mechanics are asserted rather than causally grounded, reducing irreplaceability—another mystical device could serve similarly.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Translating baby cries is introduced in paragraph six, demonstrated on-page when the recorder samples the client's baby ("I am untethered, I am adrift" then "stay"), and constrains the protagonist's action (he draws the glyph in response). It enables the woman's relief and reflects the protagonist's past failure to listen. Cost tied to the attribute: his guilt centers on not translating/listening years ago. Slightly late signal and one fewer beat than strongest elements.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Tether" appears in the glyph description ("two stars tethered by a thin line"), the tattoo on the woman's wrist ("I tethered them with a filament of ink"), the baby's cry ("I am untethered"), and the protagonist's self-tattoo ("tethering them with a line that crossed my pulse like a bridge"). The action defines the core metaphor, drives the major turn (woman's baby calms, protagonist commits), and is irreplaceable—the entire closure image depends on the tethering gesture.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Handwritten letters found in antique furniture cabinet are introduced early (paragraph nine), address the narrator by name with the two-star glyph, dictate the tattoo he must ink ("telling me to ink the glyph upon a certain wrist tonight"), and the final hidden letter provides the closure mandate ("draw a path only you can walk"). The method is specific, causal, and shapes multiple beats. Minor deduction: the cabinet as payment and the secret panel feel slightly convenient, reducing organic integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Laboratory of lost sounds is named in paragraph two, defined by silence as instrument, floor that listens, cabinet, recorder, and workstation with amber. It supplies the tools (recorder, amber, letters, table) that constrain every choice and the space where the protagonist performs translations and finally tattoos himself. The setting is indispensable to the story's logic and charges the "meteor hush" closure atmosphere. Strong micro-setting use.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"When time folds in on itself, a dusk that unspools like tape and splices itself again" is introduced early as atmospheric frame and echoed at closure ("nights that fold and splice"). It provides lyric coherence and signals the recursive guilt structure, but does not materially tighten a decision or impose a live clock. Primarily thematic rather than tactical. Resonant but not constraining.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation to hush the dissonance of old guilt is stated in paragraph four and dramatized across all beats: reading letters that know his "patient shame," throat remembering the cold, leaving the room "that smelled like iron and milk," and finally accepting "I am not forgiven, not yet" while committing to stay. The desire is contradictory (wanting absolution but accepting its absence) and drives every choice including the self-tattooing. Cost visible on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Meteor hush" appears in the opening line, recurs when the protagonist draws the two stars ("Meteor hush fell over the lab"), and closes the piece ("In the meteor hush, I pressed the amber to the new ink"). Tone is coherent—quiet, suspended, haunted—and modulates with pressure (builds density toward the tattoo, breathes at closure). It charges the final image and is voice-specific. The tone is indispensable to the story's lyric architecture.</comment>
