<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The glass artist's motivation (discovering purpose in pauses) operates largely through reflection and metaphor rather than dramatized conflict of competing impulses. The teacher's rival as antagonist remains off-stage; the protagonist's plan to expose him through frost-patterns and the canyon's testimony feels more allegorical than psychologically urgent. Embodied emotion appears in scattered gestures (kneeling, breath held, glass rod singing), but the interiority often defaults to elevated abstraction ("purpose lived in pauses because pauses were doors"). The final choice—fusing the ledger into a window for frost-translation—arrives without visible internal resistance or cost that forecloses another path on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: recurring images (glass, frost, breath, canyon) layer toward a conceptual repricing where the protagonist chooses a "steadily adaptive answer, neither cold nor hot, but annealed." Orientation anchors (luminous glass artist, canyon under stars, after surviving the attempt) appear early. The closure—creating a frost-legible window to testify at the guild—lands as Charged Poise, crystallizing the protagonist's method without executing it on the page. Cost is conceptual (choosing midpoint over destruction or direct accusation) but the felt price remains oblique; the rival's exposure is future-tense, not dramatized consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The canyon as setting constrains the protagonist's method (frost on stone, silence as witness) and charges the final image with recurring motifs (cliffs answering thought, canyon listening). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (sand chilling bones, wind thickening and thinning, frost filigree matching ledger edges), filtered through the glass artist's craft-based perception. The stone "whose surface gleamed like cooled crown glass" concretely ties setting to the character's idiom and enables the frost-reading action, meeting the 9+ gate for environment shaping tactics and charging the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—exposing the arson attempt while avoiding forgery accusations—is clear. One meaningful tightening occurs when the protagonist rejects direct guild presentation or destruction in favor of the frost-legible window, narrowing options. However, the escalation operates through reflection rather than on-page pressure; the rival's threat remains background and the canyon method unfolds without resistance or visible tradeoff. The final plan reconfigures tactics but its cost (future guild meeting, reliance on natural phenomena) is anticipated rather than paid on the page, placing this in mid-band under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: glass as metaphor for fragility and transformation, pauses as doorways, frost as truth-revealer. The core concept (scorched testament) integrates with the glass artist's annealing philosophy ("neither cold nor hot") without overt statement. The final image—letting frost translate the ledger, making the canyon testify—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to discovering purpose in pauses. The rival "would hear his laugh unspool from stone" provides dramatic irony without didacticism, and the ending avoids moralizing by staging revelation through the protagonist's craft rather than confrontation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single-POV distance remains stable with a lyric, heightened register consistent throughout ("the canyon listens," "stars felt like witnesses"). Perceptual signature is craft-specific (glass hears better than it sees, kiln carries color, annealed answer). The elevated diction ("luminous glass artist who had outlived my own molten mistakes," "a tiny drought of soot") fits the reflective mode but occasionally drifts into abstraction ("pauses were doors") that dilutes immediacy. No head-hopping; the experimental compression and patterned repetition (breath, glass, frost) are taught early and sustained. Filter verbs ("I felt that push again") are sparse and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language (glass hears, frost writes, wind braids with stars) coheres under the lyric mode taught early. However, density suffers from paraphrase loops: "purpose lived in pauses because pauses were doors" restates the stated motivation without added pressure. Template cadence appears in mid-section runs ("I knelt...I told...I read...I pressed...I laid...I retraced...I rose"). Stock metaphors cluster without fresh specificity ("black sun," "dust of soot as tiny drought" strains). The closure beat avoids these patterns, keeping it above the artifact cap, but mid-section redundancy and elevated abstraction trigger −0.6 in this category.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of glass craft, forensic frost-reading, and canyon as witness offers a specific, non-obvious frame. The ledger-as-window concept and the choice to let natural phenomena testify rather than confront directly feel purposeful and grown from the protagonist's occupation. However, the glass-artist-as-metaphor-for-resilience and the mentor's-rival-as-arsonist remain familiar templates. The frost-translation method and canyon acoustics provide fresh texture, and the annealed midpoint choice resists binary resolution. Risk-taking in lyric compression heightens coherence without obscuring the closure effect, warranting a modest within-band lift.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The luminous glass artist protagonist frames the story, makes the central decision (fusing the ledger into a frost-legible window), and shapes the closure image. Present in all three gates (setup, middle reflection on craft methods, ending choice). Causal involvement is strong but operates through reflection rather than on-page struggle; the choice to create the window alters tactics with conceptual cost (rejecting direct accusation or destruction) but the felt price is future-oriented. Beat count: setup, ledger examination, frost-reading attempt, final plan—four distinct touches. Specificity is high (glass idiom, annealing philosophy) but irreplaceability is moderate; another craftsperson could serve similar thematic function with adjustments.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The charcoal smuggler's ledger strip appears in setup (found waterlogged in ash pit), middle development (pressed flat, frost-reading attempted on stone), and closure (planned fusion into window for frost translation). It drives three beats: discovery prompts the journey, examination reveals the rival's pen marks and debt map, and the protagonist's final plan centers on making it legibly testify. Causal pressure is strong; without the ledger's specific properties (charred edge, smuggler's entries matching rival's hand), the closure method fails. Cost connection is clear: the protagonist must preserve it in transformed form rather than destroy or present it directly. Specificity and irreplaceability are high; the ledger's dual nature (evidence and scorched artifact) is unique to this plot.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The core concept "scorched testament" shapes thematic texture (ledger as testament to heat, time, will; the protagonist's survival as testament) and anchors the dominant stake (exposing arson through preserved evidence). It appears in setup ("a scorched testament, not only to trade, but to heat, time, and will") and resonates in the closure plan (ledger fused into glass as enduring testimony). However, it operates more as metaphor than tactical constraint; the protagonist's choices would function similarly if framed as "surviving evidence" or "fire-marked proof." Beat involvement is limited to thematic echo rather than multiple causal turns. Closure linkage is present but oblique; the ledger's scorched state matters but the concept itself does not independently drive the window-fusion method.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The attribute "steadily adaptive" is labeled twice ("I am steadily adaptive, I told the cliffs" and "a steadily adaptive answer, neither cold nor hot") but does not constrain on-page action with visible cost. The protagonist's choice to fuse the ledger into a window rather than destroy or present it demonstrates adaptability in principle, but the trait itself is declared rather than dramatized through competing impulses or visible tradeoff. No middle development shows the trait enabling or limiting a prior beat. Closure participation is thematic label only; removing the phrase "steadily adaptive" would not alter the logic of the annealing metaphor or the window plan. The attribute trends toward ornamental self-description rather than causal driver.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The action "retrace" drives the journey to the canyon ("I returned to retrace the line that had scorched my work"), structures the middle investigation (retracing frost veins with a glass rod, following frost north along stone to the quarry rim), and shapes the closure (the protagonist plans to retrace the ledger's evidence through frost for the guild). Three beats with distinct causal function. The retracing method is specific to the glass artist's craft and yields the rival's identity and debt map. Closure linkage is strong; the final plan depends on retracing as both literal and metaphorical process. Swappability is low; "investigate" or "examine" would lose the purposeful repetition and the craft-specific idiom of tracing patterns.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The method "patterns in morning frost" is signaled in setup ("I read clues in patterns in morning frost, where cold writes what fire cannot confess"), demonstrated in middle development (frost blooming on stone matches ledger's edges; protagonist retraces frost veins with glass rod), and anchors the closure plan (carrying the window back for frost to translate at dawn guild meeting). Three gates met. Beat involvement: frost-reading beats in middle and the final window plan both depend on this method. Causal pressure is moderate; the method enables discovery of the rival's pen marks and debt map, but the protagonist's interpretation feels assured rather than constrained by the frost's actual legibility. Specificity is high (cold writing what fire cannot); irreplaceability is strong, as no other method fits the glass artist's philosophy of reading truth through temperature and transparency.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The quiet canyon under stars is present in setup (opening line and journey destination), provides the spatial frame for all middle development (stone surface for frost-reading, wind and silence as acoustics, cliffs answering thought), and charges the closure image (protagonist plans to return and "let the canyon testify" at the guild meeting). The canyon as witness and acoustic amplifier is specific to the closure method; the protagonist's plan depends on the canyon's resonance to make the rival "hear his laugh unspool from stone." Micro-setting is active: the stone whose surface "gleamed like cooled crown glass" enables the frost-reading, and the canyon's silence and echo shape the protagonist's discovery that frost veins point to the quarry rim. Swappability is low; a generic outdoor location would not support the listening/testifying metaphor or the glass-like stone surface.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The timeframe "after surviving the attempt" anchors the story's present and motivates the protagonist's investigation. It appears in setup ("After surviving the attempt, I returned to retrace the line") and shapes the stakes (exposing the arsonist). However, time does not tighten decisions within the present action; the protagonist works methodically without live clock pressure. The wait for dawn to read frost patterns is structural (method requires morning light) but does not create urgency or alter tactics under duress. Middle development spans one night without time-cost tradeoffs. Closure participation is indirect; the past attempt provides motive but the future guild meeting is anticipated rather than time-constrained on the page. The timeframe is functional but replaceable with another post-crisis frame.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The motivation "to discover purpose in the pauses" is stated in setup ("I had come to discover purpose in the pauses, the silences between hammer and breath") and echoed at closure ("Purpose lived in pauses because pauses were doors"). It frames the protagonist's reflective stance and justifies the choice to create a frost-legible window (a pause between evidence and accusation). However, the desire is more thematic claim than dramatized friction; no on-page moment shows the protagonist torn between action and pause or paying visible cost to honor this philosophy. Middle development involves pausing to read frost, but this is methodical craft rather than conflicted choice. Closure linkage is present but operates as label rather than earned tension; the motivation could be summarized as "seeking truth through patience" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The tone "drifting resonance" is established in the opening line ("quiet canyon under stars sounded like a breath held too long, then released") and sustained through lyric compression, elevated diction, and recurring acoustic/echo imagery (canyon answering thought, song braiding with stars, rival's laugh unspooling from stone). The tone modulates subtly under pressure: breath-holding and chilled bones convey urgency, while the final image ("stand quiet, as glass stands") returns to stillness. Coherence is strong across all beats; no jarring register shifts. The tone charges the closure by framing the canyon as collaborative witness and making the protagonist's stillness an active stance. Specificity is high (drifting suggests both acoustic drift and emotional suspension); the tone is irreplaceable to the piece's idiom and the glass-as-listening metaphor.</comment>
