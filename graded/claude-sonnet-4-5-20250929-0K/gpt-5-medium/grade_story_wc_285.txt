<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The coachman's interior life reads distinctly—spindrift serenity and closely attentive awareness anchor his stance—and his goal to "distill complexity into essence" receives concrete motion through the needle-and-stitching ritual. Wren's embodiment ("eyes holding their own lantern") and the ferryman's softening shoulders supply embodied emotion. However, key choices lack visible cost: the decision to cross feels pre-determined, and Wren's map-stitching does not foreclose an alternative path on the page. The final image offers calm resolution without a dramatized trade-off, leaving motivation clean but agency muted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (fog-bound crossing, coachman beside trap, Wren approaching) land within 120 words, meeting the test. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered images (palimpsest, yarn needle, map-stitching) and the final line—"the day moved forward with them"—offers Charged Poise where the map-sail trembles with earned serenity and the road "looks less like burdens and more like breathing." Cost is felt in the ambient transition from gloom to breath, supported by "not erasing, but warming the scars." One meaningful deepening (the stitching ritual that braids fear into motion) suffices at this length, though the turn is gradual rather than sharp.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The fog-bound crossing supplies persistent constraint: wet bark muffles hooves, current tries to turn the ferry, and fog "pressed like muslin" filters perception. The yarn needle and map function as micro-setting that charges the final image—the map-sail "trembling with...spindrift serenity" crystallizes the achieved state. Sensory selection reads purposeful (spindrift, creaking hook, water slapping "like a dog too tired to fetch"), and spatial choreography tracks cleanly across trap, ferry, and far bank. Setting actively enables the stitching beat and the ferryman's relief, meeting the 9+ gate for constraint and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finishing "what we began with that needle" and crossing the palimpsest promise—is signaled early and maintained. The stitching ritual at midpoint narrows options (old letters show through new lines, fog becomes "intelligible drifts"), and the ferryman's recognition that "your road is water tonight" deepens the coachman's stance. Cost is legible in the phrase "not erasing, but warming the scars" and the fog parting "in narrow alleys of view," but the escalation reads as patient accumulation rather than a forced trade-off, consistent with the Accumulative lens. No antagonist appears; the river's resistance is momentary, and the final image lands without visible forfeit beyond ambient transformation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: the palimpsest (writing over fear with motion, "not forgetting the fear"), the yarn needle threading "what you see through what you cannot," and the map showing "everything that will drown us unless we learn to braid it." The final image—hills "less like burdens and more like breathing"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of distilling complexity without moralizing. Subtext operates through gesture (Wren touching his sleeve to steady the ferry) and the ferryman's silent shoulder-softening. Minor slip: "decisions that surfaced through ambient awareness" edges toward meta-commentary, though it remains anchored in the coachman's process.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person close maintains stable focalization through the coachman's perceptual signature: "thoughts began to percolate, patient as river stones," "closely attentive to the hush, as if listening for lost footfalls." Dialogue carries subtext ("You look like rain") and goal pursuit. Elevated diction ("palimpsest," "spindrift serenity") reads consistent with the lyric mode taught early. However, runs of similar syntactic stems appear ("He carried," "He watched," "He felt," "He set"), and "glacial" phrasing like "purposeful without breaking the silence" and template constructions slightly flatten momentum. Distance control and voice remain coherent under pressure, preventing deeper penalty.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative density (fog "pressed like muslin," water "like a dog too tired to fetch") stays legible. Information density is high: most lines do double work (e.g., "river approved and the fog did not protest" carries tone and agency). However, paraphrase loops appear: "palimpsest promise" is declared in narration, then Wren repeats "That script was our palimpsest promise"; "spindrift serenity" bookends without transformation. Template cadence runs: "He carried," "He trusted," "He watched," "He felt," "He set" cluster in sequential paragraphs. These artifacts do not obscure causality but dull immediacy, triggering −0.6 baseline and disallowing 9+ globally per the pattern-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The core synthesis—palimpsest ritual on a ferry crossing—offers a specific angle, and the yarn needle as "token and tool" deepens Wren's gift into a functional constraint. Tone and imagery cohere as singular artistic stance. However, the premise maps closely to "symbolic object enables ritual transformation" templates common in literary flash, and key phrases ("percolate," "ambient awareness," "distill complexity into essence") echo craft-prompt language without full transformation into lived detail. The final image (hills breathing, map-sail trembling) feels earned in hindsight, lifting the score, but the core remains derivative without bold structural risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Present early (setup ✓). The coachman's decision to trust "ambient awareness" and his choice to set the oar "in rhythm with the ticking of the rain gutters" shape tactics in two beats (development ✓). His recognition that "your road is water tonight" alters his stance at closure (payoff ✓). However, his agency reads observational more than decisive; Wren initiates the stitching and touching his sleeve steadies the ferry. The coachman's final tongue-click moves the trap forward, participating in closure but without forcing a visible trade-off. Gates met, causal involvement moderate.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Present early as gift and token (setup ✓). Wren threads it with moonlight and stitches the map, using it in one extended beat (development ✓). It reappears as "weightless direction" and its stitching makes fog "intelligible," constraining the ritual (payoff ✓). Two functional beats, clear causal role, charged specificity. Closure linkage is indirect—the map-sail trembles, but the needle itself does not reappear in the final image. Strong integration across beats but not indispensable to the last line.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Present early: "palimpsest promise inked in memory" (setup ✓). The concept governs the map-stitching beat where old letters show through new lines, literalizing the overwriting (development ✓). Closure phrase "palimpsest promise settle like a cloak, not erasing, but warming the scars" reweights prior material (payoff ✓). However, the concept functions more as thematic frame than tactical constraint; removing the word "palimpsest" would not break the stitching action. Gates met, but causal pressure is atmospheric rather than decisive.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Signaled early: "closely attentive to the hush" (setup ✓). The attribute enables the coachman to notice "thoughts began to percolate" and "decisions that surfaced through ambient awareness," guiding his method in two beats (development ✓). At closure, "He watched closely attentive, feeling how each stitch pulled the fog into intelligible drifts" ties the trait directly to the stitching payoff (payoff ✓). The trait constrains his approach—trusting murmurs over clamor—with mild cost (patience vs. speed). Strong causal involvement across beats and closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Appears once: "thoughts began to percolate, patient as river stones" and "Meaning began to percolate through their patience" (setup ✓, development ✓). The action describes the coachman's and Wren's process of letting understanding emerge, shaping their method in the stitching beat. However, it does not appear at closure (payoff ✗), and swapping "percolate" for "surface" or "emerge" would not alter structure. Two gates met, functional but replaceable, no closure linkage. Cap 4.6 for missing payoff; band guidance and swappability hold it near that ceiling.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Signaled early: "decisions that surfaced through ambient awareness" (setup ✓). The method governs the coachman's stance ("trusted decisions...rather than clamor") and his watching during the stitching, shaping two beats (development ✓). At closure, the method enables the final recognition that fog drifts become intelligible and the road breathes, participating indirectly (payoff ~✓). However, the mechanics remain vague—"ambient" is label-only without a visible cost tied to this means versus another. Gates met, lyric resonance present, but lack of tactical specificity lowers score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Present immediately (setup ✓). The fog-bound crossing supplies persistent constraint: wet bark, creaking ferry, current trying to turn them, and fog that "pressed like muslin" filter all perception and slow movement (development ✓). At closure, "the fog parted in narrow alleys of view" and the far bank is reached, with the setting's pressure visibly resolved (payoff ✓). The crossing is indispensable—removing it collapses the ritual, the ferryman's presence, and the map-stitching's spatial logic. Strong causal pressure, closure linkage, irreplaceability, and spatial specificity throughout.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Appears once: "We will work until rain gutters stop ticking" near the end (setup ✗ late, development ✗, payoff ✓ weak). The timeframe is declared but not tracked; no on-page moment shows the gutters stopping or the deadline tightening tactics. The phrase charges Wren's vow but does not alter the coachman's choices or the ferry's pace. Introduced late (final third), ornamental use, no causal pressure. Cap 4.6 for missing setup; further lower for lack of beat involvement and swappability.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Present early: the coachman "had sworn to deliver what matters, to distill complexity into essence for her" (setup ✓). The motivation governs the stitching ritual—Wren and the coachman braid old letters into new lines, literalizing distillation (development ✓). At closure, the phrase "palimpsest promise settle...not erasing, but warming" and the map-sail trembling with serenity demonstrate achieved distillation (payoff ✓). However, friction between wants and costs is muted; the process unfolds without visible trade-off or competing desire. Gates met, thematic coherence strong, but dramatized conflict is low.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Established early: "breathing in spindrift serenity" (setup ✓). The tone modulates under pressure—patient murmurs, quiet laughter, the ferryman's shoulders softening—without breaking the serene register (development ✓). At closure, "the map-sail trembling with a quiet, spindrift serenity" reprises the exact phrase, charging the final image and reweighting the coachman's initial stance as earned rather than assumed (payoff ✓). Coherent modulation, purposeful reprise, closure linkage strong. Minor slip: static mood dominates the middle, with limited tonal pressure during the ferry turn.</comment>
