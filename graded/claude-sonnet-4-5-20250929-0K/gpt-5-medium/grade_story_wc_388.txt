<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator exhibits a distinct perceptual signature ("sharply observant, paid in bottle caps and secrets") with embodied interiority throughout the investigation. Interior logic remains consistent: the protagonist approaches mystery mechanically rather than mythically, and this stance drives each choice from camping in the office to refusing the diamond. The final choice to leave the diamond with the orchard feels earned by the established values, though the love-note detail in the penultimate beats reads slightly convenient rather than organically discovered. Minor deduction for the convenience of that affective token, but the arc from debunker to mechanic-priest holds with visible cost (walking away no richer, having traded curse for calibration).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the protagonist reweights superstition into maintenance, teaches the caretakers tuning over prayer, and walks out "steadier, having traded a curse for a calibration." The cost is visible—refusal of payment, retention only of a love note as proof that "tenderness survived bureaucracy." The drive lens reads Causal with accumulative texture: because the protagonist reassembles letters, the resonator's function is revealed; because the function is taught, the orchard survives the next storm. Orientation anchors arrive early (liquidation, orchard, packing shed, diamond) and the investigative structure tightens from mystery to mechanical solution. One micro turn when the protagonist realizes "I did not intuit magic; I intuited design" pivots the frame cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The orchard under radioactive dust storms functions as both macro-setting and constraint: "cone of calm around the packing shed" becomes the investigative target, and the protagonist's final act of marking "spots where the calm failed" and charting "new nodes for the next storm" shows setting guiding tactics. The shredded letters "still smelled faintly of disinfectant and pear blossoms" roots sensory detail in POV priorities. The diamond as field-resonator object charges the closure when the protagonist refuses it, saying "the orchard needed its own heart"—micro-setting (packing shed, locked office, irrigation pits) all constrain choices and the final image of walking out is anchored in rows and sacks and songs.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("excavate truth from comfortable lies") is signaled early and tightens through investigation: finding the stuttering shredder, reassembling letters, discovering the resonator's function, then teaching caretakers to tune it. The turn arrives when the director's memo reveals "Liability exceeds projected goodwill"—comfortable lies cost less than difficult truths. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency (camping, rebuilding, teaching, refusing the diamond), and the cost is clear: walking away no richer but steadier, having kept only the love note. The resonator holds during the next storm, validating the mechanical solution with visible consequence (fruit shone, caretakers ran with sacks and songs).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars without thesis: the flawed diamond mistaken for curse when "imperfection were not the signature of every useful thing we build," and the orchard kept alive by math rather than myth. The love note "signed with a joke about pears and radiance, proof that tenderness survived bureaucracy" elevates emotional truth without sentimentality. The final image—"to witness the apparatus, to intuit its axis, and to keep it turning"—reweights the premise non-literally: debunking conspiracies becomes witnessing hidden design, and truth operates as "an irrigation line, not a sermon." The protagonist's dream that "truth is an irrigation line" threads utility and care without moralizing. No thematic echo in the closure paragraph; the work is shown through stakes, wrench, metronome, and kept letters.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout: "I trusted objects that outlived their owners and policies," "I did not intuit magic; I intuited design," and "I was only a mechanic of causes, setting the stillpoint back into place." Diction remains character-particular (bottle caps, shredder, metronome, interference) and modulates under pressure without register drift. No dialogue on the page; reported speech ("They asked why…") integrates cleanly. The prose rhythm shifts from investigative calm to lyric compression at closure ("no richer, but steadier") without head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. Psychic distance is stable; free indirect style in "Dreams came of orchards that learned to speak" reads purposeful and voice-motivated. One brief hedge: "as if I were a priest undoing a hex" uses filter slightly, but the effect supports the narrator's self-awareness without dulling immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Information density is high and sentence openings vary; rhythm accelerates through investigation and breathes at closure. A few figurative moments risk overwriting: "dust storm came like a herd of hammers, chewing the horizon into grit" mixes vehicle slightly (hammers chew), and "I rebuilt a life, by reassembling shredded letters" reads as minor typo or comma splice. "Slicings are invitations to patient hands" and "frequency…shepherded dust" employ metaphor purposefully without muddle. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; propulsion remains clear. The final paragraph's lyric compression ("steadier, having traded a curse for a calibration") lands cleanly. Minor deduction for the "herd of hammers…chewing" vehicle contradiction and the comma-splice/life typo in the reassembly line, but overall clarity and momentum hold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of conspiracy-debunking, field resonator, and post-liquidation orchard feels specific and non-obvious; the transformation of "cursed diamond" into "flawed synthetic seed of a field resonator" reweights trope through grounded physics (constructive interference, particulate frequency). The director's memo line "Liability exceeds projected goodwill" offers a fresh, bitter inflection on corporate villainy without cartoonish excess. Emotional truth in the love note about "pears and radiance" humanizes the bureaucracy without sentiment. The story risks lyric density and commits fully to its premise without retreat. The final image—walking out "having traded a curse for a calibration"—synthesizes theme, setting, and character into a singular stance. Risk-taking in structure (investigative frame, memo reconstruction, dream interlude) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The conspiracy debunker frames the entire arc: protagonist camps in the office, reassembles letters, discovers the resonator's function, teaches caretakers tuning, refuses the diamond, and walks out. Each turn traces to observation converted to decision (intuit design, mark failed spots, chart new nodes). Present in setup, drives middle investigation, and shapes closure refusal. Causal pressure throughout; removal would collapse the investigative spine.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The flawed diamond appears early (packing shed amulet), returns in the dust-storm calm (chime, timbre), is revealed as field resonator (cracked lattice holding frequency), and is refused at closure ("the orchard needed its own heart"). Handled across four distinct beats; its flaw reweighted from curse to "signature of every useful thing we build." Causal (enables the orchard's survival), closure-active (refusal with cost), and irreplaceable (specific cracked lattice property matters).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The hidden stillpoint shapes stakes from the first night ("cone of calm…hush shaped exactly like a prayer") through discovery ("place of constructive interference, a calm anchored by math") to closure action (marking failed spots, charting new nodes). The concept drives the investigation and final teaching; the protagonist "set the stillpoint back into place." Setup, development (realized as interference), and payoff (recalibrated, held during next storm). Removal would erase the investigative target and thematic spine.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Sharply observant" enables the protagonist to notice the cone of calm, hear the diamond's "timbre as precise as glass cooling," and intuit design rather than magic. The trait constrains the investigation to patient reconstruction rather than mythic explanation. Present in setup (paid in secrets), drives middle beats (stuttering shredder, reassembly), and informs closure teaching (tuning with wrench and metronome). The cost is visible: walking away no richer, having kept only evidence. If swapped for "methodical" the beats would shift slightly but hold; mid-high band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Intuit drives the pivot beat ("I did not intuit magic; I intuited design"), the reassembly process (reading absence as presence), and the teaching moment (showing caretakers how to tune). The action defines the protagonist's method and separates debunking from mere observation. Setup (intuit objects that outlived owners), development (intuit design in chime and calm), closure (intuit axis and keep it turning). Removal would require rewriting the investigative method and thematic resolution. Highly specific and causal.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Reassembling shredded letters is signaled (stuttering shredder, "absence is a kind of presence"), dramatized (camping in cold office, rebuilding memo and love note with coffee stains mapping irrigation), and delivers the key discovery (resonator diagram, director's liability line). The method shapes middle tactics and supplies the evidence that teaches caretakers. Setup (slicings as invitations), development (reconstruction beats with sensory detail), payoff (kept love note at closure). Specific mechanics matter; swapping for "reading archived files" would lose the earned patience and symbolic resurrection.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The wasteland orchard under radioactive dust storms supplies the investigation's necessity (trees that should not have lived), the environmental pressure (storms test the resonator nightly), and the closure validation (next storm held, fruit shone, caretakers ran rows). The setting is handled across setup (trembling trees, sagging fruit), middle investigation (cone of calm, pits where microbes feast), and ending (marking failed spots, charting new nodes). Removal would eliminate the investigative stakes and the environmental constraint that proves the resonator's function.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"After the liquidation" frames the investigation's context (corporation folded, records shredded, caretakers left with superstition) and tightens the stakes (no institutional support, survival depends on local knowledge). The timeframe recurs (first night storm, days later finding shredder, next storm at closure) and shapes tactics (patient reassembly rather than asking authorities). Setup anchor, middle context (executives vaporized, final snow of denial), and closure span (walking out after teaching). Not a live countdown, but the post-collapse frame eliminates shortcuts and forces the protagonist's mechanical solution.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The motivation to "excavate truth from comfortable lies" drives every beat: refusing rumors, trusting objects over superstition, camping to reassemble letters, teaching caretakers maintenance over prayer, and showing them the director's liability line ("comfortable lies cost less than difficult truths"). The desire is dramatized through choices (refuse the diamond, keep only the love note) and carries visible cost (no richer, but steadier). Setup (paid to excavate truth), development (prioritize stillness under noise, rebuild evidence), and closure (trade curse for calibration). Friction between the caretakers' need for myth and the protagonist's need for apparatus charges the teaching beats.</comment>
