<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is highly specific and voice-consistent—"I listen as them, because I habitually borrow personalities" demonstrates embodied empathy work. The borrowed-Maris stance creates genuine internal tension ("asking me to stop pretending Maris has all the courage I need"). However, the couple's grief arrives pre-packaged and their transformation ("the woman feels his terror as arithmetic") reads more like demonstration of the premise than earned character change. The final confession about using ambiguity to protect oneself offers a micro-choice that forecloses self-deception, meeting baseline cost requirements.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a Conceptual Repricing at closure. Orientation anchors by ~100 words (letterpress operator, topaz workshop, night setting). The piece accumulates pressure through the couple's commission, the protagonist's self-examination, and the halo fragment's responses, culminating in "I have been using my ambiguity to protect myself, but its best purpose is to disorient fear"—a CR that reweights the premise with conceptual cost (acknowledging evasion). The final star-vanishing image charges this shift. One meaningful deepening occurs when the protagonist moves from hiding behind Maris to claiming ownership of ambiguity's purpose, which narrows future tactical options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The topaz workshop functions as micro-setting throughout: grit is swept from the tympan, the halo fragment warms in its drawer, the press shudders. The observatory across the alley provides spatial counterpoint and supplies the star maps that become commissions. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("oil, citrus, and topaz dust"), and the vanishing star at the end becomes a tactile anchor ("the absence washes my hands cleaner than solvent") that charges the closure image. The setting constrains the protagonist's process and supplies the metaphoric vocabulary (points, picas, ligatures) that structures thought.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: understanding the mathematics of emotion, tested through the commission. Pressure accumulates as the protagonist sets type for the grieving couple, registers their forgiveness request, and confronts the limits of borrowed courage. The halo fragment's cooling when the protagonist sets their own confession provides a micro-reversal that forces self-examination. Cost is legible in the admission of evasion and the promise to "disorient fear" rather than hide behind it. One meaningful tightening occurs when the couple's need exposes the gap between the protagonist's technical mastery and emotional honesty, narrowing the option to continue hiding.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—empathy as rotation rather than substitution—emerges from concrete action (setting type, the halo fragment's charge transfer, the couple's shift in perception) without thesis statements. "Transposed empathy is not charity…it is rotation on a circle no one owns" integrates the concept into scene pressure rather than explaining it. The final question ("Will the sky forgive me for editing its grief into ours") reframes the protagonist's work as ethical calculus without offering tidy resolution. The recurring motif of vanishing stars gains weight through accumulation: astronomers catalog them, the couple's map marks one, and a new blank appears at the end, reweighting absence as cleansing rather than loss.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Voice is densely patterned and voice-specific: "I lock the chase and ink the forme while the night forgets names" establishes technical idiom and lyric compression early. Psychic distance remains stable in first person, filtering all perception through the protagonist's letterpress metaphors. However, runs of noun-phrase fragments and appositive constructions create template cadence in mid-sections ("not as a boast but a diagnostic," "not substitution, but a musical key change"). The couple's brief dialogue is reported rather than directly rendered, which fits the reflective mode but misses an opportunity for voice distinction. Perceptual signature is consistent: the protagonist translates all experience into typography and measurement.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines layer action, image, and thematic weight. Rhythm varies purposefully between compressed lyric bursts and longer contemplative sentences. However, paraphrase loops appear: "the halo fragment warms" / "the halo fragment brightens" / "the halo fragment cools" / "the halo fragment glows" recycles the same beat without added pressure across four mentions. Appositive constructions stack heavily ("not by theft but by careful audition," "not substitution, but a musical key change," "not as a boast but a diagnostic"), creating a noticeable syntactic pattern that becomes scaffolding rather than voice-motivated rhythm. Filter verbs remain sparse and voice-appropriate. No clarity breaks or mixed metaphors.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of letterpress mechanics, empathy work, and astronomical time-marking feels specific and non-derivative. The halo fragment as a conductivity tool for emotion avoids both generic magic and purely metaphoric use by grounding it in tactile process (warming, humming, cooling in response to truth-alignment). Risk: the piece fully commits to its lyric-accumulative structure and typographic metaphor system without hedging into conventional plot. However, the borrowed-personality trait and the mentor-ghost guidance echo familiar craft-apprentice templates. The final image of vanishing-star absence as solvent transforms the setup material into fresh moral territory.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The cryptic letterpress operator makes on-page choices: calibrating the press to the couple's grief, selecting Caslon for patience, setting their own confession, and opening the door to the night. The protagonist's decision to stop hiding behind Maris and claim ambiguity's purpose drives the closure turn. Present throughout with causal pressure on two major beats (couple's commission, self-confession) and shaping the ending action (leaving the fragment to drink vanished light, setting the map into future tense).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The halo fragment appears in five beats: initial description, warming during the couple's proof, brightening in the drawer, cooling during self-confession, and final placement on the windowsill. Its warming/cooling responses provide feedback that validates or challenges the protagonist's alignment to truth. The fragment's conductivity mechanics enable the transposed empathy process. It constraints the protagonist's method (requires truth-alignment to charge the type metal) and charges the final image (drinking vanished light as the protagonist begins future work). Irreplaceable due to its responsiveness and saint-or-astronaut ambiguity that mirrors the story's tonal blend.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Transposed empathy is named, demonstrated through the couple's commission (the woman feels terror as arithmetic, he feels her love as geometry), and articulated as "rotation on a circle no one owns." It shapes the dominant stake (understanding emotion's mathematics) and drives tactics (choosing type, inking with the fragment's static). The concept appears in setup, governs the middle beat, and reappears in the closure as the protagonist reweights ambiguity's purpose. However, the mechanism remains somewhat abstract; the reader sees the result (the couple's perceptual shift) more than the on-page process of how ink carries charge to nerves.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Habitually borrowing personalities is named and demonstrated: the protagonist steps into Maris's "crisp and patient" manner and listens "as them" to calibrate the press. The trait enables the empathy work (allows the protagonist to align with clients' emotional states) but also creates cost (hiding behind borrowed courage rather than claiming their own). It constrains the climactic choice when the halo fragment cools and asks the protagonist to stop pretending. Present in setup, drives one major beat (the Maris-borrowing that bridges the couple's work), and shapes the confession at closure. Functionally essential but could be slightly more irreplaceable if the on-page consequences of switching between personalities were more tactile.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Disorient" appears as the shop's desired output versus the protagonist's "turbulence," in Maris's whispered "Lucid turbulence," and in the climactic realization: "its best purpose is to disorient fear." The action reframes the protagonist's ambiguity from self-protection to tactical weapon. However, it remains more thematic claim than embodied action; we don't see the protagonist actively disorienting someone on the page in a way that changes their options. The concept shapes the confession and final stance but doesn't drive a physical turn or constrain a middle beat through visible mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Deliberate ambiguity is introduced early ("my answers disorient through deliberate ambiguity"), governs the protagonist's method throughout (the halo's saint-or-astronaut origin, the cryptic print style), and is repriced at closure ("I have been using my ambiguity to protect myself, but its best purpose is to disorient fear"). The method shapes the commission work implicitly—the protagonist's prints arrive "sideways, lean, and then stand like question marks"—but the mechanics of how ambiguity creates the empathy transfer remain opaque. Present in three beats with thematic weight, but the on-page demonstration of method could be more concrete.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The topaz workshop under stars anchors every beat: topaz dust on the tympan, the fragment in its velvet drawer, the press's shudder, the observatory across the alley, and the door opening to "chilled, subtracting night." The workshop's particulars (forme, chase, tympan, ligatures) supply the vocabulary for the protagonist's thought and constrain the available actions. The setting's dual nature (craft space + astronomical context) integrates the vanishing-stars timeframe and charges the final image when a new star-blank appears. The windowsill placement of the fragment and the topaz grit sweeping are tactile micro-setting moves that ground the lyric mode.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Between vanishing stars" is named as the astronomers' label for mortal errands, frames the night's work, and bookends the piece (stars tick throughout, a new blank appears at the end). The timeframe creates atmospheric pressure and aligns the protagonist's emotional calibration work with cosmic decay. However, it doesn't impose a live deadline or tighten decisions; the protagonist works at their own pace. The interval functions more as metaphoric scaffold than tactical constraint. Present in setup and closure with thematic resonance but without mechanical grip on the middle beat's timing.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Understanding the mathematics of emotion is stated as motive ("simple enough to frighten me"), tested through the couple's commission (forgiveness as arithmetic, love as geometry), and confronted in the self-confession (measuring "the distance between cruelty and mercy in points and picas"). The desire drives the protagonist's work and creates friction when the halo fragment cools, signaling that borrowed courage isn't enough. The motivation shapes two beats and charges the closure, but the dramatized cost of pursuing this understanding could be sharper—what the protagonist risks or loses by continuing this work beyond emotional honesty remains implicit.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lucid turbulence governs the voice throughout: compressed lyric syntax ("I lock the chase and ink the forme while the night forgets names"), contradictory pairings (saint or astronaut, grief as clean arithmetic), and the protagonist's self-diagnosis ("the shop wants clarity and I want turbulence"). The tone modulates appropriately—Maris's whispered correction pulls scattered vectors into orbit, the couple's scene softens slightly, the self-confession sharpens. The final image synthesizes lucidity (the blank star washes hands "cleaner than solvent") and turbulence (beginning to set a salvaged future tense without resolution). Tone charges the closure and remains coherent under pressure, with purposeful cadence shifts marking each turn.</comment>
