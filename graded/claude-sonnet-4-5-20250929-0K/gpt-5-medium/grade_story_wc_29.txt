<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interior voice is distinct and embodied—"I breathed in dust and stubbornness," "I laughed once, sounding afraid"—with clear motivations driving the arc from passive listening to active interference. Internal contradiction emerges organically: cautious hope versus skepticism, temptation to accept tenure versus commitment to autonomy. The choice to "interfere" and the final refusal of the committee chair are earned by prior causality and foreclose paths with visible cost. Minor slips: secondary characters (dean, callers, janitor) apply pressure but remain lightly sketched; the wave's temptations ("painless nights," tenure) feel slightly generic against the otherwise concrete sensory world.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly within the opening lines (midnight shift, university radio station, election season). The narrative follows a causal-accumulative hybrid: the protagonist detects the signal, traces it to the booster, diagnoses manipulation, then counteracts it through subsonic counter-tuning—each beat tightens options and raises stakes. Closure arrives as Earned Stasis with visible cost: the protagonist refuses the committee chair, accepts messiness over control, and labels a channel for emergencies. The final annotation "to outwit cosmic tricksters, teach people their breath" reconfigures the premise with felt weight. One hairline gap: the wave's "receding" after the protagonist's refusal could have shown more on-page friction or consequence to fully land the cost of victory.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The radio station is rendered through concrete, functional detail: mixer lights, generator hum, duct-taped warnings, throat-singing cables. Sensory selection reflects urgency and professional bias—static with "tempers," hiss as breath, subsonic frequencies as bone-pressure. The booster at the theater roof and the campus grid mapped onto astronomical charts constrain the protagonist's tactics and enable the final interference. The quadrangle at dawn, kettles hissing, posters unpeeling in rain all charge the closure beat. Minor limitation: the broader city and community divides remain gestural; we see rallies and chants but little micro-geography beyond the station and theater.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—autonomy versus manipulation, the protagonist's integrity versus external orchestration—is signaled early and escalates through discovery, tracing, confrontation with the wave's temptations, and the choice to broadcast countersigns. The wave's offer of tenure and painless nights tests commitment; the protagonist's refusal and the dean's call create a meaningful tightening. Visible cost: walking away from the committee chair, accepting community messiness, labeling a channel for emergencies rather than control. One small gap: the wave's "receding" feels slightly passive; a stronger on-page resistance or consequence from the trickster would have sharpened the final trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—the tension between imposed harmony and authentic autonomy, the cost of outwitting manipulation through patient listening—emerges from particulars: subsonic salting of pauses, the councilmember forgetting his anger, actors reading lines as questions. The final annotation "to outwit cosmic tricksters, teach people their breath" reweights the premise without stating a moral; it's earned by prior action (the protagonist's countersigns, the community's return to self-directed choice). Subtext operates in the wave's "smirk," the dean's "too neat" refusal, the signal's "grin pressed into bone." No thematic echo or late moralizing; the closing image (charts open to the new annotation, community "unscripted and tender") resonates as conceptual repricing with felt cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: "Static had tempers; silence had accents," "teachers' ghosts argued with my own stubborn pencil." Diction remains consistent under pressure—lyric compression ("hiss became breath, breath became friction") without register drift. Dialogue (dean's calls, callers, councilmember) is purposeful and goal-driven, advancing plot and revealing power dynamics. Free indirect touches (the wave "seemed to smirk") are clean. Minor slip: the wave's dialogue-equivalent ("introduced itself without language, a grin pressed into bone") is evocative but slightly abstract; more concrete sensory grounding in that beat would tighten the moment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally, supporting scene pressure: short bursts during confrontation ("I laughed once, sounding afraid"), longer accumulative builds during reflection. High information density—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; figurative language (static as temper, wave as throat singing) is coherent and voice-motivated. Minor artifact: "It bent around speeches like wind around stone, never stopping, simply shaping" and similar metaphor density in the middle third approach overwriting but remain legible and purposeful. Clarity holds throughout; no opacity touching closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of cosmic trickster folklore, subsonic manipulation, and campus political polarization feels fresh and specific. The protagonist's occupation as "celestial signal interpreter" and the method of phase inversion to seed pauses rather than slogans offer a non-obvious angle on media influence and autonomy. Transformation test passes: plot and emotional arc depend on these exact particulars (astronomical charts, mixer, subsonic frequencies). The wave's temptations and the protagonist's refusal of tenure avoid stock redemption beats. Risk-taking—lyric compression, experimental voice, accumulative structure—heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. One small limitation: the "cosmic trickster" framing, while transformed through radio station specificity, still brushes familiar SF/fantasy tropes; the story earns its ground through execution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The celestial signal interpreter is introduced immediately, shapes every beat (listening, tracing, diagnosing, counteracting), and makes the key decision to interfere with visible cost. Removing this exact role would break the story's logic and thematic stakes. Setup present; development across multiple beats; payoff drives closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Astronomical charts appear early ("tea-stained and annotated"), are handled in the diagnostic beat ("I rolled out charts"), and return at closure with reweighted meaning ("a new annotation... to outwit cosmic tricksters, teach people their breath"). The object charges the final image and participates in the protagonist's method (mapping campus grid onto charts). Could be more causally active in the middle beats—currently more symbolic than tactically essential—but the lyric reprise earns strong credit.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Power plays shape the dominant stake: the dean's call for neutrality, the wave's orchestration of rallies, the protagonist's refusal of tenure. The concept is dramatized through on-page choices (dean's pressure, wave's temptations, protagonist's countersigns) and alters tactics. Present in setup, development, and payoff. Slightly generic as a concept label—"manipulation" would be as apt—but the story makes it specific through election-season staging and media control.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Cautiously hopeful" is voiced early ("I have always been cautiously hopeful, but I shelve hope until evidence") and constrains the protagonist's method: waiting for evidence, refusing the dean's first request, testing the wave before interfering. The trait enables the final choice to "breathe first" and accept messiness. However, the trait is more told than dramatized in a peak choice with visible cost; it colors approach but doesn't force a painful trade-off on the page.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Interfere" is the story's hinge action, signaled early ("I decided to interfere"), executed across multiple beats (tuning transmitters, broadcasting countersigns, salting pauses), and driving the final reconfiguration. The protagonist's choice to act rather than observe forecloses the path of neutrality with visible cost (dean's offer, potential safety). Removing this action would collapse the arc. Setup, development, payoff all present; causal pressure high; irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Subsonic frequencies are introduced early ("signal sat beneath hearing, tugging at equipment and mood through subsonic frequencies"), shape the protagonist's diagnosis and countermeasure ("Through subsonic frequencies I salted pauses into rallies"), and drive the resolution. The mechanics matter: phase inversion, seeding pauses, decoupling rallies from the wave's metronome. Setup, development, payoff all present; the method is specific and irreplaceable. Minor limitation: the technical detail could be slightly more grounded (how does the protagonist access the campus grid transmitters?) but remains plausible and functional.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The university radio station anchors orientation, supplies tools (mixer, transmitters, headset), and pressures choices (dean's call, callers' righteousness, automated jazz as cover). The booster at the theater roof extends the setting and enables the climactic interference. Micro-setting (boards, mixer lights, cables) constrains tactics. Setup, development, payoff all present. Could be more causally active—campus geography beyond station and theater remains gestural—but the setting shapes outcome and charges the final dawn walk in the quadrangle.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"As the community divides" is present throughout: election season, rallies, debates, the dean's pressure, callers practicing righteousness. The timeframe tightens decisions (the protagonist acts during this window of division) and the resolution shows the community "unscripted and tender" after the interference. However, the clock is more atmospheric than urgent—no imminent deadline forces the protagonist's hand. Setup and payoff present; development pressure is moderate. The timeframe shapes stakes but doesn't alter tactics beat-to-beat.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The motivation to outwit the cosmic trickster is dramatized through the protagonist's detective work (tracing the signal, recognizing manipulation), the wave's temptations (tenure, painless nights), and the final refusal. The desire is conflicted—temptation versus stubbornness—and drives the interference and the choice to label a clean channel. The closing annotation literalizes the motivation with felt cost. Setup, development, payoff all present; causal pressure high. Minor limitation: the trickster's "receding" could show more on-page resistance to fully test the protagonist's resolve.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Ethereal grit is coherent throughout: the signal as "throat singing," the wave's "grin pressed into bone," "hiss became breath," the protagonist's "dust and stubbornness." Tone modulates with pressure—lyric and expansive during listening, compressed and tactile during interference, tender and open at closure. The final image (charts, breath, emergencies) charges the ending without deflating into sentimentality. Diction and rhythm support the tone without obscuring clarity. The combination of cosmic mystery and grounded radio-station labor feels fully integrated.</comment>
