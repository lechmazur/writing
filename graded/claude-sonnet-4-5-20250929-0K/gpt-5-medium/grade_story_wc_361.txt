<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The courier's jittery nature is embodied through sensory particulars (pendant trembling, neck prickling) and contradiction—wanting stillness while incapable of it—drives micro-choices. The widow is present but largely reactive; her stroking the tube and breathing into the courier's hands supply pressure without deep interiority. The mentor's absence shapes the courier's method and final loneliness, though the emotional cost of that absence could press harder at closure. Internal voice remains consistent and specific throughout.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story teaches a pattern of sympathetic resonance early and pays it off when the corridor opens, then thins. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the widow and lost man overlap briefly, the tube is sealed, the yew planted—options narrow with the understanding that "miracles should not be kept past their flavor." Cost is visible in the corridor's thinning and the courier's solitary return to the path. One credible tightening (the germination sequence) reweights the dominant stake. Orientation anchors are clear by the opening lines.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The ridgeway hums, lightens, and sings—its green note enables the germination and pressures the final beat. The pendant vibrates sympathetically, choosing pitch and constraining the ritual. Snow, aurora, and the rock where the yew is planted all charge the closure image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through the courier's professional lens (tuning fork, sugar thread, thaw). Micro-setting (cupped hands, bone tube warmth) drives the central action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: deliver the relic and coax wonder from routine grief. One meaningful tightening occurs when the courier steadies hands, tunes to the widow's breath and ridge hum, and the three "begin to agree"—narrowing options to this exact pitch. The corridor's thinning imposes time cost and the widow's smile at its limit shows acceptance. Agency is clear: the courier holds pitch despite the mentor's absence, and the planted yew forecloses easy resolution. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—continuance planted in ordinary life, the overlap of memory and presence—emerges through particulars: yew seeds, the pendant's lesson, the corridor that must thin. The ending offers a resonant answer without moralizing: "I am planting continuance in the clefts of ordinary life" is embodied in the sealed tube and planted sprig, not merely stated. The ridgeway's "great heart whose pulse keeps time for the little ones" reweights prior material. No thematic echo or sermon; subtext operates in silence and image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: the courier notices sound, vibration, and the membrane between palm and parcel. Diction is lyric and controlled ("maps bleach into sky," "sugar thread," "lit pear") without register drift. Internal voice modulates with pressure (neck prickling, throat trembling) while maintaining coherence. No head-hopping. Dialogue is minimal and functional. Free indirect reflection anchors in present cues (pendant trembles, ridgeway sings) and tilts present stance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and lengths create visual and auditory texture. High information density: most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "green pouring into the snow like sap returning to old wood" advances atmosphere, stakes, and setting). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor密度 slip: "I introduce myself and the ridge lightens behind me" could integrate the two actions more tightly. Figurative language is consistent and voice-motivated, though density is high throughout without a clear pattern-teaching moment to justify it in an accumulative lens—still, the effect supports the lyric closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of relic courier, sympathetic vibration ritual, and grief-charged wonder feels specific and non-obvious. The mentor's absence as both method and cost is a fresh angle. The ridgeway as instrument and the pendant as tuning device avoid stock metaphysics. Risk-taking in lyric density and the quiet corridor-opening beat heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The ending's understated resonance—planting continuance rather than resolving grief—transforms the courier-delivery premise into something inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The jittery relic courier appears early, makes the key choice to steady hands and tune pitch at the climax, and reflects on the mentor's lesson in the final beats. Present across setup, middle choice (holding pitch), and closure (alone on the path). Specific trait (jitteriness vs. stillness) creates friction and the courier's agency drives the corridor's opening and sealing.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The dragonfly-wing pendant is introduced early, catches starlight and sound, trembles during the ritual, and chooses the pitch—three distinct beats. Its lesson from the mentor shapes method and the courier's solitary listening at the end. Causally active and irreplaceable; removing it would break the sympathetic vibration logic and the mentor's presence-in-absence.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The absent mentor taught the method, gave the pendant, and stands metaphorically "behind my shoulder" at closure. Shapes stakes (the courier works in his absence) and tactics (the old lesson returns as frost to a window). Present in setup, middle (the lesson returns), and closure (loneliness, echo). The absence itself is the cost, though it could press harder as a live choice rather than backdrop.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Extends brief encounters" frames the courier's trade early and the germination sequence is the on-page enactment: time stretches, the corridor opens, the widow and lost man overlap. One major beat depends on this trait. Swappable phrasing (e.g., "prolongs moments") would not fundamentally alter structure, but the specific mechanics (vibrating sympathetically) tie it tightly to the pendant and ridgeway.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Germinate" is signaled early (yew seeds rattle, asking for ground) and the climax is the seeds beginning to germinate "in the warmth of our joined attention," creating the corridor. The yew planted beneath a rock at closure completes the arc. Two beats (mid-ritual, final planting) and the closure image depends on this action. Removing germination would break the story's logic and thematic charge.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"By vibrating sympathetically" is introduced early as the courier's trick, taught by the pendant. The method shapes the middle beat (tuning to the widow's breath and ridge hum) and the corridor's opening. Present in setup, development (choosing pitch), and closure (holding pitch). Specific mechanics (frequency, agreement) are irreplaceable; generic "magic" would flatten the story's tactile logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The aurora-lit ridgeway is anchored early, hums like a tuning fork, answers the courier's breath, lightens green, and sings the low note that enables germination. It is a co-participant in the ritual and the final image ("great heart whose pulse keeps time") charges closure. Three beats and the setting's acoustic properties are causally essential.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Across the fade from memory to myth" is named near the end as the courier's work terrain. It frames the thematic question and the widow's overlap with the lost man enacts the fade. Present in setup (relic delivery, memory-bound objects) and closure (mentor's echo, ground remembering). One clear beat (the corridor as overlap) and lyric resonance at the end, but the timeframe is more thematic backdrop than constraint on tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"To coax wonder from the routine" is stated early and the widow encounter dramatizes it: grief has "chewed the edges off time," yet the courier extends the meeting and the corridor opens. Friction between wanting wonder and the widow's understanding that miracles must not be kept creates cost. Present in setup, tested in the middle (germination), and reweighted at closure (planting continuance). Two beats with visible tradeoffs.</comment>
