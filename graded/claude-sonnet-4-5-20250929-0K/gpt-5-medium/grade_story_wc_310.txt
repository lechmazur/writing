<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrator's decision-making through coin-flipping is internally consistent and embodied ("I steadied my hands," "the old shame of my title fall away"), with contradictory impulses present—shame versus acceptance of randomization as method. Sori is thinly sketched but her "quietly enthusiastic" stance and "hummed beneath her breath" provide texture. The final choice to flip remaining coins and tune to intervals earns the closure without full interiority of stakes-under-pressure. Emotional vocabulary occasionally borders on label-speak ("stellar doubt pooled") but remains mostly concrete.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the dome dilates, the corridor of silence opens, and the pair face "the hush, understanding static bursts as prayer and purpose." Cost is felt—they've enacted a backwards prophecy that compels them to trust blind chance—and the lens (Accumulative/Textural: pattern, prophecy-reversal, density increase) holds cleanly. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive late but are legible by mid-story. One meaningful tightening occurs when the prophecy's middle clause is fulfilled, compelling the distillation; causality runs "uphill" as taught, and the final image reweights the opening vigil.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ambered observatory deck, honeyed dome, and viewport with fossilized-sap gas clouds create vivid setting that constrains choice: reversing gyros to "face a silence with the posture of listening" directly shapes the middle beat. The coins function as micro-setting—"compact planets," "rainbows from worlds no longer in any astronomical address"—and their handling charges multiple moments. Sensory details (copper still, static softening, deck ripening into amber) are selective and purposeful. Spatial choreography remains clear despite the abstract cosmology.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—wavelength alignment with purpose, not faith—is signaled early and tightens once when the backwards prophecy compels them to distill noise and trust the toss. Escalation operates under Accumulative/Textural lens: prophecy clauses narrow options, flipping coins stitches a pattern, tuning gyros to those intervals produces the corridor. Agency is present (they choose to flip, tune, face the hush) with cost legible—enacting a prophecy that already declared their actions. No antagonist, but constraint (backwards causality, "static bursts," prophecy order) applies consistent pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—understanding through surrender to noise, causality running uphill, randomization as method versus abdication—emerges from the backwards prophecy and coin-casting without direct statement. The final image ("understanding static bursts as prayer and purpose") offers a non-literal answer that reweights the opening vigil and method. Subtext operates through gesture (Sori's hum, narrator's laughter at certainty asked of a randomizer) and the amber/fossil motif that recurs with shifting meaning. No label-speak or moralizing in the final beat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single first-person POV with stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature: "cast lots decision maker," "antique as the coins I carried," "letting the snow speak syllables of rearranged time." Diction is elevated but voice-consistent (narrator's archaic title and cosmic context justify register). Psychic distance remains controlled; no head-hopping. Under peak stress (fulfilling prophecy, distilling noise), syntax compresses purposefully ("One by one, I flipped the remaining worlds"). Free indirect style is clean when narrating Sori's presence. Occasional figurative density ("stellar doubt pooled") approaches overwriting but the pattern is taught early and payoff lands.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout ("ambered observatory deck," "honeyed dome," "static bursts," "stellar doubt pooled like black dew") and some metaphors approach mixed territory ("the amber of intention," "snow of the cosmos settle until it clumped into words"). Template cadence appears in the middle third with repeated clause structures ("and I realized," "and I gathered," "and together we faced"). Propulsion is present but momentum drags in exposition-heavy beats explaining the prophecy's order. No paraphrase loops; information density is moderate. Closure beat is figuratively charged but legible.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The backwards prophecy combined with coin-casting as causal method offers a fresh, non-obvious synthesis. The piece commits fully to its premise (causality running uphill, prophecy clauses fulfilled in reverse) and follows implications without retreat. Risk-taking in structure (accumulative/textural, late orientation anchors) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The amber/fossil motif and "quietly enthusiastic" Sori avoid stock SFF tropes. Transformation test passes: plot and arc depend on this exact premise and setting. Proximity check clear; no close echoes of famous lines.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The "cast lots decision maker" is present from the opening, frames the narrator's title and method, drives two beats (laying out coins, flipping to answer prophecy clauses), and the final realization ("I was the cast lots decision maker because causality ran uphill here") charges closure. Cost is visible: accepting randomization as method, shedding "the old shame of my title." High irreplaceability; removing this character role breaks the backwards-prophecy logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The "collection of foreign coins" appears in opening ("rang like compact planets"), is handled in two distinct beats (laying out on felt, flipping to stitch a pattern), and returns in the closure beat ("I gathered the coins, their planetary faces warming my palm"). Coins enable the method (blind toss) and their pattern tunes the gyros. Specificity high: extinct alphabets, square-hole window, featherlight alloy. Cost tied: trusting the toss fulfills prophecy. Removing coins collapses the method and closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The "backwards prophecy" is signaled early ("script that read like footprints pointing toward us from the future"), shapes all tactics (turn dome, distill noise, trust toss in reverse order), drives escalation (fulfilling middle clause compels distillation), and charges closure ("only the enactment remained, matter following the memo"). Cost is conceptual and visible: they are bound to enact what has already been declared. Irreplaceability absolute; swapping for forward prophecy breaks the causal logic and theme.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Quietly enthusiastic" is assigned to Sori early, shown in "tending the receivers as if they were seedlings" and "hummed beneath her breath, a countercurrent of courage." Enables one on-page action (humming that tugs at narrator's reluctance) but lacks visible tradeoff or cost. Functional but near-swappable with "calm determination" or similar trait. Present in closure beat ("Sori nodded") but no causal weight there.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Distill" appears mid-story as prophecy clause ("you will have distilled the noise"), drives the key turn (Sori purges hiss, narrator holds copper still, noise clumps into words), and the method ("not analysis but surrender") is irreplaceable to the theme. Cost present: intimacy with noise that cannot be hurried. Removing this action breaks the prophecy sequence and the path to the corridor. Slight swappability with "filter" or "purify" keeps it sub-8.5.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Understanding static bursts" is the method signaled early ("our method for hearing what remained of intention"), mechanics matter (bleeding receivers, holding copper still, letting snow settle), shapes two attempts (distillation, final tuning), and charges closure ("understanding static bursts as prayer and purpose at last"). Cost visible: surrender, not analysis. Irreplaceability high; removing this method collapses the means to wavelength alignment. Early signal, middle development, and payoff all present.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The "ambered observatory deck" is present in the opening, provides vivid atmosphere ("honeyed dome set adrift"), and the gyros are reversed to turn the deck in a middle beat. The deck dilates at closure to become a lens. Participates in one key choice (turning to face silence) and charges the final image, but could be swapped for another isolated station with minor edits. Present across three beats; moderate irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"After the universe contracts" anchors the timeframe in the opening ("the lights of memory cooled into a hush") and provides thematic weight (post-collapse setting). Does not tighten decisions or tactics on the page; no live clock that alters moves. Adds atmosphere but is largely static. Functional backdrop, not a causal driver. Present early but lacks middle development or closure pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"To wavelength align with purpose" is the dominant stake, signaled early ("trying to wavelength align with purpose, not faith"), tested in two beats (tuning breathing to pulsar metronome, tuning gyros to coin intervals), and closure delivers the alignment ("exhaled a corridor of usable silence"). Friction between wants and costs is present (faith feels "too brittle," randomization carries shame). Cost visible: accepting backwards causality and blind toss. Desire is dramatized through choices.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Stellar doubt" appears explicitly once ("stellar doubt pooled at our feet like black dew") and implicitly colors the tone (uncertainty about method, faith too brittle). Tone modulates slightly—Sori's hum counters doubt, laughter at certainty breaks it—but does not charge the final image, which resolves into alignment and understanding. Coherent but not decisive at closure. Present across the arc but final beat pivots away from doubt into earned purpose.</comment>
