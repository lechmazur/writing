<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is concrete and lyric-specific ("borrowed heartbeat, careful as a stranger picking up a sleeping child"), with embodied emotion through the tremor-matching-droplets moment. The motivation to persuade mirrors is clear and consistent, but the internal contradiction and micro-choices under pressure remain thin—much of the middle unfolds as instruction-reception rather than resistance or cost-laden hesitation. The ending choice (keep singing, walk out steadier) arrives without visible forfeiture of a live alternative path, reading more as completion than renunciation with felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—density builds through layered images (terrace, prism, water-studio, mirrors) and the closure reweights the opening pallor/defeat with possibilities ("kitchen with sun," "window instead of curtains"). Orientation anchors who/where/why by the first two paragraphs; the single-scene frame with interiors-as-transition holds legibly. One meaningful deepening occurs when the glass trembles and shows the dancer's turning, then the narrator's own reaching-out image, reconfiguring the stake from begging instruction to coaxing futures forward. Cost is felt but oblique—no on-page action is foreclosed, only a tonal shift from desperation to steadier breath, which qualifies as Charged Poise under the Accumulative lens but leaves the price largely implied rather than concretely demonstrated.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The echoing terrace, prism parapet, and water-hung studio are vivid and purposefully layered; the droplets function as lantern-guidance, and the mirror becomes a charged object when it shows futures rather than hospital pallor. The body's borrowed heartbeat and tremor anchor micro-setting throughout. However, the studio's hanging water-strands and reflected gardens remain postcard-textured—they enrich atmosphere but do not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome, keeping the score below the 8+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—learning to persuade mirrors to show possibilities—is signaled early and pressure accumulates through the method (coded lullabies), the glass-trembling beat, and the corridor of two-future trees. One meaningful tightening occurs when the narrator must match breath to heartbeat and sing the tune of "stay/if/unless," narrowing from desperation to disciplined coaxing. Agency is visible (singing, breathing) but the escalation remains textural rather than a sharp reversal or trade-off; no live option is visibly sacrificed on the page, and coincidence (the painter appearing, the mirror cooperating) facilitates rather than complicates, keeping cost legibility at mid-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—coaxing futures forward without lying, asking rather than commanding—emerges through the mirror-teaching particulars and the borrowed heartbeat's shy steadiness. The final image ("open the window instead of closing the curtains") offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the premise without moralizing. However, the painter's direct instruction ("Keep singing… the way you ask a friend to stay for tea") edges toward thematic statement rather than pure dramatization, and the "dusky harmony" motif recurs as label more than constraint, preventing full 8+ resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Single-POV with stable first-person and a distinct perceptual signature: "the way rain spills color," "borrowed heartbeat, careful as a stranger," "obedient tilt of twilight." Diction remains consistently lyric-elevated and character-particular under pressure. The painter's dialogue ("Mirrors respect structure… turn reckless when sung to without measure") carries subtext and advances plot. Minor slip: "perceptively calm" appears twice as descriptor rather than enacted behavior, and a few filter phrases ("I sensed," "I understood") slightly dull immediacy, but rhythm control and voice coherence hold throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally, information density is high, and figurative language is controlled and lyric-legible ("narrow as a thread of rain," "borrowed the moment's sigh"). Two paraphrase loops: the "borrowed heartbeat" phrasing recurs six times across the text without always adding new pressure, and "perceptively calm" appears identically twice. Template cadence in the mirror-instruction sequence ("the tune of stay… the measure of if… the sudden drop of unless") reads as list rather than propulsion. No loops touch the closure beat, so the deduction remains moderate; prism/color/harmony motifs are pattern-taught and paid off, avoiding forced recurrence penalties.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—borrowed heart + mirror persuasion + coded lullabies—feels specific and non-obvious, and the mirage-painter conceit offers a fresh angle on healing-after-transplant. The transformation test is marginal: swap "dancer's heart" for any organ and "mirrors" for another metaphor and the emotional arc would function largely unchanged. The "hush before bells ring" timeframe and prism-color guidance add texture but remain ornamental rather than irreplaceable stakes-drivers, and the mirror-teaching beats echo familiar mentor-instruction templates without bold structural risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elusive mirage painter: Setup clear (paragraph 6), Development strong (teaches method, taps glass, leads corridor, instructs tune), Payoff present (watches, smiles, advises "Keep singing"). She enables the method but does not constrain a choice with visible cost—the narrator's decision to sing is facilitated, not complicated, by her presence. Two beats (instruction, watching), but swappable with any mentor figure without major structural shift. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.4, but facilitation without friction and high replaceability limit the score to mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prism parapet after rain: Setup clear (paragraph 7, "followed the prism parapet after rain, each droplet a small lantern"), middle callback (paragraph 35, "prism parapet after rain glowed faintly, like a reef remembering sunlight"), Payoff reprise charges the ending walk-out. Two beats (guidance entry, post-bells glow), lyric resonance reweights the opening "defeat" with the closing "kind of day that could keep us." Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.9, specificity (color-refraction) +0.4, but no causal constraint on choice (ornamental guidance, not obstacle or tool) and swappable with another sensory marker. Strong lyric integration, but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Borrowed heartbeat: Setup immediate (paragraph 3, "Inside me moved a borrowed heartbeat, careful as a stranger"), Development strong (dancer's heart memory, tempo mismatch with drip, learning to listen to each other, paragraphs 11, 20, 26, 37), Payoff decisive (final paragraph, "my borrowed heartbeat, shy but steadier, answered in the same dusky harmony"). Shapes the dominant stake (mirrors catching it mistrustfully, wanting to persuade them) and visible cost (matching breath to heartbeat under instruction). Early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.4, cost connection +0.5. Indispensable—without this exact element the mirrors' mistrust and the steadying closure lose their anchor.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Perceptively calm: Setup (paragraph 10, "voice rose behind me, perceptively calm"), middle label-only repeat (paragraph 32, "perceptively calm again"), no clear action constrained or enabled. Descriptor without dramatized trade-off—the painter's calm is asserted, not tested under pressure. Early signal +0.5, two mentions but both label-only −0.6, no causal pressure or closure linkage. Cap at 4.6 for missing middle development that alters choice; further reduced for ornamental use.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Grace: Setup oblique (paragraph 4, "sometimes my steps tried to remember their grace"; paragraph 24, "moved with grace along a corridor"), Development minimal (the dancer whose heart lives turns "into the light," paragraph 29), no Payoff—grace does not appear in or shape the final image. One beat (dancer's turn), lyric resonance (steps remembering), but swappable with any elegance or competence marker. Early signal +0.4, one beat +0.4, no closure linkage, high replaceability −0.7. Cap at 4.6 for missing closure participation; score reflects functional but replaceable presence.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Coded lullabies in children's songs: Setup clear (paragraph 17, "method was taught through coded lullabies in children's songs"), Development strong (paragraph 27, "I sang softly, through coded lullabies… letting the vowels carry like boats"), Payoff direct (paragraph 37, "I kept the tunes folded into my breath, a pocket atlas guiding me"). Shapes the method and enables the mirror-trembling turn. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.0, specificity (tunes as "pocket atlas") +0.5. Missing one gate (no first-third setup—appears ~halfway), apply setup-missing cap at 4.6, but strong Development and Payoff plus causal pressure and closure linkage push upward within allowed range to mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Echoing terrace in spring: Setup immediate (opening line, "I waited on an echoing terrace in spring"), Development (paragraphs 18–19, studio beneath terrace; paragraph 35, terrace lets go last drops), Payoff (final walk-out references the terrace frame). Three beats (arrival, beneath-studio, departure), early signal +0.8, closure linkage +0.6. However, the terrace functions as frame rather than constraint—no choice is pressured by its spatial properties, and the "echoing" quality remains decorative. Strong setup and reprise, but postcard rather than micro-setting that alters tactics; cap eligible for ~6.5, score reflects solid lyric presence without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Over the hush before bells ring: Setup clear (paragraph 12, "She asked my purpose over the hush before bells ring"), Payoff strong (paragraph 33, "When the bells finally began… our work had been forged over the hush before bells ring"). Two beats (opening frame, closure), lyric resonance that charges the ending. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, but no middle development and no tightening of decisions—time remains atmospheric rather than live clock that alters moves. Cap at 4.6 for missing middle development; lyric reprise allowance lifts score into mid-5s for charged return, but no causal pressure on tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>To persuade mirrors to show possibilities: Setup immediate (paragraph 5, "I had come to learn how to persuade mirrors"), Development strong (paragraphs 13–14, told mirrors show possibilities not defeat; paragraph 27, sing to teach the tune; paragraph 29, glass trembles and shows futures), Payoff decisive (paragraphs 34–36, mirrors answer with possibilities, narrator sees self opening window). Dominant stake, shapes all major beats, visible friction (mirrors "mistrustfully," discipline required), cost (matching breath to heartbeat). Early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.6, cost +0.5. Indispensable—the entire arc depends on this exact motivation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dusky harmony: Setup clear (paragraph 2, "Evening pooled there in dusky harmony"), Payoff direct (final paragraph, "my borrowed heartbeat… answered in the same dusky harmony as the evening that had received me"). Two beats (opening tone, closing echo), lyric reprise reweights the opening unease with steadiness. Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.2. Tone modulates minimally—remains consistently lyric-elevated throughout without sharp pressure shift, reading as static mood rather than dynamic charge. Strong bookend resonance, but no mid-scene modulation or pressure-driven tonal turn; score reflects solid lyric presence without escalation-driven tonal work.</comment>
