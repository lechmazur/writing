<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator's internal landscape is richly textured—"a tide keeps pulling at the ribs where Mira once pressed her night-warm thumbs"—and the final metamorphosis into "a passage, a scent-keeper" carries embodied cost. However, the choice to transform feels inevitable rather than wrestled; the narrator's reluctance dissolves without visible internal friction at the pivot. Mira's agency is thin; she asks the price and places a hand, but her own contradictory impulses never surface, leaving her more catalyst than co-protagonist.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens early—layered images of spices, ash, breath—and the closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): "our bond hums, paradoxically steady, a quiet star threaded through two throats." Cost is legible in the narrator's loss of "plain speech of markets" and the ongoing condition of being a passage. Orientation anchors (orchard, moonlight, narrator's grief) arrive within the first ~100 words. One meaningful deepening occurs when the narrator accepts metamorphosis and opens "a seam beneath the ribs," reweighting the bond from memory to embodied passage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The orchard under permanent moonlight is vividly particular—"apples shining like moons within the moon"—and the conjuring via mortar, spices, and scent creates a micro-setting that constrains the ritual's method. The beasts with "velvet feet" and "throats like bowls" witness and participate, their spatial presence coherent across beats. The fortune slip "between two roots" becomes bark, anchoring the final promise in the physical world and charging the ending image with tactile permanence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reforging the bond with Mira—is signaled immediately and tightens when the narrator realizes "my metamorphosis is the coin." The pressure accumulates through spice-conjuring, the beasts' approach, and Mira's half-formed arrival, then deepens at "Let me in, or let me go," forcing the narrator to choose transformation. The cost is made explicit: loss of plain speech, becoming "more passage," with the price visible in the shift from solitary beast whisperer to shared breath-keeper.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars—grief as "the new arithmetic," love as a "bridge of breaths," metamorphosis as "refraction" rather than subtraction—without moralizing. The fortune slip's revision ("Stay if you become what you both need") reweights the premise non-literally, and the final image of "a quiet star threaded through two throats" offers resonance without thesis. The spice catalogue ("Cumin for laughter, clove for bite") risks inventory, but each carries embodied memory and accumulates pressure toward the conjuring beat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric and image-dense with consistent perceptual signature: "beasts...listening with their rumps and whiskers," "hair a slow flame." Register remains elevated throughout, fitting the fairy-tale frame. However, the prose occasionally plateaus into decorative list-making ("star anise, smoked cardamom, and the last thorn of saffron") without modulating rhythm under peak pressure. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping, and the narrator's interior texture—archaic, precise, grief-soaked—holds across beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; nearly every line advances image, grief, or the conjuring ritual. Figurative language is dense ("wind braids itself with steam," "scent-keeper," "mouth that exhales what the orchard longs to tell the dead") and mostly coherent, though occasional mixed vehicles appear: "reluctant as dawn behind a mountain" pairs oddly with "a heat that is not only memory but instruction." Paraphrase loops are minimal, but template cadence emerges in mid-section beats: "I [verb]…and [noun] [verb]" structures repeat across adjacent lines without taught pattern. No filter-verb stacks or major scaffold, but the sheer density of metaphor in every sentence risks overwriting without clear payoff at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of fairy-tale orchard, phoenix aftermath, beast whispering, and spice-conjuring feels specific and non-obvious, avoiding template grief plots. The narrator's transformation into "a passage" rather than bird or tree offers a fresh inflection on metamorphosis. However, the fortune-cookie frame and "bond beyond death" premise carry recognizable scaffolding from prompt-driven fantasy. The piece commits fully to its lyric mode and cosmic-intimacy register, but the spice catalogue and some motifs (phoenix, moonlight) lean on familiar symbolic shorthand without reweighting them through unexpected cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The beast whisperer identity is established early ("I learned the grammar of breathing with things that do not breathe") and shapes the narrator's method of asking beasts for safe passage. The beasts witness the final transformation and "begin to sing," participating in the climax. However, the narrator's whispering skill does not create a key turn; the beasts observe rather than oppose or enable a choice that alters tactics. The trait enriches texture but remains secondary to the spice-conjuring and metamorphosis.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The fortune slip appears in beat one ("its slip browned like a leaf"), drives the conjuring method in beat two ("Return through what you shared"), is laid "between two roots" as treaty in beat three, revises itself ("Stay if you become what you both need") in beat four, and "becomes sap and climbs" in the final image. It evolves from memory artifact to treaty to transformed anchor, reweighting its meaning across at least four beats and charging the closure with its revision and metamorphosis into bark.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Reluctant metamorphosis is signaled early ("reluctant as dawn") and shapes the narrator's internal friction: "I am reluctant, because my voice is the last map of my mother, my solitude, my ways with beasts." The decision to accept transformation ("I choose the first") is the story's pivot, and the cost—loss of plain speech, becoming a passage—lands on the page. The narrator moves from "reluctant" to "Reluctant no longer" in the final third, and the metamorphosis redefines the bond's terms, making it indispensable to stakes and closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Paradoxically steady" appears three times: the narrator's hands are "paradoxically steady" despite interior tide, Mira's pressure is "paradoxically steady," and the final bond "hums, paradoxically steady." The phrase colors the emotional register and charges the ending image, but it does not constrain an on-page action or alter tactics. It functions as thematic label and tonal anchor rather than causal force, elevating texture without decisively shaping a choice.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Conjuring is the story's central action: the narrator grinds spices, lays the fortune slip, whispers the recipe, and the wind "braids itself with steam and scent" to unfurl Mira's shape. The method drives beats two through four, and the final bond depends on this enacted ritual. Removing conjuring would collapse the plot; the narrator's grief and the bond's reforging are enacted through this exact action, not recounted or substituted.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Scent of rare spices is signaled early ("naming spices with our eyes closed"), drives the conjuring method in beat two ("grinding star anise, smoked cardamom, and the last thorn of saffron"), and becomes the medium of connection in beat three ("the scent-keeper, a mouth that exhales what the orchard longs to tell"). The final stanza reinforces the method: "cardamom loop to wrist, saffron to vein, cumin to the old bruise," making the spice-scent mechanism indispensable to closure and the narrator's new form.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The fairy-tale orchard under permanent moonlight is established in the opening line and provides spatial coherence: the narrator returns, the beasts approach, Mira steps from the perfume, and the final promise is kept "while the moon remains." The setting charges atmosphere and supplies the orchard's rustle and drip as answer to Mira's price question, but it does not pressure a choice or alter tactics. The moonlight is more tonal anchor than constraint; the orchard witnesses rather than complicates.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"After the phoenix rises" frames the opening and returns in line eleven ("After the phoenix rises, the world does not cool; it rearranges"), establishing the story's post-catastrophe moment. The timeframe signals that Mira's death and the narrator's grief are recent, and the permanent moonlight suggests a suspended now. However, the phoenix moment itself is backstory; the on-page action unfolds in an extended ritual present without a ticking clock. The frame sets tone and stakes but does not tighten decisions or tactics within the scene.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The motivation to reforge the bond with Mira is stated in line three and drives every beat: the narrator conjures via shared memories, chooses transformation to accept Mira, and promises to "keep the passage open." The cost—loss of voice, becoming a passage—creates friction with the narrator's reluctance, and the final bond "paradoxically steady" fulfills the motivation while reweighting it from retrieval to mutual metamorphosis. The desire is dramatized in the choice at "Let me in, or let me go" and charged by visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Cosmic intimacy is established early ("cosmic intimacies naming the particular hinge of her smile and the trembling of dusk") and modulates through the piece: grief as "new arithmetic," love as "a quiet star threaded through two throats," the orchard exhaling and counting breaths. The tone remains elevated and image-dense under pressure, fitting the fairy-tale frame and post-phoenix world. The final image—"a quiet star threaded through two throats"—charges closure with the promised tone, making the register coherent and purposeful across beats.</comment>
