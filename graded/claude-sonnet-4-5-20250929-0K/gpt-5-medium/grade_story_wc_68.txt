<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is concrete and distinctive—"the scream has already happened" establishes embodied post-trauma stance. Internal contradiction appears in the tension between the ache to agonize and the choice to act ("rebellion is a lever, not a pose"), and micro-choices under pressure (holding up the cog, leading them through the tunnel) reveal hierarchy of values. The protagonist's competence is balanced with genuine stakes (the flood will kill while they argue), and the final choice to keep the cog demonstrates earned stance crystallization with visible cost (the three men's damp narratives suggest social consequences). Minor: the philosopher-among-rats frame risks pose over pressure, but the on-page hydraulic crisis rescues it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens is Causal with Accumulative texture; the flood timeline creates a because/therefore chain (silt buildup → jammed gates → imminent drowning → the walk through the library → the cog-as-tool climax). Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise: the wheel catches, the sluice opens, and the narrator keeps the cog, crystallizing the stance that "not all rebellion is arson" with visible cost (the three factions' narratives are now "damp," their authority undercut). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. One meaningful tightening occurs when the noon deadline forces the walk, and the cost is legible in the final image of sodden authority and retained tool. The piece teaches its accumulative pattern early (sedimentary layers, collecting shards) and pays it off at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The sewer-and-library setting constrains choice throughout: the chalk marks guide tactics, the sluice gates supply the emergency, and the cog-in-ratchet solution depends on the built environment. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful—"algae," "silt humps," "salt writes its own index"—and filtered through the narrator's archaeological gaze. Spatial choreography is clear (tunnel → library layers → old dock → emergency wheel), and the final beat uses setting to charge the image (water kissing shins, pressure sighing outward). The micro-setting (the drowned library, the emergency wheel) does the work of larger world-building at this length, satisfying the 9+ test without sprawl.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early (preserving methods versus the factions' narrative wars) and tightens when the noon flood forces a choice: parade the cog or save lives. The protagonist's agency drives the escalation—walking them out, using the cog as tool, retaining it after proving its worth. The reversal at the sluice (the cog fits, the wheel catches) narrows options and forecloses the factions' claim with visible cost (they speak softly, their authority damp). The flood is a credible constraint, and the resolution avoids luck: the narrator's months of chalk marks and hydraulic knowledge earn the save. No explicit antagonist, but the competing factions and the silt provide coherent pressure under a Situational lens accent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: methods versus narratives, precision versus certainty, rebellion as lever versus pose. The cog is not merely symbolic—it performs its function on the page and thereby answers the thematic question without stating a moral. Subtext operates in gesture (holding up the cog, walking without explanation) and image (the wheel catching "like a thought snapping into place"). The final choice to keep the cog offers a resonant, non-literal answer: preservation is action, not worship. The piece resists tidy morals—"not all rebellion is arson" implies cost and selectivity—and the drowned library's sedimentary layers charge the ending with accumulated weight. Minor thematic echo risk in "stubborn arithmetic," but it's grounded in dramatized action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled: clipped declaratives ("It is not rebellion to fix what can still work"), metaphoric precision ("a tooth from time itself"), and a perceptual signature that notices sedimentary layers and chalk marks. POV distance is stable—first-person interiority filters all observation through the narrator's post-trauma calm and hydraulic expertise. Diction remains within the focalizer's lexicon (philosopher-mechanic hybrid) with purposeful elevation ("ancient argument," "fossilized petition") that feels voice-motivated rather than ornamental. Rhythm modulates with pressure: longer, layered sentences in the library walk compress to short declaratives at the wheel ("The wheel caught"). No dialogue, so that bullet set is not assessed. Free indirect style is clean, and no head-hopping occurs.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high—most lines do double work (e.g., "the salt writes its own index" advances setting, theme, and tone). No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs touch the closure beat. Figurative language is controlled and grounded ("silt humps rose like sleeping whales," "an artery the city had forgotten"), with no mixed metaphors. Minor density slip in the opening third: "I am a wannabe philosopher…I fail upward into questions" risks pose over propulsion, and "They call me rationally rebellious as an insult, but I treat it like a set of clean tools" flirts with thesis statement. The closure image ("a body finding its lungs," the wheel catching) is vivid and carries no artifact. Overall momentum strong, but early scaffold prevents 8.5+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The premise—philosopher-mechanic in drowned library preserving methods against narrative factions—synthesizes post-apocalyptic setting with epistemological stakes in a fresh way. The cog-as-tool and sedimentary-layer motifs avoid cliché through specific, grounded use (chalk marks, barnacled gears, the ratchet fit). Tropes (sunken city, plague aftermath, competing factions) are transformed via the narrator's hydraulic expertise and the choice to value function over symbol. The turn at the sluice feels earned rather than convenient. Minor swappability: the factions (Tide-Priests, Cleaners, Engineers) risk stock-three-ways framing, though their damp retreat at the end personalizes them. The piece commits fully to its premise and follows implications without retreat, but the philosopher-in-sewer frame and "rationally rebellious" label trend toward template; saved by execution specificity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The wannabe philosopher is present throughout and makes key choices: listening to the factions, leading them through the library, using the cog at the sluice, and keeping it afterward. The character's observational stance (collecting methods, reading waterlines) directly enables the climactic action. The decision to walk them out rather than agonize (lines: "rebellion is a lever, not a pose") is a visible turn that alters tactics and drives the closure. Costs are visible: social friction with the factions, retention of the cog despite their claims. The trait "wannabe" signals humility but risks undercutting agency; the on-page hydraulic mastery rescues it. All three gates met; strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The seafarer's chronometer cog appears in setup (dredgers bring it), development (held up to the factions as bait and proof), and payoff (wedged into the ratchet, then kept). Its specific properties matter: it's a precision tool ("a tooth from time itself"), and its fit into the emergency wheel is the story's mechanical hinge. The cog's meaning reweights across beats—from trinket to method to lever to kept proof—charging the closure when the narrator retains it ("because it had proven itself"). Visible cost: the factions' claims are denied. The object is indispensable; no generic gear would carry the thematic and mechanical weight. Early signal, two-plus beats, causal pressure, closure linkage, and irreplaceability all present.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Competing narratives (Tide-Priests' baptism, Cleaners' scrubbing, Engineers' prototypes) are signaled early and shape the middle beat: the three men arrive to claim the cog for their differing symbolic uses. The narrator's choice to ignore their narratives and act on hydraulic fact is the story's central tactic. The concept pressures the protagonist ("the healthiest disease is certainty") and forecloses paths at closure—by proving methods over stories, the narrator dampens their authority. The element could be more causally active; the factions are present but passive during the flood. Setup and payoff strong; middle development is thematic rather than tactical. Closure linkage is solid but oblique (their "damp narratives").</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Rationally rebellious" is labeled early ("They call me…I treat it like a set of clean tools") and demonstrated in the choice to bypass argument and act ("rebellion is a lever, not a pose"). It enables the walk through the library and the decision to use the cog practically rather than symbolically. Cost is present but light: the factions' disappointment. The trait risks being told rather than solely shown—"rationally rebellious" is an epithet—but the on-page actions (months of chalk marks, ignoring their debate, keeping the cog) embody it. Setup clear, development visible in one key choice, payoff implicit in the retention. Swappability moderate; "pragmatic rebel" or "methodical dissenter" could substitute with minor edits. Mid-band: functional and present, not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Agonize" appears once, explicitly: "the old ache rise…the reflex to agonize over the least harmful lie." The moment is a hinge—the narrator refuses to agonize and instead acts, walking them out—but the action itself (leading, using the cog) does the causal work. The verb "agonize" is more a renounced impulse than a performed major turn. It primes the choice but is not the choice. Setup clear (the ache is named), development is the refusal (one beat), and payoff is oblique (the kept cog suggests no further agonizing). Replaceable with minor edits: "hesitate," "debate internally," "weigh options." One causal contribution, but not multi-beat or indispensable. Mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Through sedimentary layers" is both literal (the walk through the drowned library's strata: pamphlets → treaties → clay) and thematic (methods sleep like seeds in silt). The means is signaled early ("I move through sedimentary layers"), performed in the middle beat (the descent with the three men), and pays off when the emergency dock—accessed via those layers—supplies the sluice and cog-ratchet solution. Mechanics matter: the route is the rescue. The method also charges the closure image ("an ancient method stood up in a new century"). Setup, development, and payoff all present; causal pressure strong. Irreplaceability high: no other means (direct access, surface route) would carry the thematic and spatial weight. Minor: the method is also motif, so line between "how" and "symbol" blurs, but function dominates.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sunken city ruins supply the drowned library, the silt-jammed sluice gates, the emergency dock, and the chalk-marked walls—all of which constrain and enable choices. The setting pressures the protagonist (lower quarters will flood) and provides the tools (the old dock artery, the emergency wheel). Micro-setting details (the mussel shelf, the barnacled gears, the silt humps) are handled on the page and alter tactics. The ruins are not postcard; they are a lived-in workspace and a hydraulic problem. Setup early, development continuous, payoff strong (the wheel and sluice are the climax). The setting is indispensable; a dry or intact city would break the story's logic. High causal pressure, closure linkage, and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"After the plague ends" anchors the timeframe and motivates the competing narratives (post-crisis rebuilding). It shapes backstory (the ledger of the plague dead) and primes the current stakes (certainty as disease). The element appears in setup and thematic echoes but does not tighten decisions on the page—the noon flood deadline does that work. The plague aftermath enables the sunken city but is not causally active in the present beats. Setup clear, development is thematic, payoff oblique (the narrator's methods versus post-plague narratives). Swappability moderate: "after the war," "after the flood," or any societal collapse could substitute with minor edits. Functional but not indispensable; the flood clock matters more than the plague clock.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The motivation to preserve ancient methods is signaled early ("it is respect for the dead that we preserve their methods"), demonstrated continuously (collecting gears, rebuilding the tide clock, reading waterlines), and drives the climactic choice to keep the cog. The desire is dramatized and conflicted: the narrator must choose between parade/purity/prototype and functional preservation, then prove the method's worth under time pressure. Costs are visible—social friction, the ache to agonize—and the final retention forecloses the factions' symbolic claims. The motivation shapes every beat and charges the closure ("an ancient method stood up in a new century"). Setup early, development multi-beat, payoff decisive. High causal pressure, closure linkage, and felt cost. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Abrasive calm is established in the opening lines ("the scream has already happened…someone has to sift…without flinching") and maintained through the crisis: clipped declaratives, metaphoric precision, no panic. The tone modulates slightly under pressure—sentences shorten at the sluice, rhythm tightens—but the narrator's post-trauma equipoise holds. The tone charges the final image: "the wheel caught like a thought snapping into place" is calm-amid-crisis made syntax. Coherent through all turns, with purposeful cadence shift at closure. The tone is voice-constitutive and irreplaceable; a panicked or sentimental narrator would break the story's logic. Setup immediate, development continuous, payoff in rhythm and word choice. High integration, no slips.</comment>
