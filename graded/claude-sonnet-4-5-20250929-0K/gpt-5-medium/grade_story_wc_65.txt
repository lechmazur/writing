<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interior voice is consistent and specific—lyric, reflective, charged with professional idiom ("ignorance cartographer," "sustaining transformation"). Embodied emotion appears sporadically (hand trembles, breath at the window), but most pressure is mediated through abstract modeling rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final choice to draw feels pre-decided rather than forged under pressure; the narrator rehearses rationale without visible struggle that would elevate agency. Micro-choices exist (placing hinges, drafting the legend) but the path feels deliberative rather than agonized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the narrator layers modeling iterations, images (kingfisher, ice, hinges), and reflective blocks to reweight the dominant stake—designing an archive that balances innovation and constraint. Orientation anchors arrive within the first ~80 words (obsidian spire, frozen lake, tonight). The closure unit is Charged Poise: the final lines crystallize the mandate ("must prevail without vanquishing, must invite without drowning, must continue") and the poised moment before inscription, but the cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page. The accumulative design coheres but the ending tilts toward declaration rather than image that undeniably reconfigures prior material.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The spire, frozen lake, and prism lamp anchor spatial and atmospheric specificity; the kingfisher's dive through the one unfrozen oval offers a vivid micro-setting detail that charges the narrator's insight ("reading fractures"). Sensory selection reflects professional focus (tiles, threads, beads, quill nib) and the environment subtly constrains choice—cold, isolation, the hum of trapped heat. The final image's reference to "ice" and "page waits like ice" ties setting to closure image, satisfying the Q3 9+ gate. Minor deduction: occupational detail (predictive modeling mechanics) remains abstract rather than tactile.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: seed innovation within a constraint to prevent "sprawl" and "flatten dwellings." The narrator pursues this through modeling iterations that narrow options (tower, burrow, canal → hinges), constituting one meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens. Agency is present in micro-decisions (placing hinges, drafting workshop constraints), and the final lines articulate the reweighted calculus. Cost is conceptual—responsibility, fear of misuse—but not embodied in a forfeited path or visible sacrifice on the page. No antagonist required, but the pressure never forces a trade-off that alters the narrator's prior stance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: the canal/hinge/workshop design enacts "sustaining transformation" through constraints that invite rather than police. The kingfisher image—finding the unfrozen oval, reading fractures—functions as a non-literal answer to the central question without overt moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture (the quill waits, hand trembles) and image (ice groaning, thaw rehearsing). Minor deduction: the final paragraph articulates the thematic calculus ("prevail without vanquishing") more directly than an image alone would, trending toward statement rather than pure resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: the narrator notices in terms of cartography, voids, and patterns ("coastlines of questions," "frost along a window"). Diction is elevated and consistent, rhythmically controlled ("knife-bright air," "streak of zinging teal"). Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Psychic distance remains stable; purposeful compression ("Not numbers alone, but narratives tested") fits the reflective mode. Minor slip: a few lines approach therapy-speak ("fear that the hinges will be misused") but recover quickly with concrete modeling. No dialogue to judge. The voice under pressure remains coherent and singular.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings show range. Information density is high in modeling passages ("tiles, threads, and glass beads of probability") and imagery (kingfisher, prism lamp). No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Minor deductions: filter-verb clusters in reflective blocks ("I see the market I never visit, the language I never learned, the fear") slightly dull immediacy, and a few lines lean toward stock metaphor ("rivers of flight," "ocean of deliberate blankness"). The final beat is clean and propulsive, preserving closure clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The premise—cartographer of ignorance designing a future archive through predictive modeling—offers a fresh angle. The canal/hinge/workshop synthesis feels specific rather than generic, and the kingfisher image provides a non-obvious teaching moment. Risk-taking is present in the accumulative, reflection-led structure. Minor deduction: the central conceit leans on familiar metaphors (mapping the unmapped, seeding innovation) without fully transforming them through lived detail or surprising moral calculus. The transformation test passes (the specifics matter), but the emotional arc could belong to many reflective planners.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The ignorance cartographer frames the narrator's identity and professional stance from line 3, and the role shapes the modeling process (charting voids, naming coastlines). The narrator's choices—selecting the canal design, placing hinges, drafting workshop constraints—create key turns in the modeling sequence. The final beat reaffirms the role ("what I will draw must prevail without vanquishing"), linking identity to closure. Setup and Development gates clear; Payoff gate is met through the poised moment before drawing. Minor friction: the cartographer identity is more label than embodied constraint; the modeling feels like planning rather than active cartography under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The kingfisher feather quill nib appears early ("glints in blue, patient as a winter star") and returns at the end ("Now the nib asks for action," "I lift the kingfisher feather quill nib, and the page waits like ice"). The object's weight and origin ("remembers rivers") are noted, and it anchors the final poised moment. Setup and Payoff gates clear. Missing Development gate: the quill is described but not handled or used in a middle beat that alters tactics. The object remains largely symbolic rather than actively constraining choice.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Writing the future" is signaled in line 9 and directly shapes stakes: the narrator must decide what to inscribe before pen meets page. The concept drives the modeling sequence (testing scenarios, drafting the legend, mapping ignorance) and charges the final image ("the page waits like ice"). Setup, Development, and Payoff gates all clear. The concept is not merely thematic decoration; it defines the dominant stake and the poised closure moment. Minor friction: the concept leans abstract; the "writing" remains metaphorical planning rather than physical inscription that changes an on-page situation.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Groundedly imaginative" is invoked in line 8 ("the moment requires a slower wingbeat, groundedly imaginative, not merely decorative") and echoes in the final design choice—canal over tower or burrow, hinges that bend rather than scold. Setup gate marginal (late first third); Development gate present (the canal choice reflects the trait); Payoff gate absent (the trait is not named or visibly reweighted at the end). The trait constrains method but does not visibly shape a single high-cost choice. Swappability moderate; "pragmatic" or "rooted" could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Prevail" appears in the kingfisher observation ("The bird knows how to prevail, not by battering ice, but by reading fractures") and in the final lines ("What I will draw must prevail without vanquishing"). Setup via kingfisher beat (~midpoint); Payoff clear in the closing articulation. Missing strong Development gate: no middle choice explicitly tests "prevailing" as a tactic. The action is more conceptual frame than physical event; it could be replaced with "endure" or "succeed" with modest rephrasing. The kingfisher image gives it specificity, but the action remains largely metaphorical.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Predictive modeling" is named in line 19 and enacted through tiles, threads, beads, and scenario testing (tower, burrow, canal options; modeling greed and remedy). Setup and Development gates clear; the method shapes the middle sequence and narrows options. Payoff gate present: the modeling informs the final design and the poised moment ("the future is already rearranging its furniture"). The method is not merely backdrop; it structures the narrator's approach and enables the canal choice. Minor friction: the mechanics remain somewhat abstract; we see results (beads migrate, threads tug) more than the modeling process under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The obsidian spire and frozen lake anchor orientation in line 1 and recur (spire hums with heat, ice groans, kingfisher skates across ice). Setup gate clear. Development gate marginal: the environment supplies atmosphere and the kingfisher's unfrozen oval, but does not directly constrain a narrator choice. Payoff gate weak: the final image invokes ice ("page waits like ice") but the spire itself disappears from the closing beat. The setting provides vivid backdrop and one teaching image (kingfisher) but does not pressure tactics. Swappability moderate; another isolated, cold locale could serve similar atmospheric function.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Before the pen meets the blank page" is announced in line 5 ("Tonight, before the pen meets the blank page, I must decide a continent") and frames the entire modeling sequence as preparatory. The timeframe creates urgency—decision must arrive by end of this session—and the final beat delivers the threshold moment ("Now the nib asks for action"). Setup, Development, and Payoff gates all clear. Minor friction: the clock is declared but not visibly ticking; no intermediate time pressure tightens tactics. The timeframe structures the piece but does not escalate within the sequence.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To seed innovation within a constraint" is stated in line 10 and drives the dominant stake: the Commission's mandate and the narrator's design problem. The motivation shapes every modeling iteration (fear of sprawl, choosing canal over tower, posting constraints at workshop doors). Setup, Development, and Payoff gates all clear. The desire is dramatized through choices and the final articulation of design principles. Minor friction: the motivation is more intellectual puzzle than visceral want; competing desires (fear versus hope) are noted but not embodied in a conflicted choice that exacts visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Sustaining transformation" is named in line 13 ("Sustaining transformation is a practice of care, not a bonfire with applause") and recurs in line 29 ("a hinge is a promise to move and to return, sustaining transformation") and implicitly in the final beat ("transformation may run, but it endures when it learns to walk"). Setup and Payoff gates clear. The tone is coherent—reflective, deliberate, cautiously hopeful—and modulates subtly as the narrator moves from mapping ignorance to poised action. Minor friction: the tone is more stable than dynamically charged; it does not shift sharply under pressure, and the final image maintains the same contemplative register rather than crystallizing a felt emotional cost.</comment>
