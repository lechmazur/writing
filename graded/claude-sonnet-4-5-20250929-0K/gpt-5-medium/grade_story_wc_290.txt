<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The claustrophobic explorer's interiority is embodied through breath-counting and chest tightness, and the compass point becomes a concrete anchor for her grandmother's influence. The trait "prudently adventurous" generates visible tactics (chalk, exit strategy) that shape on-page choices. However, the motivational arc—recovering the key to access the Observatory—proceeds without meaningful internal conflict or contradiction; the protagonist never wavers or pays a psychological price that forecloses an alternative path. The final choice to thread the key and walk toward the Observatory feels like fulfillment of an established plan rather than a decision that alters stance under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its pattern early—lyric compression, metaphor-dense narration, spatial poetics—and the closure lands as Charged Poise: the protagonist sets the key, the door sighs open, and the telescope reveals the mutiny as "a hunger to be heard," reweighting the spatial conflict without requiring a decisive external change. Orientation anchors (who, shadowed nexus, fallow period) arrive within the first 120 words. One meaningful deepening occurs when the organ's reverberation "transfixes" the triangle and the alleys "sit straighter," tightening spatial agency. Cost is conceptual and felt: the protagonist defies the Council and commits to "wistful rebellion," and the final image of the aligned cobbles registers as a truce whose price is the protagonist's ongoing defiance. The accumulation of metaphor and the reliance on implied spatial rules create minor friction, but the closure effect is legible and resonant.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The shadowed nexus, fountain, church organ, and Observatory are spatially coherent and each location constrains a choice: the nexus requires the sonic intervention, the fountain yields the key, the Observatory holds the lock. The compass point functions as micro-setting, its steel tip used twice (pricking the triangle, glinting "like a witness") to anchor the protagonist's spatial negotiation. Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered ("Cold bit until I felt metal," "air narrowed twice"). The final image—telescope pointed "down the city's throat"—charges the closure by converting the setting into an instrument of listening, directly supporting the thematic turn. The lyric density occasionally obscures exact spatial choreography (e.g., the sexton's position, the precise layout of five alleys), but purposeful compression is taught early and the effect remains legible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: recover the key to unlock the Observatory and understand the spatial mutiny. The protagonist's agency is clear—she signals the sexton, uses the compass point to "prick a triangle," breathes to "invent a larger room," and retrieves the key—and these actions narrow options by committing her to defiance of the Council. One meaningful tightening occurs when the alleys shift and the protagonist's claustrophobia rises ("the old tightness... behind my ribs"), forcing her to use breath and geometry to carve navigable space. The cost is conceptual: the protagonist accepts the role of "wistful rebellion" and the Observatory's revelatory price. However, the escalation is smooth rather than sharp; no reversal threatens failure, and coincidence (the sexton's favor, the key's exact location in the silt) enables success without forcing a trade-off or foreclosing an alternative path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the accumulation of spatial imagery: rooms, breath, doors, locked spaces, and the recurring motif of the compass point as a tool to "hold [maps] to their word." The final image—the telescope aimed at the plaza, cobbles aligning "like a held note," and the mutiny reframed as "a hunger to be heard"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without stating a moral. The protagonist's arc (claustrophobic explorer who negotiates space through sound and geometry) is inextricable from the thematic question of whether spatial agency can be reclaimed through treaty rather than conquest. The phrase "wistful rebellion is a promise to the past that the future will be braver" risks thematic echo but is earned by the protagonist's on-page choices and the final act of threading the key. Minor abstraction ("space itself has been making choices") and one near-thesis statement ("the trick was not to conquer the mutiny but to make it remember our treaties") prevent entry into the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct and controlled: lyric compression, metaphor-dense syntax ("night spread a thinning velvet," "alleys shifted like sleepers turning"), and a stable first-person present anchored in the protagonist's embodied perception. Psychic distance remains consistent; no head-hopping. The perceptual signature—rooms, breath, geometry, sound—is character-specific and filters all observation. However, the prose periodically drifts into elevated diction that strains the POV's plausible lexicon mid-crisis: "elaborate shrugs," "spatial mutiny," "treaties," "wistful rebellion" read as authorial rather than the focalizer's idiom under pressure. The final third maintains voice coherence, and the closing image ("the mutiny was not refusal, only a hunger to be heard") integrates metaphor with character stance. Minor register drift and one instance of convenient omniscience ("the key was thrown into the basin to save a love or doom a dynasty, depending on the teller") keep the score below 7.5.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout, with metaphors in nearly every sentence of high-pressure beats ("alleys shifted like sleepers turning," "sound spearing my little geometry," "the organ's reverberation reached... like a hand on my shoulder"). While the pattern is taught early and voice-motivated, the accumulation risks overwriting: mixed vehicles ("pipes inhaled, then exhaled," "spaces were people too") and synonym churn ("treaty," "mutiny," "cease-fire," "rebellion") create texture but dull propulsion in the middle third. Two paraphrase loops: "I felt the old tightness rise behind my ribs" / "my lungs fluttered" and "the alleys shifted... offended but listening" / "the alleys sat straighter" restate pressure without adding new information. Template cadence appears in three consecutive sentences beginning with "I" + past-tense verb in the climax paragraph. Information density is strong in the final third, where each line advances the spatial negotiation and thematic closure. No grammatical errors; pronoun references are clear. Apply −0.6 for patterned artifacts (paraphrase loops, template stems, figurative density in peak beats without payoff) and −0.3 for mixed metaphors.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis—claustrophobic explorer negotiating spatial autonomy through sound geometry and a retrieved key—is specific and non-obvious. The conceit of "spatial mutiny" and the use of a church organ to "call" the city into compliance transform familiar quest structure through particular world logic and sensory detail. The final turn (telescope pointed inward, mutiny reframed as hunger) feels earned in hindsight and avoids the mechanical satisfaction of unlocking a door to gain knowledge. However, the core premise (recover lost artifact to access forbidden knowledge) is a widely used template, and the emotional arc (defiant protagonist succeeds against institutional prohibition) does not subvert or complicate genre expectations. The protagonist's claustrophobia is invoked but never constrains a choice or creates friction; "prudently adventurous" generates tactics but no visible risk or error. The piece commits to its lyric-spatial vision without retreat, and the Observatory's telescope offers a fresh inflection. Within-band adjustment: +0.2 for risk-taking in voice and structure that heightens thematic stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The claustrophobic explorer trait is present by the opening line and shapes two on-page choices: breathing slower to "invent a larger room" when the air narrows, and the decision to keep walking despite tightness rising behind her ribs. The trait is embodied rather than label-only, and it reappears at a middle pressure point when "the air narrowed twice and my lungs fluttered." However, the claustrophobia does not constrain a tactic or force a trade-off; the protagonist always succeeds in managing it without visible cost. The trait is not causally active in the closure beat (the Observatory entry) and does not shape the final image. Early signal +0.5, two distinct beats +0.9, embodied constraint +0.4, but no closure linkage or cost connection: net ~5.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The compass point is introduced early ("From my pocket I drew the blueprint drafting compass point") and used in two distinct beats: pricking the triangle at the fountain to anchor the sonic geometry, and glittering "like a witness" when the air narrows, reassuring the protagonist. It returns in the middle third when the protagonist places "chalk commas under arches" and "pricked a coping stone to remind the map it was being read." The object's function—holding maps "to their word"—directly enables the spatial negotiation and is tied to the grandmother's belief system, charging its use with thematic weight. However, the compass point does not appear in or shape the closure beat (the key insertion and telescope reveal), limiting its final impact. Early signal +0.6, three distinct beats +1.4, causal pressure +0.8, specificity +0.5, but no closure linkage: net ~7.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The spatial mutiny is introduced in the first third ("Space itself has been making choices without us, a slow spatial mutiny that turns corridors into cul-de-sacs") and directly shapes the protagonist's tactics: she must use the organ's reverberation to make the alleys "remember our treaties" and "sit straighter." The mutiny is the obstacle that requires the sonic intervention and the geometric anchoring, and it is causally active in the middle beat when "the alleys shifted like sleepers turning, offended but listening." The closure reweights the mutiny from refusal to "a hunger to be heard," reframing the conflict and charging the final image. Early signal +0.6, two distinct beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.5: net ~6.4.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The attribute "prudently adventurous" is present by the second paragraph ("I am prudently adventurous, which means I bring chalk, patience, and an exit strategy, yet I go where I am told not to") and generates visible tactics: chalk for marking, the compass point for anchoring, and the favor from the sexton. The trait constrains the protagonist's approach (she does not rush or improvise recklessly) and is reinforced in the final third when she "moved prudently adventurous through the returning alleys, placing chalk commas." However, the trait does not create friction or force a trade-off; the protagonist's caution never conflicts with her adventurousness or imposes a cost. It is not causally active in the closure beat. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, enables tactics +0.6, but label-heavy and no cost: apply −0.4 for label-only use, net ~5.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The action "transfix" appears in the middle beat: "When the next chord descended, I let it transfix the triangle, sound spearing my little geometry until the alleys sat straighter." This moment is the hinge that enables the protagonist to navigate the nexus; without it, the alleys remain hostile. The term is used once more metaphorically in the final third, but the causal work is concentrated in the single mid-scene application. The action is specific and irreplaceable (substituting "anchor" or "hold" would lose the image of sound as a piercing force), and it directly enables the key retrieval. However, it does not recur at closure or shape the final image. Early signal (mid-scene, ~40% mark) −0.2, one distinct beat +0.4, causal pressure +1.4, specificity +0.6, but no closure linkage: net ~6.7.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The method—using the church organ's reverberation—is introduced early ("We had discovered that the city would listen if called through the reverberation of a lonely church organ") and is causally active in three beats: the protagonist signals the sexton, the first chord makes the alleys shift, and the sexton changes stops to "permit our exit." The method's mechanics matter: the organ's "low wave" and "higher breath" are distinct interventions that shape spatial outcomes, and the final reassurance ("the organ sent another long reassurance that uncreased the night") enables the protagonist to manage claustrophobia. The method is tied to a prior discovery (treaty with the city) and recurs in the closure paragraph when "the organ's reverberation reached even here like a hand on my shoulder," charging the telescope moment. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.6: net ~7.8.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The shadowed nexus under starlight is introduced in the opening line and is the spatial locus of the first major action: the protagonist paces the fountain "at the intersection where five alleys pretended to meet." The setting pressures the choice to use the organ and provides the resource (the fountain with silt) that yields the key. The starlight recurs at closure when "the stars tilted like eavesdroppers," framing the Observatory entry. The nexus is not merely postcard description; its spatial ambiguity (alleys that "pretend to meet") is the problem the protagonist must solve. However, the setting does not evolve causally or impose a constraint in the final beat. Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure reprise +0.8, but no micro-setting constraint in the ending: net ~6.1.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The fallow period is mentioned in the opening third ("They call this season the fallow period... the fields rest while the city pretends to") and provides atmospheric context: rest, dormancy, pretense. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or alter tactics; the protagonist's actions are not time-bound, and the fallow period is not invoked again or linked to the spatial mutiny or the Observatory's accessibility. The element is present and thematically consonant (rest/stasis vs. spatial agency) but functionally ornamental. Present but no causal work: apply −0.8 for ornamental use, cap at 3.2 per swappability (any season could serve the same atmospheric role).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation to uncover the vital key is introduced early ("I came to uncover a vital key lost to time") and drives every on-page action: pacing the nexus, signaling the sexton, pricking the triangle, reaching into the silt, and threading the key onto the cord. The desire is dramatized through physical action and spatial negotiation, not merely told. The middle beat—kneeling and reaching into the silt, feeling "cold bit until I felt metal"—enacts the goal under pressure. The closure is the fulfillment of this motivation: the key unlocks the Observatory and enables the telescope's revelation. The want does not conflict with a competing need or impose a visible cost (the protagonist never hesitates or sacrifices an alternative), preventing entry into the 8+ band. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.6, closure linkage +1.6, but no friction or cost: net ~7.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The tone "wistful rebellion" is articulated mid-story ("wistful rebellion is a promise to the past that the future will be braver") and is embodied in the protagonist's defiance of the Council, the threading of the key, and the walk toward the Observatory "through the returning alleys." The tone modulates coherently: wistfulness appears in the memory of the grandmother and the cartographer, rebellion in the decision to keep the key visible and to unlock the barred Observatory. The final image—the mutiny reframed as "a hunger to be heard" and the protagonist's stance as listener rather than conqueror—charges the tone with thematic resonance. However, the explicit articulation of "wistful rebellion" as a thesis statement in the middle third risks thematic echo and reduces subtextual integration. Early signal +0.5 (implicit in opening, explicit mid-scene), coherent modulation +0.8, closure charge +1.2, specificity +0.5, but apply −0.4 for one thematic echo: net ~6.8.</comment>
