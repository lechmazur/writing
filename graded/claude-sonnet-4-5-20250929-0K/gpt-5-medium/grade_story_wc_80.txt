<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The surveyor's interiority is richly embodied—"boots remembering former thresholds," "firmness is how I hold the trembling"—and the paradox of "Stoically Sensitive" generates genuine tension between restraint and emotional investment. The motivation to "touch what sank and catalog the way emptiness braids itself through what remains" drives concrete micro-choices: wresting the door, placing notes, copying names. Minor deduction: the character's internal contradictions are articulated more than enacted under pressure; the piece leans toward contemplation rather than dilemma.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors clearly (surveyor, submerged pavilion, post-drawbridge-rise ritual). The closure—"I was here not to repair the past but to map its living gaps, and to love them until they answer"—is a Conceptual Repricing that reweights the surveyor's task from restoration to witness-bearing, with felt cost in the solitary, unglamorous repetition. One meaningful deepening occurs when the note-placing shifts from measurement to custody ("wrestling is not only for rage, it is for custody and for care"). Deduction: the cost remains oblique and emotional rather than a visible forfeiture or tactical constraint on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The submerged pavilion is rendered with vivid, selective detail—"lace of arches veiled by green water," "glass cabinet asleep in silt"—and the setting constrains access (service door sealed for twenty years, water depth marked for tomorrow). The antique inkwell and tripod are handled on the page and the waterline itself is a recurring spatial anchor. The final image—"drawbridge sleep like a huge eyelid, and the city breathe through its missing teeth"—charges the setting with thematic weight. Slight deduction for some decorative catalog ("arrows, dates, a crown of rust") that does not alter a choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—to witness and map abandonment rather than restore—is signaled early and sharpens through the surveyor's ritual: wresting the door, placing notes, copying names from the water-bitten program. One meaningful tightening occurs when the surveyor rejects rescue or recognition ("I do not wait for rescue or recognition; I wait for the moment when what is gone accepts my witness without shame"), narrowing the task to solitary testimony. Deduction: no visible cost or trade-off; the surveyor completes each step without opposition, making escalation more rhythmic than pressured.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—witness as love, restraint as flame—emerges organically from the surveyor's method and the recurring "Interlaced absence" / "Hushed Blaze" motifs. The final slip ("to map its living gaps, and to love them until they answer") offers a non-literal answer to the question of how to honor what is lost, reweighting prior measurement as devotion. The piece resists easy morals and the "Hushed blaze" heading models restraint as intensity. Minor note: "Hushed Blaze" is articulated rather than enacted at peak pressure, edging toward statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature—"I map their fall as if mapping vanished laughter," "rust sealed shut for twenty years"—and the diction remains high-lyric but internally consistent. The compressed, appositive-heavy syntax ("a lace of arches veiled by green water, a ballroom for weeds and the rinse of late light") reflects the surveyor's precise, recursive attention. No dialogue; no head-hopping. Minor deduction: some lines approach overwriting ("the bridge's raised spine as a timeline on which I move backward") without fully serving pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully—short declaratives ("I did not come merely to measure") anchor longer appositive cascades—and information density is high. Several lines do multiple jobs: "Its lid snaps like a small lighthouse shutting its eye, and I feel the hush between clicks as a charted current" advances atmosphere, character sensibility, and the inkwell's thematic role. Deductions: "Stoically Sensitive" and "Interlaced absence" are capitalized and repeated label-fashion (−0.3); a few phrases border purple without added clarity ("moon misplace itself in a glass, half in jest, half in dread"). No paraphrase loops or major scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of lyric meditation, surveyor's ritual, and elegy for drowned architecture is specific and non-obvious. The framing—notes hidden in foundation repairs as a form of love—transforms the familiar "abandoned place" trope through occupational detail and the "Hushed blaze" paradox. Risk-taking in the recursive, appositive-heavy style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Minor hedge: the surveyor's solitary competence and uncontested completion edge toward the safety middle; no antagonist or friction tests the method.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The surveyor's choices drive the narrative arc: deciding to enter the pavilion, wresting the service door, placing notes, copying names, and leaving the final slip. These micro-choices shape the middle and ending beats. The character's agency is more observational and ritual than dilemma-driven, capping higher scores.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The inkwell appears in three beats: taken from the satchel, its lid snapping "like a small lighthouse shutting its eye," used to copy names, and packed at the end. Its "tides of ink older than my meticulous patience" charges the surveyor's method with continuity. It shapes the note-placing ritual but does not constrain a choice or create visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Interlaced absence" is named in the title, appears as a note coordinate, and frames the surveyor's task ("the old city did not vanish; it withdrew into Interlaced absence, a pattern only visible if you stand still as silt"). It defines the dominant stake and reweights the closure ("to map its living gaps"). Deduction: the concept is more thematic label than tactical constraint; it does not narrow options on the page.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Stoically sensitive" is named in backstory ("they called me in school, and I learned to accept the paradox as a compass") and enacted obliquely in the surveyor's restraint-as-intensity. "Firmness is how I hold the trembling that arrives with memory" gestures at the tradeoff. Deduction: the trait is articulated more than constrained; no visible cost or enabling moment tied to the paradox.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Wrest" appears twice—wresting the service door ("I wrest the ironed latch of a service door that rust sealed shut for twenty years") and wresting the program from the cabinet ("I wrest it from the cabinet with gentleness, because wrestling is not only for rage, it is for custody and for care"). The second use reweights the action as care rather than force, shaping the thematic turn. Neither wresting creates a major plot reversal; both are completions rather than obstacles.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The method—placing notes in foundation repairs—is signaled early ("My method is unglamorous and exact: Placing notes…"), demonstrated across multiple beats (notes at the column, at the missing stair, behind the jamb, in the hinge crack), and charged at closure ("to map its living gaps, and to love them until they answer"). The mechanics matter: each note witnesses a specific absence. Deduction: the act faces no resistance; it is ritual rather than tested tactic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The submerged pavilion anchors every beat: the drowned promenade, the service door, the underrooms, the silt-filled cabinet, the waterline marked for tomorrow. The water depth and sealed door constrain access; the setting's details (chipped initials, missing stair, water-bitten program) supply the material the surveyor maps. The final image returns to the pavilion's strange brightness and the surveyor's departure. Setting shapes tactics and charges the ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"After the drawbridge rises" frames the opening and returns near the end ("After the drawbridge rises now, a delayed ceremony"). The timeframe allows entry and imposes a window ("mark the waterline on the door for tomorrow's depth"), creating mild urgency. Deduction: the clock is more ritual marker than tactical pressure; no deadline forces choices.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The desire "to become the archeologist of abandoned dreams" is named early and enacted through note-placing and the copying of names. It drives the surveyor's choices and is repriced at closure ("not to repair the past but to map its living gaps"). Deduction: the motivation is articulated more than conflicted; no friction between competing wants or costs tests the desire.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Hushed blaze" is named as a heading ("Hushed Blaze, I write as a heading, to remind myself that restraint is a flame"), modeled in the restrained-but-charged diction throughout, and enacted in the surveyor's method ("the work asks for heat without spectacle"). The tone modulates subtly—calm ritual punctuated by charged images ("memory were bioluminescent")—and charges the final departure. The tone is coherent and purposeful, though slightly over-articulated as concept.</comment>
