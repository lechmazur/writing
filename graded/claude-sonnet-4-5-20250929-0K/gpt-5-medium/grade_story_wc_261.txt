<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is concrete and voice-particular: "I am a blade disguised as a salve" embodies contradiction through metaphor rather than label. The choice to plant the ivy cutting in the fossil coffee ring is earned by prior causality (the displaced miracle, the telepathic bond, the surgeon's numbing ritual) and forecloses the wound-opening path with visible cost. Minor deduction: the "accidentally telepathic with plants" trait edges toward diagnostic self-awareness in early exposition, though it is later grounded in embodied action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The closure lands on-page with felt cost: planting the ivy in the fossil ring and releasing the hourglass sand is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis shifting toward healing) that forecloses the wound-opening pattern. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—density builds through repeated images (ivy, coffee rings, hourglass, meteor hush) that reweight at closure. Orientation is clear by the opening lines (quiet tower at dawn, post-anesthesia wake). One meaningful deepening occurs when the protagonist descends into the tunnel and reads the fossil ring, narrowing from seeking closure to offering it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The quiet tower at dawn anchors early and recurs to frame closure. The tunnel chamber, frost on the hourglass, ivy on the sill, and the fossil coffee ring all constrain choice: the protagonist must physically descend, the cold steadies her tremor, the plants guide her feet. The body under anesthesia recovery and the numbed palms function as micro-setting that alters perception ("each pin is a star"). The frosted hourglass charges the final image when cracked and poured into the ring.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—learning to read stories in scars without opening more wounds—is signaled early and tightens once: the descent into the tunnel is a renunciation of the wound-opening stance, paid for by planting the ivy and releasing the hourglass. The protagonist's agency (choosing to descend, cracking the hourglass, whispering the plant-command) drives escalation under the Accumulative lens; coincidence (the displaced miracle) complicates but does not resolve. The fossil ring discovery deepens knowledge by showing Mira's last gesture was reassurance, which reconfigures the guilt. Cost is legible on-page: the emptied hourglass and the closure-as-garden acknowledgment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—closure as cultivation rather than sealing—emerges from the particulars: the ivy cutting, the fossil ring, the displaced miracle's apology-breath, the final whisper "carry her steadiness forward." The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("closure is not a gate but a garden I will learn, slowly") without moralizing. The hourglass-as-throat, ivy-as-translator, and coffee-rings-as-chronicle recur with shifting meaning, grounding the thematic question in embodied objects. No late motifs; all images seed early and pay off at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: the narrator notices ivy pull, coffee tremors, sand-whisper, loam-apology. Diction is lyric and compressed ("meteor hush," "needle-stitched light") but internally consistent; the voice modulates under pressure without register drift. No head-hopping. The plants' whispers function as free indirect style anchored in the protagonist's telepathic perception, not omniscience. Minor deduction: "I am a blade disguised as a salve" and similar formulaic self-descriptions edge toward maxim rather than embodied thought, though they remain voice-coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; figurative density is high but pattern-taught early and sustained through closure without muddle. Information density is strong: most lines advance image, character, or pressure. Minor deductions: "the air holds a meteor hush that feels stitched by long needles of light" stacks three metaphors without full integration; "the city below whispering that it too survived by miscalculation" anthropomorphizes without clear grounding. A few near-loops appear: "I did not ask for it" echoes "displaced miracle slipped," and "the plants told me / The plants murmur" recycles the same vehicle across adjacent beats. Apply −0.6 for moderate figurative density in peak beats and minor scaffold. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of accidental plant telepathy, displaced miracle, and fossil coffee ring as forensic device is specific and non-obvious. The closure—planting an ivy cutting in a fossil ring to "teach me to read it in living scars"—feels inevitable in hindsight, earned by the prior particulars. The piece transforms the closure-seeker archetype by literalizing wound-opening through telepathic scrying and bodily consequences (numbed palms, loam-breath). Risk: lyric compression and extended metaphor heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. No close echoes of famous lines; the premise reads original within the constraints.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The "closure seeker who opens wounds" is signaled in the opening third ("I am a closure seeker who opens wounds, and I hate the truth of how often I am right"), drives the middle descent into the tunnel where the protagonist physically opens the sealed chamber, and is transformed at closure when she plants the ivy and redefines closure as a garden rather than a gate. Two key beats: the decision to descend ("shall we go, and I answer yes") and the final planting. Causal pressure is high; the character's stance forecloses the wound-opening path with visible cost (emptied hourglass, new commitment to slow learning). Irreplaceable: the story logic hinges on this trait.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The frosted hourglass appears in setup (window ledge, Mira's parting gift), is used in the middle to steady tremor ("press it to the sill until the cold bleeds into my wrists"), and is cracked and poured at closure to plant the ivy. Three distinct beats. Causal pressure: the sand-as-time and frost-as-grief charge the object; cracking it is the decisive act that enables the planting. Specificity: the frosted quality and sand-whisper are unique properties that recur with reweighted meaning. Cost: the protagonist empties and breaks the last physical token of Mira.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The "displaced miracle" is seeded early ("the plants told me then that a displaced miracle slipped, saving the wrong lungs"), constrains the protagonist's breathing and guilt ("I cannot breathe without tasting loam and apology"), and is referenced at closure when the plants murmur the same story. It shapes stakes (the protagonist's need to reconcile the miracle) and tactics (descending to the tunnel to read Mira's last gesture). Two beats: the initial revelation and the fossil-ring confirmation. Moderate causal pressure; the miracle is more thematic driver than physical constraint. Swappability is low; the story's guilt and plant-bond hinge on this concept.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plant telepathy is signaled early ("I am accidentally telepathic with plants"), enables the middle descent ("let the plants tunnel with me"), and is active at closure (the ivy drinks and the ferns bow after the planting). Three beats. Causal pressure: the plants guide the protagonist's feet, translate silence, and answer her unasked ache. Cost: the protagonist must trust the plants' version of events (that the miracle mistook her body for Mira's). Specificity: the trait is irreplaceable; without it, the protagonist cannot access the tunnel or read the fossil ring.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Tunnel" is present in setup (Mira's collapse, "the morning the tunnel collapsed"), drives the middle descent ("find the fenced scar of the works where the tunnel yawns"), and is the closure location (planting the ivy in the chamber where the ceiling failed). Three beats. Causal pressure: the tunnel is the site of Mira's death and the displaced miracle; entering it is the renunciation of wound-opening. Specificity: the tunnel's physical danger and history are irreplaceable. Cost: descending without a lamp is a literal risk.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"By examining coffee rings" is seeded early ("by examining coffee rings, I track shivers of yesterday"), used in the middle to scry tremors for fault lines of memory, and is central at closure when the protagonist finds "the outline of a cup in clay, a phantom circle, a coffee ring hardened into fossilized morning" and reads Mira's last gesture. Two beats. Causal pressure: the method enables the discovery that reweights guilt. Specificity: the coffee ring as forensic device is unique. Swappability is low; the fossil ring is the pivot.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The "quiet tower at dawn" is present in the opening line and the closing line ("When I carry the emptied glass back to the quiet tower at dawn"), framing the descent. The ivy on the sill provides the cutting that is planted at closure. Two beats (frame). Causal pressure is moderate: the tower is the departure and return point but does not constrain middle choices. Lyric resonance: the frame reweights the tower as a site of slow learning rather than wound-opening. Swappability: a different dwelling would serve the same function with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the anesthesia wears off" is signaled early ("I wake after the anesthesia wears off") and recurs once ("Now, after the anesthesia wears off, pins of sensation return"). The numbed-to-returning sensation arc subtly parallels the protagonist's emotional shift from numb guilt to purposeful action. One beat. Causal pressure is low: the anesthesia does not constrain the descent or planting. The timeframe is more thematic than tactical. Swappability: "after surgery" or "at dawn" would serve similar purposes.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The motivation "to learn to read the stories in scars" is signaled early ("I read them to learn to read the stories in scars"), drives the middle descent to read the fossil ring, and is restated at closure ("teach me to read it in living scars"). Three beats. Causal pressure: the desire to read scars without opening wounds shapes the protagonist's tactics and the final planting. Cost: the protagonist must renounce the wound-opening stance. Specificity: the dual meaning of "scars" (soil scars, Mira's courage, the protagonist's palms) is irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The tone "meteor hush" is established in the opening line ("the air holds a meteor hush that feels stitched by long needles of light"), recurs at the fossil-ring discovery ("the sand hush deepens"), and charges the closure ("a hush like the pause before meteors gathers, then breaks into a gentle breath"). Three beats. Coherence: the tone modulates from held-breath stillness to exhale without jarring shifts. The meteor hush functions as a pressure-bearing silence that reweights at closure when the breath finally comes. Specificity: the "meteor" diction is unique and tied to the protagonist's post-anesthesia starry perception.</comment>
