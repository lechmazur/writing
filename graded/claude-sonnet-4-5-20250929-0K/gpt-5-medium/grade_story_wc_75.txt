<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The curator's interiority is concrete and particular ("feeling history tug like a hive-slick rope"), and the internal arc from "I feared becoming embalmer rather than nurse" to "worthy workers are rare, and need is a stern docent" shows genuine contradiction and earned acceptance. Embodied emotion appears in "I woke afraid, ridiculous, hopeful, salt-tongued," moving beyond label-only affect. However, the transformation feels somewhat declared rather than fully dramatized through micro-choices under peak pressure; the acceptance of responsibility arrives through exposition ("Responsibility settled on me like nectar armor") rather than a concrete decision moment that forecloses a visible option.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds pressure through layered images (beeswax, limestone, bread, wax softening) and a pattern-taught rhythm that culminates in the final reconfiguration where the curator accepts seasonal caretaking. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): "I promised to return seasonally, to carry their methods outward like bees carry rumor" reconfigures the museum role with felt cost (endurance, altered vocation). The orientation anchors who/where/when by the third paragraph, and causality coheres under the accumulative lens. One weakness: the stranger's late arrival and revelation about the beekeeper's death feels convenient rather than causally earned, though it does not break the dominant closure effect.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The grotto setting pressures choices throughout: damp air threatens artifacts, the waterfall's "cold lace" tests endurance during the vow ceremony, and broken cisterns become ovens. The emerald lens functions as a micro-setting constraint, determining which objects survive. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful ("Moist air carried a scent of beeswax, damp limestone, and something like rosewater dread"), filtered through the curator's professional and emotional priorities. The final image of the waterfall bowing and "galleries breathe honeyed mist and memory" charges the ending, meeting the 9+ gate for Q3.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—rescuing dying arts while avoiding becoming "embalmer rather than nurse"—is signaled early and tightens when the lens is revealed to select what survives, raising the curator's responsibility to "unbearable." The bread-baking method introduces a meaningful choice (feeding while recording), and the climactic vow ceremony forces the community to "chew their own initials and swear to remember another person," forecloses the option of passive preservation, and shows visible cost (vulnerability, "our courage felt edible and breakable"). The stranger's late arrival and the beekeeper resolution feel somewhat convenient, lowering pressure slightly, but the curator's final commitment (seasonal return) is protagonist-driven and credibly earned.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: names as fragile testimonies, bread as both sustenance and memory, the tension between preservation and vitality. The bread-as-initials motif returns with reweighted meaning at the vow ceremony and the beekeeper's crown, charging the closure without stating a moral. However, the final two lines edge toward thematic statement ("my history rises warm, eaten, and therefore enduring"), and the piece occasionally leans on symbolic convenience (the waterfall changing key, the lens as selection mechanism) rather than letting the central question arise entirely from conflict. The resonance is strong but not quite untouched by assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV distance is stable; the narrator's professional idiom ("I am historically oriented, which is true and sometimes a curse") and perceptual signature (noticing "prayer beads," "snail-shell vents," "pond-lit constellations") remain consistent and character-specific. Diction is controlled and purposeful, balancing elevated register with concrete anchors. Senka's brief dialogue ("Keep our names warm" is a dream, not direct speech; actual dialogue is minimal) and the stranger's plain speech provide contrast. One slip: "thaw into testimony" in paragraph 11 slightly muddles the metaphor (limestone thawing), and the final paragraph's summary voice ("I am still a museum guide, but now...") pulls slightly toward exposition rather than maintaining scene-driven immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("history tug like a hive-slick rope," "nectar armor"). However, several lines carry metaphor overload or mixed vehicles: "limestone thaw into testimony" conflates temperature and witness; "balconies crowded with displaced persons staring through the emerald-tinted lens" in the dream is spatially unclear; "corridors stitched" by vows strains the image. Template cadence appears in mid-section paragraph openings ("I began with," "I told her of," "I wrote histories"). The density is high, but clarity wobbles in peak beats (the vow ceremony and dream sequence), applying a −0.6 deduction for figurative muddle and template stems across multiple high-pressure lines.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of displaced persons, edible archives (bread-as-initials), and the emerald lens as survival arbiter is fresh and feels inevitable in hindsight. The emotional truth of preservation's paradox (feeding vs. embalming) avoids generic templates. Risk-taking in the lyric, accumulative structure and the non-linear dream interlude heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. However, the beekeeper subplot and the stranger's arrival echo familiar redemption-through-truth beats, and the final paragraph's museum-guide-transformed arc trends toward a template character journey. The piece transforms its elements but does not fully escape the contours of a "caretaker accepts burden" frame.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The museum guide is present early, makes the key choice to introduce bread-baking (shaping tactics), decides to accept the lens and responsibility (altering the mission), and commits to seasonal return at closure. These are decisions, not mere observations, meeting the two-gate threshold and contributing to the ending. However, many beats (the lens revelation, the stranger's arrival) happen to the curator rather than through the curator's agency, limiting causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The emerald-tinted opera glass lens is introduced in paragraph 9, used to reveal hidden carvings (beat 1), later revealed as a selection tool determining artifact survival (beat 2, reweighting its meaning), and wielded during the climactic vow ceremony where initials "glowed like pond-lit constellations" (beat 3, shaping the ending image). It narrows options (only lens-viewed objects endure) and carries conceptual cost (responsibility). All three gates are met with strong causal and closure linkage, though it arrives slightly late (around 25% mark) rather than in the first third.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Displaced persons shape the setting, the community's need (dying arts, interrupted lineage), and the stakes (rescuing methods under threat). The concept pressures choices: the curator must work within damp constraints, the community's grief over the beekeeper, and the survival question posed by the lens. It appears early, constrains middle tactics (building ovens, testing the lens), and frames the closure commitment (seasonal return to carry methods outward). However, it functions more as context than as a tactic-altering force in individual beats; the curator's work would look similar if the displacement were differently caused.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Historically oriented" is signaled early ("My employers say I am historically oriented, which is true and sometimes a curse") and mentioned again in the final line. It motivates the cataloguing mission and the choice to begin "with names, because history begins there." However, the trait never visibly constrains a choice or imposes a cost; the curator could equally be a preservationist or archivist without meaningful edit. The trait is present and thematically coherent but functionally replaceable, landing mid-band with lyric reprise credit but no causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Thaw" appears in "carvings hidden in limestone thaw into testimony" (beat 1, the lens revealing history), "crumbs were sprinkled into wax molds to soften it, and thaw" (beat 2, enabling wax to take faces again), and "Grief thawed into apologies" (beat 3, the stranger's revelation changing the community's stance). Each use is causally distinct and shapes a turn: the lens changes what can be seen, the softened wax restores faces, the emotional thaw enables forgiveness. The action is irreplaceable in its meaning (warm reversal of cold loss) and contributes to closure, meeting all three gates with strong specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The family custom of baking bread shaped like initials is introduced in paragraph 20, becomes the method that drives the middle action (building ovens, kneading, recording each initial with context), enables the wax-softening breakthrough ("crumbs were sprinkled into wax molds to soften it, and thaw"), and structures the climactic vow ceremony where "People chewed their own initials and swore to remember another person." It also reappears in the beekeeper's crown of B's at closure. The method is signaled, its mechanics matter (feeding and preserving simultaneously), it shapes multiple attempts, and it is indispensable to the ending's logic and charge. All three gates are met with high causal and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The grotto city behind a monumental waterfall pressures choices throughout: damp threatens artifacts (driving the lens's selection power), the waterfall's spray tests the community during the vow ceremony ("cold lace on our faces"), and broken cisterns supply the ovens. The setting is present early, constrains middle tactics (working within cave conditions), and charges the final image ("the waterfall seemed to bow, and the grotto hearts kept beating"). The setting is irreplaceable; the story's logic depends on the enclosed, wet, threatened space. All three gates are met with strong causal and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the beekeeper's last visit" is mentioned early and frames the community's grief and the hive problem (wax too hard, black crepe). However, it functions as backstory context rather than a live constraint; no clock tightens decisions, and the pacing is indeterminate (days? weeks?). The beekeeper's death is resolved by the stranger's late arrival, but the timeframe itself does not alter tactics or charge the ending. It is present and functional but replaceable with another inciting loss, landing mid-band with no causal pressure or closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The motivation "to rescue dying arts" is stated early ("My task was to rescue dying arts, though I feared becoming embalmer rather than nurse") and drives the cataloguing, the bread method, and the lens-based selection. The fear of "embalmer rather than nurse" introduces internal friction. The motivation shapes the middle choice (bread as living testimony) and the ending commitment (seasonal return). However, the motivation is told more than dramatized in micro-choices under peak pressure; the curator's acceptance of responsibility is declared ("Responsibility settled on me...and I accepted") rather than shown through a concrete on-page refusal or sacrifice. Two gates are met (setup, payoff) with thematic coherence but limited friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The tone "rosewater dread" is signaled in paragraph 7 ("Moist air carried a scent of beeswax, damp limestone, and something like rosewater dread") and recurs in diction throughout: the fear of becoming embalmer, the dream of honey bleeding, "our courage felt edible and breakable," "nectar armor, sweet and unbearable." The tone modulates from tentative fear to acceptance, charging the final image of "galleries breathe honeyed mist and memory." It is coherent through turns and purposeful, though the compound descriptor "rosewater dread" itself is used only once and the effect is more diffuse atmospheric blend than a recurring tonal signature. Two gates are met (setup, closure modulation) with strong coherence but limited direct reprise.</comment>
