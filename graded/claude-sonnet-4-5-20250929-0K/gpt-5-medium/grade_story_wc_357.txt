<question>1</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>The protagonist's interiority is richly textured through embodied perception ("heart tight," "skin prickles") and the grandmother's legacy provides clear motivation. However, the journey reads more as observation than decision-driven pressure—the pilot follows water flows and responds to phenomena without facing contradictory impulses or making choices that foreclose paths with visible cost. The final planting is ritually satisfying but lacks the earned tension of competing wants or a mistake that compounds before resolution.</comment>

<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening lines. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered imagery (water, echoes, resin) and the final planting reconfigures the orchard's resilience with felt ancestral weight. The closure—planting the fused spindle beneath the grandmother's drum—lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis blended with Charged Poise), reweighting the premise of survival-as-practice. Cost is conceptual and relational rather than a decisive physical forfeiture, which keeps it from the highest band.</comment>

<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The floating arches, inverted gravity, and water-flow navigation create a vividly specific environment that constrains movement and choice throughout. Micro-setting detail—the resin spindle, the algae-veiled underbellies, the boulder-riding grove—charges the final image. Sensory selection is purposeful and filtered through the pilot's professional lens. The orchard planet functions as both stage and crucible, shaping tactics and the ending's resonance.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—finding the source of resilience—is signaled early and pursued throughout. Pressure accumulates through the Accumulative lens: the pilot navigates obstacles (the arch, the water ribbon, the resin spindle) and the final act of planting reweights earlier loss. However, escalation is driven more by revelation than by narrowing options or forecloses paths; the protagonist encounters mysteries but does not face trade-offs that alter tactics or impose a visible price that charges the final moment under duress.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme—resilience as practice, not accident—emerges organically from the arrow tip's "remembered weather," the resin spindle's lesson of alignment, and the closing image of trees exhaling "a held year." The piece avoids moralizing; insights arise from tactile particulars (bark enduring hail, sap rerouting wounds). The final planting offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. A slight tilt toward abstraction in some descriptions ("music that gathers, bends, and carries us home") keeps it from the highest tier.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: the pilot notices water, echoes, and plant textures through a professional/ancestral filter. Diction is lyric and controlled ("velvet," "ink," "starlight in honey") and modulates appropriately under pressure. Some figurative clusters in peak beats (e.g., "echoes swarm down like rain remembered") elevate register without obscuring clarity, though they risk slight overwriting. No head-hopping; voice remains coherent and purpose-driven throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Rhythm varies naturally and information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs (world-building + emotion + sensory texture). A few runs of near-synonyms appear ("whirling silence," "murmuring hive of absence") and some metaphors layer densely in high-pressure beats without always advancing causality. The opening and closing lines anchor voice and recharge motifs effectively. Clarity holds, but the density of figurative language in the middle third occasionally slows momentum rather than propelling it.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of inverted gravity, water navigation, and ancestral artifact as resilience-compass is specific and non-obvious. The piece commits fully to its premise and avoids safe hedging; the "spindle as practice made solid" and the arrow tip's "remembered weather" feel earned in hindsight. The lyric voice and accumulative structure take risks that heighten thematic stakes without gimmickry. However, the core frame—quest for a mystical source—is familiar; transformation arises more from execution than from a radical premise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>The intrepid orchard pilot is present throughout, pursues the dominant stake, and makes the final planting choice. However, most beats involve observation and navigation rather than decisions that foreclose paths or alter tactics under competing pressures. The role shapes voice and world-interaction but does not create key reversals on the page.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The broken arrow tip appears early (setup), is carried and handled at the resin spindle (development), and is fused and planted in the closure beat (payoff). Its "remembered weather" and the grandmother's legacy constrain the pilot's goal and charge the final image. Removing it would unravel the story's causal and thematic spine.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The "gathering of echoes" is seeded early, shapes the navigation ("gathering of echoes, soft yet certain"), and the resin spindle is revealed as a core that "gathers echoes of what stands and what bends." The concept drives the discovery and reweights the closure. It operates as both literal phenomenon and thematic hinge, constraining choices and charging the final planting.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>5.9</grade>
<comment>The attribute appears in backstory (grandmother's pears deepened, bark thickened) and is promised in the ending ("trees exhale a held year"), but it does not constrain or enable an on-page action with visible cost. It functions as a thematic marker rather than a tactical pressure point.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>The action of discovery is the story's spine: the pilot seeks and finds the resin spindle. The journey's beats (following water, entering the arch, touching metal to resin) all serve this action, and the closure depends on it. However, the discovery is more revelation than turn; the protagonist does not face obstacles that force adaptation, so the action is essential but not transformative.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Navigating by water flow is signaled early ("our oldest method"), used in multiple beats (following the ribbon, angling through the arch, guiding the grove downward), and shapes tactics throughout the inverted hour. The method is irreplaceable within the world's logic and constraints the pilot's choices. Removing it would collapse the story's spatial coherence and thematic linkage between water and resilience.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The orchard planet and floating rock arches are present from the opening line, pressure navigation throughout, and the cathedral of arches houses the resin spindle at closure. The setting supplies resources (water flows, the boulder-riding grove) that alter tactics and charge the final image. Micro-setting (algae-veiled underbellies, sap-gleaming air) is woven into every beat.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>The hour-long gravity inversion frames the entire journey and returns in the closure ("When gravity begins to right itself"). However, the timeframe is not tracked or tightened on the page; no clock pressures decisions or narrows options. It functions as a structural bracket rather than a live constraint that alters tactics under duress.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>The motivation to find the source of resilience is dramatized from the opening beat ("discover, at last, the source"), drives every navigational choice, and is fulfilled at the resin spindle with the grandmother's legacy reweighted. The desire is rooted in loss (grandmother's death, orchard thirst) and the final planting embodies cost (ancestral duty). The friction between want (knowledge) and cost (embodied responsibility) is clear.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The "whirling silence" is seeded in the opening ("fields sigh into a whirling silence"), recurs at the resin encounter ("whirling silence" around the spindle), and modulates through the ending ("season unknots its shoulders"). The tone is coherent, lyric, and breathable, supporting the accumulative pressure. It charges the final image without rigidity, though it remains more atmospheric than sharply contrastive under peak stress.</comment>
