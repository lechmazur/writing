<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is vivid and distinctive—"listening becomes a structure I can walk through"—with embodied sensory experience and micro-choices that reveal character under pressure. The protagonist's curiosity drives concrete actions (pulling catalogs, following pulses, entering the gallery) that narrow options and lead to connection. Internal contradiction appears when the narrator initially misreads the photograph (listening vs. laughing), though the final choice to guide both parties feels somewhat passive rather than a full renunciation or decisive stance shift. The cost is present but oblique: "incidental heroism, nothing I intended" softens the weight of what was risked or forfeited.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure—pulses, fog, the photograph, and the hearing aid build density and converge at closure when the narrator guides child and man to connect. Orientation anchors (atrium, twilight, the dead call) land early and remain stable. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the narrator facilitates connection without forcing resolution, and the final line acknowledges both agency and its limits ("incidental heroism, nothing I intended"). Cost is conceptual—patience, the will to keep listening—but remains legible in the reeling hush that frames the ending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium, the hearing aid as warm tactile object ("like a pocketed sparrow"), and the gallery of unclaimed photographs create a coherent micro-setting that constrains movement and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: fog sliding in "as if the city has decided to lie down and sleep," the guard's mouth "open like an exit." The hearing aid's thrumming and the street's smell of oranges anchor spatial and sensory progression. The setting's layers—atrium, street, gallery, man's room—remain clear and the final convergence in "that reeling hush" ties space to emotional state.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: find the child's mother by following the faint pulses; the tightening arrives when the narrator realizes the woman was laughing, not listening, and the pulses swing to the man. That reversal narrows options and forces a recalibration. The final beat—guiding both to dial and speak—applies modest agency; the narrator's role as facilitator is consistent with the job but leaves the protagonist slightly outside the final action. Cost is present in the patience and the acceptance of "incidental" rather than decisive heroism, though the escalation could press harder on what the narrator risks or loses by walking into the fog.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the hearing aid, the photograph, and the act of listening: grief as redialed call, connection as process rather than resolution. The final image—three parties in separate spaces, held together by voice and patience—answers the thematic question (how do we map old currents before they drown the living?) without moralizing. "Incidental heroism, nothing I intended" resists tidy closure and preserves complexity. The ear motif (right ear, hearing aid, listening vs. laughing) recurs with shifting meaning and the story commits fully to its premise without retreat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>POV distance is stable and the narrative voice is distinctive: lyric compression ("fog slides in as if the city has decided to lie down and sleep"), precise idiom ("reeling hush," "swallowed star"), and perceptual signature (tracking faint pulses, jokes that never land). Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close in the atrium, slightly receded when describing the man and child. Dialogue is minimal but goal-driven when present ("Help," the man's confession). The final lines maintain voice coherence under emotional pressure and the prose rhythm tightens appropriately as pulses converge without devolving into template cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high: most lines advance setting, character, or stakes without padding. Figurative language is fresh and specific ("steam sketches a question mark," "swallowed star," "hummingbird caught under a jar") without overwhelming clarity. Minor register drift appears in "persistently curious" and "artifact" (slightly elevated for the voice) but does not obscure momentum. One paraphrase near the end: "the first thing found is the will to keep listening" echoes prior patience language without adding new pressure. No scaffold loops or template cadence; clarity remains strong through the elliptical final convergence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The premise—contact tracer for hearts mapping old currents via hearing aid pulses—offers a fresh synthesis of detective procedural and elegiac tone. The reversal (laughter mistaken for listening, the call originating from the man's grief-redialed sleep) feels earned in hindsight and specific to this world's logic. "Incidental heroism" and the reeling hush tone avoid safety-middle choices. The transformation test holds: names and places could not be swapped without losing the mist, the hearing aid, the gallery of last photographs. One proximity echo: the poetic compression and fog recall certain genre exercises, but the particular alchemy of elements reads singular.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The contact tracer role frames expectation early (atrium, pencil, phones), drives the middle beats (pulling catalogs, following pulses, entering the gallery), and shapes the ending when the narrator guides child and man to connect. The job's constraints—logging names, tracking artifacts, listening as structure—enable and narrow tactics. Causal pressure is clear: the narrator's choice to walk rather than stay at the desk leads to the photograph discovery and the final facilitation. Cost is oblique (incidental, wasteful walking) but present. The character's decisions are central to all key turns.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The photograph appears mid-story when the hearing aid thrums, reweights understanding (laughing vs. listening), and introduces the man. Its details (woman's tipped head, man with cup, steam's question mark) drive the narrator's inference and the pulses' swing to the darker room. The photograph is handled on the page ("I lift one frame") and its revelation of joy before debt and illness charges the ending by contextualizing the child's search and the man's grief. It participates in closure by anchoring the final connection between man and child. Setup is delayed but payoff is strong.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Incidental heroism" is signaled early ("most evenings I just listen"), shapes the narrator's walking despite the supervisor's objection, and is named explicitly in the final line to frame the ending's modest, non-triumphal closure. The concept constrains tactics—facilitating rather than solving—and reweights the premise by refusing grandiosity. However, it remains more thematic echo than a choice-altering stake; the narrator never faces a fork where heroism versus incidental action determines outcome. It charges the tone but does not drive a beat turn with visible cost tied specifically to that concept.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Persistently curious" is declared mid-story ("I am persistently curious, and the city answers only to feet") and enables the walking choice that leads to the gallery. The trait constrains one on-page action—leaving the atrium despite the supervisor's disapproval—with a small cost (wasteful time). It does not return or force a later tradeoff. The curiosity feels consistent with the narrator's job and voice but remains a labeled trait rather than a dramatized friction that shapes multiple beats or the ending.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Assure" appears twice: first to the child ("I assure her I will try"), then to both at the end ("I assure them both that finding is a process"). The action is central to the narrator's role and directly shapes the story's emotional arc by framing patience and ongoing process rather than immediate resolution. The second assurance is the closure beat's core speech act, reweighting the stake from finding-the-mother to finding-the-will-to-listen. Swapping "assure" for "promise" or "tell" would dilute the narrator's professional, measured tone. The action participates in setup, middle choice, and closure with felt cost (modest agency, incidental heroism).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The hearing aid is signaled early (catalog search), handled physically ("warm in my palm like a pocketed sparrow"), drives the middle beats (thrums when the narrator lifts the photograph, pulses swing to the man's room, rattles "like a hummingbird"), and shapes the ending (the man keeps it running to hear the woman's steps). Its mechanics—tracking faint pulses—enable the narrator's tactics and the final connection. The aid's specificity (decades-old, unclaimed, belonging to the laughing woman) makes it irreplaceable. It touches setup, development, and closure with causal pressure and felt cost (grief as redialed signal, device as proxy for presence).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium at twilight anchors the opening and frames the narrator's departure into fog. The setting provides the phones that tremble and the desk where the pencil never dulls, establishing the job's ritual space. However, the atrium does not constrain a middle choice or return with reweighted meaning; the story moves quickly to the street, gallery, and man's room. The twilight and mist charge tone but do not pressure tactics after the first beat. The setting is vivid and coherent but functions more as launch point than recurring constraint or closure participant.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"When the dead call" is signaled immediately ("At my desk... the phones begin to tremble. That is when the dead call") and frames the inciting event (the child's call). The timeframe shapes the narrator's role and the story's elegiac tone. However, it does not tighten decisions or create a live clock; the walking, discovery, and final connection unfold without temporal pressure. The dead-call premise reappears when the man reveals "grief redialed his sleep," reweighting the timeframe conceptually (involuntary召 rather than volitional contact). It participates in setup and thematic closure but does not constrain middle tactics or escalate urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"To protect vulnerable voices" is stated early ("assigned to map the old currents before they drown the living, to protect vulnerable voices") and drives the narrator's choices: answering the child, searching the catalog, walking into fog despite the supervisor's objection, facilitating the final connection. The motivation is dramatized through action rather than merely told. Friction appears when the narrator realizes the search has shifted from mother to man, and the final assurance acknowledges the limits of protection (process, not resolution). Cost is present in the patient, incidental labor. The motivation shapes at least two beats and participates in closure with felt tradeoff (modest agency, acceptance of what cannot be fully protected).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Reeling hush" is introduced early ("The room tightens into a reeling hush as the line clicks") and recurs at the ending ("We sit together in that reeling hush"). The tone is coherent through emotional turns—fog, gallery silence, the man's closed eyes, the child's swallow—and modulates with pressure (thrumming aid, vibrating line). The final reprise charges the closure image by gathering all three parties in shared quiet. The tone constrains the narrator's register (measured, elegiac, non-triumphant) and prevents overstatement. It shapes atmosphere across beats and the ending with undeniable pressure, though it remains more tonal constant than a stake-altering force.</comment>
