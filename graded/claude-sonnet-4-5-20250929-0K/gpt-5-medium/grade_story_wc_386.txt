<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to "salvage something pure" drives investigative choices across beats (mapping taps, diving, warming the globe), and the decision to "let people see themselves in the mirror first" carries tactical weight. Interiority feels particular ("I could feel the grid of Sofia's rhythm in my palms"), though the arc from investigation to exposure lacks a visible internal contradiction or trade-off at closure—the narrator executes a plan rather than wrestling with competing impulses. The final gesture (husband turning the crank "until it stuck") offers closure but doesn't foreclose a path for the protagonist with felt cost on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of tapping/rhythm across dreamers, maps it to evidence, and culminates in communal witness that forces corporate acknowledgment. Orientation anchors late (shrine, ice, harbor context emerge piecemally past ~120 words) but the mosaic structure is legible by midpoint. Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing: "exposure is a gentle blade" reweights the investigation's method with social cost (foreman's lowered eyes, quiet husband's final turn). One meaningful deepening occurs when the globe's tune becomes "password" evidence. Cost is conceptual and communal rather than protagonist-personal, which is valid under CR but mutes felt price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ice shrine, portholes, ferry wreck, and melted snow globe anchor setting with purpose: the globe's base and crank constrain the reveal, the ferry's "ribs" and "cabins gape like pulled teeth" guide the dive, and borrowed starlight frames tone. Spatial choreography across dive/shrine/town is legible. The piece does not reach 9+ because while environment supplies resources (globe, scarf, seat position), no single setting element demonstrably narrows a choice at a pressure point—setting stages rather than forces.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: expose the welding company's culpability. Escalation under Accumulative lens: the rhythm decoded → dive retrieval → globe warmed to yield password → dreamers assembled → public tapping forces confession. One meaningful tightening when the globe's beats "matched their maintenance logs" and the foreman lowers his eyes. Agency is investigative rather than confrontational; the narrator orchestrates but doesn't face a personal trade-off at closure. Cost is legible (company steps outside, foreman swallows) but social/external rather than protagonist-borne, limiting the felt price on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of truth salvaged through patient, communal witness emerges from particulars: the tapping code, the dreamers' testimony, "exposure is a gentle blade," the globe that "turned lifeboat for evidence." The ending's quiet stance ("we did not cheer; the ice would have cracked") reweights method over outcome without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the foreman's swallowing, the pilot's son leaning "like he might kiss a lighthouse," and the husband's silent crank-turn. No thematic echo in final lines; resonance arises organically from image and gesture.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single-POV first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: "wreck-diver ghost whisperer," "breath makes halos," "silt there moves as if remembering." Diction is lyric-elevated but consistent and voice-motivated throughout. Purposeful compression ("three winters ago," "that winter") and patterned syntax (comma-spliced accretions) are taught early and sustained. No head-hopping; psychic distance stays anchored. The piece does not reach 9+ because some figurative density in the opening third ("candle-lit shrine carved into glacier ice where breath makes halos and prayers drift like plankton") loads texture without immediate pressure, and the voice's lyricism remains uniform rather than modulating sharply under the dive's physical stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense and mostly coherent ("windows of connection," "ribs where cabins gape like pulled teeth," "milky bruise"), but the opening paragraph stacks metaphors without clear propulsion: "borrowed starlight," "halos," "plankton," "windows of connection" within ~60 words. Rhythm varies purposefully in later beats ("quick, careful, insistent as a metronome"). Minor paraphrase loop: "I expose what sinks beneath silence" / "the dead are shy but relentless when their truth wants surface" restates the same concept across adjacent lines. No major scaffold or template cadence, but pervasive lyricism in high-density clusters reduces immediate clarity. Deduction: −0.6 for figurative density in opening without immediate beat advancement, −0.2 for paraphrase adjacency.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: wreck-diver medium + tapping Morse in dreams + melted snow globe as hidden recorder transforms familiar ghost-investigation material through specific, non-obvious mechanics. The globe's dual function (gift/evidence vessel) and the method of communal witness via dreamers feel particular to this voice and world. Risk-taking in lyric density and mosaic structure heightens tone without obscuring the causal spine. The piece does not reach 9+ because the "ghost leaves clues in dreams" premise has template proximity, and while the globe twist is ingenious, the broader arc (investigator exposes corporate cover-up) follows a familiar moral calculus without subversion.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Wreck-diver ghost whisperer narrator drives all investigative beats: hears currents, maps taps, dives at dawn, warms globe, invites dreamers, carries beats to town. Present throughout and causally active. Choices alter tactics (mapping, diving, warming, staging communal witness). Closure participation clear but passive orchestration at the end (dreamers and foreman act; narrator observes). Strong setup and development; closure linkage is observational rather than decisional. Score: 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Melted snow globe appears in three beats: pointed to by Sofia (setup), retrieved from ferry seat (development), warmed and cranked to yield password (payoff/closure shaping). Causally indispensable: without the globe's hidden crank and beats, no evidence surfaces. Specificity high (rusted crank, music box jeweled with salt, "milky bruise"). Closure linkage strong: husband turns crank "until it stuck" in final image, reweighting the object as both evidence and memorial. Score: 8.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Windows of connection (portholes in ice) appear in opening and frame the investigative method (linking drowned and sleepless). The concept shapes the shrine's function and narrator's role but does not constrain a specific choice or alter tactics under pressure. Present in setup, thematically resonant, but mechanically passive—the windows stage rather than force. Closure does not return to the windows image. Score: 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Weaves truth carefully" appears as trait label in opening ("I am the kind of guide who weaves truth carefully") and is dramatized in the decision to invite dreamers rather than shout accusations ("let people see themselves in the mirror first"). One on-page choice with visible cost (patience over confrontation). Present in setup, enacted once in middle/closure choice. Moderate causal pressure; the trait enables the method but could be replaced with "patient investigator" without breaking logic. Score: 6.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Expose action drives the entire arc: narrator exposes by mapping taps, retrieving globe, decoding beats, assembling dreamers, carrying testimony to town, forcing company acknowledgment. Major turns trace directly to this action (globe decode → communal witness → foreman confession). Indispensable; swapping "expose" for another verb would break the story's method and closure. Present across all three gates with high causal necessity. Score: 7.8.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Analyzing cameo appearances in strangers' dreams is signaled early ("the dead began making cameo appearances in strangers' dreams"), mechanics detailed (bakers, buskers, pilot's son; all wearing same coat, tapping two fingers), and the method shapes investigation (mapping dots/dashes, inviting dreamers to shrine). Development strong: dreams supply the code. Closure: dreamers' testimony becomes "sworn" and their recognition of tapping completes the evidence chain. Present across all three gates; mechanics matter throughout. Score: 7.4.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Candle-lit shrine carved into glacier ice anchors setup (opening paragraph) and serves as communal courtroom in closure ("The shrine became a courtroom of shadows"). The shrine's portholes and lamplight enable the globe-warming beat. Spatial specificity high; the setting constrains method (ice would crack if they cheered). Present in setup and closure; middle development less pronounced. The shrine stages action but does not narrow a choice under pressure. Score: 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade><comment>Required element is None.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Motivation to salvage something pure is declared early ("to salvage something pure from the wreckage you must let people see themselves in the mirror first") and dramatized in the choice to invite dreamers rather than accuse directly. Friction appears between the desire for purity and the method's patience (no shouting, gentle blade). Desire shapes tactics across middle and closure beats. Cost legible in the foreman's submission and the quiet ending. Present in setup and closure with one clear on-page choice constrained by this want. Score: 7.1.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Borrowed starlight appears in opening and closing lines, framing tone. The phrase recurs with shifted weight: first describing work conditions, finally charging the globe's shine ("we watched the melted snow globe shine in borrowed starlight, then rest"). Tone is elegiac and patient throughout, modulating subtly at pressure points (dive urgency, courtroom quiet). Coherent across turns; the final reprise reweights the opening image with closure cost. Lyric seed → payoff structure qualifies for mid-7s. Score: 7.0.</comment>
