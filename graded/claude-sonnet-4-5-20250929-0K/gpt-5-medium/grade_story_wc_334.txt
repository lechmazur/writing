<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is concrete and voice-particular ("hands-on folklorist, chronically curious"), with embodied emotion in peak moments (biting the apple, tracing ink with warmth not hers). Internal contradiction appears in the confession about loving work more than the woman holding the anchor rope, showing genuine cost. The final choice—writing grandmother's name a third time—feels earned by the underwater recovery sequence, though the grandmother remains more motif than pressure-applying presence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with lyric compression. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the protagonist recovers fragments, not everything, and writes the correction with visible cost ("not mine to keep, but enough to begin a repair"). The orchard-as-library metaphor ("charged late fees") makes the price undeniable. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph (island, tide list, sunken greenhouse). One meaningful deepening occurs when the truth-confession brightens the ring and returns grandmother's cadence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The sunken orchard greenhouse constrains every choice: mirrors catch ring-sheen, broken ceiling panes become navigational maps, the hatch leads to the ledger. Micro-setting (slate, mask, mirrors) repeatedly alters tactics. The apple drifting toward the protagonist and bitten "like a pilgrim kissing a relic" charges the closure image with sensory specificity (salt, then sweetness) and causal pressure. Spatial choreography remains clear across underwater moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover stolen memories—is signaled early and tightens through one meaningful escalation: the protagonist must "feed the ring the missing truth" (confession about the anchor-rope woman). That confession narrows options and costs relational honesty, reweighting the final image. The price is visible ("I had let it slip") and the grandmother's cadence returns "patient, precise, and a little amused," making the trade-off legible. One reversal suffices at this length under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—memory as archive requiring payment—emerges from particulars (brine-preserved apples, mushroom ring as ledger, the protagonist's correction mirroring grandmother's stubbornness). The final act of writing the name a third time offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. However, "crisp nostalgia sharpened the day, and I felt almost honestly new" edges toward summary statement rather than pure image, slightly diluting resonance in the ending paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct and consistent: the protagonist notices through a folklorist's lens (rope, chalk, mirrors, logbook matching), sensory detail filtered by professional habit ("tide tax, apple-taker, the hush between bells"). Diction remains voice-particular and purposeful ("stubborn tenderness," "silt language," "faithful but impatient friend" for the slate). Psychic distance modulates cleanly (intimate at confession, sensory-tight when biting the apple). One brief line—"Laugh if you like, but fungi catalog worlds the way we dream"—momentarily addresses an absent reader, a hairline wobble in focalization that does not obscure pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally, information density is high (most lines advance setting, image, and stakes), and no paraphrase loops or template cadence appear. Figurative language is controlled and thematically coherent (orchard grafted onto sea, shipwrecks as ribs/barred windows, gull-smudge becoming thought of hand). Minor density excess in the middle third (e.g., "decades later still felt like yesterday" repeated as "Decades later, yes, but not gone") and one stock phrase ("small hinge in the year") slightly reduce crispness, but clarity and propulsion remain strong through the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise—underwater orchard as memory archive, fairy ring requiring truth-payment—transforms familiar ghost-story and quest tropes through lived folkloric detail (slate, logbook, mirrors as tools) and specific world logic (brine preservation, fungi as catalogers). The protagonist's confession about prioritizing work over relationship introduces non-obvious moral calculus. The ending avoids tidy resolution ("not everything, because the orchard was a library that charged late fees"), committing fully to its premise. Risk-taking in lyric compression and underwater setting heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The folklorist's choices—chalking cracks, laying mirrors, speaking the confession aloud—drive key turns. Early signal (paragraph 3: "I carry rope, chalk, mirrors"), middle involvement (mirrors catch ring-sheen, slate charts path), closure linkage (writes grandmother's name, owns the correction). Two distinct beats with causal pressure, but the trait "hands-on" is more method-label than distinct cost-generator.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The fairy ring appears mid-story (paragraph 17: "pale wreath in the seagrass"), pulses and counts, brightens after confession, and dims at tide turn—three functional beats. It gates the memory recovery (must feed it truth) and charges the closure sequence (ring dims as protagonist surfaces). Specificity matters (mushrooms as world-catalogers), but late first appearance and lack of early setup cap upper range.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Decades later" is signaled in paragraph 5, repeated in paragraph 21 as refrain, and drives stakes throughout: grandmother's dive long ago, fragments that "grew me," the orchard's time-as-grafted quality. It shapes the protagonist's motivation and the closure insight ("not gone; time here was an orchard grafted onto the sea"). The concept alters options (memories are tithed, not destroyed) and charges the final correction with temporal weight.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Chronically curious" is labeled in paragraph 3 but functions primarily as character descriptor. It enables the protagonist's tool-carrying and question-asking but does not constrain a choice with visible cost. One beat involvement (studying broken constellations to detect patterns) ties to method, but swappable with "methodical" or "diligent" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Detect" is signaled early (paragraph 3: "I carry...so many questions" implies observation) and executed twice: studying broken constellations (paragraph 13) to match grandmother's sayings, and detecting grandmother's cadence returning (paragraph 29). The action shapes middle and closure beats, driving the logbook match and the memory recovery. Specificity ties to folklorist method, though "observe" or "trace" could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The method appears in paragraph 13 ("I learned early to detect patterns by studying broken constellations") and is executed immediately: chalking cracks, matching to logbook. It shapes one key turn (finding the path to the hatch) and returns in paragraph 32 when mirrors map the ring "like an evening sky." Two beats, early signal, closure participation via the mirror-constellation map, but the mechanics (why constellations reveal memory-theft) remain opaque.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The sunken orchard greenhouse is anchored in paragraph 4, surrounds every choice (ceiling cracks become maps, trellis marks the ring, hatch holds the ledger), and pressures tactics throughout (noon slack required, tide turn forces exit). Shipwrecks "made a hard horizon" and "groaned" as witnesses. The setting supplies resources (apples, mirrors catching light) and constrains time. Indispensable to logic and closure; removing it breaks the story.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"When habits break" is signaled in the opening line and echoed in the penultimate paragraph ("as if habits had broken for everyone"), framing the protagonist's return. It sets tone and timeframe but does not constrain on-page choices; the noon slack and tide turn do the temporal work. The phrase reads more as thematic accent than live clock that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The motivation is stated in paragraph 6 ("I had come back to recover stolen memories") and dramatized across the arc: grandmother's glassy eyes and fragments (paragraph 8–9) drive the career and return, the confession is required to unlock the ring, and the ending accepts partial recovery ("not everything...enough to begin a repair"). Friction between desire and cost (must admit personal failure) earns the stake. Three beats, closure-active, with visible price.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Crisp nostalgia" is announced in the final line and threaded throughout via selective sensory detail (salt-and-graphite smudge feels "correct," brine-preserved apples as "small moons," grandmother's braid-knot lesson). Tone modulates from investigative precision (slate, mirrors) to intimate memory (warmth in glove, voice as bubbles). The final line restates the phrase explicitly, which slightly reduces emergent resonance, but the tone charges the closure image and coheres under pressure.</comment>
