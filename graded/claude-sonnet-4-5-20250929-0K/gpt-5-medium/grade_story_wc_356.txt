<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The herbalist's ambition and sensitivity are established early and shape key choices (planting the seed, inhaling the stink to "map every note"). Internal contradiction appears when ambition encounters village fear, and the final shift from "ambition softened into stewardship" feels earned by the on-page work. However, interiority occasionally slips into elevated register ("olfactorily sensitive, cursed and blessed") and the embodied struggle at peak moments (the bloom unfurling) leans descriptive rather than showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening lines; the lens reads Accumulative/Textural with pressure building through planting, tending, and the bloom's climactic arrival. Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (the bridges steady, ambition softens into stewardship) with felt cost (the village "flinched as if truths had teeth," the protagonist endures the stink). The tightening is legible: restless motion → planted seed → feral bloom → equilibrium restored. One persistent constraint (olfactory sensitivity) shapes tactics and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The treetop village is vividly particular—boards sway "like breathing," six ropes converge, pots "sing nervous hymns"—and the setting constrains choice (planting at the bridge's heart, the trembling ropes unsettling sleep). Sensory hierarchy is filtered through the protagonist's olfactory bias ("taste the world through currents of scent"). The corpse flower's smell is rendered with specificity ("rank yet promising revelation," "feral and cavernous") and the bridge-as-body recurs to charge the final steadying. Micro-setting (the cradle of woven air roots) and spatial choreography remain clear.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (cultivate serenity within motion to restore village equilibrium) is signaled early and tightens when children wake panicked and bridges tremble. Escalation under the Accumulative lens proceeds through planting, guiding the bloom with "slow drums and leaf-tied chimes," and the climactic unfurling where "the village flinched." The protagonist's agency drives every beat (planting, inhaling, mapping the smell) and the final steadying forecloses the path of restless ambition with visible cost ("ambition softened into stewardship"). One meaningful deepening occurs when the protagonist inhales fully, translating rot into balance, which reweights the village's shared breath.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme (knowledge flows beneath choices; grief perfumes the way home) emerges organically from the grandmother's note, the corpse flower's stink, and the protagonist's olfactory sensitivity. The final image (journal as "map of breath," ambition softening) offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in the flies' lesson ("rot is a road back to balance") and the village's collective exhalation. However, "undercurrent of wisdom" and "serenity within motion" echo prompt language, and the thematic articulation occasionally tilts toward assertion ("I told them my motive straight as rope") rather than arising purely from particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature (olfactory filtering, herbalist's idiom: "storm sap," "undercurrent of wisdom"). Diction is purposefully elevated and lyric ("the tide's thought," "breath arranged like steppingstones") without head-hopping. However, under peak stress (the bloom unfurling) the voice sustains its elevated register without compression, and some phrasing reads ornamental rather than voice-urgent ("feral and cavernous" is vivid but slightly staged). Free indirect moments are clean, and the journaling frame anchors reflection in present action.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high and mostly coherent ("root seeking stone," "patience hung homes," "wildflower hush"), but in high-pressure beats metaphor sometimes stacks without propulsion: "the smell unfurled, feral and cavernous" is vivid yet does not advance the beat causally. Template cadence appears in paired structures ("then the owls, then the silence") and repetitive clause openings ("I planted… I built… I told… I journalize"). A paraphrase loop occurs between "knowledge does not sit still but flows beneath choices" and "undercurrent of wisdom braided through rot." Information density is generally high, but these artifacts dull momentum at closure's edge.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The treetop-village + olfactory-herbalist + corpse-flower synthesis is specific and non-obvious, and the transformation of ambition-into-stewardship through communal breath feels earned in hindsight. Emotional truth (grief as perfume, rot as teacher) avoids sentimentality. However, the core arc—outsider plants controversial remedy, village resists, bloom restores equilibrium—follows a recognizable healing-practitioner template without fully subverting it. The lyric idiom ("the tide's thought," "serenity within motion") distinguishes voice, but prompt-adjacent phrasing ("undercurrent of wisdom") suggests partial derivation rather than full transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The herbalist's choices drive every major beat: planting the seed at the bridge's heart (setup), building the cradle and guiding the bloom with drums (development), and inhaling fully to map the stink (payoff). Ambition is signaled early, tested by village fear, and transformed into stewardship at closure. The trait constrains tactics (olfactory sensitivity enables translation) and the final softening forecloses the path of restless striving with visible cost. All three gates are met, and causal pressure is strong.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The seed appears in the opening third (parcel delivery), drives the planting and tending beats, and its bloom unfurls at the climax to steady the bridges. It returns with reweighted meaning: initially "dark as storm sap and heavy as an unspoken word," it becomes the agent of equilibrium ("the bridges steadied as though held by listening"). The object is handled on the page (planted, cradled, guided) and its smell is mapped across multiple beats. Strong causal linkage and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The undercurrent of wisdom is named early ("knowledge does not sit still but flows beneath choices") and shapes the grandmother's note and the protagonist's interpretation of the flies' lesson ("rot is a road back to balance"). However, it functions more as thematic claim than on-page constraint: the protagonist does not face a choice between wisdom-paths or lose an option by choosing the undercurrent. The concept charges the final image (journal as "map of breath") but does not narrow tactics. Present across setup and payoff; missing middle development constrains score.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Olfactory sensitivity is signaled in the opening paragraph and enables the protagonist to "taste the world through currents of scent," translate the corpse flower's stink ("mapping every note"), and hear the flies' lesson. It constrains the planting method (tea-soaked air roots "to temper the future stink") and drives the climactic inhalation ("I inhaled until my eyes watered"). The trait shapes tactics across beats and participates in closure (mapping breath), though the cost is felt more than visible. All three gates met.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Journalizing is named as a family custom in the opening third and recurs at the tending phase ("I journalize as I work, sketching… a spiral that mirrors the bridge"). The final journal entry ("recorded that night as a map of breath") registers the closure turn. However, the act does not drive major turns—the planting, bloom, and inhalation would proceed without it—and could be replaced with another recording method (oral recitation, memory) without structural loss. Present in setup and payoff; functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The doodling custom appears in the opening third ("a family custom of doodling maps that turn into recipes") and the grandmother's doodles guide the planting ("reading Grandmother's doodles like steps across water"). The method is signaled and its mechanics matter (spirals breaking into wavelets and roots as instructions). However, the guidance is summary-level ("sketched instructions that looked like dances") rather than on-page constraint, and the method does not reappear at closure. Two gates (setup, development) met; missing payoff caps score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The treetop village is anchored early (homes "hung from patience," boards sway) and pressures every beat: the trembling bridges unsettle sleep (inciting incident), the bridge's heart becomes the planting site (spatial constraint), and the steadying of the bridges marks closure ("bridges steadied as though held by listening"). The setting supplies resources (six-rope convergence, air roots) and the micro-environment (hung pots, swaying) charges the final equilibrium. All three gates met with strong causal linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"The turning of the tide's thought" is named early as the village's decision-making moment and recurs at the council scene near closure ("At the council, during the turning of the tide's thought"). The timeframe shapes urgency (the bridges' restlessness demands response) and the council's timing matters. However, the phrase functions more as cultural idiom than a live clock that alters tactics beat-to-beat; elapsed time between planting and bloom is compressed without tightening pressure. Present in setup and payoff; lyric reprise reweights the stake.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation is stated explicitly ("to cultivate serenity within motion") in the opening third and tested when neighbors whisper that "ambition twists the nose and the village, both." The protagonist dramatizes the desire through planting, guiding the bloom, and the climactic inhalation, accepting the village's fear as cost. The final softening ("ambition softened into stewardship") registers the transformation with visible cost (foreclosing restless striving). Friction between ambition and communal fear creates pressure. All three gates met.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Tone is signaled early through lyric idiom ("patience," "hush between gusts," "swaying lives") and modulates with pressure: the bloom unfurls "feral and cavernous" (tonal shift to crisis), then the "wildflower hush" arrives at closure when "the bridges steadied as though held by listening." The phrase "wildflower hush" charges the final image and coherence is sustained. However, the tone remains somewhat static in register—elevated and meditative throughout—without sharp compression under peak stress. Present across all three gates with purposeful modulation at closure.</comment>
