<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rafi's interiority is embodied and specific—the photograph fold showing bodies at edges, vent fans triggering freeze response, somatic markers enacted on the page. Internal contradictions surface through wanting "to anchor optimism in realism" while carrying trauma that still locks his body. The gull scene dramatizes his freeze response and recovery through Leda's voice without therapy-speak intruding at the peak moment. Minor: the niece conversation risks over-articulation ("rooms that storms could enter without wrecking") but the photograph handling earns the reflection.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at closure. The story accumulates pressure through repeated encounters with triggers (vent fans, helicopter, photograph unfolding) and converges on the final image: "folded the photograph once more, the paper new only in the way his hands now held it, steady as a trellis in wind." Cost is visible—he can now hold the wound steadily rather than avoid it, foreclosing the path of pure avoidance. Orientation anchors cleanly in the opening paragraph (arboretum, cliff, Rafi). The mid-story gull rescue provides one meaningful tightening where freeze becomes functional action, and the logbook exhibit deepens stakes by externalizing his internal project. The photograph's final handling charges prior material with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The arboretum environment constrains multiple choices: fog scrubbing for citrus, seed selection for "hotter years," glass tightening before storms. The cliff path supplies the gull encounter that triggers the key freeze moment. The photograph (micro-setting as object) charges the final image when its handling shifts from wound to scar. Spatial choreography remains clean across the greenhouse wings, cliff path, and caretaker's room. Sensory detail is purposeful—"salt and sap," "diesel and kelp"—and filtered through Rafi's priorities (watering, grafts, trellises).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: learning to build "rooms that storms could enter without wrecking" (integrating trauma without avoidance). The gull rescue provides one meaningful tightening where the freeze response is met and worked through via somatic markers, narrowing the path of pure avoidance. The photograph's final folding at closure shows agency as endurance with visible cost—he can now hold the memory steadily. The helicopter trigger during the gull scene escalates pressure under the Accumulative lens by layering past and present. Minor: the niece conversation adds thematic depth but does not create a second reversal; it deepens rather than turns, which fits the inferred lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: grafts as seams "neat and brave as stitches," plants breathing in the caretaker's room, "doors, not denial." The ending offers a non-literal answer—hands holding the photograph "steady as a trellis in wind"—that reweights the opening's "patient tasks" and ocean that "said nothing false." The logbook exhibit externalizes the theme (weather → choice → care → shelter) without stating a moral. Recurring images (grafts, trellises, breathing plants) accumulate pressure and charge the final moment. Minor: "optimism means doors, not denial" edges toward articulation but is immediately grounded in the grafts image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is consistent and character-specific: "trimming the madrona, sketching notes to himself in pencil that left the least arrogant mark." POV distance is stable; Rafi's knowledge stays bounded. Diction remains within his idiom ("pearl of stillness, weightless and strong" fits a gardener's metaphoric vocabulary). The Leda dialogue is brief, purposeful, and advances the gull rescue without explaining. Brief dialogue with the niece and tourists feels natural. Figurative language is dense but mostly voice-motivated and legible ("skein of air snarling into the old pitch of rotors"). Minor: "somatic markers" is clinical but established early as counselor-taught vocabulary.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; opening lyric compression ("breathed salt and sap") shifts to grounded action ("scrubbing fog from panes"). Information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs (character, world, theme). The gull rescue beat propels cleanly without loops. Minor deductions: "He recognized how quietly talented she was" slightly scaffolds what the prior sentence showed. "Cut this knot, hold here, breathe" risks list cadence but the urgency justifies compression. A few figurative phrases stack in reflective beats ("memory loading like an old program, stuttering frames") without obscuring clarity. Zero major loops or filter-verb stacks in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of arboretum-as-recovery and post-automation lighthouse keeper absence offers a fresh angle on trauma-integration narratives. Specific details (somatic markers, grafts as stitches, tide tables paired with succulents, seeds "that took wind as a partner") feel particular to this voice and world rather than generic PTSD recovery beats. The gull rescue transforms a familiar help-the-animal beat by making it the protagonist's own freeze-response test. The ending commits fully to quiet resonance without retreat into explanation. Risk: the piece leans into lyric accumulation and bets on the photograph's charged reprise, which pays off without obscuring causality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rafi (drone strike wedding survivor) present throughout; his trauma history shapes every major beat. Setup: photograph and freeze response introduced early. Development: freeze during gull rescue forces somatic marker use. Closure: final photograph handling shows hands "steady as a trellis" with visible cost (acceptance replaces avoidance). Causal pressure high; his choices drive the ending. Cost: must hold the wound rather than avoid it. Specific to this character (wedding, bride's gold dress). Beat involvement: photograph touch (×3 distinct), freeze response (×2), counselor training recalled, niece conversation. Irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Photograph introduced early ("single thing that made it through"), handled in pocket, unfolded mid-story ("bodies crowded the edges"), and returned with reweighted meaning in final paragraph ("the paper new only in the way his hands now held it"). Setup clear. Development: shapes his avoidance and wound-holding. Closure: directly anchors final image. Three distinct beats. Cost: each unfolding confronts trauma; final fold shows acceptance. Specific properties matter (crumpled, fold reveals bodies). High causal and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Pearl of stillness" appears once after gull rescue ("inside his sternum a pearl of stillness, weightless and strong") and implicitly in final paragraph's "steady" photograph handling. Setup absent; first appears ~60% through. Development: names the felt shift after the gull. Closure: echoed in "steady as a trellis." Lyric reprise reweights the stake (from freeze to stillness). Modest causal pressure; more thematic echo than tactical constraint. Cost connection: the stillness is earned by prior freeze-and-recovery. Replaceable phrasing but the resonance lifts it.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Quietly talented" applied to Rafi (opening: "quietly talented with grafts and trellises") and Leda (mid-story: "how quietly talented she was"). Setup early. Development: Rafi's grafting skill enables his recovery metaphor; Leda's skill enables the gull rescue that triggers his key moment. Closure: grafts as "neat and brave as stitches" charge the ending. Two characters, two beats. Cost: talent is paired with struggle (somatic work, patience). Specific constraint: his skill anchors his metaphoric vocabulary. Slight swappability ("skilled," "patient") but integration across beats is strong.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Freeze" is the pivot action. Setup: vent fans make him freeze. Development: helicopter sound during gull rescue triggers full freeze response, and Leda's voice guides him through. Closure: final photograph handling shows he no longer freezes but holds steadily. Three beats. High causal pressure—freeze defines his limitation and the gull beat is his breakthrough. Cost visible: freeze nearly prevents helping the gull; overcoming it forecloses pure avoidance. Irreplaceable; swapping for "hesitate" would gut the trauma mechanics. Specific to PTSD physiology.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Through somatic markers" signaled early ("learned through somatic markers from a counselor") and enacted twice: naming sensations after vent-fan freeze, and during gull rescue ("noting through somatic markers the loosening in his shoulders"). Setup present. Development: method enables recovery from freeze during the gull beat. Closure: implicit in his steady final handling. Two on-page uses. Mechanics shown (name sensations, wait until they shrink). Cost: requires conscious effort under stress. Moderate causal pressure; shapes his tactics but could be replaced with another grounding technique. Specific vocabulary elevates but not fully indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Arboretum supplies multiple constraints: fog scrubbing for citrus, glass tightening before storms, cliff path for gull encounter, logbook exhibit space, caretaker's room for closure. Setup immediate (opening paragraph). Development: environment enables seed-selection project, gull rescue, and logbook pairing. Closure: "plants breathed" in caretaker's room anchors final paragraph. High beat involvement (×5 distinct uses). Causal pressure: cliff path and gull directly enable key freeze moment. Cost: work is seasonal and storm-bound. Specific properties (seaside, glass roofs, succulent wing) matter. Strong integration but one swap (botanical garden) would preserve most function.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the last lighthouse keeper" establishes post-automation present and supplies the niece subplot. Setup early (second paragraph). Development: automated lighthouse contrasts Rafi's human care; niece brings logbooks that externalize his theme. Closure: "lighthouse blinked its unmanned blessing" in final section echoes the frame. Modest causal pressure—time anchor does not tighten decisions. The automation theme enriches but does not drive turns. Replaceable with another recent-past marker. Two beats (lighthouse mention, niece). Late (~50%) for the niece element. Lyric reprise lifts it slightly but lacks cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"To anchor optimism in realism" stated mid-story ("He wanted to anchor optimism in realism, to plant species that would survive the hotter years yet still bloom") and dramatized throughout. Setup implicit in his job choice for "patient tasks." Development: seed collection, intern teaching, gull rescue (applying learned markers = realistic method), logbook exhibit. Closure: photograph handling is anchored optimism—he holds the wound steadily, not denying it. Friction visible: optimism vs. freeze response; doors vs. denial. High beat involvement. Cost: must confront triggers to move forward. Specific desire drives action. Strong integration.</comment>
