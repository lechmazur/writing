<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The heiress's motivation is concrete and her choices drive pressure, particularly the proof-by-contradiction wager and the board call. Interior reflection is filtered through "devotedly observant" and the rosewood nib's sensory cue, though the father flashback occupies space without altering present tactics. The caretaker's arc from weary defense to "gently astonished" wonder is earned, and his confession about wanting to "smooth the sea" reads as genuine character work rather than convenience. Micro-choices under pressure (touching the lever, resting the pen nib) reveal hierarchy without therapy-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens is Causal with accumulative texture: the journalist's cut line → climb → wager → lens closing → world stalling → board call forms a because/therefore chain. Closure is Decisive Change with visible cost: she commits the family apparatus to open data and reorients power ("gravity is a fine servant and a poor god"), foreclosing the old complicity. Orientation anchors by line 2 (spiral observatory, heiress, father's pen nib). The wager functions as a clean reversal that narrows options and the ending call reweights all prior material with social cost on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The observatory's echoing dome, spiral stairs, and lens-as-eyelid constrain movement and charge the closure (lens reopening = "warm inquiry"). The rosewood pen nib functions as micro-setting: its cedar scent anchors memory, its reflection delivers the father's mercy insight, and its resting position bookends the wager. Sensory hierarchy is consistent (smell, visual echo, wind "like snow and old photographs") and filtered through the heiress's observant lens. Spatial choreography (stairs, console, lever, printer downstairs) remains clear and the environment pressures choice throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: discover whether the device manipulates news flows. The wager tightens options meaningfully—assume no effect, seal shutters, wait for evidence—and the "emergency light blinks, papers stall" delivers a felt reversal. The board call is protagonist agency with visible cost: she accepts scrutiny and resource constraint ("sanctuary for open data") on the page. The caretaker's lever-touch is his renunciation, and the heiress's choice to believe "just enough to act" shows moral calculus under pressure. One tightening and one deepening escalate cleanly under the causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: the device as moon-tide metaphor, "orbits of regret," and the final "gravity is a fine servant and a poor god" line all grow from on-page action rather than assertion. The rosewood nib's reprise ("a small spike" at closure) reweights the opening star-chart/deadline motif without moralizing. The journalist's fear as "telling the truth early" and the caretaker's confession avoid thesis statements. The ending offers a resonant answer—transparency over control—without a stated moral, and the "warm inquiry" image charges the closure with non-literal meaning rooted in prior light/lens imagery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single-POV first-person maintains stable distance and perceptual signature: "devotedly observant," metaphors rooted in newsprint and astronomy, diction balanced between lyric compression and clarity. The caretaker's direct speech ("You must be her, the family that wrapped the world in ink like a gull in netting") carries distinct idiom. Free-indirect blending (the dome "repeats harmless in a way that sounds like a cough") is clean. Rhythm modulates under pressure (short clauses during the wager, longer reflection on mercy) without head-hopping. "Proof by contradiction" phrasing fits the heiress's observant logic; purposeful compression ("I have spent my life among dramatists of weather and wars") is voice-consistent and legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Information density is high and most lines advance stakes or atmosphere. Rhythm varies purposefully and propulsion is steady through the wager climax. However, repetitive sentence stems appear in the reflection zones ("I am devotedly observant," "I ask," "I tell," "I believe," "I call") and the dome's echoing is invoked three times without escalation. Minor paraphrase: "hollow hush that feels like testimony" and later "breathes, every step returning...as echo and doubt" restate without added pressure. The final pen-nib line ("a small spike") lands cleanly. Overall clarity and momentum are maintained, but template cadence and synonym cycles lower the band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise—device nudging headlines like lunar tides—offers a fresh synthesis of media manipulation and observatory science. The proof-by-contradiction wager is a non-obvious tactic that grows from the heiress's observant logic. The rosewood pen nib as compass/spike and "orbits of regret" metaphor feel specific rather than stock. Risk-taking in the lyric compression and extended metaphor field heightens stakes without obscuring causality. The ending's "gravity is a fine servant and a poor god" avoids platitude through prior accumulation. Transformation test passes: changing names and places would alter the emotional specificity of newsprint legacy and observatory setting.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setup: established in line 2. Development: her wager constrains the caretaker's choice and her board call alters tactics. Payoff: the call to the board and reopening the lens are her decisive acts. Beat involvement spans wager proposal, waiting, and call; causal pressure narrows the caretaker's options and her own. Closure linkage is direct: her call forecloses the old power model. Cost is visible (scrutiny, resource constraint). Early signal, multi-beat presence, causal role, and closure participation with irreplaceability (her family apparatus is the lever) push this high.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Setup: introduced line 3 with sensory detail (cedar scent). Development: rested on console as compass during wager, reflection cues father's mercy insight. Payoff: final line "a small spike" reweights the opening star-chart metaphor. Three beats (opening, reflection, closure reprise) with lyric resonance. However, mid-scene use is passive (resting, not wielded) and the nib does not constrain a choice—it anchors memory. Swappability is moderate (another heirloom could serve). Lyric-resonance allowance and closure reprise lift it into mid-6s, but lack of on-page causal pressure prevents higher.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setup: implicit in journalist's fear and device premise. Development: caretaker's confession "orbits of regret, how small choices circle great ones until friction pulls them into flame" articulates the concept mid-scene. Payoff: the final "gravity" metaphor reweights the orbit image. Present in dialogue and ending, but functions more as thematic echo than a tactical constraint. The concept does not narrow options on the page; the wager and device evidence drive choices. Two-gate presence (development + payoff) with thematic resonance but no direct causal work caps it near 6.0.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Setup: stated line 4 "I am devotedly observant, a habit that began with proofreading margins." Development: filters perception throughout (proofreading → studying skies, noticing the dome's echoes). Payoff: the caretaker mirrors it ("devotedly observant now") before the ending. The trait colors narration but does not constrain a visible choice with cost—observation enables the wager logic, but the trait itself is not tested or forfeited. Label-only risk mitigated by consistent perceptual filter. Two-gate presence (setup + payoff echo) without a middle tradeoff limits the score to mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setup: signaled via wager proposal ("let me intervene by sealing its shutters"). Development: the caretaker's lever-touch enacts the intervention, and the world's stalling response proves its effect. Payoff: reopening the lens and the board call are interventions that redefine power flows. The action drives the major turn (papers stall) and the closure (open-data mandate). Three beats with causal pressure, closure linkage, and irreplaceability (removing "intervene" breaks the wager's logic and the ending's stakes). Cost is visible on the page (resource constraint, scrutiny).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setup: explicitly invoked line 23 "through proof by contradiction, I offer him my wager." Development: the method structures the wager's logic (assume no effect, test by sealing, await contradiction). Payoff: the contradiction lands (papers stall), validating the method and forcing the board call. The method is signaled, its mechanics matter, and it shapes the protagonist's attempt. Two beats (proposal + result) with causal role and closure linkage. Specificity is high (this exact logical frame is irreplaceable), but late first appearance (~mid-scene) and single-move use prevent higher band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Setup: anchored line 2 (spiral, dome above clouds). Development: echoing dome repeats "harmless" as a cough, stairs constrain the climb, console and lever enable the wager, downstairs printer signals the world's response. Payoff: reopening the lens delivers "daylight pours like warm inquiry." The setting pressures every choice (access, echo, instrument proximity) and charges the final image. Three beats with micro-setting depth (body in space, tool adjacency). Irreplaceability is high: the observatory's isolation and instrument are plot-essential. Early anchor, multi-beat involvement, causal role, and closure charge push this into high 7s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Setup: title phrase and line 1 anchor the sequence. Development: climb, wager, waiting, and phones-not-buzzing track elapsed pressure. Payoff: the board call occurs in the aftermath window. Time is present across beats and tightens decision (waiting for evidence, acting on it). However, the clock is loose—no minute-by-minute pressure or ticking countdown that alters tactics. Two-gate presence (setup + payoff) with accumulative tightening but no precise constraint on moves. Mid-6s for coherent temporal flow without high-stakes urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setup: stated line 5 "I have come to discover hidden truths, or at least the shape they cast when light crosses them." Development: wager enacts the discovery attempt, and the world's stalling reveals the truth. Payoff: the board call commits to transparency ("open data") as the actualized discovery. The motivation is dramatized through choice (wager, call) and friction (risk of being "merely a visitor" vs. proving complicity). Three beats with visible cost (scrutiny, resource loss). Early signal, causal pressure, and closure linkage with irreplaceability elevate this solidly into 7s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Setup: established early via lyric compression ("hollow hush that feels like testimony," "devotedly observant") and wry asides ("dramatist...falls as heavy as a gavel"). Development: modulates through wager (playful logic) and caretaker's confession (solemn wonder). Payoff: "warm inquiry" and "small spike" balance gravity and lightness in the final lines. Tone is coherent through turns and charges the ending image. The blend of elevated diction and dry humor (e.g., "because gravity is a fine servant and a poor god") is consistent and voice-specific. Three beats with closure charge and no tonal breaks.</comment>
