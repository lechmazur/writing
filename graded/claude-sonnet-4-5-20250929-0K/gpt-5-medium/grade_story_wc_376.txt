<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The calligrapher POV is consistent with embodied interiority ("I felt my shoulders sag, leaves in shade") and micro-choices under pressure (refusing to gild the lie, withholding service until archives open). Internal contradiction appears when the protagonist both wilts near dishonesty yet enables the vault system by continuing leaf-post work without resistance until discovering the archive. The final choice to force collective opening is earned by accumulated pressure, though the protagonist's shift from passive observation to active lever feels slightly abrupt. Emotional embodiment is strong throughout with leaf-metaphor consistency.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural with Situational elements. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise transitioning to communal action) with visible cost—the protagonist refuses solo control and forces collective witness, reweighting the city's relationship to archived truth. Orientation anchors who/where/what by line 2 (calligrapher, greenhouse city, leaf-post). One meaningful tightening occurs when the protagonist discovers the vault, escalates through the strike, and culminates in collective opening. The postmaster's nod and the breathing jars provide felt cost. Causality holds under the accumulative lens: discovery → withheld service → gathered crowd → opened vault.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse city pressures all choices: toxic sky mandates enclosure, humid environment enables leaf-post, condensate becomes the vault's mechanism. The zinc postal plate fragment functions as both tool and key, constraining the route and charging the final opening. Sensory detail is purposeful—"condensate beaded along rails like punctuation," "air turned sharp with a confession." Spatial choreography tracks cleanly through fern hospital, hatch, vault chamber, and return. The micro-setting (bench, gutters, jars) supplies the logic for where truth collects and how it might be released, charging the closure image when "jars breathe."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: finding lost conversations vs. the city's need to suppress volatile truths. One meaningful tightening when the protagonist discovers the vault system and realizes complicity, then escalates by withholding leaf-post service. The strike forces the city to choose visibility over managed silence. Agency is clear in refusal and in forcing collective opening. Cost is legible: the protagonist forecloses solo artistic practice ("no more leaf-post until archives reopen voluntarily") and risks social standing. The postmaster's trembling hands and the councilwoman's arrival add secondary pressure that converges at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the vault conceit: candor deferred becomes candor weaponized; the city's emotional plumbing system externalizes the cost of managed truth. The leaf-as-truth-detector motif accumulates pressure without becoming allegorical checklist. Final image—"we measured survival together in truths"—reweights the premise without moralizing: collective witness replaces archival control. Subtext operates in the postmaster's "moved" and the protagonist's willingness to name the lie. No therapy-speak intrudes. The "Pluviary of Spoken Things" label at closure condenses theme into charged image, earning the conceptual repricing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV distance is stable first-person with tight access to sensory metaphor ("word moved tasted like mildew"). Voice is distinct through botanical syntax ("leaves in shade," "wilted near dishonesty") and maintains consistency under pressure. Brief dialogue serves action and subtext: the postmaster's evasive "moved" and the protagonist's candor-test "where, softly." Psychic distance modulates purposefully when the protagonist shifts from intimate observation to collective "we" only at closure after the community gathers. Minor register drift into civic abstraction ("prevent riots, preserved reputations") in the postmaster's speech, acceptable as his defensive rhetoric.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and supports pressure, with short beats during confrontation and longer accumulative sentences during discovery. Information density is high—most lines advance world, character, and stake. Two paraphrase loops lower momentum: "Words unsent collect in my ribs like dust in louvers, and their absence dries everything I touch" restates the candor-as-water metaphor already established. Filter-verb stack in mid-section ("I lifted one and listened, and I heard... I uncorked another") acceptable as procedural rhythm. Some elevated figuration ("reefed with arrows," "punctuation waiting to make sense") verges on overwriting but remains legible. No template cadence or synonym churn; closure image is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The greenhouse-city-as-emotional-plumbing synthesis is fresh and follows its logic without retreat: leaf-post as truth-test, condensate as captured confession, vault as civic pressure valve. The calligrapher-as-lever metaphor transforms the artist-as-witness trope through specific world mechanics (zinc escutcheons, spore couriers, citronella sprigs). The vault discovery and strike escalation feel earned in hindsight. Risk-taking in the dense botanical metaphor system and accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The ending refuses neat resolution—toxic sky persists, yet the Pluviary becomes a shared responsibility—offering complexity without false equivalence.</comment>
