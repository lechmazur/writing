<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The gravestone carver's interior life is densely rendered through embodied choices (ribbon selection, chisel pacing, depth calibration responding to the father's steadying hand). Internal contradiction appears in the tension between fierce meditation and the loosening invited by poem marks. The father's arc—choosing his daughter's kite poem, finding breath that does not shatter—earns its Earned Stasis with visible cost. Minor deduction: the mother's spectral presence occasionally risks therapy-speak ("lessons arrived as drafts") but mostly stays concrete through butterflies and greenhouse creaks.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final kite curve reweights the migration, ribbons, and collective grief premise with undeniable pressure and felt cost (the father's loaf, the seasonal arc completed). Orientation anchors promptly (greenhouse, dusk, carver's tools by line 2). One escalation beat—storm testing the roof, nothing breaks—deepens the grief-as-structure motif. Cost is legible in the father's steadied hand and the carved pauses. Minus 0.2 for slight lens drift in mid-section between lyric accumulation and causal ribbon-use.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The greenhouse functions as micro-setting that constrains and charges: condensation planets, cracked roof admitting butterflies, lettuce beds steadying the father, broken vents delivering spectral drafts. Sensory detail is purposeful and POV-filtered (dirt path "glowed faintly, as if the floor remembered sunlight the way skin remembers touch"). The potting bench serves as recurring anchor across beats. Spatial choreography remains clear despite the weeks-long span. The butterflies' feet as "commas trembling with the authority of mercy" teeters toward overwriting but stays within the established lyric register.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—discover the shape of collective grief without breaking it—is signaled early and tightened through the father's kite-poem choice, the storm that spares seedlings, and the final spare curve. Agency appears in measured choices: chisel depth responding to the father's steadying, softening syllables where butterflies land, retracing curves wasted by haste. One meaningful deepening when the father asks how the carver bears so many names and receives the ribbons-keep-moving answer. Cost is felt but not maximally legible on the page; the father's steadying and the carver's nightly returns imply endurance without a sharp forfeiture moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: grief migrates in widening rings, movement as steadied returning replaces progress, silence around names lets roots find earth's gaps. The ribbons, butterflies, and greenhouse interweave without thesis statement. The final kite curve offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the collective-grief question. Minor penalty: "movement is the shape of our collective grief, not progress" edges toward direct thematic summary, though the mother's breath voice somewhat dramatizes it. The father's crumbs and poems as offerings avoid sentimentality through concrete staging.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited; perceptual signature is consistent (carver notices tide rhythms, root metaphors, spectral drafts). Diction is elevated but coherent within the lyric mode taught early ("thundering calm," "woven ribbon roll," "orange river north"). The father's single line of dialogue ("if I knew any words strong enough to hold the date") reads naturally and the carver's offer integrates action with minimal filter verbs. Minus 0.4 for occasional register drift into abstract philosophizing ("meaning learns to sit at the table") that risks losing the carver's grounded idiom under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings shift. Information density is high (most lines do two jobs). However, figurative density in high-pressure beats risks overwriting: "spectral mentorship sharper than any chisel," "butterflies…a drifting congregation reminding me the work must stretch across the butterfly migration," "their feet were commas trembling with the authority of mercy." Three metaphor-heavy constructions cluster near closure without clear pattern payoff. Template cadence appears in mid-section ("She had taught me…," "While I carved…," "As the weeks traveled…") across adjacent paragraphs. Apply −0.6 for density + −0.4 for template stems = −1.0 total in Q7, plus disallow 9+ globally per artifact rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—gravestone carving, spectral maternal mentorship, butterfly migration as temporal frame, ribbons with poem notches—feels specific and non-obvious. The carver's occupation grounds the abstraction of collective grief in tactile choices (chisel depth, curve pacing). The father watching beside lettuce beds and choosing his daughter's kite poem transforms the trope of grieving parent into lived particularity. Risk-taking in lyric density and weeks-long span succeeds mostly, though the metaphor load in closure beats slightly obscures rather than heightens. No close echoes of famous lines detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character present early (line 2), drives middle choices (ribbon against stone, chisel depth responding to father's hand, retracing wasted curves), and completes the daughter's kite stone in the final image. Two or more beats; causal pressure in pacing decisions; closure linkage clear. Swappability moderate (another grief-adjacent artisan could work with edits). Cost tied to nightly returns and bearing many names is mentioned but not sharply dramatized. Gates: setup ✓, development ✓, payoff ✓. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure +1.0, cost +0.3 = ~+2.7; swappability −0.5, some summary −0.3 = net ~+1.9 → base 5.0 + 1.4 = 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Ribbon roll appears early (line 5), used to measure breath/silence, marked with poem notches for family custom, placed against stone to guide chisel (line 13), offered to father who chooses daughter's kite notch (line 21), and referenced in final exchange about ribbons keeping moving (line 29). Three or more beats; causal pressure (guides carving, mediates father's choice); closure participation (movement answer); high specificity (woven, notched, poem-marked). Gates: setup ✓, development ✓, payoff ✓. Early +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal +1.0, closure +1.0, specificity +0.5 = ~+4.5 → 7.5, minor swappability concern −0.3 = 7.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Spectral mentorship signaled early (mother died two winters ago, visits as hush line 10), appears in middle beats (gust steering from ornament line 15, lessons as drafts line 25, butterflies landing on exact syllable line 26, greenhouse creak in disapproval line 27), and the mother's "breathed" line about movement shapes the thematic closure (line 30). Concept constrains choices (carver adjusts depth, softens syllables, retraces curves per spectral cues). Gates: setup ✓, development ✓, payoff ✓. Early +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal +1.2, closure +1.0 = ~+4.2 → 7.2, but risk of abstraction ("spectral mentorship" as label) −0.4 = 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Attribute stated line 8 ("fiercely meditative when I work") but immediately qualified by "the poem marks loosen my grip." Fierce meditation arguably enables the careful chisel pacing and retracing of wasted curves (line 27), but the trait is more label than visible constraint with cost. No on-page moment where being fiercely meditative forecloses an option or incurs a price distinct from general carefulness. Gates: setup ✓, development weak, payoff absent. Early +0.4, one beat +0.4, label-only −0.5, no cost −0.4 = net −0.1 → base 3.0 + 2.1 = 5.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Retrace appears explicitly (line 11 "retrace their stories," line 27 "retrace a curve wasted by haste") and implicitly in the carver's method of setting letters shallow then deeper (line 23) and the father returning with new poem (line 28). Action shapes two beats and is tied to spectral correction. However, swappability is high: "revise," "refine," "re-carve" would function similarly. Gates: setup ✓, development ✓, payoff weak (final kite curve is new carving, not retracing). Early +0.5, two beats +0.9, swappability −0.6, payoff absent −0.6 = net +0.2 → base 3.0 + 3.2 = 6.2.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Family custom introduced line 6 (trading favorite poems at dinner), notches on ribbon carry poem lines (line 6), and the method extends into greenhouse when carver invites father to choose a notch (line 21) and they "trade favorite poems as if the table had stretched" (line 22). Father returns with new poem from daughter's notebook (line 28). Method enables the father's kite-poem choice, a key turn. Gates: setup ✓, development ✓, payoff ✓. Early +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal +0.8, closure participation +0.7 = ~+3.0 → 6.0, minor summary-only concern (dinner itself off-page) −0.1 = 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Greenhouse at dusk anchors line 1, supplies condensation planets (line 12), cracked roof admitting butterflies (line 17), lettuce beds steadying father (line 19), broken vents delivering spectral drafts (line 25), and withstands storm to spare seedlings (line 27). Setting constrains choices (spatial intimacy allows father to stand and choose, greenhouse hush wraps them) and charges final image (ash gold evening, daughter's stone finished there line 31). Gates: setup ✓, development ✓, payoff ✓. Early +0.8, three beats +1.4, causal +1.2, closure +1.2, irreplaceability +0.6 = ~+5.2 → 8.2, minor postcard risk in "glass ribs singing like tide" −0.6 = 7.6.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Timeframe introduced line 9 (butterflies began orange river north last week), spans "weeks" (line 24), and concludes "last of the butterflies lifted…one ash gold evening" when daughter's stone is finished (line 31). Time tightens pacing (nightly returns line 24, storm mid-season line 27) and the migration functions as both deadline and metaphor for grief's movement. Gates: setup ✓, development ✓, payoff ✓. Early +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal +0.8, closure +1.0 = ~+3.3 → 6.3, but weeks-long span risks vagueness (no sharp clock pressure in individual scenes) +0.3 lyric-resonance allowance = 6.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Motivation stated line 3 ("discover the shape of collective grief without breaking it"), dramatized in choices to set letters shallow then deeper (line 23), carve pauses (line 25), soften syllables (line 26), and answer father's question with ribbons-keep-moving (line 30). Desire drives carving method and response to spectral cues. Gates: setup ✓, development ✓, payoff ✓. Early +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal +1.0, closure +0.8 = ~+3.8 → 6.8, but motivation occasionally told ("I promised the air" line 11) rather than purely embodied −0.5 = 6.3.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Tone established line 1 ("thundering calm"), sustained through "greenhouse wrapped us" (line 20), "hush of my mother approved" (line 23), storm that does not break panes (line 27), and "ash gold evening" final image (line 31). Calm modulates with pressure (storm, father's question) without breaking coherence. Tone charges closure by framing the spare kite curve as both quiet and monumental. Gates: setup ✓, development ✓, payoff ✓. Early +0.7, coherence across turns +1.2, closure charge +1.4, specificity +0.5 = ~+3.8 → 6.8, some decorative echo ("thundering" risks oxymoron cliché) −0.2, but strong payoff recovers +0.8 = 7.4.</comment>
