<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The vagrant poet's interiority is richly embodied through sensory action—jarring sounds, winding the music box—and the final choice to "keep capturing sounds...only until the village learned to cup its own palms" shows renunciation with visible cost. Internal contradiction appears when he claims to hold air together yet fears his trade is obsolete, driving the arc. Minor slip: the widow and village remain lightly sketched, functioning more as pressure sources than fully realized secondary characters, but at this length and with clear spatial choreography that is acceptable.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the poet promises to stop jarring once the village learns to listen, forecloses his old trade, and leaves windows open to "invite tomorrow"—a visible cost and stance shift. The accumulative/textural lens holds throughout: density increases from solo jarring to village gathering, pattern breaks when the music box releases notes into jars, and the final cadence ("ticking like a lighthouse for the quiet we had chosen together") reweights the dominant stake with felt cost. Orientation anchors by line ~80 (loft, poet, dawn, jars on sill). One minor seam: the widow's backstory about her husband building the loft arrives late but pays off at closure, so causality remains intact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The loft's "saltwood and rope" construction and sill-mounted jars constrain the poet's method and charge the final image (box resting on sill, windows open). Sensory selection is sharp—"iron and tea," "sea sugar"—and filtered through the poet's material poverty and sound-trade idiom. The music box's physical state (barnacled, rusted) alters tactics: he must wind it and wait for dawn wind to coax sound. Spatial choreography remains clear across loft-to-beach transition. Does not quite reach 8.5+ because the dunes themselves apply minimal tactical pressure beyond framing; the body and recurring objects (jars, box) do most of the work.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—becoming "the translator between generations"—is signaled early and tightens when the music box's melody "had kept returning alone, having lost its second voice." The poet's agency (choosing to open jars in sequence, arranging them "like vowels ready for breath") drives the village reconciliation and forecloses his old solitary trade with visible cost. One meaningful deepening: the widow's tune was grief; combined with jarred echoes it "became conversation." Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens. Does not reach 8.5+ because the escalation is a single decisive intensification rather than a compounding sequence, which is sufficient at this length but leaves no tactical trades visible mid-conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—redemption as "a clarity earned by listening until it hurt"—emerges from the music box/jar convergence and the widow's physical gesture pressing the box to her chest, not from assertion. The final image (box "ticking like a lighthouse for the quiet we had chosen together") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in the poet's refusal to hoard sound and the village's cautious barefoot approach. One motif (jars) recurs with reweighted meaning and constrains the poet's final choice. Quiet ending charged by particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout: "words alone kept slipping through," "melody...having lost its second voice to weather," POV-specific idiom that treats sound as currency. Psychic distance remains stable; no head-hopping. Purposeful compression and lyric patterning (parallelism in opening/closing "At dawn's earliest whistle") are taught early and legible at closure. Register occasionally drifts high ("positively wistful," "gleaned redemption") but remains voice-motivated in a poet-narrator. Dialogue absent. Rhythm modulates under pressure (short urgent clauses when opening jars, longer syntactic breaths at resolution). One slip: "lonesome splendor threaded through salt and sawdust" leans ornamental in a peak beat but does not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high and sentences layer action with atmosphere ("I corked it by reflex and held the glass to the light, and the light trembled as if reading a diary"). Rhythm varies purposefully. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor overwriting in figurative density: metaphors appear in most sentences of the village-gathering beat ("vowels ready for breath," "rescuing harmony like a child from an attic," "hinge between rooms") without full pattern-teaching, triggering ~−0.4. The closure beat remains clean. One stock phrase: "azi/positively wistful as if their cheeks had rehearsed a happy ache" feels slightly algorithmic but does not dull the final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of sound-jarring, lost melody, and intergenerational silence feels specific and non-obvious; the widow's husband embedding song in the loft's construction is a fresh inflection earned in hindsight. Trope of the reclusive artist transformed through the poet's material poverty and refusal to hoard. Risk-taking in lyric compression and patterned recurrence heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, warranting +0.3 within band. Does not reach 8.5+ because the "translator between generations" frame, while executed well, echoes familiar redemption-through-art templates; the story succeeds by grounding it in glass jars and barnacled gears rather than by reimagining the premise itself.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vagrant penny poet is present throughout, makes the key choices to open the jars in sequence and promise to stop once the village learns, and those decisions drive the closure. Early signal, three distinct beats (waking/jarring, discovering box, village gathering), causal pressure (his poverty and sound-trade shape tactics), closure linkage (his renunciation and promise). Specific and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Forgotten music box appears early (paragraph ~13), is handled physically (wound, opened, notes released), and its final state (resting on sill, ticking) charges the closure image. Used across three beats: discovery, wind-and-wait, village convergence. Causal pressure: its rusted state forces the poet to wait for dawn wind; its melody transforms the jars' meaning. Closure linkage strong. High irreplaceability and cost connection (widow's grief, husband's hidden song).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Gleaned redemption is stated once ("I gleaned redemption...as a clarity earned by listening until it hurt") and the poet's arc enacts it: listening to jarred sounds, merging them with the box's tune, achieving village reconciliation. It shapes the dominant stake and is present at closure conceptually. Develops one key turn (jar-box convergence). Modest causal pressure; could have been implicit without the label. Mid-band: necessary but not irreplaceable phrasing.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Positively wistful appears once to describe villagers' faces at the gathering. The trait colors the scene but does not constrain or enable a specific choice with cost. Functional presence (lyric echo of the poet's earlier longing), but swappable with similar affect descriptors. Lyric reprise from "truest wish" to village affect offers modest thematic charge. Two gates (development, payoff); no setup. Late signal and ornamental use limit upward range.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sweeten appears three times: final wish to "sweeten the static," carrying emptied vessels back to "sweeten the boards with sea sugar," implicit in the resolution's harmony. Shapes one key turn (poet's promise to stop jarring and let village learn) and is present at closure. Causal role modest; the concept threads through but could be replaced with "heal" or "bridge" with minor edits. All three gates met, two beats, closure linkage present, but middling irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Capturing sounds in glass jars is the poet's established trade, signaled immediately (paragraph ~4), governs his tactics throughout (choosing which sounds to jar, arranging jars for the village), and his renunciation of it ("only until the village learned to cup its own palms") is the closure cost. Mechanics matter: he uncorks to release, corks by reflex, arranges like vowels. Four beats minimum. Causal pressure high, closure linkage decisive, irreplaceability absolute. Cost tied directly to method.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Feral loft beneath the dunes is established early (paragraphs ~3–4), provides the sill for jars and the spatial anchor for the poet's solitary work, and its final state (windows open, purring, box on sill) charges the closure image. Two clear beats: solo work, return after gathering. Causal role: the loft's isolation enables the sound-jarring trade; its transformation (open windows inviting tomorrow) tracks the thematic shift. Solid irreplaceability and closure linkage, though the dunes themselves exert minimal tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>At dawn's earliest whistle frames the opening and closing paragraphs and times the wind's arrival that tilts the music box lid, enabling the sound release. Time signal is early and lyric reprise at closure reweights the stake. Two beats (opening anchor, wind arrival). Modest causal pressure: dawn wind is necessary but not tracked as a tightening clock. The phrase charges the final image through echo. All three gates, but swappable timeframe with minor edits keeps it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>To become the translator between generations is stated as "truest wish" early (paragraph ~10), governs the poet's choice to gather the village and open jars in sequence, and the closure renunciation (teaching them to "cup its own palms") directly addresses this motive with visible cost. Three beats: wish declaration, village invitation, final promise. Causal pressure solid, closure linkage strong. Friction between the poet's fear of obsolescence and his fulfillment visible on the page. High integration, slight deduction for being told once rather than fully dramatized before acting.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lonesome splendor is named once (paragraph ~22) but the tone pervades: solitary loft imagery, "empty pockets," sounds "small as a bead," village gathering described with restrained wonder, final image of shared quiet. Coherent through all turns, modulates from isolation to communal listening without breaking register. Charges the final image ("ticking like a lighthouse for the quiet we had chosen together"). Two gates (development in accumulation, payoff at closure); no early setup label. Strong tonal control and closure linkage elevate despite late naming.</comment>
