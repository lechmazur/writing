<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The prism-minded archivist maintains a consistent interior lens—angles, refraction, vigilance—through specific micro-choices (trying crowns, refusing glitter, staring at absences). Embodied emotion appears in tactile beats ("iron band warms with consensus," "safes reopened in my ribs"), but the protagonist's journey reads more as a tour through wonders than a struggle with contradictory impulses. The final choice to "leave with safes reopened" and "say nothing" carries thematic weight but lacks a visible tradeoff or foreclosed alternative that would demonstrate internal conflict under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes orientation (archivist, grotto, tilt-hour) by the first third and follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases as the narrator moves deeper, tries crowns, opens safes, then exits with interior cargo. The closure offers Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—"vigilance must root itself" and the city's locks "pause before accepting imprecise grief"—but the cost remains conceptual and diffuse rather than a single on-page forfeiture or visible price. The final image reweights the premise (latent blaze held, not poured) yet the stance crystallization feels asserted more than earned by a decisive beat that narrows options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The serpentine grotto is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (luminous pollen, ridged stones, stalactites as crowns) and the inverted-gravity hour creates spatial pressure. The iron band with the astonished eye functions as micro-setting: it refracts the narrator's sight into "panes, each pane an itinerary of locks," directly enabling the safe-opening sequence and charging the final warm consensus. Spatial choreography remains clear (threshold effects, chamber unwrapping, upside-down reentry) and the environment constrains the visit to the tilt-hour window.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding forgotten combinations—is signaled early and pursued across beats (doodle clue, crown trials, safe study, corridor choice). Pressure accumulates through the tilt-hour constraint and the practice of refusing haste/glitter, but escalation reads as a series of unlocks rather than a narrowing dilemma with visible cost. The protagonist's agency (scattering vigilance seeds, choosing the final corridor) is present but the safes "offer their skeptics" without forcing a tradeoff or risk that alters later tactics. The ending reconfigures the city's locks, yet the price paid—patience gathered, blaze kept latent—remains abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the grotto's mechanics and the archivist's stance: attention as architecture, vigilance rooted rather than poured, patience versus bullying. The recurring motifs (prism angles, latent blaze, threshold effects, seeds) accumulate pressure and the final image ("bells learning discretion," locks pausing) offers a resonant, non-literal answer without stating a moral. The piece resists tidy resolution and invites reflection on how quiet mastery spreads. Minor thematic echo in "vigilance must root itself" reads slightly didactic but is anchored by prior action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The voice is singular and densely figurative: "thermocline," "belts of relic stalactites," "crowns on hooks," "skeptics polish my purpose." POV remains stable (single first-person, consistent perceptual signature of refraction and archive-logic). Under peak pressure (safe-opening, corridor choice) the diction stays ornate rather than compressing, which slightly dulls urgency but remains voice-consistent. No dialogue; filter verbs ("I feel," "I see") appear but are sparse. The register is elevated throughout, which fits the archivist's self-conception yet risks distancing the reader from embodied stakes at climactic beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Figurative density is high and sustained: most sentences carry metaphor or elevated diction ("syrup," "wick," "pomp," "gentle verdicts"). In the safe-opening sequence—arguably the story's peak pressure—phrases like "pulse that pounds in archives" and "little doubts that polish my purpose" maintain lyric texture but soften propulsion. Paraphrase appears in adjacent lines: "I am not gathering loot; I am composing the patience" restates the prior "One by one the safes offer their skeptics" without new pressure. Template cadence in the crown-trial paragraph ("I try three... so I remove them... The fourth is plain... When it touches my brow") stacks parallel structure without variation. No loops or clarity breaks touch the closure, but accumulation across the middle third lowers momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The premise—gravity-inversion grotto as archive of forgotten lock-combinations accessed via manuscript doodle and attention-as-currency—synthesizes familiar quest elements into a specific, non-obvious frame. The self-gnawing key that stops when tilted, stalactites as crowns, safes opened by "studying the space beside the hinge" for forty heartbeats, and the final image of locks learning restraint all feel distinctive. The archivist's prism-minded stance and the notion that vigilance must root rather than pour offer fresh inflections on patient mastery. The piece commits fully to its metaphysical logic without retreat, and the doodle's evolving use (tilted paper → tilted head → corridor that exists "between two breaths") demonstrates ingenuity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The prism-minded archivist is present throughout, frames the quest early, and makes multiple choices: refusing pomp crowns, selecting the iron band, practicing refusal at the safe, choosing the final corridor. The iron-band choice enables the safe-opening sequence and the corridor decision shapes the ending's charge. Agency is clear across at least three beats and the final stance (saying nothing, keeping the blaze latent) ties directly to the archivist's patience discipline.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The manuscript margin doodle appears early (satchel clue), is described (sideways door, tide clock, self-gnawing key), and its instruction ("tilt the paper... key points north" → "I tilt my head instead") triggers the grotto's unwrapping. It returns implicitly in the choice of "a final corridor... the manuscript margin doodle never showed," reweighting its role from guide to incomplete map. Two distinct beats (unwrapping, final corridor) with evolving use; the doodle's absence at the end charges the protagonist's risk.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Seeds of vigilance" are named explicitly ("My body remembers the instruction... starve the familiar. So I slow... and let alertness sprout like hard green. Those sprouts are seeds of vigilance") and scattered "by noticing what others ignore." The concept shapes tactics (refusing glitter, studying absence) and the ending claims the city's locks pause because of this rooted vigilance. However, the seeds function largely as metaphor for attention; no single beat demonstrates a visible cost or tradeoff tied specifically to scattering them versus another tactic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Clandestinely luminous" modifies the pollen in the grotto fog ("fog threaded with a clandestinely luminous pollen"). The pollen is described as "letters from a collapsed alphabet" and dims at the end, storing itself for the next visitor. It appears in two beats (entry, exit) but does not constrain or enable a choice; it decorates atmosphere rather than altering the protagonist's options or tactics.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Reenter" is the stated motivation ("I can reenter a quay of choices left in the dark") and the structural spine: entering the grotto, stepping through threshold effects, reentering the main chamber upside down after the corridor choice, and leaving to "reenter the bookless alleys." The action defines the quest, anchors the tilt-hour stakes, and the final reentry ("I reenter the main chamber upside down, because the hour is almost done") delivers the closure image. At least three beats; removing "reenter" would require wholesale reframing.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Through threshold effects" is named twice: "I step through threshold effects the way a swimmer crosses a thermocline" (mid-beat) and "Threshold effects blossom again, and the grotto folds me gently" (final corridor). The mechanics (air to syrup, sound narrows, directions trade) are specified and the method recurs at a key turn. However, it functions as transition description rather than a constraint that shapes attempts or costs; the protagonist moves through without friction or adaptation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The serpentine grotto in mist is signaled early ("the ledger... tells me... the serpentine grotto in mist will open its lock at tilt"), structures the entire journey (entry, chamber progression, stalactites, safes, final corridor, upside-down reentry), and its fog/"clandestinely luminous pollen" and inverted-gravity mechanics pressure choices. The grotto's unwrapping ("a chamber unwrapping from behind another chamber") enables the safe-room discovery and the tilt-hour constraint forces the exit. The setting is indispensable to plot and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"When gravity inverts for an hour" is established early ("That tilt is the hour when gravity inverts... During that window I can reenter") and creates a live clock: "I can stay only until the hour completes" and "I reenter the main chamber upside down, because the hour is almost done." The timeframe tightens the final corridor choice and forces the exit, altering tactics (choosing what to take, leaving before completion). The hour is tracked across beats and shapes the ending's urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"To find where forgotten combinations hide" is stated early ("I go because I want to find where forgotten combinations hide and wait") and pursued across beats: reading the doodle, trying crowns, opening safes by "studying the space just beside its hinge," and discovering "This is where forgotten combinations hide." The motivation is dramatized through action and conflicted by the tilt-hour constraint (can't open all safes, must choose the final corridor). However, the desire faces no internal friction or cost that forces a tradeoff between finding more versus leaving.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Latent blaze" appears in the opening ("I carried that heat like a latent blaze under wet canvas, quietly unstoppable") and returns in the final paragraph ("let my blaze remain latent"). The tone throughout balances controlled intensity—elevated diction, metaphysical stakes, refusal of haste—with quiet certainty. Under peak pressure (safe-opening, corridor choice) the tone remains steady rather than modulating sharply, which fits the archivist's discipline but slightly flattens urgency. The final image charges the latent-blaze motif by insisting on restraint, cohering tone and theme.</comment>
