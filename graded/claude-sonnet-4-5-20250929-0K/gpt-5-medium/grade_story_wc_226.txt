<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The artist's motivation is clear and intensifies through the sequence, though interiority remains somewhat lyric-abstract rather than embodied. The micro-choice to pay twice for the child carries visible cost ("the weight inside him at last unclench"), earning the final forfeiture. Internal contradiction is present but muted—theft guilt versus defiant revision—and the embodied struggle stays gestural. The child functions well as secondary pressure with his dividing chant that shifts the price structure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Orientation anchors by ~100 words (towers, spire, artist arrives with satchel). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing hybrid): the canyon redefines the price from voice-theft to shared color-fragments, and the artist surrenders "the gold of his mentor's last morning" with visible release. One meaningful deepening occurs when the child's dividing chant disperses the doubled price into many. Cost is legible in the color-giving and the artist's unclench. The lens holds without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The canyon, bone towers, and pale spire constrain the ritual terms and charge the final giving scene. The bottle-shard necklace refracts light into "shifting flags," a micro-setting object that later enables the child's dividing chant. Spatial choreography is mostly clear (margin of mist, spire center, cloth spread). Sensory detail is vivid and selective: "vibration climb the palm like a warning," echoes as "water over flute holes." The spire's color-shift at closure directly results from the giving and visibly reconfigures the ritual.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: change how forgiveness is priced, signaled early. One meaningful tightening: the canyon names new terms (colors instead of voice), then the child's chant disperses the artist's doubled price. The artist's agency—spreading cloth, inviting chorus, offering to pay twice—drives the sequence. Visible cost: the artist surrenders the mentor's last morning and feels the weight unclench. No coincidence resolves; the ritual keepers arrive after the voices have already paid. Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens and the final color-gift forecloses silence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the refracted forgiveness structure: splitting a single debt into shared fragments lets the community keep singing rather than lose a voice. The final image—spire "colored by fragments"—answers the core question without moralizing. The artist's gold-of-morning offering earns the unclench without diagnostic label-speak. Subtext operates in the child's whispered dog/clock rhyme and the canyon's hum. One slip: "Forgiveness is not silence, it is wind that goes forward" borders on thematic echo but is attributed to "someone" and immediately absorbed by the canyon's refusal to repeat it, limiting the penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited on the artist; distance is consistent. Voice carries a lyric, elevated register that fits the myth-tinged setting but occasionally drifts into abstract poeticism ("forged hush that even dust respected"). Perceptual signature is present: the artist notices paint-jars, mentors, color as debt. Dialogue is sparse and goal-driven ("No, the artist said, I will pay twice"). The child's "dividing chant" and the elders' "Begin" feel purposeful. Filter verbs ("felt the vibration," "saw in him") appear but remain voice-motivated. One register slip: "human weather of trying" reads slightly ornamental in a peak beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language is mostly coherent ("needle the clouds forgot to remove," "human weather of trying"). Information density is high; most lines advance setting, character, or pressure. Two patterns reduce momentum: paraphrase loops in the backstory block ("He had painted a dawn… he had not paid, and the debt pulsed") restate guilt without added pressure (−0.3). Template cadence in the color-giving sequence ("Give a blue… a red… a green") is voice-motivated by the canyon but borders on mechanical (−0.2). No filter-verb stacks in high-pressure beats. Clarity remains high; no muddy metaphors touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The premise—refract forgiveness across many voices through impromptu poetry—offers a fresh angle on collective ritual. The detail of color-fragments as payment is specific and non-obvious. The child's bottle-shard necklace and dividing chant transform the artist's doubled price, a synthesis that feels earned in hindsight. The final image (spire colored by fragments, voices kept singing) avoids the stock silencing ritual and commits fully to its premise. Minor constraint: the mentor-as-voiceless-debt backstory echoes familiar penitent-artist templates, though the color-economy twist transforms it enough to sustain originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Present throughout; drives the decision to change ritual terms, spreads the cloth, invites poetry, and offers to pay twice. Choices create two key turns: inviting the braid of stories and surrendering the mentor's gold. Present in closure (packs inks, touches bone, sees mentor reborn in child). Causal pressure is moderate—other agents (child, canyon) also shape the outcome. Cost is visible (gold of mentor's morning, weight unclench).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Signaled early ("pale spire in mist, a needle the clouds forgot"). Handled in three beats: artist touches it and feels warning, empty jar left at its foot (backstory), and at closure it receives color-fragments and answers with tone. Functional across middle and ending; the spire's color-shift is the visible proof of the new price-structure. Specificity: its acoustic response ("thread of tone") and capacity to hold color are irreplaceable. Cost connection: the artist's unclench is tied to the spire's acceptance.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Shapes stakes from the outset ("They came for the price of forgiveness") and constrains the middle choice (how to change the cost). The canyon's redefinition of terms (colors instead of voice) is the conceptual hinge. Present in closure: "Before the ritual could steal a single voice, the voices had chosen to pay together." The artist's doubled offer and the child's division are both price negotiations. Visible cost: each speaker surrenders a color; the artist gives the mentor's gold. The entire plot turns on repricing forgiveness.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The child is labeled "innocently mischievous" early and demonstrates it by flicking pebbles, naming notes, and offering a rhyme that hides weight. The dividing chant at closure is the key act: "Split twice becomes many" transforms the price structure. Trait enables the solution with visible effect (dispersal of cost). Constraint: his necklace of bottle shards refracts light, a micro-mechanism that later parallels the conceptual refraction. Cost is oblique but present—his colors are preserved by the artist's doubled payment.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Signaled early ("to refract a single truth into many, and split its burden among voices"). Executed through impromptu poetry that braids confessions, then the child's chant that refracts the artist's doubled price. The action is irreplaceable: without refraction, the ritual remains single-voice theft. Present in closure: the spire is "colored by fragments," voices "kept singing." Causal pressure is high—refraction mechanics shape both the poetry and the final price-split. Specificity: light through bottle shards parallels the conceptual split.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Signaled early and used in the middle: "Begin" → artist offers a line about a door named by many mouths → people add continuations → braid of stories forms → child adds dog/clock rhyme. The method matters: without the poetry sessions, the single confession cannot become a chorus. Mechanics are on the page: inviting breath to speak as shapes, the canyon warming to "the human weather of trying." Present in closure logic: the voices' choice to pay together is prepared by the braided stories. Specificity: poetry as method fits the refraction premise.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Towers and canyon echo-structure constrain ritual terms; the canyon itself speaks the new price. The bone towers' vibration warns the artist. The spire's fog and acoustic properties are irreplaceable at closure (color-reception, tone-thread). Echoes actively refract the braid and the child's chant: "Split twice becomes many… the canyon made his math true with echoes." Spatial pressure: people gather at the margin, artist spreads cloth at center. Micro-setting (bottle shards, empty jar) also functions. Environment shapes tactics and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Signaled early ("before the ritual") and used to tighten urgency: the artist arrives to change the cost before the ritual can claim a voice. The ritual keepers' arrival at the end confirms the timing paid off ("the ritual had already arrived ahead"). Time pressure shapes the artist's choice to act now. Cost connection: if he had waited, a voice would have been taken. The timeframe is functional but not a live ticking clock—no moment-by-moment countdown. Solid causal role without high specificity.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Desire is dramatized: the artist's stated aim ("to refract a single truth into many") drives his choices—spreading cloth, inviting poetry, offering to pay twice. Friction between want and cost is visible: he must surrender the mentor's gold and risk doubling his own price to protect the child. The motivation is tested on the page when the canyon names terms and the child steps forward. Present in closure: the refracted payment structure is the realization of the motivation. Specificity: the desire is not generic redemption but a structural repricing.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Tone is established early ("forged hush that even dust respected") and modulates with pressure: the canyon "listened like a judge," then "warmed," then "hummed," finally releasing "a breeze that did not echo." Coherent through turns: the silence-then-sound arc supports the theme of voices choosing to pay rather than be silenced. Charges the final image: "Forgiveness is not silence, it is wind that goes forward" and the canyon's refusal to repeat it. The hush-to-wind progression reweights the opening's forged silence with earned release.</comment>
