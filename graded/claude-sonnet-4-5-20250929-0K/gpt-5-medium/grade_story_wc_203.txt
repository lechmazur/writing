<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's observational bias and elevator-repair lens shape perception consistently ("gravity prints its diary everywhere"). Interior voice remains distinct through lyric compression, and the choice to wind the mainspring backward reflects genuine agency with visible cost—releasing the ghosts forecloses the investigation. Minor slip: "skillfully observant" is stated rather than demonstrated in a pressured micro-choice, and the final gesture ("pressed my palm") feels slightly enacted rather than contradictory.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the protagonist releases the trapped hours, the room "seems lighter by the weight it lost," and the act forecloses further haunting with visible cost ("slipped the mainspring barrel into my tool bag…as a receipt"). The accumulative/textural lens holds throughout—dust patterns, ceiling details, and the coiled steel build pressure that the unwinding releases. Orientation anchors (abandoned ticket office, ghost-arguing elevator tech) arrive promptly, and the escalation (discovery → engagement → release) tightens options under the chosen lens without causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ceiling grid, dust accumulation, and mainspring barrel constrain discovery and charge the final image; removing the setting would collapse the logic. Sensory selection reflects professional bias (dust as text, sag as clue, mouse paths as roads) and the ticket-office particulars (coins, roses, newsprint-and-gun-oil whisper) anchor POV filter. Spatial choreography is coherent (counter → tile → joist → barrel) and the environment evolves causally (fluorescent dies, dust lifts and resettles). Minor: "peeled knuckle" and "painted smiles" verge on stock decay imagery without fresh specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—discover what ceilings hide / balance the ghost debt—signals early and tightens through the mainspring discovery, which narrows options to engage or leave. The choice to unwind backward is protagonist-driven and forecloses the haunting with on-page cost (the room exhales, ledger entries cross out, buzz dies for good). The price is legible: "paid in breath enough" and the receipt-burden the protagonist carries out. Under the accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening suffices; the coiled tension unwinding registers as escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—debts paid in borrowed time, the weight of carried histories—emerges from the mainspring as both bank and clock, the ringmaster's theft of hours, and the protagonist's choice to balance accounts without stating a moral. The final image (cracked smile that "did not flake anymore") reweights the premise: release repairs what hoarding broke. Subtext operates in "receipts" as both ledger and burden, and the ceiling's "map of trapped promises" charges the ending without overt thematic statement. No dead-end philosophizing; the horologist's ribbon ledger and "afternoons that never came back" remain concrete.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Voice is consistent and textured—idiomatic compressions like "breath in winter," "moth" for ledger, "seats folding up"—and the perceptual signature (gravity's diary, dust as text) remains character-specific. Distance is stable; no head-hopping. Under peak pressure the diction stays controlled. Minor penalties: "A whisper peeled itself free" and "hush slid down…like silk let go" lean toward stock poetic phrasing, and late in the piece filter verbs cluster slightly ("watched the dust lift, swirl"). The line "Our ringmaster kept the payroll in time" shifts into expository clarity that slightly dilutes the lyric compression.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Information density is high (most lines advance discovery or charge imagery), and rhythm varies purposefully—short declaratives ("I waited") against longer lyric unfurlings. Clarity holds; no pronoun confusion or impossible choreography. Penalties: light paraphrase loop ("The ghosts did not wail; they waited" after "pooling like breath" / "ripple the dust"); "crumbs into little constellations" and "chorus of afternoons" touch decorative in a high-pressure discovery beat; the phrase "when the overhead fluorescent buzz dies off" appears verbatim twice (beginning and end) without pattern-teaching that charges the reprise—it reads scaffold rather than motif. These issues remain non-closure (the final image is clean) so cap deduction at −0.8 total per the accumulation rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—elevator tech / ghost mediator investigates a circus ruin via dust forensics and finds a time-ledger mainspring—is specific and non-obvious. The premise transforms "repair work" into metaphysical accounting, and the ceiling-as-secret motif reweights familiar ghost-story tropes. The horologist's barrel is a fresh inflection on haunted debts. Risk: lyric compression and accumulative structure heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. Minor friction: "cracks in the façade" as concept reads slightly prompt-adjacent rather than organically invented, and the final gesture (palm on cracked paint) feels slightly staged for thematic closure rather than inevitable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The elevator-repair-tech-who-sees-ghosts is present from the opening line, shapes perception (ceilings carry secrets, dust as diary), and the decision to engage the mainspring—winding backward to release the ghosts—creates the key turn at closure. The character's dual expertise (vertical journeys and ghost arguments) directly enables the discovery and the choice to "balance the clock." The trait appears in all three gates (setup, middle discovery, closure action) and the final choice is causally rooted in this exact skillset. Cost is visible: the protagonist leaves carrying the barrel "as a receipt," a burden that continues the night-time arguing with ghosts.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The mainspring barrel is discovered mid-story (behind the sagging tile), handled physically (twisted with pliers, unwound backward), and its mechanics—coiled steel ribbon ledger, payroll kept "in time"—drive the climax. The object's unique properties (both bank and clock, tension thrumming with borrowed days) cannot be replaced by a generic haunted artifact. It appears in three beats: discovery, examination, unwinding. The closure hinges on its release ("the spring relaxed, a hush slid down"), and the protagonist carries it out as receipt. The only friction: it arrives slightly past the first third, capping eligibility near but not at the top band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Cracks in the façade" is signaled early (painted smiles cracking, "how a place speaks"), recurs in interiority ("lines where duty and curiosity pulled different ways"), and the final image—palm on cracked paint that "did not flake anymore"—repays the motif with reweighted meaning (release repairs fracture). The concept shapes the protagonist's reading of the space and closure participation is clear. Friction: mid-story the concept drifts into metaphor (internal cracks) without altering on-page tactics; it charges theme more than it constrains choice. Two gates strongly (setup, closure), middle use is thematic rather than causal, landing it in mid-6s under lyric-resonance allowance.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Skillfully observant" is claimed early ("I am skillfully observant because gravity prints its diary everywhere") and demonstrated via dust-pattern reading, ceiling-tile sag prioritization, and the crescent fingerprint on the barrel. The trait enables the discovery (noticing the sag, reading mouse-path reverence, finding the watch crowns). Cost is oblique: the skill commits the protagonist to engage rather than walk away. Friction: the trait is partly told ("skillfully observant") rather than purely shown, and while it enables tactics it doesn't visibly fail or trade off against another priority under pressure. Three gates present, causal in discovery, closure-adjacent but not decisive at the final image.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Engage" is the stated method (waiting for the buzz to fade, letting whispers engage) and the unwinding of the mainspring is the decisive engagement that releases the ghosts and crosses out the ledger. The action is signaled early, attempted in the middle (listening, being guided), and completed at closure. The mechanics matter: winding backward is the specific engagement that admits the debt and names the thief. Swapping "engage" for "confront" or "release" would require only light edits, capping it below the top band, but the action's iterative nature (listen, find, unwind) and closure centrality push it into the 8+ range. Cost is on the page (room inhales, ledger self-corrects, buzz dies for good).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Analyzing dust accumulation patterns is signaled early ("dust is how I read a room"), demonstrated in key beats (thick felt on barrel top with clean crescent where fingers lifted, mouse paths curving in powder to avoid one beam), and shapes discovery (the crescent tells frequency of visits, the paths reveal reverence/fear). The method enables the protagonist to prioritize the sagging tile and later find the watch crowns. Closure linkage is indirect: the dust lifts and resettles "in a new arrangement that matched nobody's hands," marking release. Friction: the method is more tool than driver—it informs but doesn't constrain the final choice. Two strong gates (setup, middle), closure participation is atmospheric rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The abandoned circus ticket office supplies the ceiling grid (where ghosts pool), the sagging tiles (discovery point), the counter (climbing platform), the joist (hiding place for the barrel), and the cultural residue (ringmaster's theft, troupe's debt). Removing this exact setting would break the logic: elevator repair elsewhere wouldn't yield a horologist's payroll mechanism. The space constrains discovery (must climb, pry, trace mouse paths) and charges the final image (cracked paint smile, loose sign banging outside). Three gates present, high irreplaceability, causal across beats, closure-active (the room "seems lighter," the smile stops flaking). Slight friction: "abandoned circus" verges on stock ruin trope without fully transforming it.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"When the overhead fluorescent buzz dies off" frames the opening condition (protagonist waits for it), recurs verbatim at closure ("I left when the overhead fluorescent buzz dies off for good"), and the timeframe governs the ghost engagement (buzz fades → whispers engage). The temporal marker teaches a rule (ghosts whisper in quiet) and the ending phrase "for good" signals permanent release. Friction: the timeframe is more atmospheric threshold than ticking clock; it doesn't tighten tactics or create urgency within the scene. Lyric reprise reweights the moment (temporary fade → permanent quiet) but mid-scene the time pressure is absent. Two gates (setup, closure), development gate weak, landing it in mid-5s with lyric-resonance lifting it slightly.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The motivation—"to discover what ceilings hide"—is stated early ("took the call…as an invitation"), dramatized through the climb and tile removal, and tested at closure when discovery forces the choice to release rather than merely catalog. Friction between want (discovery) and cost (admitting the debt, carrying the receipt) is visible: "To engage the mechanism meant admitting the debt." The desire drives all three acts (arrival, search, unwinding) and the final image (taking the barrel as receipt, leaving when the buzz dies for good) shows the protagonist accepting the burden discovery imposes. Three gates present, causal pressure, cost on the page. Slight friction: the want is partly told in setup rather than purely inferred from action.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Weightless burden" is established in the opening ("balance became a weightless burden the year the circus quit"), recurs in imagery (ceiling as map of trapped promises, tension thrumming through coiled steel, room "lighter by the weight it lost"), and charges the closure (protagonist carries the barrel "not as loot, but as a receipt"—burden transformed into duty). The tone modulates with pressure: lyric compression tightens during discovery, softens at release ("hush slid down…like silk"). The oxymoron governs the emotional register throughout: heavy debts rendered with light, breath-like imagery. Three gates, strong thematic coherence, closure-active. Minor: the tone occasionally tilts decorative ("crumbs into little constellations") in a peak beat without clear pressure payoff.</comment>
