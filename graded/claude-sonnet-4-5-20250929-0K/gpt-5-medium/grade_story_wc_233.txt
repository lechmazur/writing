<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The queen's motivation is clear—unraveling recurring dreams—and embodied through concrete choices: leaving the crown, climbing, touching the stone self. Internal contradiction appears in her refusal to dismiss dreams versus serving the throne as "a ghost of unasked questions," but the wanderer's meta-commentary ("once I kept watch at your cradle") and the moth/flame analogy flatten what should be earned realization into told wisdom. The final choice lacks visible cost on the page; she "unstitch[es]" from her stone self and wears dreams "like a ring," but we don't see what she forfeits or how this alters her next move.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: we learn "queen," "palace," "mountains" in the opening, but spatial anchors drift (orchards, ridge, ledges, pool) without stable choreography until the cobalt grotto. The Drive Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—images and motifs (bleeding starlight, moth/flame, crescent key) accumulate toward a Resonant Reconfiguration. Closure attempts Charged Poise: the queen "unstitch[es]" and the starlight pool "stopped bleeding, calm as an eye that had decided to watch." However, the cost is not legible on the page; we're told she wears dreams "like a ring that remembered every finger," but what she renounces or forfeits remains abstract. The wanderer's departure and the pool's calm offer atmospheric closure, not a visible decision or price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful: "mountains whose ribs cut the dusk," "ember grotto," "pool thick with starlight," and the cobalt grotto create sensory progression. The crescent drawn on her brow functions as a key, a concrete constraint that matters. Spatial choreography wavers—"the first waystation," "the second ledge," "past midnight they reached"—distances and transitions blur without stable anchors. The final grotto's roof "showed night unapologized, every star an opening instead of a pin" charges the closure image, meeting the 9+ test for setting, but the earlier drift and lack of clear geography cap the score.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—unraveling the mystery of recurring dreams versus serving the throne—is signaled early. Pressure tightens when the queen meets the wanderer, drinks, climbs, and confronts her stone self. However, escalation under the Accumulative lens is a single intensification (the grotto reveal), not a sequence of narrowing choices. The wanderer's warning ("you will choose who rules when you go back, and who you will not be able to forgive") promises a high-stakes decision, but the resolution is abstract: "they unstitched; she was one again." No visible trade-off or foreclosed path appears on the page. Cost is asserted in her whisper but not dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—the cost of unexamined power, the moth versus the flame—emerges through images: the crown on salt, bleeding starlight, the stone self. The moth/candle metaphor is over-articulated by the wanderer: "both times the same moth burned itself on the same candle. The dreams returned because you would not look at the moth, only the flame." This is thematic echo, not earned discovery. The final image ("the pool of starlight had stopped bleeding, calm as an eye that had decided to watch") offers resonant ambiguity, but the wanderer's late explanations dilute what should be implicit. No false moralizing in the final paragraph, which helps.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited, focused on the queen. Perceptual signature is present: "wind combed her braids with a softly commanding patience," "her voice had learned to be softly commanding even when drifting." Dialogue is sparse and goal-driven ("I am precisely when I can be"), carrying subtext. The wanderer's exposition ("Once, I kept watch at your cradle") shifts into helpful-narrator mode, over-explaining rather than trusting dramatization. Diction is consistent—lyric, elevated—and psychic distance modulates purposefully. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks that dull pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout: "mountains whose ribs cut the dusk," "map of dreams she had written in sleepless ink," "bruise of prophecy," "flask the color of nicked bone," "wind took on the voice of a wet veil whisked across tile." Most images are coherent, but some strain: "lacy menace of power and mercy knotted together" mixes texture (lacy) with abstraction (menace, power, mercy) without grounding. Template cadence appears: "There she met… He bowed… You are late… I am precisely…" and "If you wake her… She asked… Once, he said…" across the wanderer's scene. Paraphrase loop: "Names are doors, he said, and so are silences" followed by "she told him the name the dreams used" restates without added pressure. These artifacts do not touch the closure beat directly but accumulate to −0.8 to −1.0 within Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The premise—a queen pursuing recurring dreams, meeting a guide, confronting a stone self—draws on archetypal quest and shadow-integration templates without a sharp transformative angle. The "stone self" and "unstitching" offer a moment of specificity, and the moth/flame metaphor is purposeful, but the wanderer's late exposition and the abstract resolution ("she was one again, the dreams not dismissed but worn like a ring") feel more like prompt fulfillment than inevitable synthesis. Risk is present in the lyric voice and non-linear accumulation, but the closure lacks the sharp, non-obvious turn that would elevate originality into the 7+ band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The disenchanted queen is present from the opening and drives every beat: leaving the crown, walking, climbing, drinking, touching the stone self. Her choices create the key turn at the end (touching the crescent, "they unstitched"). However, the final decision is abstract—she "breathed, the stone breathed, and they unstitched"—and lacks visible cost or a clear tactical shift. Setup, development, and closure participation are all present. Causal pressure is moderate; the queen's agency is consistent but the stakes-altering moment is soft. Score: early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +1.2, minus swappability −0.4 (another seeker could function similarly), minus abstract resolution −0.7 = ~5.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The ember grotto appears once: "The first waystation was the ember grotto on the ridge, a cave that breathed warm ash and remembered campfires from summers no historian had written. There she met a wanderer…" It provides setting for the meeting but is not handled, returned to, or reweighted. No causal pressure; the grotto could be any waystation. Setup present, no development or closure participation. Score: early signal +0.4, one beat +0.4, ornamental use −0.8, swappability −0.6 = ~4.2, capped at 4.6 for missing closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Bleeding starlight is introduced in paragraph 5 ("the court magi called it bleeding starlight, a bad omen"), reappears at the second ledge ("a pool thick with starlight… because it looked like a wound refusing to close"), and is present in the cobalt grotto ("threads of starlight entered and exited her, bleeding and returning"). It constrains tactics (the queen must reach the grotto before dawn) and charges the closure image ("the pool of starlight had stopped bleeding, calm as an eye"). Setup, development, closure participation all present. Causal pressure moderate; it shapes the climb's urgency. Score: early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.5, specificity +0.5 = ~6.7, rounded down.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Softly commanding" appears twice: the wind "combed her braids with a softly commanding patience" and "her voice had learned to be softly commanding even when drifting." Both are descriptive labels without on-page action or visible cost. No choice is constrained or enabled by this trait; it could be omitted without altering the plot. Setup present (early), no development or closure participation. Score: early signal +0.4, ornamental use −0.8, label-only −0.3, swappability −0.5 = ~3.8, capped at 4.6 for missing closure, rounded to 4.8 for one beat of voice coloring.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The climb structures the entire narrative: the queen walks toward the mountains, ascends the ridge, passes the ember grotto, reaches the second ledge, and arrives at the cobalt grotto. Major turns trace to this action—the meeting with the wanderer, the pool of starlight, the stone self confrontation. The climb is irreplaceable; the story's logic depends on vertical progression and arrival. Setup, development, closure participation all present. Causal pressure strong; the climb narrows options and culminates in the final choice. Score: early signal +0.7, three or more beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.6, irreplaceability +0.7 = ~7.9, rounded down.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"A shared exhale spotting the first fireflies of summer" appears once: "They drank, shared the burn, and for a moment their breaths matched and misted, a shared exhale spotting the first fireflies of summer as they rose from the grass like lost sparks." It is a lyric image, not a method that shapes attempts or mechanics. No causal role; the fireflies do not return or constrain choices. Setup present, no development or closure participation. Score: early signal +0.4, one beat +0.4, ornamental use −0.8, swappability −0.5 = ~3.1, capped at 2.8 for missing closure, adjusted to 3.1 for vivid atmospheric resonance.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The cobalt grotto above clouds is introduced early ("Each night showed her a cobalt grotto above clouds"), reappears as destination ("far beyond, the cobalt grotto above clouds, slit into the skyline like an eyelid half-open"), and dominates the closure scene. The grotto's roof "showed night unapologized, every star an opening" and houses the stone self. It supplies the key resource (the stone self) and charges the final image. Setup, development, closure participation all present. Causal pressure strong; the grotto is the site of the resolution. Score: early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.7, irreplaceability +0.6 = ~7.1, rounded down.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"After the final warning" frames the opening and the wanderer notes "We must climb before dawn, because dawn forgets what night remembers." The timeframe creates urgency but is not tracked on the page—no clock tightens decisions during the climb. "Past midnight they reached" is vague. The final warning is setup only, no development. Score: early signal +0.5, one beat (dawn warning) +0.4, weak causal pressure +0.3, no closure participation −0.0, vague tracking −0.4 = ~4.9, capped at 4.6 for missing closure, adjusted to 4.9 for atmospheric presence.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to unravel the mystery of recurring dreams" is stated early ("What drove her was not escape but hunger: to unravel the mystery of recurring dreams") and drives the climb, the meeting, and the final confrontation. Friction appears in her whisper: "I do not want the throne to end, but I cannot serve it as a ghost of unasked questions." However, the cost is abstract—she "unstitch[es]" and the dreams are "worn like a ring"—no visible trade-off on the page. Setup, development, closure participation all present. Causal pressure moderate. Score: early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +0.9, closure linkage +1.3, minus abstract cost −0.8 = ~6.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Lacy menace appears once explicitly: "in that contact felt the lacy menace of power and mercy knotted together." Tone throughout is dreamlike, elevated, and charged—"mountains whose ribs cut the dusk," "bleeding starlight," "wind took on the voice of a wet veil"—creating coherent menace without overt threat. The tone modulates under pressure (the climb, the grotto) and charges the final image ("the pool of starlight had stopped bleeding, calm as an eye"). Setup, development, closure participation all present. Score: early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.4, specificity +0.5, minus single explicit label −0.3 = ~6.3, rounded down.</comment>
