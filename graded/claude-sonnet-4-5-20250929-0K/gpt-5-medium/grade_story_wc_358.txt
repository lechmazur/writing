<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The investigator's interiority is concrete and purpose-driven, filtering observations through professional practice ("foresight is not vision but practiced posture"). Micro-choices under pressure—placing tape, uploading offsets, coaching the child—reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost (time, attention, reputation). The mentor's patch carries embodied weight, and the final inventory choice ("what held and what almost failed") shows professional restraint rather than celebration, reflecting learned discipline. Minor slip: the child's "adult economy" nod feels slightly over-observed for the pressure of the moment, nudging toward label rather than pure dramatization.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Causal-Situational Hybrid (investigation methodology → micro-adjustments → safe landing). Closure lands on-page with visible cost: the investigator inventories near-failures rather than celebrating success, and the unclipping of the patch signals the work's provisional nature ("the air will be different tomorrow"). Escalation tightens through the child's arrival (generator failing, chopper circling), which converts abstract survey into urgent coordination. Orientation anchors early (dawn, port, shipping containers, accident investigator) and the because/therefore chain—wind patterns between buildings trained a dust devil that threw the pilot—drives the middle third and justifies the offset corridor solution.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The container labyrinth and boulevard funnel constrain the investigator's survey method and directly charge the final image: the patch "barely stirs" in the new corridor, proving the offset worked. Sensory hierarchy reflects professional priorities: salt, rust, mothball sweetness, then tactical details (glass pattern, eddy-snatched tarps, tape-streamer breath). The forklift "within a ripple of broken glass" and dust devil "trained by walls and steel boxes" convert setting into active antagonist. Spatial choreography remains clear across vertical moves (fire stair climb, helipad sightline). The concrete "twenty meters north and three seconds late" anchors abstract wind into navigable constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: prevent another landing accident in wind-trained turbulence. The child's arrival escalates from abstract survey to live rescue (generator failing, hospital need), tightening the timeline and raising immediate cost. The investigator's agency is active throughout—documenting patterns, chalking arrows, uploading offsets, coaching the child—and the final landing attempt hinges on those micro-decisions. Visible cost: the patch "barely stirs" confirms success but the inventory of "what almost failed" acknowledges fragility. One meaningful tightening (survey → urgency → safe landing) suffices for this length. The "singular convergence" framing—many lines meeting at one tight window—charges the investigator's method with conceptual weight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: foresight as "practiced posture" rather than mysticism, and the investigator's refusal to cheer ("we inventory") dramatizes humility before complexity. The patch returns with reweighted meaning—borrowed authority at the start, wind-witness at the climax, pocketed artifact at the end—charging the final fold with transience. "Silence answers" bookends the opening's "unshared custody of attention," closing the frame without moralizing. The child's bare legs and "adult economy" nod compress generational knowledge transfer into gesture. The distinction between "hazy precision" (an ethic) and false certainty runs through every beat, culminating in "promise nothing, but plan fiercely," which avoids platitude by grounding in immediate life-or-death stakes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: the investigator sees "canyons" where others see containers, "trapdoor made from ordinary wood" in turbulence, and "ghost of movement" in broken glass. Diction remains voice-consistent under pressure ("borrowed authority and a vow," "data will not be numbers until later, but now I need their manners"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close on tactile anchors (charcoal, magnetized stakes), pulled back for systemic reading (boulevard funnel, approach corridors). The child's dialogue is naturalistic ("the hospital generator is failing") and contrasts with the investigator's compressed technical idiom. Compression at peak beats (tape "barely flutters," skids "kiss") fits urgency without losing clarity. Minor: "rapidly adapting to the blankness" in the opening slightly over-announces the trait rather than letting early beats demonstrate it.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High information density: "flight engineer's patch to my vest, the cloth oval a borrowed authority and a vow" does character, object, and theme work in one image. Rhythm modulates with pressure—longer reflective lines in survey mode, clipped syntax during the landing ("The patch barely stirs, the tape barely flutters"). Zero paraphrase loops; each move advances spatial understanding or tightens stakes. Figurative language is controlled: "canyons do not care about names," "dust devil…trained by walls," "air should be bored by then." Minor slips: "Ribbon tape flashes from magnetized stakes, drawing pale currents like a slow animal breathing" stacks two metaphors (flashes/drawing, pale currents/animal) in one beat, creating slight density without muddle. "Hazy precision is an ethic" borders on thematic declaration but the colon and concrete follow-through ("look close enough to respect error") rescue it.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Premise—accident investigation as active foresight rather than retrospective blame—transforms procedural trope through sensory particulars (charcoal, tape streamers, patch as windsock) and the philosophical frame ("singular convergence"). The child's role as witness and co-planner avoids convenient solo heroism. Risk: the lyric-technical hybrid (poetic compression layered over procedural detail) succeeds without obscuring causality. The "dust devil…trained by walls" image synthesizes meteorology and urban topology into fresh metaphor. Transformation test passes: swap names/places and the emotional arc (mentor's legacy, provisional mastery, humility before complexity) collapses. Minor proximity concern: "held breath released on a count" and "air will be different tomorrow" approach stock phrasing but are saved by their integration into the investigator's calibration mindset.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The investigator drives every turn: entering the port, surveying wind patterns, climbing for higher read, uploading the offset guide, coaching the child, placing tape streamers. Decisions alter tactics (the "twenty meters north and three seconds late" offset) and the final choice to inventory rather than celebrate reflects earned caution. Early signal (dawn entry), middle development (survey → urgency), and payoff (safe landing attributed to investigator's prep) all present. Visible cost: reputation and time risked on "rule-of-thumb" method, and the acknowledgment that "the air will be different tomorrow" forecloses any claim to permanent mastery.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The patch appears in beat one (clipped to vest as "borrowed authority and a vow"), returns in beat two (hung from antenna as wind-witness), and charges the closure (unclipped and pocketed, its stillness during landing proof of the offset's success). Each use reweights meaning: mentor's legacy → functional tool → transient artifact. The patch's final "barely stirs" moment directly validates the investigator's corridor choice and supplies the story's quietest, most decisive image of success. Irreplaceable: no generic object could carry the same mentor/authority/humility triad.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Singular convergence" is defined early ("many lines meeting at one tight window") and shapes the investigator's method: no single cause, but wind, walls, containers, boulevard, pilot timing. The concept constrains tactics—rather than blaming one factor, the investigator maps the system—and charges the final image: the successful landing depends on threading multiple variables. Middle development: the dust devil example ("trained by walls…exactly when he committed") dramatizes convergence as antagonist. Cost: the investigator must model complexity rather than assign blame, a harder and less satisfying path.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Rapidly adapting" is named in the opening and demonstrated throughout: shifting from survey to urgency when the child arrives, translating abstract wind data into real-time corridor offsets, coaching the child through vector logic. The trait enables the pivot from investigation to intervention and constrains the investigator to improvisation (tape streamers, patch-as-windsock) rather than formal instruments. Cost: the "rule-of-thumb offset" and "promise nothing" acknowledgment show the limits of rapid adaptation. Minor: the label appears early but the first on-page demonstration (survey pivot) waits until mid-story, slightly weakening setup gate.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Survey drives the causal chain: documenting wind patterns → identifying the boulevard funnel → calculating the offset → uploading the guide → coaching placement of tape streamers. The action is signaled in the opening third ("I begin documenting wind patterns") and shapes every middle beat. Payoff: the helicopter's safe approach follows the surveyed corridor, and the investigator's final inventory revisits survey data ("what held and what almost failed"). Irreplaceability high: removing survey collapses both the investigator's method and the story's conceptual spine (foresight as practiced observation).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Documenting wind patterns is introduced early ("I begin documenting…between buildings and between stacked containers") and its mechanics matter: ribbon tape on magnetized stakes, chalk arrows, fire-stair climb for higher sightline, charted overlay. The method enables the offset calculation and the tape-streamer placement that guide the final landing. Middle development: the boulevard-funnel discovery depends on systematic pattern-reading. Cost: the method is provisional ("hazy precision") and its success depends on the investigator's willingness to act on incomplete data. Slight swappability: another observational method (anemometer readings, drone survey) could substitute with moderate edits, capping upper band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The container labyrinth supplies the story's core constraint: it trains the dust devil by creating wind canyons, forces the investigator to navigate "alleys," and provides the vertical platform (fire stair) for the decisive sightline. The setting is signaled immediately ("towering labyrinth of shipping containers glitter like dark cliffs") and returns in every beat: survey, climb, corridor identification, final landing validation. Payoff: the "container rows align with a boulevard" discovery is the story's pivot, and the successful landing proves the investigator read the labyrinth correctly. Irreplaceable: swap for open field or warehouse and the wind-training mechanism collapses.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"After the town goes silent" opens the story and establishes post-accident context (safety stoppages, ship horn died, gulls fled). The timeframe creates urgency when the child announces the circling chopper, tightening the window for survey completion. Middle development: the contrast between "yesterday's relief craft" failure and today's attempt charges the investigator's stakes. Closure: the cranes "regain patience" and the town "begins to hum" signal reopening, framing the story as the hinge between silence and resumption. Minor swappability: "after the accident" or "during the shutdown" could substitute with small edits, and the timeframe does not impose a ticking clock that alters tactics beat-by-beat.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation is stated early ("I came to cultivate foresight in action") and dramatized through every choice: entering alone, surveying rather than blaming, translating data into real-time guidance, coaching the child, and inventorying near-failures instead of celebrating. Friction: the investigator's desire for foresight conflicts with the provisional nature of the work ("the air will be different tomorrow"), creating visible cost in the final refusal to claim mastery. Payoff: "I walked into silence, to cultivate foresight in action until the silence answers" bookends the opening and charges the closure image. Minor: the motivation is slightly over-articulated in reflective beats rather than remaining fully implicit in choices.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Hazy precision" is defined as "an ethic: look close enough to respect error, firm enough to move" and governs tone throughout: specific detail (twenty meters, three seconds) paired with acknowledged limits (rule-of-thumb, "promise nothing"). The tone modulates with pressure—lyric compression in survey mode ("canyons do not care about names"), clipped technical syntax during urgency (radio upload, tape placement), quiet restraint at closure ("we do not cheer; we inventory"). The final image—folding the chart, unclipping the patch, pocketing both—embodies hazy precision's transience. Coherence across turns: even peak beats avoid false certainty, sustaining the ethic under stress.</comment>
