<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is consistently embodied through musical choices that track emotional states—shifting kalimba pulse to match Ada's tapping, placing the locket on the guitar body. Ada's arc from guarded grief to "cautious exuberance" is earned through the eclipse sequence and the narrator's adaptive presence. Minor deduction: the narrator's professional competence lacks a visible struggle or mistake that would complicate the therapeutic work under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Ada's finger tracing the locket curve "to keep it alive" crystallizes her shift from isolation to shared wondering with visible cost—she must hold the question rather than resolve it. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout: density increases through sensory layering (cooled air, silvered light, cricket chorus) and culminates in a cadence shift at totality when "the courtyard inhaled together." One meaningful deepening (the locket on the guitar body) narrows Ada's emotional stance and reweights the opening image of her guarding the keepsake.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The eclipse functions as both setting and constraint: thinning light forces the shift beneath the tree, totality creates the hush that charges Ada's gesture, and the return of incremental sunlight paces the denouement. The locket as micro-setting (metal ticking against wedding band, humming on guitar strings) constrains and enables the narrator's therapeutic link. Sage, dust, and the tree's "dreaming roots" are filtered through the narrator's patient attention and anchor every turn.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—helping Ada engage her grief without collapse—is signaled early and tightens when she refuses the eclipse glasses. The narrator's decision to place the locket on the guitar (agency through adaptive action) narrows options and creates the totality moment where "we were one instrument." The cost is visible: Ada must trace the question mark rather than answer it, and the narrator must pitch the lullaby lower "because nights were hard." One meaningful escalation through protagonist micro-choices under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: the locket's wheat-colored curl as "perfect question mark," the hillside's "long chord," and wondering as "a form of love" arise from scene pressure rather than assertion. The final image—Ada asking for the lullaby in a lower key—offers a non-literal answer to the story's question (how to hold loss without erasure) and reweights the opening "cautious exuberance" with visible cost. No thematic echo or stated moral; resonance is earned through the eclipse sequence and the narrator's whispered insight at the pivot.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single first-person POV remains stable; perceptual signature is distinct (musical filtering: "thumb drape notes," "wind in a bottle," sound as color). Diction modulates purposefully from professional calm ("softly adaptive") to lyric compression under totality ("patient moth," "quiet certainty"). Ada's single line of dialogue—requesting the lower key—carries subtext (nights, ground, need) without explanation. Minor slip: "the old tree lift its breath" briefly anthropomorphizes without clear POV motivation in a beat otherwise grounded in bodily attention.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines layer action, image, and emotional charge (e.g., "the metal ticking faintly against her wedding band" anchors grief in sound and gesture). Rhythm varies across the eclipse sequence, accelerating into totality and breathing through the return of light. Two minor scaffolds: "Ordinary magic is not a rebellion against the world; it is the world doing what it does when we notice" reads as thematic capsule rather than scene pressure, and "I wanted the dark to teach us to listen to what the light usually erases" borders on abstract mission statement. No loops or template cadence; figurative language (moon as "patient moth," shadows "crisp like paper cuts") remains coherent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of music therapy, eclipse ritual, and keepsake object is specific and non-obvious; the choice to place the locket on the guitar body to "hum with the strings" transforms a familiar grief trope through sensory physicality. The eclipse as shared listening rather than spectacle offers a fresh angle. Risk: quiet accumulative structure over causal drama. Deduction: the "ordinary magic" frame and narrator's articulated mission occasionally drift toward self-aware thesis rather than letting the particulars speak.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's decision to shift the song to match Ada's tapping (early beat), place the locket on the guitar (middle turn that enables the totality moment), and whisper "wondering is a form of love" (closure beat that crystallizes Ada's shift) demonstrates causal pressure across all three gates. The "softly adaptive" method constrains choices—no confrontation, only musical responsiveness—and the final request to teach the lullaby lower shows Ada's altered stance as a result of the narrator's presence. Cost: the narrator must accept that Ada will hold the question rather than resolve it.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The locket appears in setup (Ada "guarding" it on arrival), development (opened to reveal the wheat-colored curl and question mark shape, then placed on the guitar to hum), and payoff (Ada tracing its curve at totality and holding it steadier afterward). Its specific properties—the metal ticking, the curl's color and shape, the ability to resonate on guitar strings—are irreplaceable and drive the narrator's therapeutic link. Cost: Ada must return the locket to her palms without closure, keeping the question alive.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Ordinary magic" is named explicitly in the narrator's reflection ("the world doing what it does when we notice") and shapes the narrator's stake (nurturing wonder). It recurs at closure when "new shadows" are named "as if they were neighbors we had finally met" and the hillside's "long chord" is heard "with your feet." The concept reweights the eclipse from spectacle to listening exercise, altering the narrator's tactics (stories of small details, wind taking tempo). Moderate lyric reprise links opening frame to ending practice, but the on-page causal work is lighter than the character or object elements.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Softly adaptive" is demonstrated rather than merely labeled: the narrator shifts song pulse to match Ada's tapping, lowers the guitar to let wind take tempo, and adjusts the lullaby key on request. This trait constrains choices—the narrator cannot push or confront—and the cost is visible when the narrator must accept Ada's slower pace and trace-without-answering stance. Present in setup (arrival description), middle (tempo shifts), and payoff (teaching the lullaby lower). The attribute is irreplaceable; removing it would collapse the therapeutic method.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The action "link" is signaled early ("I felt a line form, a link gently drawn" when matching Ada's rhythm) and executed explicitly when the locket is placed on the guitar body "so the memory could link to the music and the dark and all of us." This decision drives the totality moment where "we were one instrument" and enables Ada's final tracing gesture. The specificity—linking through vibration and shared sound—cannot be swapped; it is the story's central therapeutic turn and redefines Ada's relationship to the keepsake with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The eclipse is signaled in setup (title, early coolness on the narrator's hand, passing out glasses), shapes middle tactics (moving beneath the tree as light thins, the narrator asking for stories instead of mere observation), and delivers the closure moment (totality as "quiet certainty" when the courtyard inhales together and Ada traces the locket). Its mechanics—narrowing light, totality's hush, incremental return—are irreplaceable and constrain the narrator's pacing. The eclipse transforms the gathering from spectacle to ritual listening with felt cost: the group must endure disorientation and Ada must hold her question in the dark.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sage Ridge anchors who/where early and supplies resources: the courtyard as "shallow amphitheater," the tree with "dreaming roots," sage and dust scent that layers the eclipse sequence. The ridge's edge and valley distance frame the group's isolation. The tree constrains the middle turn (forces gathering beneath as light sharpens) and charges the ending when the narrator teaches listening "with your feet." Moderate essentiality: the setting pressures choices and recurs in the final image, but another naturalistic site could substitute with edits.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Beneath the hush of dreaming roots" is a spatial anchor (the tree) rather than a temporal constraint. The eclipse itself functions as a live clock (moon's "slow slide," light thinning, totality, sun's return), and the narrator tracks progression through sensory cues. Time is legible and shapes pacing—the narrator lowers the guitar when totality arrives, Ada traces the locket during the brief dark—but "dreaming roots" as a timeframe element does not tighten decisions beyond establishing the tree as the gathering point. Present in two beats (move to tree, lingering after), but the causal pressure comes from the eclipse duration, not the roots imagery.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrator's desire "to nurture lifelong wonder" is stated early and dramatized through the choice to ask for "ordinary magic" stories, the refusal to make the eclipse mere spectacle, and the closing lesson on listening to the hillside's chord. The motivation conflicts with Ada's grief-driven withdrawal, creating friction when she refuses the glasses. Cost is visible: the narrator must accept that wonder for Ada will remain cautious, tied to lower keys and nights that are "hard." The motivation drives at least two beats and shapes closure, though the articulation borders on mission-statement abstraction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Cautious exuberance" is embodied in the narrator's arrival state, modulates through the eclipse (building to totality's "quiet certainty"), and returns transformed in Ada's "breath steadier, her smile a steady thread of cautious exuberance." The tone charges the final image: laughter "softly," lingering rather than celebrating, teaching the lullaby lower. Coherent through pressure; the cautious frame prevents triumphalism at the sun's return and aligns with the story's earned-stasis closure. The tone is irreplaceable and shapes the therapeutic method.</comment>
