<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is concrete and distinctive—"the questions rust in my mouth," "her voice rise through my ribs the way surf rises through stones"—and the journey back to the shelter embodies grief through micro-choices (wrapping the censer foot, kneeling to find notes). Internal contradiction operates subtly: the navigator accepts instructions without knowing why, yet the final act recognizes that the compass "does not lead me to Mara; it leads me with her." The Mara backstory is substantial but anchored in present sensory cues (the beacon pointing inland, the station's pulse) and tilts the present stance toward accepting loss as route rather than recovery, meeting BRR reflection-led allowance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a mosaic pattern early (station → phone calls → inland journey → shelter) with clear transitions and a coherent lens throughout. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the protagonist commits to perpetual reverse migration—"ready to build the next necessary mercy"—foreclosing recovery with visible cost ("the path we etched will hold like a seam"). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the first two paragraphs. One pressure point: the beacon shifts from sweeping to pointing, narrowing the navigator's route and forcing the inland journey. Cost is legible in the final stanza: the station will dim, the pulse will famish, but the ache is now mapped as route, not destination.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The starlit signal station functions as both macro-setting and constraint: its hydraulic failure initiates the narrative, its pulse "fluctuates with moon phases" to govern the journey's timing, and its beacon "points, a single bone finger" to direct the protagonist inland. The censer foot and needle form a micro-setting that charges the final image—placed "in the center," they create a compass that "does not lead me to Mara; it leads me with her." Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: "salt pans that mirror every star that forgot to burn out," "feral gardens swallow porches." The environment constrains the closure choice: the station's dimming pulse and the mapped seam will hold, committing the navigator to return and repeat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: to navigate the geography of loss, not the coastline. One meaningful tightening occurs when the beacon stops sweeping and points inland, forcing the protagonist to journey to the shelter where Mara's notes lie. The inland walk narrows options: the navigator must place the censer foot and complete the compass rather than remain at the station. Escalation under Accumulative lens: density increases as the journey layers memories (hydraulics fail, Mara singing, vowels on driftwood) onto present action, culminating in the recognition that "reverse migration is not return but recognition, not recovery but route." Cost is visible: the station will dim, the pulse famish, yet the protagonist commits to "answer the next midnight call," foreclosing the possibility of cessation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme—loss as perpetual navigation rather than closure—emerges from concrete particulars: the beacon's shift from sweeping to pointing, the censer foot as hinge for a needle "that wants to remember," and the final recognition that "reverse migration is never over; it is a tide that keeps time with absence." The compass does not lead *to* Mara but *with* her, reframing grief as route. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "raw solace lives in the act of charting what we cannot repair," and the protagonist will return to build "the next necessary mercy." No thematic echo in the final paragraph; the final image (needle resting on the censer foot, "quiet as ash before new incense") reweights the premise without stating a moral. The piece resists tidy resolution: the station dims, the path holds, and the work continues.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: "I sit inside its ribbed throat," "the questions rust in my mouth," sensory detail filtered through a technician's attention to screws, solder, salvaged wire. Diction remains character-particular under pressure: "raw solace lives in the act of charting what we cannot repair" balances technical precision with lyric compression. No head-hopping. The voice modulates purposefully from technical observation ("The pieces do not match until the moon leans full") to elegiac recognition ("I think of the hydraulics fail on the ferry, how the engine coughed"). Psychic distance tightens in the final stanzas as memory and present action merge. Free indirect style is clean; no filter-verb stacks or POV leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings shift. Information density is high: most lines layer action, memory, and atmosphere. However, paraphrase loops appear: "After the flood, after the evacuation, after the hydraulics fail" is echoed by "I think of the hydraulics fail on the ferry, how the engine coughed, how the wheel locked, how we waited and learned leaving"—the second restates the first without added pressure (−0.2). Template cadence appears in the climactic sequence: "The sand remembers... I kneel to find... They were vowels... I set the patina bronze... The needle I carried..." (five consecutive subject-verb stems) in a high-pressure beat (−0.5). Stock metaphor "like a prayer" and "like a bird relearning sky" appear but do not obscure clarity. These artifacts do not touch the closure beat itself, limiting total deduction to −0.7. No other significant loops or muddle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of signal-station technician, grief cartography, and reverse migration as perpetual route rather than return feels specific and non-obvious. The censer foot—"a hinge for incense once, now a pivot for a needle that wants to remember"—transforms a salvaged object into a compass for loss. The frame resists the stock "return to a lost place" arc by recognizing that the compass does not recover but re-maps the ache. Emotional truth grounds the premise: "Mara kept singing so I could follow, and I kept counting so she could stop" particularizes their interdependence. The piece commits fully to its lyric-accumulative mode without retreat. Risk: the elliptical structure and high figurative density could obscure, but the closure effect remains legible. Within-band bonus +0.3 for coherent risk-taking that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The patchwork navigator is present from the opening ("called the patchwork navigator by those who still remember") and drives three beats: receiving midnight instructions and building the frame, following the beacon inland to the shelter, and placing the censer foot to complete the compass. The final decision—"I will return to the starlit signal station and answer the next midnight call, ready to build the next necessary mercy"—alters tactics from passive reception to committed perpetual work. The navigator's choices create the key turn: inland journey → recognition that reverse migration is route, not recovery. Early signal, three beats, closure linkage, and causal pressure place this in the essential band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The patina bronze censer foot appears in four beats: introduced as "the smallest piece...rummaged from a drowned chapel," fitted onto the frame to stop the station's shivering, carried inland wrapped in cloth, and placed "in the center" of the shelter where "the air changes, pulling the vowels into alignment." It enables the needle to settle and the compass to form. The object's transformation—from incense hinge to memory pivot—charges the closure: "the needle will rest on the censer foot, quiet as ash before new incense." Early signal, four beats, causal pressure (its placement completes the compass), closure linkage, high specificity (its history and weight matter), and visible cost (the protagonist commits to return and repeat). Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Reverse migration is introduced midway ("the voice returns...telling me this is how reverse migration begins") and defined immediately: "Not the birds flying south into winter, but the memories walking backward, toward the last place they were whole." The concept shapes the protagonist's inland journey and reframes the closure: the compass "does not lead me to Mara; it leads me with her." The final recognition—"Reverse migration is never over; it is a tide that keeps time with absence"—crystallizes the stakes as perpetual work rather than recovery. The concept changes options: the protagonist accepts that loss is route, not destination, and commits to answer future calls. Setup at midpoint, development through the inland journey, payoff at closure. Two beats, causal pressure, closure linkage, specificity. Essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Fluctuates with moon phases appears twice: "It keeps a pulse that fluctuates with moon phases, as if tides tug its cables" and "the path is lit by the slow rhythm that fluctuates with moon phases." The trait constrains the timing of the inland journey (the pieces "do not match until the moon leans full") and enables the protagonist to navigate ("Night dons its hammered blue, and the path is lit"). The moon's fullness is the trigger for the frame's completion and the journey's launch. Early signal, development beat (moon-full timing), and presence in the climactic journey. One causal constraint with visible cost (the protagonist must wait for the full moon), but closure participation is indirect (the moon enables the journey but does not reappear in the final image). Shapes one key turn.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Build" is present from the title onward: "They tell me what to build, but never why," "my hands learn a choreography of screws, solder, and salvaged wire," "When I fit it onto the frame they made me build," and the final commitment: "ready to build the next necessary mercy." The action drives three beats: constructing the frame under midnight instruction, completing it with the censer foot, and pledging to repeat. The act of building becomes the protagonist's perpetual work, shifting from passive execution to committed practice. The major turn traces to this action: the compass built through cryptic calls enables the inland journey and the final recognition. Early signal, three beats, closure linkage, causal pressure. Essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Cryptic phone calls at midnight appear in three beats: "The call light glows at midnight, and the first voice rasps through," "Through cryptic phone calls at midnight, my hands learn a choreography," and "This compass we built through cryptic phone calls at midnight does not lead me to Mara; it leads me with her." The method shapes the protagonist's work: the instructions are received without explanation, creating the frame that becomes the compass. The final recognition credits the method for the compass's creation. Early signal, two development beats, closure linkage. The method matters (it builds the compass), but its mechanics remain abstract (the content of the calls is elided). Shapes one key turn and contributes to the ending's charge, but could be more causally detailed.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The starlit signal station is present from the opening and anchors four beats: the hydraulic failure that initiates the narrative, the protagonist sitting "inside its ribbed throat" to receive calls and build, the beacon's shift from sweeping to pointing that forces the inland journey, and the final commitment to return. The station's pulse and beacon constrain choices: the beacon points inland, the protagonist follows, and the station will dim without the navigator's return. The setting supplies the call mechanism, the building workspace, and the directive that launches the plot. Early signal, four beats, causal pressure (beacon shift narrows options), closure linkage (the protagonist will return), and visible cost (the station's pulse will famish). Essential and indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"After the hydraulics fail" frames the narrative from the opening line and recurs: "After the flood, after the evacuation, after the hydraulics fail on the ferry that never came back for us." The hydraulic failure is the inciting condition that strands the protagonist at the station and precipitates the loss of Mara. The timeframe is past-tense reflective rather than live clock; it sets the premise but does not tighten present decisions (the moon phase does that). Early signal, one development beat (the ferry memory), closure participation is indirect (the failure is the condition for all subsequent action but does not reappear in the final image). Shapes one key turn, but the time constraint is not live or escalating.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"To navigate the geography of loss, not the coastline" is stated early and drives the protagonist's journey: the station "knows this," the beacon points inland, and the protagonist follows to the shelter where Mara's notes lie. The motivation is dramatized through choices: wrapping the censer foot, setting out across the flats, kneeling to find the notes, placing the censer foot to complete the compass. The final recognition—"reverse migration is not return but recognition, not recovery but route"—crystallizes the motivation as perpetual work. Friction between wants (to find Mara) and costs (the station will dim, the work never ends) is visible. Early signal, three beats, closure linkage, causal pressure, visible cost. Essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Raw solace is not named but embodied throughout: "the station exhales steam like a wounded animal learning to breathe," "raw solace lives in the act of charting what we cannot repair," "the compass will sleep, and the needle will rest on the censer foot, quiet as ash before new incense." The tone coheres through turns—loss is neither overcome nor denied but mapped as route—and modulates with pressure: technical precision in the building sequences, elegiac memory in the inland journey, quiet commitment in the final stanza. The tone charges the final image: the protagonist will return, the work continues, and the solace is raw because it is perpetual. Coherent through turns, modulates with pressure, charges the final image.</comment>
