<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The clairvoyant guide and baker pilgrim carry distinct interior textures—the guide's prophetic failure ("I did not see it coming") and the pilgrim's sensory memory of flour anchor their choices. The pearl's refusal of the guide ("my hand strays into a chord that empties me of certainty") embodies a credible reversal with visible cost. However, the pilgrim's motivation remains largely告知 rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses; his laugh at the end asserts understanding without on-page struggle. Internal contradiction is present but not sustained under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its lyric pattern early (singing cave, music choosing the pilgrim) and pays it off when the pearl "births a tone" and walls "inhabit themselves with echoes of bread lines." Orientation anchors by line 3 (clairvoyant, musical crystal cave, pilgrim with map). Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration—the pearl's choice of the pilgrim reweights everyday magic with conceptual cost (the guide's prophecy broken, duty redefined). One minor causality slip: "unseen forces draft a different script" reads as convenience plotting, but the pearl's rolling toward the pilgrim is prepared by his scent of flour.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cave actively constrains choice: crystal ribs ring when they breathe, the pearl trembles at the scent of flour, the highest stalactite receives the offering. Micro-setting (the chamber, the bell of silence, overlapping shadows as pathway) charges multiple beats and the final image. Sensory selection is vivid and filtered through the clairvoyant's perceptual bias ("bright darkness, the color of listening"). Spatial choreography remains clean despite lyric compression.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: magnify everyday magic, signaled early. The pilgrim's kneeling choice—"not to take it, but to ask what taking might change"—narrows options with moral calculus. The pearl's refusal of the guide and rolling to the pilgrim is a meaningful reversal that reweights prophecy versus humble spell. The final offering to the stalactite deepens the stakes with visible cost (sharing breath and duty). Pressure accumulates under the Accumulative lens, though the guide's resistance is brief and underplayed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme (everyday magic over heroics) emerges through particulars: the scent of flour, bread lines, lullabies, market gossip. The pearl's behavior dramatizes the concept without stating it. The ending image—"bright darkness becomes a cloak that does not blind"—resonates as Conceptual Repricing, reweighting prophecy and the clairvoyant's failure. The pilgrim's laugh ("the reason this place exists") risks thematic echo but is anchored in the cave's response. No sermonizing; the closing lines trust the image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>First-person singular POV is stable and controlled. The clairvoyant's perceptual signature is distinct: "the color of listening," "I fall behind, watching their twin shadows." Diction is purposefully lyric and compressed ("lanterns" as audience for stories, "cradle beat that carried me once"). One minor slip: "He, the pilgrim" reads as unnecessary apposition given prior clarity. Psychic distance modulates with pressure (the guide's certainty emptying at the touch of the chord). No head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; figurative density is high but coherent within the taught lyric mode. Information density is strong: "a locket of syllables forged by drips and patience" does multiple jobs. Minor template cadence in the opening third: three consecutive "We/I/The" sentence stems without variation. One paraphrase loop: "I did not see it coming" recurs twice without added pressure. No loops or artifacts touch the closure beat. Propulsion is maintained despite compression.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of clairvoyant failure, baker pilgrim, and musical cave is specific and non-obvious. The pearl choosing the pilgrim based on scent memory rather than mystical worthiness transforms the "chosen one" trope. "Bright darkness, the color of listening" and "the way dew returns sky to grass" are fresh inflections. The commitment to everyday magic over wizardry is bold and fully realized. Risk: the lyric compression could obscure, but the pattern is taught early and pays off at closure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Clairvoyant present throughout; frames the journey (hired to guide, predict cracks); appears in two key beats (reaching to stop the pearl, hand straying into the chord that empties certainty); closure directly involves the failed prophecy reweighted. The character's choices alter tactics (falling behind, witnessing rather than delivering). Cost is visible: prophecy broken, role redefined. Early signal, beat involvement, closure linkage all present.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Cave pearl present in setup (chamber with the pearl), middle beat (trembles at flour scent, rolls toward pilgrim's palm), and closure (raised to stalactite, births a tone, charges the final image). Drives at least three beats. Specificity high: "round as a moon and dull as a pebble, until the choir of rock inhales." Causal pressure: the pearl's refusal of the guide and choice of the pilgrim narrows options. Indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Unseen forces shape stakes early ("the map listens more than it speaks, drawn by unseen forces") and recur at the climax ("unseen forces draft a different script," "spread like warmed butter"). Enable the pearl's movement and the guide's hand straying. Constrain at least one choice (the guide's failed attempt to stop the pearl). Appear in closure participation (forces seeping along fissures, stitching light to dark). Early signal, beat involvement, closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Steadily unpredictable applied to the cave's tones ("steady as rain yet steadily unpredictable") and recurs when chords "grow steadily unpredictable, bursting into polyrhythms." Shapes the pilgrim's experience and the guide's uncertainty. Enables one key beat (the music choosing the pilgrim). Present in first third, reappears in middle, but does not directly charge the closure image. Two-gate presence with moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Inhabit appears in the middle beat ("rings braid into pathways only patient ears can inhabit") and closure ("Walls begin to inhabit themselves with echoes"). Two distinct uses. The action reweights the ending but does not drive a major turn; the pearl's movement and the pilgrim's offering are the primary closure actions. Lyric reprise with some causal work, but swappable with "fill" or "resonate" without major structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Through overlapping shadows signaled in first third ("The path is taken through overlapping shadows") and recurs at a key beat ("I fall behind, watching their twin shadows overlap and separate, and the way forward appears through overlapping shadows"). Two-gate presence with purposeful reprise. The method provides the pathway but does not constrain a choice with cost. Lyric function more than causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Musical crystal cave present throughout; setting actively pressures choices (crystal ribs ring when they breathe, chamber hushes, stalactite receives the offering). Drives at least three beats. Provides the resources (the pearl, the choir of rock, the bell of silence) that shape the outcome. Micro-setting (the chamber, the overlapping shadows, the highest stalactite) alters tactics. Early signal, beat involvement, closure linkage, high specificity. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>After the pilgrim arrives establishes the temporal frame in the opening line. All action occurs in a continuous present after arrival. Time does not tighten decisions or track as a live constraint; the piece unfolds in lyric accumulation rather than deadline pressure. Present as frame but does not shape tactics or narrow options. Setup only, no middle development or closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>To magnify everyday magic signaled early ("We came to magnify everyday magic, not to conquer it") and recurs at closure ("the reason this place exists, to magnify everyday magic"). Drives the pilgrim's choice to ask rather than take, and the final offering to share. Friction between the guide's prophetic mission and the pilgrim's humble spell. Cost tied to the motivation: the guide's role redefined, prophecy broken. Early signal, beat involvement, closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Bright darkness present in first third ("He, the pilgrim, murmurs that the dark here feels bright"; "I call it bright darkness, the color of listening") and charges the closure image ("bright darkness becomes a cloak that does not blind"). Tone is coherent and modulates with pressure (from expectation to reversal to acceptance). The oxymoron reweights perception at the end. Lyric reprise with strong closure participation. Two-gate presence with thematic charge.</comment>
