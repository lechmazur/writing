<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interior voice is distinctive—"I lead through following"—and micro-choices (choosing the locket, waving in the news crew) emerge from a consistent curatorial stance. However, the protagonist remains competent without genuine struggle; no blind spot or mistake compounds before resolution. The courtyard inhabitants are sketched through testimony rather than live pressure, reducing relationship friction. Embodied emotion is present ("hands tucked, mouths open only to breathe through patience") but the collective ritual smooths individual contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of layered testimony early and sustains it; the mailbox opens when communal ache reaches critical density, a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. Cost is legible: the letters inside confirm Noemi's absence and the community's ongoing vigil replaces closure with "open library" maintenance. One meaningful deepening (Marta's and Jonah's confessions narrow the ritual from curiosity to shared vulnerability) tightens the dominant stake under accumulative logic. Causal linkage is light—stories "click some unseen tumbler"—but the lens permits metaphoric causality when the final image reweights prior material with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The courtyard supplies proximate resources (hibiscus shadows, the bolted mailbox, bougainvillea) that frame every beat and the locked box physically constrains choice throughout. The hairpin from the locket becomes a micro-setting tool that charges the climax. Sensory selection is purposeful: "sandstorm calm, a hush gritty and tender around our ankles" filters environment through the narrator's curatorial lens. Spatial choreography remains clear across the circle formation and the news crew's arrival.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—proving that listening heals—is signaled in the opening and tested when the outside world (developers, camera crew) intrudes. One meaningful deepening: the confessions of Marta and Jonah raise vulnerability cost and the protagonist's waving-in of the crew transforms threat into witness. Agency is clear in the choice to tap the hairpin and lead the ritual. However, no live option is visibly foreclosed; the news crew lowers gear without friction, and the mailbox opens through accumulated testimony rather than a hard trade-off. Cost is felt but diffuse across the collective rather than a single consequential sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—listening as repair—emerges organically from the ritual structure and Noemi's planted letters without overt statement. The final image of the unlocked mailbox "a throat cleared for ongoing song" and the instruction to "tap your story into our common lock" reweights prior material with non-literal resonance. Subtext operates in the developer's silent tears and the crew's widened eyes. The story resists tidy closure: Noemi's return is promised "with rain," leaving ambiguity without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>First-person singular POV remains stable with a distinct curatorial idiom: "I inventory stories before objects." Psychic distance is controlled; the narrator infers community feeling but does not breach individual interiorities. Dialogue is absent, limiting voice-distinction tests, but reported speech ("Old Mr. Paredes whispered," "Aya said") carries subtext through the narrator's curation. Occasional elevated diction ("metronome of ache," "communal breath") fits the thrift-store poet stance but edges toward stock lyricism in peak beats without full embodiment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high across most beats. However, patterned lyricism pervades: "each rib a rumor, each breath witness," "the lock changed from metal to ache, then listening," "we heal in the hearing." These metaphoric strings cluster in the climax without teaching a pattern early, blurring concrete action under decorative layers. Template cadence appears in the final third: five consecutive sentences open with bare subjects + past-tense verbs ("One carried," "Another explained," "I passed," "No camera rolled," "A vendor stopped"), reducing propulsion. No paraphrase loops, but figurative density in peak beats triggers mid-band positioning per the overwriting check.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The mailbox-as-listening-device premise offers a fresh angle on community repair narratives, and the curator-as-facilitator role avoids stock hero templates. The hairpin's repurposing (from locket to tuning tool) shows earned ingenuity. However, the outside-world intrusion resolves too smoothly—developers and news crews soften without cost—suggesting a safety middle that avoids hard trade-offs. Emotional specificity is present in Marta's and Jonah's confessions, but the collective ritual risks abstracting individual stakes into a generalized ache.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The curator appears in every beat, framing the ritual and making two key choices: selecting the locket (early second third) and waving in the news crew (climax). "Discerning" is embodied through the act of cataloging and choosing the right object. The role enables the listening method and charges the ending instruction. However, the trait itself (curation) does not impose visible cost or constrain a live option; decisions flow smoothly from competence rather than friction.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The locket is cataloged early ("aged locket Noemi traded"), handled mid-story ("I unlocked the thrift shop, pulled the drawer marked Jewelry, and chose the aged locket"), and its hairpin becomes the climactic tool ("I slipped the hairpin from the aged locket and held it like a tuning fork"). Three distinct beats with escalating function. The object's "blistered gold" and "pressed pink thread" supply specificity, and its final instruction to "take the hairpin, then tap your story into our common lock" reweights the opening catalog. Removing it would require a substitute tool, but another key-like object could serve with minor edits, capping irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The locked mailbox is introduced in paragraph five, frames every middle beat (Aya's midnight click, the circle around it, the tap-by-tap ritual), and provides the climactic reversal when it "sighed open." Its locked state drives tactics (storytelling to unlock) and the letters inside supply the closure payoff. The mystery shapes the dominant stake throughout and the mailbox's final unlocked state—"a throat cleared for ongoing song"—charges the ending image. Removing this exact element would collapse the story's logic and central metaphor.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Leads through following" is stated early and demonstrated twice: setting out cups without direction, and waving the news crew in "without speeches" by modeling the hush. The trait enables the non-authoritarian method and is thematically coherent. However, it does not visibly constrain a choice or impose cost; the narrator's competence allows smooth execution. The phrase recurs in the final third as a thematic echo, but no moment shows a friction between leading and following that would elevate integration above functional.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Hear" is the engine action: the narrator asks for stories "that hurt to carry" and promises to carry them; the mailbox "hear[s] us, the pins inside rearranging as if on breath"; the city "heard us anyway." The verb drives the method, is present in the climax ("we could hear"), and anchors the final proof ("we heal in the hearing"). Three beats with escalating stakes. Swapping for "witness" or "listen" would require only minor lexical edits but would lose the metaphoric layer of the lock hearing, preserving most structure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Neighborhood storytelling is introduced early (Mr. Paredes, Aya, Dove testify) and structures the middle escalation (Marta and Jonah confess). The method is signaled by "I mapped a body of rumor" and dramatized through the circle ritual. It shapes attempts (each voice "clicked some unseen tumbler") and the climax depends on it. The method does not appear in the final image itself—letters and the hairpin take over—capping closure participation, but it enables every prior beat and the proof that "listening heals."</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The courtyard is named in the opening line, supplies hibiscus shadows and bougainvillea as spatial anchors, and hosts every beat. The dawn timeframe and the circle formation around the mailbox provide spatial choreography. However, the setting does not impose a resource constraint or alter a tactic under pressure; it functions as a stable container rather than a dynamic pressure. The final instruction to "gather at dawn in the courtyard" reprises the opening frame, reweighting it as ongoing practice, which lifts integration into mid-6s under the lyric-resonance allowance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"When the outside world intrudes" is signaled midway ("developers fanned brochures," "camera crew rehearsed smiles") and provides the complication that tests the protagonist's listening-heals thesis. The intrusion tightens the decision to wave the crew in and charges the vendor's request for a letter. However, the timeframe itself is vague—dawn stretches without a live clock—and the intrusion resolves smoothly without escalating cost. The phrase recurs in the penultimate paragraph as thematic reprise, acknowledging future returns, which adds lyric closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to prove that listening heals" is stated in paragraph four and tested across every beat: the storytelling ritual, the mailbox opening, the news crew's transformation, and the vendor's tears. The desire drives the choice to lead through following and the final proof is declared: "we heal in the hearing." Friction between want and cost is light—no failure or doubt appears on the page—but the letters inside ("Anyone Who Needs") confirm that the proof is iterative rather than conclusive, adding a layer of earned humility. The motivation shapes the dominant stake and the closure image directly.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Sandstorm calm, a hush gritty and tender" is introduced early and sustained through "Noise pressed at the gates, but our center kept its slow orbit," the "gentle hush we kept," and the crew's "shoulders dusted with calm." The tone modulates with pressure—urgency rises with the intrusion, then softens as the crew lowers gear—and charges the final instruction's quiet imperative. The paradox (storm + calm) is embodied in tactile detail ("gritty," "dusted") rather than asserted, and the ending's open invitation maintains the tone without resolving it into static peace.</comment>
