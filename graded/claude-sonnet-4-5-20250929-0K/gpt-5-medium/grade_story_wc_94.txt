<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The poet's motivation is stated but never tested through a concrete on-page choice with visible cost. Interiority relies heavily on abstract, label-heavy phrasing ("furiously tranquil," "rarefy fear into clarity") rather than embodied contradiction. The caretaker functions as exposition conduit rather than pressure source; their dialogue delivers backstory without forcing the poet to forfeit or risk anything. The final tracing gesture and declarative statement "This is why I write" read as summary rather than earned renunciation or stance crystallization.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: storm imagery, constellation motifs, and cartography language recur and build density. Orientation anchors appear late—who/where/when crystallize only after the caretaker's first line, well past 120 words—but the disorientation does not pay off at closure, triggering the −0.3 penalty. Closure attempt is Conceptual Repricing (the poet understands the cartography of scars), but cost remains abstract; no on-page sentence shows what path is foreclosed or what the poet sacrifices to gain this knowledge. The final image ("healed page drying") offers metaphorical resonance without dramatized consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The observatory dome, darkroom timer, and storm are vividly rendered and sensory detail is selective. The timer and chart constrain one mid-scene action (pressing the button, tracing the constellation), satisfying the micro-setting test. However, spatial choreography of the two characters within the dome remains vague—no clear positioning or movement tracking—and the storm functions primarily as backdrop rather than altering tactics at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to understand the cartography of scars"—is signaled early but never meaningfully tightened. The poet arrives, listens, traces a map, and declares understanding without facing a live choice that narrows options or imposes cost. The caretaker's revelation about the teacher is pure exposition; the poet does not have to trade, endure, or forfeit anything to receive it. No reversal or deepening changes the poet's tactical options; the storm "rolls nearer as if listening" but does not force action.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme (wounds as navigable maps, forbidden speech reclaimed through witness) emerges through recurring imagery rather than assertion. The constellation-in-ash motif and the censored-versus-spoken poem contrast carry subtext. However, the ending offers a tidy, stated moral—"This is why I write, to understand the cartography of scars"—rather than a resonant, non-literal image. The "healed page drying" metaphor gestures toward complexity but the prior beats have not dramatized the cost of that healing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Single third-person POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction is consistently elevated and lyric ("furiously tranquil," "rarefy," "arterial lines"), maintaining a singular narrative texture. However, the register remains uniformly poeticized even during high-pressure exchanges, reducing contrast and flattening urgency. Dialogue carries exposition rather than subtext or goal pursuit; the caretaker's lines function as guided tour rather than character-driven speech. Perceptual signature is generic contemplative rather than poet-specific.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching or clear payoff: "storm-kissed wonder," "night-blooming atlas," "alleyways like sutures, highways like lightning that refused to leave." Mixed metaphors appear ("storm stepping back to the horizon" after "listening," "arterial lines" for city wounds). Paraphrase loops recur: the phrase "furiously tranquil" appears three times with minimal reweighting. Template cadence runs dominate: "They [verb]... they [verb]... their [noun]" structures stack across paragraphs. Applying density (−0.5), coherence (−0.5), and loop penalties (−0.4) totals approximately −1.4 in Q7, with artifacts touching the closure beat (final tracing gesture) disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The core premise—censored poet reads secret map to forbidden knowledge in storm observatory—assembles familiar elements (forbidden art, secret teacher, literal cartography of trauma) without fresh synthesis. The storm-as-witness and scars-as-constellation images are vivid but not transformed; swapping "poet" for "musician" and "verses" for "compositions" would leave the emotional arc intact. The "furiously tranquil" phrase strains for paradox but remains ornamental. No bold structural or perspectival risk elevates the execution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The censored poet is present throughout and is the focalizer. Setup and development gates are met (arrives seeking understanding, receives map/photo). However, the poet's choices are reactive—listening, asking, tracing—rather than driving turns. The final declaration "This is why I write" is summary, not decision with cost. Mid-band functional presence without causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The darkroom timer appears early (carried "like a metronome"), is placed on the railing, pressed twice to time the storm, and stopped "at the crest of thunder." Three distinct beats satisfy the object-involvement test. However, the timer's function is metaphorical rather than mechanically causal—it does not alter tactics or enable a choice the poet could not otherwise make. Payoff gate is met (restarted in final paragraph to "measure how long their courage would echo"), but the cost connection is abstract.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"A vigil in pause" is named explicitly twice and thematically enacted when the poet times "the space between the flashes and the answers" and stops "the clock at the crest of thunder, holding a vigil in pause that felt like stepping through glass." Setup and payoff gates are met. The concept shapes the poet's stance (measuring rather than rushing) but does not narrow tactical options or impose a visible cost; the poet could achieve the same understanding without the pause.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Furiously tranquil" is used three times as a descriptive label (the caretaker, the poet's hands, the poet's arrival) but never constrains or enables a choice with cost. The trait is asserted rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting in scene. Ornamental recurrence without mechanical pressure; mid-band functional at best.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Rarefy" appears once in literal form ("the mountain air began to rarefy around their lungs, thinning fear into clarity") and once metaphorically ("the storm rarefy language into a map that breathed"). The action is poetic shorthand for transformation but does not drive a turn or alter options. Swappable with "clarify" or "distill" without structural loss; late metaphorical use does not create closure necessity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The sealed envelope in the bus timetable is introduced early (paragraph 2), contains the map and constellation signature that motivate the journey, and is referenced by the caretaker ("Your envelope was delivered by hands that cannot be named"). Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. The method matters narratively—it establishes the teacher's hidden communication—but mechanically it could be replaced (hidden note in library book, graffiti tag) without breaking the logic. Functional across beats but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory is established early, houses the action, and provides the dome's bolt-tracker, the camera, and the chart—all used in middle beats. The setting's altitude and exposure to the storm enable the timing vigil and the visual constellation overlay. Payoff: "the observatory loosened its grip, the night opened" charges the exit. The observatory is essential to the vigil concept and the storm-witness imagery; removing it would require major rewrite. Strong integration across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"When masks slip" is the meeting condition in the envelope and is repeated by the caretaker ("Tonight is when masks slip... when the air admits its ghosts"). Setup and thematic payoff are present, but the timeframe does not tighten decisions—the poet has already arrived and the storm unfolds without urgency or countdown. Middle development is weak; the phrase operates as metaphorical coloring rather than a clock that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"To understand the cartography of scars" is stated by the poet mid-scene and echoed in the final paragraph ("This is why I write, to understand the cartography of scars"). Setup and payoff gates are met. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting choices or costs; the poet never faces friction between the desire to know and a price for knowing. Functional thematic thread without visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>"Storm-kissed wonder" anchors the observatory description early and recurs in related images (thunderclaps as bells, flashes as pages, arterial lines). Tone is coherent and lyric throughout. However, the tone does not modulate under pressure—the prose remains uniformly elevated and poeticized even during the revelation about the erased teacher—and the final image ("glimmered like a healed page drying") sustains the same register without intensification or break. Coherent but static; mid-band for consistent mood without dynamic charge.</comment>
