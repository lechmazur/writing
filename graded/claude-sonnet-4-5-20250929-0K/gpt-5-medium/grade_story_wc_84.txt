<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The drone pilot POV maintains consistent perceptual texture (observation-driven vocabulary, attention to pattern and legibility). The pilgrim remains opaque throughout—interior access is withheld entirely, reducing relational pressure to a series of declarations rather than embodied stakes. "Perpetually surprised" appears three times but functions as a label rather than a trait that constrains choice with visible cost. The final shift ("no longer perpetually surprised") is asserted without dramatized cause, and the pilot's calibration "for kindness" arrives as therapy-speak rather than earned renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors who/where/when by line three. The accumulative design layers drone work, matrix chip translation, and collaborative decoding toward a Conceptual Repricing: "belonging is not found but tuned" reweights the opening stake. Cost is oblique—the pilgrim "tucks it under their tongue," the dome rotates "with us"—but the final image of shared cadence and mutual trust reconfigures the initial isolation with felt pressure. One meaningful deepening occurs when silence is recognized as letter (~midpoint), shifting the translation method and enabling the climactic printout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The observatory supplies concrete resources (brass gears, slit of sky, carved constellations underfoot, targeting stones) that the pilot and pilgrim handle across multiple beats. Dusk as "brilliant dimness" charges the opening and closing images, modulating through "thinner" and "soft electricity." The matrix chip cradle soldered from a broken sextant demonstrates tool-use specificity, and the dome's rotation enables the climactic drone spiral. Spatial choreography remains legible: drones move through the slit, beams brush floor carvings, the spiral traces script across the opening night.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: decode the frequency of belonging. One meaningful tightening occurs when the algorithm is adjusted to "read silence as a letter," enabling the climactic message. The pilgrim's hand trembling "above the paper as if it were a pond" and the whispered idea that "letters might be waiting for a story" register pressure, but the resolution lacks visible cost—both characters walk away improved without forfeiting a live option. Agency exists (adjusting the algorithm, guiding drones), but the final agreement to return feels additive rather than renunciatory.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme (belonging as tuning rather than discovery) emerges through concrete work: adjusting the algorithm, translating silence, following star trails. The matrix chip's shift to "speak without vowels altogether" and the realization that "blanks are not errors, but rests" move from problem to insight without meta-commentary. The final line ("belonging is not found but tuned, by following star trails until the spaces between letters agree to hold you") edges toward thesis statement but is integrated as directive printout rather than authorial voice. The observatory-as-sentence-diagram image resonates without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>POV distance remains stable; first-person pilot narration filters all perception through attention to pattern, legibility, and horizon. Voice carries distinct texture: "perpetually surprised," "who I belong to," "horizon to be a sentence," "cameras drink photons and doubt." Two register slips: "cadence like footsteps arriving after a long border of gravel" and "soft electricity, a hush that is both shelter and proof" elevate diction beyond the established idiom. The pilgrim's scant dialogue ("what absence brought them here") lacks subtext or resistance; answers "hide behind a wince and wind" rather than dramatizing evasion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; most sentences advance image or action. Two paraphrase loops: "perpetually surprised" recycled across three beats without functional change; "missing pieces" appears in map description, printout blanks, and final paragraph with synonym churn (gaps/absence/blanks) rather than reweighted meaning. Filter-verb stack in one high-pressure beat: "I recognize," "I realize," "I adjust," "I confess" flattens immediacy. Figurative density is high but mostly coherent; "letters and orbits were relatives who stopped using last names" and "tucked it under their tongue as if storing thunder" serve voice without muddle. Minor template cadence: repeated "The [noun] [verb]" openings across five paragraphs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of drone cartography, type foundry matrix, and observatory astronomy offers a fresh premise that avoids stock pilgrimage tropes. The realization that silence functions as letter rather than error provides a non-obvious turn. The ending resists tidy closure: both characters commit to return, and the city "catches fragments of our cadence" rather than achieving complete decoding. Risk: the lyric accumulation and metaphoric density (horizon as sentence, observatory as sentence diagram) heighten stakes without obscuring causality. Swappability test: replacing drones with another remote-sensing tool or the matrix chip with a different translator would require structural rewrites.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Pilot present throughout; makes two key choices: adjusting the algorithm to read silence as letter (midpoint) and banking the drones into a spiral that traces the new script (climax). Early signal: "I am a sharp-eyed drone pilot, hired to chart the sky" (line two). Closure participation: "I am still the sharp-eyed drone pilot, but now my eyes are calibrated for kindness" reframes the role. Cost: the shift from hired task to collaborative tuning forecloses the transactional distance established at the start.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Matrix chip appears in four beats: scavenged backstory (line five), inserted into cradle (line fifteen), hums in different register (line twenty-seven), brightens at climax (line thirty-one). Its etched gates "respond to starlight" and "translate the sky into movable type," enabling the printout directive. Specificity: "type foundry matrix chip" from "a city press that once minted alphabets like constellations" ties typographic history to celestial navigation. Closure linkage: the chip's brightness coincides with the pilgrim's voice matching the screen pattern, charging the resolution. No visible cost tied directly to the chip itself.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Missing pieces" shapes stakes from line seven onward: cracked tiles, broken astrolabe teeth, gaps in inscriptions. The printout shows "blank sorts where vowels of home should be" (line seventeen), driving the midpoint realization that blanks are rests rather than errors. The pilgrim's hand trembles "above the paper as if it were a pond" when reaching toward absence (line eighteen). Closure participation: "the night trusts us with its missing pieces" (final line) reweights absence as trust rather than deficit. The concept alters tactics (adjusting the algorithm) and charges the final image with felt cost (accepting incompletion as method).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Perpetually surprised" appears three times: describing the pilgrim's eyes (line three), as narrator reaction to laughter (line eleven), and negated at closure ("no longer perpetually surprised," line thirty-eight). The trait does not constrain an on-page action or create visible cost. Line eleven ("I am again perpetually surprised by how laughter turns structures tender") applies the label to the pilot rather than the pilgrim, diluting specificity. The final negation is asserted without dramatized cause. Functions as thematic echo rather than causal lever.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Pull" appears once: "I pull the rope that once rotated it, and the brass gears sigh awake" (line twelve). The action enables the dome rotation that opens the slit for the drones, a necessary step. No visible cost or character trade-off accompanies the pull. Swappability: the action could be replaced with "unlatch," "crank," or "release" without structural change. Early signal present (line twelve of thirty-nine). Not revisited at closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Following star trails" is signaled at line nine ("we will navigate by following star trails"), governs the drones' work (line fourteen: "three drones into the slit of sky" with "cameras drink photons"), and returns in the climactic printout: "belonging is not found but tuned, by following star trails until the spaces between letters agree to hold you" (line thirty-three). The method shapes attempts: drones trace trails, glyphs align to trails (line sixteen), and the final spiral "traces the new script across the opening night" (line thirty-six). Closure participation strong; cost oblique (time, collaborative patience).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Observatory present from title and line one. Supplies multiple resources: dome and rope (line twelve), slit of sky (line fourteen), carved constellations underfoot (line twenty-four), targeting stones (line twenty). The dome rotates "with us" at climax (line thirty-seven), and the space becomes "our compass" (line thirty-nine). Setting pressures choice: the dome "resists at first" (line twelve), requiring the pilot to pull the rope; the observatory "leans in" (line thirty) when the pilgrim reads. Micro-setting: the matrix chip cradle soldered from a broken sextant (line fifteen) demonstrates tool-use specificity. Dusk as "brilliant dimness" charges opening and closing images.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Timeframe "after the pilgrim arrives" anchors the scene's start but does not track elapsed time or create urgency. Dusk transitions to "thinner" (line thirteen) and then "opening night" (line thirty-six), providing atmospheric progression without deadline pressure. No clock or ticking constraint forces choices; the collaborative work unfolds at a pace determined by discovery rather than external time limit. Setup present (title and line one); no development or closure cost tied to temporal scarcity.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Decode the frequency of belonging" is stated at line four and drives the collaborative work: translating glyphs (line sixteen), recognizing blanks as rests (line twenty-seven), adjusting the algorithm (line twenty-seven), and producing the final printout directive (line thirty-three). The pilgrim's backstory ("cities that welcome only the finished," line twenty-three) dramatizes the desire. Friction exists between want (belonging) and method (accepting missing pieces), but the resolution grants both without visible forfeiture. The pilot's confession ("I belong to whoever needs the horizon to be a sentence," line ten) reframes motivation mid-scene. Closure participation: "belonging is not found but tuned" (line thirty-three) answers the opening desire.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Brilliant dimness" appears in the opening line and returns as "a brilliant dimness settling like an answer we have not earned" (line thirteen). The oxymoron governs sensory detail throughout: "last purple ribbon of day," "dusk becomes thinner," "soft electricity, a hush that is both shelter and proof," "threading warmth through the cooling air." Tone modulates with pressure: initial breathlessness gives way to collaborative focus, then to quiet triumph in the final spiral. The paradox (brilliant yet dim, shelter yet proof) charges the closure image: the city "catches fragments of our cadence" (line thirty-seven) rather than full illumination, maintaining the opening tone's ambiguity.</comment>
