<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The archivist's interiority is densely textured and consistent—"faithful to preservation and starving for escape" drives the central choice. The hesitation ritual ("arranging lamps, recording breath, polishing the seal again") embodies contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final decision to release the letter feels earned by prior causality, with visible cost: "I did not know if I had preserved it or set it free, only that both mattered." Minor deduction: the archivist's expertise in conduit mechanics arrives late without prior signal, slightly weakening the preparation for the climactic choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Charged Poise/Resonant Reconfiguration: the letter is released through dormant networks, transforming the city's "dizzying quiet" into "tiny decisions" and "walking changed," with visible cost ("I did not know if I had preserved it or set it free"). The accumulative/textural lens holds throughout—density increases via braided images (frost, letters, conduits, breath) that converge at the midnight release. Orientation anchors (library, snow, archivist role) arrive early. One minor slip: the transition from reading the letter's historical content to deciding to release it compresses motivation slightly, though the "ritual from hesitation" passage bridges adequately.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The frozen library constrains every choice: frost-furred pipes, glass cases, the storm pressing panes create tactile urgency. The return duct for old microfiche becomes the release mechanism, earning its specificity. The body under visor, breath fogging glass, sitting with shelves that "knew already" my heartbeat—micro-setting charges the final image when "frost bloomed across the glass like a curtain call." The plaza's blind switch and dormant conduits map infrastructure as lived setting rather than backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preservation vs. escape, silence vs. speech) is signaled early and tightens through the hesitation ritual. The midnight grid-reset provides a timed window that narrows options and forces the release. The cost is legible: professional discipline melts, future uncertain, yet "people did not speak of what moved them, yet their walking changed"—a distributed consequence that reweights the protagonist's isolation. One small gap: the council's impotent response (meeting to "denounce vandalism") could have shown sharper risk to the archivist personally, but the story privileges systemic change over individual peril.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme (maintenance as courtship, love as refusal to let things fail unseen, archival work as keeping the world discussable) emerges organically from the letter's content and the archivist's act. The final image—"frost bloomed across the glass like a curtain call"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer: preservation and release are not opposites but twin gestures. "To archive was not to hoard but to keep the world discussable" avoids platform thesis by embedding the insight in specific action. The ending's conceptual repricing (bench "forgot to be a bench and remembered being a rendezvous") reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is consistent and architecturally precise: "voltage dies," "backups," "clock pulses," "duct coughed awake." The archivist's way of noticing blends technical lexicon with lyric compression ("grammar of maintenance," "fuse braided with tenderness"). Psychic distance holds steady in first-person reflection anchored to tactile present (warming seal, feeding letter into duct). Minor slip: "They told me of maintenance as courtship" anthropomorphizes the letters in a manner slightly outside the established voice, though it reads as intentional personification under pressure rather than POV leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high: most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "Pipes hissed beneath the aisles where frost furred the brass like patient moss" anchors setting, mood, and the freeze motif). Rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language is mostly controlled. Two deductions: the phrase "dizzying quiet" recurs five times, becoming a tonal anchor rather than a loop, but "quiet" + "silence" synonym churn appears in adjacent beats mid-story. Template cadence in the catalog passage ("The exile documented... The wife traced...") slightly flattens momentum. No loops touch the closure beat, so caps do not apply.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of cryogenic archivist, dangerous liaison letter, and dormant infrastructure as metaphor for silenced speech is specific and non-obvious. The transformation of "maintenance as courtship" trope into a political act of distributed whisper via obsolete networks feels earned. Risk: the heavily lyric style and oblique action could obscure causality, yet the piece commits fully and the midnight grid-reset grounds the fantastical release in plausible routine. Minor proximity concern: "grammar of maintenance" and "meet me where voltage dies" echo certain contemporary poetic registers, but the integration with the plot's infrastructure prevents derivative feel.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The cryogenic archivist role frames expectation early ("keeper of the frozen stacks"), enables the recognition of the letter's danger, provides access to dormant conduits, and drives the key choice to release it at midnight. The role's tension (preservation vs. exposure) is embodied in the hesitation ritual and final decision. Present across all three gates and causally active at closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The dangerous liaison letter appears early (envelope "colder than the rest"), is handled and warmed with breath, read for its contraband content (blind switch, passwords), becomes the object of the hesitation ritual, and is physically fed into the return duct at the climax. Its content (infrastructure + tenderness) shapes the thematic resolution and its return to the case with "frost bloomed across the glass" charges the final image. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Contraband truths" anchors the letter's quarantine status, motivates the archivist's conflict, and defines the stakes: truths that "flowered, meticulous as schematics" versus a city that "eats every whisper." The concept shapes the release tactic (whisper via networks rather than shout) and reweights at closure when "dangerous liaison letter had become our common punctuation." Present across beats and essential to closure's conceptual repricing.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Bravely conflicted" is stated once ("I was bravely conflicted, faithful to preservation and starving for escape") and dramatized through the hesitation ritual and final choice. The trait enables the decision to release while risking future, but the label itself does not recur or constrain multiple beats. Functional but the phrasing reads slightly ornamental; the conflict is better embodied in action than in this summary phrase.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Scandalize" is named as a city appetite ("eats every whisper that might scandalize its mirror") and inverted by the protagonist's desire to "provoke an unspoken conversation" rather than loud scandal. The action's form—distributed whisper that "salted minutes, bent glances"—subverts scandal into quiet change. The concept shapes tactics but the verb itself is not foregrounded at closure, making it more thematic accent than structural hinge.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Through dormant networks" is seeded early ("the founder's conduits never truly slept; they became dormant networks, laced under the stones") and becomes the release mechanism at the climax ("I fed the dangerous liaison letter into the return duct... Through dormant networks the letter threaded the city"). The method's specificity (microfiche duct, clock pulses, streetlamps, tram brakes) alters the protagonist's approach and charges the ending. Essential to closure mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The echoing library under snow provides tactile constraint (frost, breath fogging visor, storm pressing panes) that shapes every choice. The "breathless echoes" motif recurs and the ending's "echoing library under snow held its breath with me" directly charges the final image. The setting's acoustic and thermal properties are not decorative but functional: the snow "cooks silence differently," enabling the act. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Within the blink that follows surprise" frames the historical meeting in the plaza when cameras reset, and that seam becomes the model for the midnight grid-reset when the archivist acts. The timeframe tightens the decision window and recurs conceptually in the "tiny decisions" and "shy nods" that follow. Present in setup, middle reflection, and closure participation, though the blink itself is more metaphor than live clock during the protagonist's act.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The motivation "to provoke an unspoken conversation" is stated mid-story and dramatized through the choice to release via whisper rather than shout: "Not a shout, but the pause that changes a life." The friction between wanting speech and fearing exposure drives the hesitation ritual, and the ending confirms success ("couples paused mid-whisper," "their walking changed"). Desire shapes tactics and closure, with visible cost (uncertain future).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>"Dizzying quiet" opens the story, recurs as the city's discipline ("perfect silence"), modulates under pressure ("the dizzying quiet, now full of tiny decisions"), and charges the final image ("echoing library under snow held its breath with me"). The tone coherence—hush layered with accumulating pressure—holds through turns and supports the accumulative lens. The tone is not static; it reweights from oppressive to generative, making it indispensable to closure.</comment>
