<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation (to rescue the brother) is clear and embodied through memory and vow. The eel herder's precognitive curse is described but not dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene—she accepts her fate with "resigned grace" rather than struggling. The brother's displacement is told rather than shown through his experience. Interior voice remains consistent, though the elevated register occasionally distances us from raw emotion under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with visible cost: the eel herder trades places with the brother, and the protagonist inherits her work. The causal chain (promise → quest → ritual → rescue → exchange) holds under a causal lens. One meaningful tightening occurs when the spiral becomes a door and the rescue attempt forces the choice. The Orientation Test is borderline—"tidal bluff under aurora" and "season after friction disappears" are anchored by ~80 words, though the metaphysical rules take longer to clarify; waiving penalty as the disorientation serves the world-building and is functional by closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The tidal bluff, aurora, and frictionless season create a vivid, purposeful frame. The painted rocks and star dust function as micro-setting elements that constrain the rescue method. Spatial choreography during the ritual (rocks at cliff's lip, spiral of eels, door aperture) remains mostly clear. The setting charges the final image when rocks "still gleamed, holding the shore to a course it could believe." Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the metaphysical lens, though some descriptions ("velvet gravity," "cold silver") trend decorative.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rescue the brother) is clear and escalates through one meaningful tightening: the spiral-door opens, but staying open requires the eel herder's sacrifice. The protagonist's agency drives the ritual collaboration and the final acceptance of the herder's terms. The cost is visible and irreversible on the page. The brother's passivity (he can only aim, not stop) slightly undercuts joint agency, but the protagonist's choice to "brace the aperture" and accept the exchange sustains pressure through closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of understanding sacred patterns emerges through the ritual's mathematical sequences and the protagonist's vow to continue the work. The final image ("we will read it like scripture, not to be saved, but to stay awake") reweights the opening promise without moralizing. Subtext operates in the eel herder's riddling speech and the motif of friction/slipping that threads through footprints, brother's drift, and thefrictionless season. The line "arithmetic of mercy had solved itself, and my role was the remainder" risks abstraction but lands as earned insight tied to the sacrifice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV remains stable first-person with a lyric, elevated register consistent with the metaphysical frame. Perceptual signature is present in lines like "promises linger like delayed thunder" and "salt and iron." The eel herder's dialogue ("Because messages require distance") carries voice distinction, though her riddling tone occasionally feels authored rather than inhabited. Compression and poetic syntax are purposeful and taught early. Some filter verbs ("I felt the horizon hesitate," "I thought of the night") dull immediacy in a few beats, and the elevated diction occasionally distances from raw bodily experience under peak stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. Two minor issues: (1) metaphor density in the opening third ("sea sang like wire," "sketch of glimmers," "tone of borrowed dawn," "horizon hesitate") stacks without clear escalation or pattern payoff, trending toward decorative; (2) a few lines loop conceptually ("numbers we had sown sprouted points where motion could rest" echoes "sequences persuaded motion to become meaning"). Information density is high and propulsion clear. No scaffolding or template cadence. The final image recharges prior rock/pattern motifs effectively.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The combination of frictionless world, eel herding, mathematical sequences, and precognitive sacrifice feels specific and non-obvious. The metaphysical frame (collapsed star dust, aurora as grammar, eels as ancestral maps) synthesizes unusual elements organically. Risk-taking in the lyric register and compressed exposition heightens stakes without obscuring causality. The precognitive-curse-as-sacrifice is a fresh angle on the mentor's exit. Minor deduction: the "sacred patterns" framing occasionally drifts toward abstraction, and the frictionless season, while vivid, remains more atmospheric than causally essential to the brother's rescue mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The eel herder frames the quest, co-executes the ritual (placing rocks, pouring star dust), and makes the climactic sacrifice. She appears early, drives two major beats (teaching the method, enacting the trade), and her absence shapes the ending vow. Removing her exact role would collapse the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Collapsed star dust appears in three beats: introduction with demonstration, use during the ritual to hold the corridor, and legacy transfer (the pouch). Its "hunger" and weight are specific properties that anchor the door and make the rescue possible. It charges the closure by enabling the sacrifice and being passed to the protagonist.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The lingering promise is signaled early ("a debt to a brother swept sideways"), drives the protagonist's quest, and is resolved/transformed in the final vow to continue the herder's work ("no longer burned; it breathed"). It constrains the protagonist's choice to accept the sacrifice terms. Present in setup and closure; middle development is implied rather than tested.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The precognitive curse is described and motivates the herder's resignation, but its mechanics (knowing bends moments into obedience, "ache that followed every accuracy") are told rather than dramatized in a choice with visible cost. It justifies her sacrifice but does not constrain an on-page tactical decision where we see her wrestle with foreknowledge.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Harness" is the verb that frames the entire ritual: harnessing the dust's hunger, the sequences, and the eels' response. It drives the middle beat (placing rocks) and the climax (bracing the door). The story's mechanics depend on this action; swapping it would require substantial rewrite.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Placing painted rocks in mathematical sequences is taught in setup, executed in the middle ritual beat with specificity (primes, Fibonacci, perfect squares), and repeated in inverse to open the door. The method's mechanics matter: "gaps matched our line of rocks" and "numbers we had sown sprouted points where motion could rest." Removing this exact method would break the rescue logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The tidal bluff under aurora is anchored early and provides the ritual stage. The cliff's lip is used for rock placement, and the aurora "leaned closer" during the climax. The setting charges the final image ("when the aurora returns, we will read it"). It enables rather than pressures choices; postcard description is avoided but tactical constraint is light.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The frictionless season is vivid atmosphere ("boots forgot to bite stone," "every gesture slid into another meaning") and thematically resonant with the brother's drift. It appears in setup and echoes in the final practice of sequences. However, it does not tighten decisions or create a live clock; the rescue timeline is untracked. Functional but not causally essential.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The motivation to understand sacred patterns drives the protagonist's quest (vowed "to learn it in his name"), is tested when accepting the ritual's cost ("understanding will ask you to become part of them"), and transforms into the closing vow to continue the work. It creates friction between rescue desire and the price of pattern-knowledge. Present across all three gates with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Borrowed dawn" is seeded in the herder's welcoming tone and returns in "dawn, which felt borrowed again" after the sacrifice. The tone is elegiac and measured, modulating slightly during the ritual's intensity. It charges the final image by echoing the opening, reweighting "borrowed" from greeting to inheritance. Coherent but not indispensable; the lyric register would survive without this exact phrase.</comment>
