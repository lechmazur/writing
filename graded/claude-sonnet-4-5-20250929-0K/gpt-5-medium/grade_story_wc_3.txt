<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The translator's interior life is vivid and specific—"my hands trust grooves more than ink"—with clear motivation rooted in a desire to understand transition rather than retrieve the spirit. Micro-choices (reading tablets aloud, adjusting nodes, planting the seed) accumulate pressure and embody methodical care. The final stance (keeping company with transition rather than owning it) earns closure through visible restraint. Minor: the physicist-spirit remains abstract; more concrete memory friction would deepen the relational cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the haunted ambitions quiet into "a patient corridor") with visible cost: the protagonist abandons ownership of transition and accepts a companionship role. The arbor-as-sentence metaphor coheres under an Accumulative/Textural lens; pressure builds through voice-tuning and node adjustments to reestablish the serenade. Orientation is swift (magnetic arbor, clay tablets, suspended trunks). One tightening—reestablishing harmonic guidance before trunks spark—drives the arc without needing multiple reversals.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The magnetic arbor functions as micro-setting and constraint: filings swim to lines, rails hum when voice cups curvature, nodes knot into "tired eddies." These material properties shape the protagonist's tactics (tablet-to-bark pressure, vocal tuning). The seed cradle of filings and felt charges the final image when the helix drinks the tuned field. Spatial choreography (trunk by trunk, center cradle) remains clear. Brief cap at 8.3 under BRR rule does not apply since reflection stays under 20% and anchors present choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: prevent drifting rails from sparking. One meaningful tightening occurs when the protagonist moves trunk by trunk, correcting nodes, then plants the seed in the center cradle—narrowing options from diagnosis to embodied repair. The seed's split and rooting is the decisive turn, earned by prior vocal and tactile work. Cost is legible: the protagonist releases the ambition to "own transition" and accepts a service role. Agency is renunciation with visible on-page consequence (the arbor gathers weight, the seed roots).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: transition as bridge principle, sustained by companionship rather than mastery. The seed-as-lost-chord and arbor-as-sentence motifs accumulate pressure and reweight at closure when the protagonist realizes "my task was not to own transition, but to keep company." No thesis statement; the final image (seed gleaming "as though memory were a mineral") offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext operates in the protagonist's methodical restraint and the physicist's encoded notes. One anti-pattern: "always within touching distance" brushes thematic echo but is mitigated by embodied scene work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single-POV distance is stable; perceptual signature is distinct (analogical thinking, hands trusting grooves, vocables as water). Diction remains within the translator's lexicon—technical yet lyrical without register drift. Purposeful compression ("weight is rumor, and sound climbs the ladders") is taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping. Peak-stress lines maintain rhythm ("I whisper her name once, not to summon but to measure the vacuum") without syntactic monotony. Free indirect style is clean; no filter stacks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Information density is high: nearly every line advances arbor mechanics, character stance, or thematic motif. Rhythm varies purposefully (short declaratives at planting, longer cadences during reflection). No paraphrase loops or template stems. Minor: "kindly methodical" recurs three times across the text, risking repetition without pattern payoff, but does not obscure causality. Figurative language (rail-as-reed, voice-as-water) is coherent and motivated. Zero scaffold or synonym churn in closure beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The magnetic-arbor-as-grammar synthesis is non-obvious and specific; the translator's use of cuneiform tablets as both text and tactile tool to tune rails is fresh. Analogical thinking as method (reed/rail, vowel/water) transforms a familiar "restoring order" arc into a lyric exploration of vocalized physics. Risk: the piece leans heavily on metaphor density, but coherence holds. Transformation test passes: plot and arc depend on this exact arbor, seed, and translation skill. No close echo of prior work detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Present in setup (tablets, satchel), drives middle beats (reading aloud, adjusting nodes), and shapes closure (planting the seed, updating tablets). Choices narrow options and alter tactics under pressure. Cost is visible: the protagonist abandons the wish to "own transition."</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Introduced early (nested pouch), returns in middle beats (warms, picks up grammar), and is causally active at closure (planted, splits, roots, gleams). Evolving use across three beats. Removal would collapse the arbor's restoration and the protagonist's realization.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Signaled in setup ("haunted ambitions that never settled"), shapes the protagonist's drive to build maps between states, and is directly addressed at closure ("The haunted ambitions quiet"). Changes on-page options by motivating the translator's task. Cost: accepting a service role rather than mastery.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Label appears three times ("kindly methodical" at lines 3, 27, and implicitly at closure when updating tablets). Constrains pacing (trunk by trunk, node by node) with visible care. Tradeoff: methodical work is slower but prevents errors. Swappable with "patient" or "careful" with minor edits; specificity is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Signaled as the task (prevent rail drift, restore serenade), drives all middle beats (vocal tuning, node adjustment, planting), and completes at closure ("I reestablish the serenade finally"). Major turn: arbor gathers weight, rails answer, seed roots. Removal breaks the arc.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Introduced early ("as she taught, letting images bridge disciplines"), applied in middle beats (rail=reed, vowel=water, pressure=longing), and explicitly shapes closure tactics (translating force verbs into pressures). Mechanics matter: analogies enable the protagonist to tune the arbor. Not merely decorative.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Present throughout; arbor properties (magnetism, memory-as-sap, nodes, rails, trunks) constrain every beat. Filings swim to lines, rails hum when voice cups curvature, seed cradle at center charges the ending. Micro-setting alters tactics at each node. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Frames the entire narrative ("After the spirit leaves" opens and recurs). Pressure arises from the vacuum left and the need to act before trunks spark. Time is not a live ticking clock but a condition that tightens the task. Present in closure ("After the spirit leaves there is a pressure").</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stated early ("Since then I have sought to understand"), tested in middle beats (testing pressure with analogies, comparing to steam and longing), and resolved at closure ("not to own transition, but to keep company"). Friction between desire for mastery and the physicist's wish produces visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Coherent and modulated: intimate restraint pervades (whisper, patient notes, touching distance recurs). Peak moment: "The arbor releases a soft chime that finds my ribs, intimate, almost within touching distance." Tone charges the final image when the seed gleams and the protagonist accepts proximity over possession.</comment>
