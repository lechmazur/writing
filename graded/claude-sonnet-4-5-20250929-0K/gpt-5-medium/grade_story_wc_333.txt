<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal state is consistently rendered through metaphorical perception ("fog trapped in a jar"), and the decision to sing despite fear is earned by prior beats. However, the locksmith remains externalized—his choices are presented as enigmatic actions without visible internal contradiction or cost. The mother appears only as conceptual presence, not a second character exerting pressure. Minor deduction for the lack of embodied struggle in the locksmith's arc and the abstract treatment of fear as sentinel rather than lived contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred: pressure builds through mirrored courtyard imagery, ribbon handling, and singing beats that deepen the stake (voice as wound → voice as beginning). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the protagonist sings despite fear, the ribbon releases, and the idea of return is freed with felt cost ("cold that had held my tongue"). Orientation anchors (locksmith arrives, courtyard reached) land by the first third. One tightening: the courtyard scene crystallizes the choice to sing, reweighting prior silence. Cost is conceptual and relational—"the sky hummed in answer" signals acceptance, and the locksmith's departure with the ribbon marks the forfeiture of the keepsake's binding function. No causality breaks, though the metaphorical density occasionally obscures whether events are literal or interior.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The courtyard of broken mirrors angled toward stars is a micro-setting that constrains the protagonist's action: the mirrors show hidden rooms, align into a cathedral of swallowed whispers, and the first star's appearance triggers the path formation. The ribbon and lock of hair function as tactile objects handled across beats (bowed to, laid down, loosened, lifted). Spatial choreography is clear in the courtyard sequence. The "shadowed nexus" and starlight charge the closure image when the sky hums in answer. Slight deduction for the earlier domestic setting being named but not physically grounded—no sense of the original door's room or threshold.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: freeing the idea that voice can transform loss into beginning, currently imprisoned by fear. One meaningful tightening: the courtyard ritual (laying the hair, singing the wavering note) forces the protagonist to act despite terror, narrowing options from silence to song. The locksmith's request to "speak my mother's promise without her words" and "sing anyway" escalates pressure by demanding embodied vulnerability. Visible cost: singing a note that "searched its own hallway" risks exposure ("cracked vessel no one should drink from"), and the ribbon's release forfeits the keepsake's protective function. The resolution is earned by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens: the song itself performs the unlocking. No antagonist, but fear as persistent constraint is legible throughout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: locks as belief structures, hair that "grew without permission" signaling autonomy, silence as contagious language, and the courtyard mirrors showing "rooms where I had hid my wanting." The closing image—sky humming in answer, locksmith carrying away "only what no longer bound"—offers a non-literal answer to whether loss can become beginning. The ribbon's transformation from binding keepsake to "light as first snow" reweights prior material without stating a moral. Slight elevation for the "doors learn from daring" line being embodied in the act of singing rather than declared as thesis. Minor risk: the "fear's wrapping" and "unafraid of doors" language in the penultimate and final beats approach thematic echo, but the image work (sky humming, ribbon tucking) anchors them.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct lyric register ("cosmic possibility like river stones," "wet teeth"). Perceptual signature is consistent—narrator notices metaphorical overlays (door/idea, lock/belief) throughout. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("stodgy sentinel," "housing and open," "unspent room for echoes") that feels imposed rather than voice-emergent, especially under peak pressure in the courtyard. The locksmith's brief dialogue ("doors learn from daring") is thematically on-point but lacks subtext or evasion. Psychic distance is controlled, though the piece leans heavily on poetic compression at the expense of immediate sensory grounding. No head-hopping. Minor penalty for register drift in high-pressure beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Metaphorical density is high and mostly coherent ("fog trapped in a jar," "crescent on my memory," "hush of cosmic possibility like river stones"), but several constructions strain clarity: "unassumingly bold" as oxymoron lacks embodied demonstration, "enveloped secrets" is abstract, "weir of shadows" is imprecise, and "stodgy sentinel" clashes with the lyric register. Paraphrase loops appear: "It stuck behind fear like fog trapped in a jar, pressing outward, filming every surface" re-states the prior sentence's "idea trapped behind fear." Template cadence in the courtyard sequence: multiple sentences open with "The locksmith [verb]" or "He [verb]." Information density is uneven—some lines do multiple jobs ("the ribbon slipped free and fluttered like a moth, the hair lifted"), others are decorative ("violet," "velvet dusk"). No severe artifacts at closure, but cumulative line-level drag. Deductions: paraphrase loop −0.2, template cadence −0.4, mixed-register drift −0.3 = net ~−0.9 from a baseline ~7.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of locksmith-as-therapist metaphor with literal courtyard ritual and the ribbon as both keepsake and binding constraint is specific and purposeful. The courtyard of broken mirrors angled toward stars is a fresh image, and the "silence he laid over the ribbon like gauze" offers a non-obvious unlocking mechanism. Transformation test passes: swapping names or setting would lose the mother's promise, the hair's autonomy memory, and the sky-as-listener motif. Risk: the lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring the central choice to sing. Minor deduction for the locksmith archetype (enigmatic guide) being familiar, though the execution individualizes him through gesture (bowing to ribbon, arranging fingers as tumblers). The "payment was the song continuing" conclusion feels earned rather than generic.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The locksmith drives three beats: arrival and questioning (signals stakes), courtyard guidance and ribbon placement (enables the ritual), and final departure with the ribbon (closes the arc). His choices—asking for the object that most wanted the idea freed, telling the protagonist to wait for the star, whispering that "a lock is made of belief," arranging fingers as tumblers, and taking the ribbon—are causally active. Setup: first third. Development: courtyard sequence (middle). Payoff: final bow and departure. High irreplaceability: his specific methods (no tool, laying silence, aligning tumblers) and the decision to carry away the ribbon charge the closure. Visible cost connection: his labor enables the freeing but he departs without payment beyond the song's continuation. Band signals: early, three beats, causal pressure, closure linkage, specificity. Slight friction: his interiority remains opaque (observation without internal decision costs him one notch toward 8+).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lock of hair tied with ribbon appears in five beats: brought as the object (setup), bowed to by the locksmith, placed at the path's start, held while remembering its growth, and slipping free to flutter as the idea is freed. It evolves from binding keepsake to active participant in the unlocking. Setup: first third. Development: courtyard handling (middle). Payoff: ribbon slips and lightens, locksmith tucks it away. Causal pressure: the protagonist's memory of hair growing without permission loosens "the history that had cinched it," enabling the closure. Specificity: the ribbon's dual role as memorial and constraint is irreplaceable. Cost: forfeiting the keepsake's protective function is the price of freeing the idea. Band signals: early, five beats, causal, closure-active, irreplaceable, cost-tied. High integration; only minor distance from 9+ due to one beat (the bowing) being more ceremonial than causally transformative.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Enveloped secrets shapes stakes and tactics: the idea is "trapped behind fear itself," "like fog trapped in a jar," and the locksmith treats the ribbon as "a witness burdened by enveloped secrets." The courtyard ritual tests whether belief-locks can be opened, and the final line references "fear's wrapping." Setup: first paragraph. Development: courtyard dialogue ("what idea wanted freeing") and the mirrors showing hidden rooms. Payoff: "the work was not to make truth appear, but to free it from fear's wrapping." The concept is causally active—fear as wrapper/envelope prevents singing until the ritual disorients "the habit that guarded me." Slight swappability: "trapped" or "hidden" could replace "enveloped" with minor tonal shift. Band signals: early, two beats, causal, closure-present, modest irreplaceability. Mid-band for solid functional integration without high specificity.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Unassumingly bold" is attributed to the locksmith in the second sentence but remains label-only. No on-page action demonstrates the tension between modesty and audacity—he arrives "small" with "glinting picks" but his subsequent choices (bowing, whispering, arranging fingers) read as ceremonial confidence without visible cost or constraint from this trait. The oxymoron is mentioned but not embodied. Setup: early. Development: absent—no middle beat where unassuming manner limits him or boldness costs him. Payoff: the final departure is humble (laughs softly, gathers ribbon), but the boldness component is not legible. Swappability: "enigmatic" or "confident" could replace with no structural loss. Band signals: early only; one ornamental use; no causal pressure or closure tie. Late-friction: label without tradeoff −0.5. Cap 4.6 (missing development gate) applied.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Disorient" appears in three contexts: the locksmith's gaze "weighed what speech would only disorient," the protagonist's fear "disorient[s] the habit that guarded me," and the courtyard scene where the mirrors bend perception. Setup: early (locksmith's gaze). Development: mid-story, the courtyard's disorientation "enough to disorient the habit." Payoff: not explicitly present in the final image, though the ribbon's release follows the disorientation. Causal role: the courtyard's perceptual shift enables the unlocking by breaking the fear-habit. Swappability: "unsettle" or "confuse" could replace with minor tonal shift. The action shapes one key turn (mirrors showing hidden rooms) but does not reappear at closure. Band signals: early, two beats, one causal turn, modest irreplaceability. Friction: absent from closure image −0.3. Mid-band for functional but not indispensable role.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The hint given by the first star is signaled ("wait for a hint given by first star seen at twilight"), its mechanics are shown (first star pricks the dusk, mirrors angle, path forms), and it enables the ritual. Setup: courtyard arrival (past first third but pre-midpoint). Development: the star's appearance triggers the path, allowing the locksmith to place the hair. Payoff: the protagonist sings under the now-present stars, and "the sky hummed in answer." Causal pressure: without the star-cue, the path does not form. Specificity: twilight timing and star as agent are irreplaceable to the ritual's logic. Slight friction: the method is more magical constraint than protagonist-driven tactic. Band signals: signaled early in courtyard, one beat, causal enabler, closure-adjacent (sky hums), high specificity. Caps: introduced after first third (late-setup penalty −0.3). Score trends toward 7+ for strong causal and closure work despite later introduction.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The shadowed nexus under starlight is where "the idea would have room to turn without shattering the house" and supplies the courtyard of broken mirrors. Setup: locksmith names it in first third. Development: the courtyard's spatial properties (mirrors angled toward stars, path formed from shards) pressure the protagonist's choices—she must wait, speak without words, sing. Payoff: the courtyard "filled with my mother walking back toward me" and the sky hums in answer. Causal pressure: the setting's mechanics (mirrors showing hidden rooms, aligning into cathedral) enable the unlocking. Irreplaceability: the nexus under starlight is essential to the ritual's logic. Cost: the protagonist must leave her familiar space and perform vulnerability in this exposed setting. Band signals: early, two beats, causal, closure-shaping, irreplaceable, cost-tied. High integration; one notch below 8.5+ because the setting's pressure is more atmospheric enabler than active constraint on tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Across the hush of cosmic possibility" appears once as poetic description of the walk to the courtyard. It does not function as a timeframe that tightens decisions—no clock, deadline, or temporal progression pressures the protagonist's choice to sing. The phrase is more tonal/atmospheric than structural. Setup: mid-story (walk). Development: absent—time does not constrain middle choices. Payoff: absent—the closure does not reference time or hurry. Swappability: "at twilight" or "under starlight" could replace without loss. Band signals: one mention, ornamental, no causal role. Frictions: late appearance, no development, no payoff, high swappability. Caps: missing all three gates, cap 2.8 + ornamental label +0.3 for tonal coherence = ~3.1, but "cosmic possibility" adds slight thematic resonance +0.5 = 4.1 final, recognizing it as atmospheric rather than structural timeframe.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>To free an idea trapped behind fear is the protagonist's explicit motivation, voiced early ("the idea that I could sing the loss into a beginning") and tested in the courtyard when she must sing despite terror. Setup: first third. Development: courtyard dialogue ("what idea wanted freeing tonight") and the locksmith's challenge to "sing anyway" force the protagonist to choose voice over silence. Payoff: singing the wavering note, the ribbon slipping, and the idea of return being freed enact the motivation. Causal pressure: the fear-versus-song friction drives every beat from the locksmith's questions to the final hum. Visible cost: risking the "cracked vessel" self-concept and surrendering the protective keepsake. Irreplaceability: this exact desire (idea freed, not thing retrieved) is essential. Band signals: early, three beats, high causal pressure, closure-driving, irreplaceable, cost-legible. One notch below 8.5+ because the motivation is stated rather than fully discovered through contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Improbable longing is established in "my mother... smiled with improbable longing" and sustained through the protagonist's yearning for voice and return. The tone modulates: wistful restraint (early), disoriented vulnerability (courtyard), and tentative hope (singing, sky humming). Setup: first third. Development: the courtyard's tone shifts from ceremonial to tremulous as the protagonist sings "a note that wavered, searching its own hallway." Payoff: the final image—sky humming, ribbon light as snow, locksmith departing—carries bittersweet longing without resolution (mother does not return bodily). Coherence: the tone never collapses into triumph or despair; longing persists as "improbable" even when the idea is freed. Charges the closure: the sky's hum answers longing without fulfilling it. Band signals: early, modulates across beats, charges ending, coherent. Slight friction: "improbable" is more label than embodied tension in some beats, preventing full 8+.</comment>
