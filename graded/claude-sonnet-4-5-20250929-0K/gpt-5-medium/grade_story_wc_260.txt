<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The handler's interiority is textured and embodied—"I warmed the forceps, spoke to the chameleon, and drew a shallow breath" shows micro-choices under pressure. Internal contradiction surfaces in "I wanted credulity" vs. the decision to strip vanity: desire for trust wrestles with self-reproach. The final move—placing tail tip beside brochure—is earned by prior reflection on "beliefs can blacken," foreclosing naive hope with visible cost. Minor deduction: the broker con is told rather than dramatized, reducing friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors POV, workshop, and post-con timeframe by line 5. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the handler commits to plain testimony over grand redemption, places relics side-by-side, and accepts scrutiny—"you will decide how much to believe"—foreclosing performative rescue with felt cost. One meaningful deepening occurs when the tail removal parallels shedding ornament. Deduction: the con backstory is summarized in four lines mid-story, flattening causal linkage; the broker vanishes off-page, reducing immediacy.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The misty workshop under stars recurs in opening, mid-turn ("panels darkened and then clarified"), and closure ("stillness shimmer"), charging the final image. Micro-setting elements—forceps, terrarium, atomizer, tray—constrain on-page action: warming forceps, removing plastic waterfall, and stitching all pressure choices. The chameleon's relearning balance mirrors the handler's, making body-as-setting functional. Sensory selection remains purposeful: mist as counsel, lantern painting bottles "from the inside," stars "trembling" while enduring.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: rebuild trust after the con, signaled early ("accounts were hollow"). One meaningful tightening: the tail removal mirrors the thematic choice to strip vanity, narrowing options to transparency. Agency is clear—handler writes the donor letter, names profiteers, invites scrutiny—foreclosing performative redemption with on-page cost ("you will decide"). The chameleon's question-mark tail externalizes the handler's uncertainty. Minor deduction: the broker's betrayal is told in summary, reducing the on-page pressure that forces the final stance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme—trust rebuilt by shedding ornament—emerges from concrete action: removing fake waterfall, placing tail tip beside brochure, writing the plain letter. The final image offers a non-literal answer: "certainty is a predator, doubt a steward" reweights prior conviction without stating a moral. The chameleon's "solemn indifference" judges by steadiness, not motive, charging the ending. No intrusive thesis statements. One brief moment nears thematic echo—"Convictions must bend or they break"—but it's keeper-attributed and quickly embodied in the bench work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is steady: "lantern, every bottle became quietly vivid, as if painted from the inside" filters world through caretaker's attention. Diction remains voice-consistent—"hope is hungry," "nocturnes"—without register drift. Distance is stable first-person; no head-hopping. Rhythm modulates under pressure: short declaratives at the cut ("I did not invite rage; I invited precision"), longer breaths in reflection. One minor slip: "We will take only what refuses to heal" anthropomorphizes the tail slightly, though it reads as voiced comfort to the animal.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high: most lines do double duty (e.g., "He sold us confidence, and I bought it because I wanted cruelty to end" advances backstory and motive). Rhythm varies—short declaratives at peak beats, longer cadences in reflection—without template runs. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks. One deduction: "I counted tinctures, counted sutures, counted the apologies" is purposeful parallelism but nears synonym churn. Minor scaffold: "Sometimes it feels alive, sometimes merely patient" adds texture without advancing pressure. Figurative language ("mist rose like counsel") remains coherent and sparse.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The wildlife-handler frame transforms the con-artist aftermath premise through lived occupational detail: warming forceps, stitching lightly, relearning balance. The tail-as-dead-belief parallel is specific and non-obvious, arising organically from the task. Placing tail tip beside brochure as "two small relics of belief" feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk: the lyric tempo could alienate readers expecting plot velocity, but the piece commits fully and the closure lands. No close echoes of famous lines; "doubt a steward" reads fresh.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Handler's choices create key turns: removing fake waterfall, cutting the tail tip, writing the donor letter, and placing relics side-by-side. Present in setup (line 4), middle (tail removal), and closure (shelf arrangement). Two distinct beats (removal, letter-writing) plus closure participation. Causal pressure: the decision to "shed layers" alters tactics from performative rescue to transparency. Specificity: wildlife training shapes micro-moves (warming forceps, murmuring to the animal). Visible cost: reputation and donor trust hinge on the plain testimony.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Tail tip appears in setup (line 2, unwrapped from gauze), middle (removal with forceps, held in tray), and closure (placed beside brochure as relic). Three distinct beats. Causal: its "refusal to heal" motivates the cut and mirrors dead belief. Closure linkage strong: the shelf arrangement reweights it as a lesson in doubt. Specificity: "pale as dust," "like a tiny omened seed," and "question he feared answering" make it irreplaceable. Cost tied to it: the handler names the shared vulnerability ("beliefs can blacken").</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Fragile convictions shape stakes early ("I bought it because I wanted cruelty to end") and constrain the middle choice: the handler refuses vanity-driven rescue and commits to transparency. Present in setup (line 11), developed in removal beat ("Convictions must bend"), and paid off at closure (placing tail and brochure as relics that "refused to heal"). Two beats plus closure. Causal pressure: the concept narrows tactics from grand bargains to "small nocturnes." Modest deduction: the phrase "fragile convictions" itself never appears; "conviction" does twice, but integration relies on synonyms (beliefs, certainty, doubt).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Quietly vivid" appears twice: line 8 ("every bottle became quietly vivid") and line 32 ("broker's speeches had been quietly vivid too"). Setup present, reprise at closure section. The contrast—honest workshop light vs. deceptive speeches—reweights the phrase with irony. One beat (bottles under lantern) demonstrates it; the second is summary comparison. Causal role modest: the workshop atmosphere supports the stance but does not force a choice. Swappability moderate: "vivid" could be "striking" without major loss, though "quietly" adds the handler's restraint filter.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Reconstruct" anchors two major turns: removing ornament from the terrarium (line 18–20) and writing the donor letter to rebuild trust (line 46–51). Setup present (line 17: "to reconstruct a small ecology, and maybe myself"), middle development strong (terrarium work), closure linked (letter as reconstruction tool). Causal: the method of stripping false additions drives both the physical and social repairs. Specificity: the ecology work is literal, the trust work metaphorical, creating resonance. Minor swappability: "rebuild" could substitute with small edits, though "reconstruct" carries architectural precision.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Method signaled early (line 18: "by shedding layers until only the honest shape remained") and demonstrated twice: removing terrarium ornaments (plastic waterfall, fake blossoms, branded thermometer) and writing a plain letter that names profiteers without ornamentation. Setup clear, two distinct beats, closure participation (final image of stripped-down workshop and the shelf's honest relics). Causal: the method constrains both ecology and trust repair, narrowing options to transparency. Specificity high: the mechanics of removal are concrete. Cost tied to method: the handler risks donor rejection by refusing performative flourishes.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Workshop under stars present in setup (line 1), middle (line 22: "panels darkened and then clarified"), and closure (line 64: "stars tired of listening"). The mist and lantern enable the night work; the setting's privacy allows the plain reckoning without performance. Two beats plus closure reprise. Causal role: the nocturnal isolation shapes the decision to write a transparent letter rather than manage daytime donor calls. Micro-setting elements (forceps, terrarium, atomizer) constrain choices. Minor deduction: the stars function mostly as atmospheric anchor rather than direct pressure on tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Timeframe "after the con is revealed" is signaled early (line 5) and structures the pressure: "Phones had rung all day" and "invoices glared" establish urgency. The night setting allows reflective work, but no live ticking clock tightens decisions within the scene. One beat (donor calls) references it; the workshop session itself is untimed. The handler's decision to write the letter stems from post-con fallout, so the frame enables the stake. Modest causal role: the aftermath mood motivates transparency but does not escalate pressure within the window. Swappability moderate: "after scandal" would function similarly.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation stated explicitly (line 54: "to balance self-respect and compassion") and dramatized in two choices: tail removal with care ("We will take only what refuses to heal") and donor letter that names harm without rage. Setup present (line 11: belief in ending cruelty), middle friction (self-reproach vs. kindness), closure crystallization (shelf relics and plain testimony). Two beats plus closure. Causal: the balance narrows options, rejecting both punitive anger and self-serving hedging. Visible cost: the handler accepts scrutiny ("you will decide") and relinquishes control. Minor deduction: the phrasing "balance self-respect and compassion" reads slightly thesis-like, though it follows embodied action.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Tone present in opening ("mist lay thin as breath," "stars listened") and sustained through calm declaratives, lyric compression, and measured cadence. Modulates subtly: tighter syntax at the tail cut ("I did not invite rage; I invited precision"), returns to stillness at closure ("let the stillness shimmer"). Coherent across turns without flattening into static mood. Charges final image: the workshop's patience becomes the handler's stance. The tone enables the Accumulative lens and supports the Earned Stasis closure. Specificity: "shimmering stillness" is echoed in "stillness shimmer," creating a frame that reweights the opening with closure cost.</comment>
