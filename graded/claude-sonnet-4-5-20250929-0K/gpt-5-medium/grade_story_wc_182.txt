<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The arcane linguist has a clear motivation and specific skills (reading catalog holes, warming diary pages), but interiority remains largely label-based ("carefully resourceful," "rescue missions") rather than embodied contradiction. The emotional progression feels smoothed: no genuine struggle between impulse and restraint appears on the page. The rescue of the apprentice happens through metaphor ("conjugations like ladders") without dramatized cost or visible failure along the way. The final stance ("we continue the rescue missions, but for ourselves") arrives as assertion rather than earned through contradictory choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within opening lines; the pattern of gap-reading and diary-navigation is taught early and recurs. The piece delivers one meaningful tightening when the apprentice is found and the library opens, providing Resonant Reconfiguration (the relief of being allowed to err). However, cost remains oblique: no concrete forfeiture or foreclosed path is legible on the page at closure—"gentler futures from the overlooked" reads as conceptual comfort rather than felt price. The mosaic structure (travel through caverns, lamplighter encounter, apprentice rescue, summit arrival) holds coherent pressure but the final image diffuses stakes rather than crystallizing them with undeniable cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The labyrinthine bookstore is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (peppermint bark, distant thunder, dust and unread melodies) and spatial choreography tracks cleanly across moves. The botanical diary functions as micro-setting, constraining navigation choices and charging the closure when leaves unpress and sprout questions. Environment shapes tactics (following missing atlases, warming pages, reading gaps) and supplies the final image's setting (lectern of petrified moss). The mountain's temperamental rearrangement applies situational pressure throughout, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that setting constrain choice and charge the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>One dominant stake is signaled early (find the library of unlearned lessons) and pressure coheres through gap-reading, diary-following, and the apprentice rescue. The piece delivers one meaningful deepening when the library opens and questions are allowed without exile. However, escalation feels more atmospheric than driven by protagonist agency: the bookstore rearranges itself, the traveler reappears with instructions, and the resolution hinges on collective whispering rather than a choice that forecloses a live option. The cost of "being allowed to err" remains conceptual; no visible price (time, stamina, tool, social credit) alters tactics or charges the final image with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme (the value of unlearned lessons, failure pronounced kindly, rescue as self-recovery) emerges organically from gap-reading, the apprentice caught in footnotes, and seeds sprouting might-have-beens. The final image (sprouting questions, gentler futures) offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. However, the resolution leans toward conceptual comfort rather than ambiguity with cost: "allowed to err without exile" and "consequences we had misnamed as fate" read as thematic summaries that assert relief rather than dramatizing the price of that permission. The botanical diary's transformation is purposeful but the ending's emotional charge feels more declared than earned through contradictory particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyric, and consistent: "sleeping organ," "conjugations like ladders," "proverb" as simile for thinness. POV distance remains stable throughout with no head-hopping. Diction stays within the linguist's register (arcane, phonemes, indexes) and figurative language coheres around textual/botanical metaphors. However, peak moments rely on elevated abstraction ("music too careful to disturb dust," "stepped into the hush") rather than embodied perception under stress. Dialogue with the lamplitter ("vowels for candle oil") and traveler feels stylized rather than goal-driven or subtextual. The perceptual signature is consistent but lacks the rhythmic compression or modulation that would distinguish calm observation from crisis.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout with most sentences carrying metaphor ("dust and unread melodies," "ink hardens," "air thinned and spines grew blank"), creating a sustained lyric texture but also slowing propulsion in peak beats. Paraphrase loops appear: "rescue missions" is restated three times across paragraphs without added pressure; "gaps" and "absences" cycle through adjacent lines. Template cadence emerges in the middle third with repeated "I [verb]" stems across four consecutive sentences. The overwriting reduces clarity at the apprentice-rescue beat, where "conjugations like ladders" and "tenses as handholds" stack without concrete action. No severe artifact touches the closure directly, but cumulative density and loops flatten momentum, triggering −0.8 in Q7 for non-closure accumulation and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact cap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of bookstore-as-mountain, linguistic rescue work, and botanical navigation is specific and purposeful, avoiding template plot. The conceit of "library of unlearned lessons" and "gaps leaving sharper contours" offers a fresh angle on archival fantasy. However, the emotional arc (solitary scholar finds community and permission to fail) and the resolution (sprouting questions, gentler futures) follow familiar paths within the subgenre. The piece commits fully to its lyric premise but does not take structural or perspectival risks that heighten stakes beyond atmospheric accumulation. Transformation is present but moderate; swapping the bookstore for another metaphorical archive would leave the core emotional movement largely intact.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The arcane linguist is present throughout and makes gap-reading decisions, warms diary pages, and speaks final lines. However, key turns (apprentice rescue, library opening) rely more on the diary's guidance and the traveler's instruction than the linguist's agency. The trait "arcane linguist" functions as role label rather than constraint; no on-page moment shows a linguistic skill enabling or foreclosing a path with visible cost. Present in closure but not causally decisive there.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The botanical diary is handled in multiple beats: scavenged from traveler, leaves warmed to reveal script, guides navigation toward missing atlases and the apprentice, and placed on lectern at closure where leaves unpress and sprout. It constrains middle choices (following fern annotations, identifying passages by air-taste) and charges the final image (seeds sprouting questions). Early signal, multi-beat involvement, closure linkage present. Cost is oblique (the diary's transformation rather than its loss), preventing higher score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Rescue missions are mentioned early and frame motivation, appear in the lamplighter bargain (rescuing the apprentice), and return in the final line ("we continue the rescue missions, but for ourselves"). However, the concept shapes theme more than tactics: no on-page choice shows a tradeoff between rescuing and another goal. The apprentice rescue itself is resolved through metaphor without visible struggle or cost. Present in closure but as thematic echo rather than causal driver.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Carefully resourceful" is labeled early ("a polite phrase for breaking rules no one quite wrote") but does not constrain an on-page action with visible cost. The protagonist's resourcefulness (warming pages, reading gaps) is demonstrated but "careful" never creates friction or limits a choice. The attribute is present but functions as character description rather than a trait that enables or forecloses a path under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Renegotiate" appears twice: renegotiating with the geometry to find the apprentice, and the bookstore "renegotiating a duet." The action drives the apprentice-rescue beat (studying gaps, convincing the place to remember) and shapes the library-opening beat (whispering mistakes together). Early signal, multi-beat involvement, and presence at closure elevate the score. However, the mechanics remain abstract ("offering tenses as handholds") without concrete cost or visible failure, limiting irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Researching gaps" is signaled early, demonstrated repeatedly (reading catalog holes, following missing atlases, noticing skipped entries), and drives the apprentice-rescue turn. The method shapes middle attempts and appears conceptually at closure (sprouting questions from overlooked seeds). Early setup, multi-beat use, and closure participation meet the three-gate test. However, the method could be replaced with "following patterns" or "reading signs" without structural loss, capping the score below high bands.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The labyrinthine bookstore occupying an entire mountain provides spatial pressure throughout: aisles breathing, floors spiraling, bridges connecting eras, temperamental rearrangement. It constrains navigation choices, supplies the apprentice's location (footnote between indexes), and forms the final image's space (plateau, lectern, sprouting aisles). Early signal, multi-beat involvement, closure participation, and specificity (peppermint bark staircase, blank spines at summit) are all present. Cost tied to the setting is oblique (effort rather than foreclosed path), preventing 8.5+.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"After the time traveler arrives" frames the opening and the traveler reappears at the summit "older by an hour, younger by a century." However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create urgency: no clock tracks elapsed time and no choice is narrowed by temporal pressure. The traveler's departure and return bookend the piece but function as atmospheric markers rather than causal constraint. Present but not pressure-driving.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The motivation to find the library of unlearned lessons is stated early, drives the upward journey, and is achieved at closure when the library opens. However, the desire is told more than dramatized: no on-page moment shows friction between this goal and another want or cost. The lamplighter asks why the protagonist chases the library, and the answer ("because we forget everything else too quickly") is assertion rather than embodied conflict. The motivation shapes the arc but lacks visible internal friction or trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Unheard symphony" appears early (dust and unread melodies, music too careful to disturb dust) and resolves at closure ("the unheard symphony resolved... into recognition" and the bookstore hums a chord). Tone is lyric, atmospheric, and coherent throughout with no jarring shifts. The final image charges the motif by making the silent symphony audible without sound. Early seed, closure reprise, and tonal consistency are present, meeting lyric-resonance allowance. However, the tone does not modulate with pressure (remains uniformly elevated) and the reprise reweights meaning conceptually rather than altering a choice, preventing higher score.</comment>
