<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The sentinel POV is established with embodied detail (letter edge "fragile as moth wings," air tasting "of apple skins"), and the traveler's conflict between rivers and rows is concrete. However, the sentinel's passive role—listening, offering metaphors—limits active internal contradiction. The traveler's final kneeling act earns a micro-choice, but the sentinel's motivation remains more facilitator than participant with visible cost. Interiority leans toward poetic observation rather than embodied struggle under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: repeated vineyard/love-letter imagery builds toward the traveler writing a new map-letter that binds scar to future. Orientation anchors (station, pavilion, autumn) arrive early. The closure—kneeling to carve truth and bind what survives—reconfigures the dominant stake (can she honor both rivers and rows?) with felt cost (the burned edge sealed into the map). One deduction: the sentinel's role in the closure is observation rather than decision, softening the cost's immediacy.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Pavilion, vines, lantern, and gravel road are established early and sensory details (amber glow, creaking trellis, moths at glass) are filtered through the sentinel's occupational focus. The pavilion bench becomes the site of the traveler's map-rewrite, a micro-setting that constrains the final choice. Pruning knife and twine function as tools that enable the closure act. Minor slip: some metaphoric flourishes ("leaf glow," "halos") drift toward decorative rather than pressure-driven.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether the traveler can reconcile rivers and rows—is signaled when she shows the map. Pressure tightens when the sentinel reveals the burned letter edge, and the traveler admits she saved only the edge because "the middle was a promise she cannot keep." The kneeling act (writing a new letter, binding the scar) narrows options with visible cost: she must tell him she loves rivers more, without apology. One meaningful deepening suffices for this length, though the sentinel's agency is minimal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme (the cost of reconciling mismatched loves) emerges through the graft metaphor ("cambium cannot greet its neighbor") and the burned letter's return as scar-within-map. The final image—"rivers kiss the rows"—answers the central question without moralizing. Minor deduction: "to nurture intersubjective understanding" appears in the penultimate paragraph as a near-thesis statement, edging toward thematic echo. The particulars (pruning knife, twine, map) anchor the abstraction enough to avoid heavy penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single POV remains stable; the sentinel's perceptual signature (vineyard idiom, similes rooted in cultivation) is consistent. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven ("Do you love him… without apology"). The traveler's voice ("I am a cartographer who trusts rivers more than rows") carries distinct idiom. Minor deduction: some narration edges toward elevated register ("passionate subtlety," "verdicts loosen") that, while voice-motivated, occasionally drifts from the sentinel's established vernacular under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high (letter edge, map, graft metaphor interwoven). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. However, figurative density is relentless—nearly every sentence carries a simile or metaphor ("wine cellar holding its breath," "courage from gravel," "net catching air")—without pattern-teaching or payoff. In peak beats (revealing the letter, the traveler kneeling), the figurative load dilutes immediacy rather than sharpening it. Apply −0.5 for density without escalation, −0.2 for register drift in final third ("verdicts loosen").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The vineyard-sentinel frame and the counselor-via-graft-metaphor are specific and non-obvious. The burned letter edge as physical scar folded into a new map offers fresh synthesis. Risk: the piece commits fully to lyric accumulation and metaphoric argument. Deduction: the traveler-seeks-vineyard-wisdom setup echoes a familiar template (seeker meets sage); transformation comes through the specificity of the graft metaphor and the kneeling act, but the frame itself is recognizable. Derivative Premise Guardrail: −0.4 for template proximity, mitigated by metaphoric specificity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Present throughout; offers pruning knife and twine, speaks the graft metaphor, asks the pivotal question ("Do you love him… without apology"). However, the sentinel's choices are facilitating rather than forecloses-a-path-for-self; the traveler's decision is the closure unit. The sentinel shapes two beats (revealing the letter, offering tools) and frames the ending ("we keep this place"), but lacks visible cost. Two gates (setup, payoff) plus beat involvement, minus lack of personal cost: 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Introduced early (found "yesterday beneath the waiting bench"), handled in two beats (revealed to traveler, sealed into map), and returns with reweighted meaning at closure (scar folded into future). The letter edge enables the pivotal question and the final binding act. Causal pressure: revealing it precipitates the traveler's admission. Closure linkage: sealed into the map as a memento of cost. All three gates, two beats, closure linkage: 7.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Named on the map margin ("destined mismatches in careful resignation"), voiced by the traveler ("he wants vineyards… I trust rivers"), and addressed in the graft metaphor ("mismatches are not doomed… but demand new rituals"). Shapes the dominant stake and the final letter's content ("meet him only where rivers kiss the rows"). Three gates, beat involvement, causal pressure. Minor deduction: the phrase "destined mismatches" arrives as on-page text rather than fully dramatized friction, edging toward label-only in its first mention. 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Gently persuasive" appears twice as label ("a gently persuasive murmur," "gently persuasive with nobody until somebody wanders near") but is dramatized in the sentinel's soft question ("Do you love him… without apology") and the metaphoric counsel that "slip[s] past her guard without snapping twigs." The trait enables the traveler's openness but does not constrain the sentinel with visible cost. One beat (pivotal question), setup + payoff gates, label-heavy: 5.2.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Rediscover" is the traveler's stated need ("help her rediscover the point of arrival she keeps missing") and the closure act (writing a new letter that redefines meeting-place). The action shapes the dominant stake and the final image. However, it is stated early and enacted late; middle beats focus on diagnosis (graft metaphor) rather than rediscovery attempts. Setup + payoff gates, closure linkage, but minimal middle pressure: 6.1.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Signaled early ("I begin by drawing parallels between rootstock and heartstock"), mechanics matter (cambium greeting, timing bruises, furrows to cross), and the method shapes the traveler's final letter ("where rivers kiss the rows" is a parallel synthesis). The graft metaphor is the armature of the middle beats and charges the closure. Three gates, causal pressure, closure linkage: 7.6.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Introduced in the opening ("amber pavilion in autumn"), vines and trellis anchor sensory detail, and the pavilion bench becomes the site of the map-rewrite. Lantern and moths supply atmosphere; glass and bench constrain the kneeling act. The setting does not impose a urgent physical constraint but provides micro-setting resources (bench, knife, twine) that alter tactics. Three gates, beat involvement, closure linkage, minor physical pressure: 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Named in the opening ("After the final bus departs a vacant station") and reprised in the penultimate paragraph ("after the final bus departs a vacant station again"). Establishes solitude and off-season quiet but does not tighten decisions or track elapsed time during the encounter. Setup + payoff gates via lyric reprise, but no middle pressure or live clock: 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Stated explicitly in the penultimate paragraph ("We keep this place for those who seek to nurture intersubjective understanding") and dramatized in the sentinel's listening and the traveler's willingness to articulate her conflict. However, the motivation is more thematic claim than friction-laden desire; the sentinel pays no visible cost for this nurturing. Setup (implied early via "listen until words sort themselves"), payoff (explicit), one beat (pivotal question), but label-heavy and minimal cost: 5.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Passionate subtlety" is named on-page ("I speak with passionate subtlety") and enacted in the soft pivotal question and the metaphoric indirection that "slip[s] past her guard." Tone modulates from quiet observation to the charged kneeling beat, and the final image ("verdicts loosen") maintains restraint. However, the self-narration of tone is a meta intrusion. Setup + development + payoff gates, coherent modulation, minor self-referential slip: 6.2.</comment>
