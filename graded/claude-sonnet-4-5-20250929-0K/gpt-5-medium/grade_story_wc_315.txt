<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is specific and embodied—knees echoing vortex shape, testing buckles through gloves, tapping codes into rails. Internal conflict is live: the burden of trust versus self-doubt after a prior failure, crystallized in "asking whether I have seen enough to trust my own invention." The prior glider accident and the scar that neither crosses give genuine stakes to the relationship with the pilot. Micro-choices—setting lanterns to green-blue, tapping the revised message, leaning with the ship—reveal values under pressure, though the final nod feels slightly under-dramatized given the weight carried.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): "The weight on my ribs loosens, not fully gone, but carried better, a harness adjusted rather than a dismissal." Cost is felt—the mutual debt remains, poise earned through revised approach and shared code. Orientation anchors quickly (arbor platforms, cloud seam, watcher role). The escalation moves from static check to cloud vortex warning to the ship's shudder and safe docking, reweighting the watcher's self-trust and the pilot's returned reliance. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length, and the final image charges prior material (parachute buckle, tapping, the scar).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The nocturnal arbor above clouds is vivid and particular: braided-light stitching, rope veins, lanterns kept low "to keep the stars from feeling shy," platforms swaying like a breathing cathedral. The parachute buckle, guide ring, and rope constrain the watcher's physical choices. The vortex's heat-lens behavior and the colder ribbon route directly shape the revised approach. Spatial choreography is clear (rail, cradle, starboard wing). The micro-setting (buckle, lanterns, tapping rail) charges the final image when the ship kisses the cradle and the pilot climbs out.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: preserve trust by guiding the pilot safely after a prior failure. Pressure coheres and tightens—radio static clears, clouds squeeze into a vortex, the watcher revises the approach, the wing shudders, then lands. Agency is decision and endurance: the watcher reads the seam, taps the code, sets lanterns to green-blue, and leans with the rope to shape calmer air. The cost is legible: "we are not done paying," and the harness adjusted rather than dismissed. One meaningful tightening (the vortex complication and revised route) suffices, and the protagonist's attentive invention drives the resolution under accumulative/situational pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—trust, burden, and earned interdependence—emerges from particulars: the scar neither crosses, the ritual breath, the parachute buckle as metallic vow, muscle memory as handshake with task. The watcher's burden recurs with variation, deepening from "notice before anyone else can fear" to "spare words until landing" to the final adjustment of weight. The ending resists moralizing: the small nod and loosened ribs answer the thematic question without stating it. Subtext operates in gesture (the pilot meeting eyes "without being asked") and the ambiguity of ongoing debt. No thematic echo or diagnostic label-speak in the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person, distance controlled, perceptual signature consistent: listening "not with ears but with the careful patience of an instrument," feeling clouds whirlpool "like a lens focusing heat." Diction is lyric and compression purposeful ("trees that outgrew the ground and decided to keep going until pressure forgot them"). Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven: the pilot requests "my eyes without the pride he once wore," and the watcher gives tactical instruction without apology. Under peak stress (ship shudder), syntax tightens appropriately. No head-hopping, filter verbs are sparse and voice-motivated, and the metaphoric density is high but mostly legible—though occasional phrases ("soundless echo," "arbor creaks in long vowels") verge on ornamental without clear payoff.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high in many beats ("parachute buckle rings against the rail, not pretty but certain, a small metallic vow keeping its part of the ritual"). However, figurative language appears in most sentences without consistent pattern-teaching, creating density drag: "rope veins," "braided light," "stitched moth," "breathing cathedral," "lens focusing heat," "roots entering frost," "soap bubbles," "pondwater," "tired hand." Mixed metaphors appear ("clouds whirlpool strangely, like a lens focusing heat rather than light" conflates fluid and optical vehicles). Template cadence runs: "I [verb], and [noun] [verb]" recurs across multiple paragraphs. These artifacts pervade the middle third and touch the closure beat ("weight on my ribs loosens… a harness adjusted"), triggering the artifact penalty and disallowing 9+ globally per the Q7 rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The nocturnal sky-arbor and cloud-seam navigation offer a fresh frame, and the watcher's attentive invention is specific to this premise. The emotional arc—rebuilding trust through revised route and shared code—avoids generic beats. However, the mentor-burden and prior-failure-redeemed structure is familiar, and the story does not transform it beyond competent execution. The parachute buckle and muscle-memory motif are purposeful but not wholly original. Transformation test: swap sky-arbor for ground tower and the arc remains largely intact. One fresh inflection: the tactile, non-verbal crew coordination ("tapping the rail in a code the crew has learned by feel") and the metaphor of "remembering through muscle memory is not memory at all, but a handshake between the body and a task" elevate within the band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The "midnight pattern seeker" is signaled in paragraph three and drives key turns: reading the cloud seam, revising the approach, tapping the code, leaning with the rope. The trait constrains choices (double-checking, pausing to listen) and the final choice (guiding the pilot with revised route) is causally earned. Present in setup, middle beats (tapping, scanning vortex), and closure (meeting eyes, small nod). Cost is visible: the ongoing mutual debt.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The parachute buckle appears in multiple beats: testing with thumb through glove (paragraph eight), clipping into guide ring and feeding rope (paragraph twenty-two), ringing against the rail during ship shudder (paragraph thirty). Its function—to take shock and release in a curve—constrains the watcher's physical setup and is causally active when the wing buckles. Returns with reweighted meaning in the closure beat as "a small metallic vow keeping its part of the ritual." Early signal, beat involvement, causal pressure, and closure linkage all present.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"The watcher's burden" is introduced early (paragraph five) and shapes stakes and tactics throughout: "to notice before anyone else can fear," "to preserve trust under pressure," "to spare words until landing." It drives the protagonist's double-checking, the decision to revise the approach, and the choice to withhold apology. The concept recurs with variation and charges the final image: "carried better, a harness adjusted rather than a dismissal." Not merely thematic echo; it changes on-page options and is indispensable to the closure effect.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Attentively inventive" is labeled in paragraph ten ("I have always been attentively inventive, finding where patterns kink") and demonstrated in the revision of the approach: setting lanterns to green-blue, tapping the revised message, reading the heat-lens vortex, directing the pilot to the colder ribbon. The trait enables the key turn with visible cost (the risk of asking the pilot to trust again). Present in setup (implicit in double-checking), middle (revision beats), and closure (the nod that says "we are not done paying"). However, the label-only mention in paragraph ten is ornamental; the trait is better shown than named, capping the score slightly.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Revise" drives the major turn: the watcher reads the squeezed seam, revises the approach by setting lanterns to green-blue and tapping the new code, and tells the pilot to tilt early and ride the colder ribbon (paragraph twenty-seven). The ship responds, shudders, then lands safely. This action is irreplaceable—swapping "revise" for "guide" or "signal" would require structural edits. Present in setup (past revision of routes when ground pretended to be sky), middle (the revision beat), and closure (the safe landing earned by the revision). High causal pressure, beat involvement, and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Remembering through muscle memory" is signaled in paragraph nine ("Remembering through muscle memory is not memory at all, but a handshake between the body and a task waiting in the dark") and recurs in paragraph fifteen ("remembering through muscle memory means nothing gets lost to panic") and paragraph thirty ("When the ship leans, I lean, and the rope answers, remembering through muscle memory to give half an arm's length"). The method shapes the crew's coordination (tapping codes learned by feel) and the watcher's physical alignment with the ship. Present across three distinct beats and charges the closure by enabling the safe landing. However, the method is somewhat replaceable with "trained reflex" or "practiced routine," capping the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The "nocturnal arbor above the clouds" is vividly rendered in the opening and supplies resources that affect outcome: the highest cradle where the supply wing will dock, the rail for tapping codes, the guide ring and rope for the parachute buckle, the lanterns for signaling. The arbor's swaying and the cloud vortex pressure the watcher's choices. Spatial choreography is clear and the setting constrains the physical setup. Present in setup, middle beats (cradle, rail, lanterns), and closure (ship kisses the cradle). However, much description is atmospheric rather than tactically decisive, and swapping "arbor" for "platform rig" would not fundamentally break the story logic, capping the score in the mid-6s to high-6s range.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"After the radio static clears" anchors the timeframe and appears in paragraph seven ("Tonight, after the radio static clears, the supply wing will thread the cloud seam") and paragraph thirteen ("The radio hisses, then a voice threads through… saying we are two minutes ahead"). The clearing static marks the start of the approach window and tightens decisions. However, the timeframe is not a live clock that pressures tactics beat-by-beat; the "two minutes ahead" detail is mentioned once and does not recur to shape the final beats. Present in setup and one middle beat, but not in closure. Functional but replaceable with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"To preserve trust under pressure" is introduced in paragraph six ("Our leader trusted me to preserve trust under pressure, a delicate circle that could snap if I blinked") and dramatized in the watcher's choices: testing the buckle, tapping the code, revising the approach, withholding apology, and meeting the pilot's eyes without being asked. The motivation is in friction with the watcher's self-doubt ("asking whether I have seen enough to trust my own invention") and the cost of the prior failure. Present in setup, middle beats (revision and guidance), and closure (the small nod and ongoing debt). The motivation drives the arc and is indispensable, though the phrase "preserve trust under pressure" itself is slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Soundless echo" as tone is signaled in paragraph four ("Even the wind carried a soundless echo, a hush that made each knot in the rigging feel articulate") and sustained through quiet, attentive beats: listening with "the careful patience of an instrument," the lanterns kept low "to keep the stars from feeling shy," the crew's "small jokes that break like soap bubbles," the watcher sparing words until landing. The tone modulates under pressure (clipped pilot voice, the ship's shudder) and charges the final image: the small nod and the weight "carried better" rather than dismissed. Coherent through turns, but the label "soundless echo" itself is ornamental and the tone is more "quiet vigilance" than a distinct sonic signature, capping the score in mid-6s.</comment>
