<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The labyrinth maintenance worker's interiority is concrete and particular—dream dust measured with a tea spoon, grief deconstructed like clogged drains—and the protagonist's progression from mechanical repair to archival witness shows agency under pressure. The final choice to read the tags and log them as angles is earned by prior causality and forecloses the pure maintenance role with visible cost. Minor slip: the trees-as-witness motif occasionally drifts toward abstraction ("trees had watched me more faithfully than people") without immediate embodied contradiction, but the embodied discoveries (root breaching wall, tags as minutes) ground the arc convincingly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly via Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis with Charged Poise): the protagonist shifts from routine maintenance to archivist-witness, the sextant heals, and the labyrinth stops leaking—mundane miracles with conceptual cost (the role is forever changed). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; density increases through layered images (dream dust hills, tags as minutes, angles replacing words) and the cadence shift at dawn reweights the dominant stake. One hairline issue: the pin-drop moment ("at the moment a pin is heard") is dramatized but its causal trigger is slightly soft—lightning and the sextant's trembling cue the descent, yet the pin itself feels more atmospheric marker than hard pivot.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The stormlit tower, labyrinth corridors, and recurring objects (sextant, root, tags) all constrain choices and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent: parapet → upper stair → lower ring → sliver room behind wall. The sextant pressed against the root to reveal the hidden archive is a micro-setting move that alters tactics. Sensory detail is purposeful (chains like silvered vines, milk blue breath of lightning) and filtered through the maintenance worker's lens. No cap trigger; environment shapes the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding and managing sorrow via the labyrinth's mysteries—is signaled early and tightens through a single meaningful escalation: the pin-drop leads to excavation, the tags, and the sextant's healing. The protagonist's agency (measuring dream dust, excavating mortar, arranging tags by weight and ache) drives the pressure forward under the Accumulative lens. The final cost is legible: the role shifts from fixer to witness-archivist, and "measured grief will float" becomes an earned principle. One constraint: the escalation is primarily deepening rather than narrowing options, which fits the lens but keeps the band shy of 8.5+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—sorrow as measurable, archivable, and shared across witnesses (trees, tower, protagonist)—emerges organically from particulars: tea spoon measurements, metal tags, the sextant's crack as "sorrow line," angles replacing words. The ending offers a resonant non-literal answer: quantified grief floats, mundane miracles arrive with schedules, and the protagonist can finally hear the trees' quiet register. No thematic echo or moralizing; the final image (trees gleaming, jar labeled "minutes yet unread") reweights prior material without stating a thesis. Subtext operates throughout (root as answering body, tags as meeting minutes).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistent: maintenance-worker pragmatism laced with lyric compression ("welder of edges," "sharp as sugar," "rinse water"). POV control is stable; perceptual signature is selective (hinges, latches, wheels as jurisdiction and conversation). Non-standard syntax and compression are pattern-taught and legible throughout. One slip: a few phrases drift toward elevated diction that strains the POV's plausible lexicon ("I wanted to discover what trees witness" reads slightly more authorial than the established voice under pressure). No dialogue present; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high and mostly coherent: "moon cleared, its brass seams warmed," "corridor waited for me to hear it," "sorrow line like a river on a map." Rhythm varies and information is layered. However, several instances of overwriting cluster in the middle third: "rusted to the sharpness of sugar" mixes tactile contradiction, and the phrase "recognition could be measured, as if sorrow could wear a badge" stacks two metaphors without full coherence. Template-cadence runs appear ("I kept it because... I wanted to discover... The sextant lay beside... I opened its spine...") across ~four adjacent lines, triggering a modest artifact penalty. No loops in the closure beat; momentum is strong overall.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of quantified sorrow, maintenance labor, and arboreal witnessing is specific and non-obvious; the transformation of grief via measuring and archiving avoids therapy-speak by anchoring in physical tools (tea spoon, ledger, angles). The sextant healing in moonlight and the labyrinth self-repairing as the protagonist reads the tags offer fresh inflection. Risk-taking (lyric compression, non-standard grammar, accumulative structure) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. One reservation: the trees-as-witness conceit, while specific here, is well-worn in contemporary lyric fiction; full originality depends on the archival-minutes twist, which is strong but not quite transformative enough to lift the score above 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The labyrinth maintenance worker is present throughout, frames expectation early (first sentence), and drives at least three beats: measuring dream dust, excavating the wall, arranging and reading the tags. The final action—logging tags as angles and sweeping dream dust into a jar—directly shapes closure and demonstrates a role transformation with cost. The character's choices narrow options (from passive repair to active witness) and the ending would fail without this exact protagonist.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The astronomer's broken sextant appears early (paragraph 4), is handled in multiple beats (found jammed, laid beside dream dust, opened to reveal crack, pressed against root, heals at closure), and its healing charges the final image. The crack as "sorrow line" and the needle's jerk guide excavation; the instrument teaches the hand to draw angles that replace words. Removal would break the story's logic and thematic closure. High irreplaceability and causal pressure across setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Quantified sorrow is signaled early ("deconstruct my grief," "first experiment in quantified sorrow") and shapes tactics: measuring dream dust with a tea spoon, arranging tags by weight and ache, logging them as angles. The concept drives the middle beat (excavation motivated by the need to map sorrow) and reappears at closure ("measured grief will float"). It constrains choices and alters the protagonist's method. Strong integration, though the execution occasionally drifts toward thematic echo rather than pure on-page constraint.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Heals in moonlight is introduced midway ("The instrument heals in moonlight, I wrote"), demonstrated when the moon clears and brass seams warm, and pays off at closure ("the crack in the sextant sealed"). It enables the final transformation with visible cost (the protagonist must wait for moonlight, excavate by its rhythm). The attribute constrains one key action and charges the ending, but its first appearance is slightly late (second third) and it does not shape earlier beats, capping the score near the two-gate threshold.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Deconstruct is present early ("I would deconstruct my grief the way I deconstructed clogged drains") and drives the protagonist's method throughout: measuring, excavating, arranging tags, drawing angles. The verb redefines the role from passive repair to active archival deconstruction and is inseparable from the closure transformation. It appears in at least three beats (dream dust, mortar excavation, ledger logging) and would be difficult to swap without structural loss. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mapping scattered dreams is signaled early (paragraph 13: "by mapping scattered dreams, because dreams fell like dust"), demonstrated through measuring dream dust into hills with a tea spoon, and returns at closure when the jar is labeled "minutes yet unread." The method shapes the protagonist's initial experiment and the final archival gesture, though the middle excavation beat relies more on the sextant and root than on dream-mapping per se. Two-beat involvement with closure linkage; solid integration but not indispensable across all turns.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The stormlit tower by moonlight is present from the opening line, supplies resources (parapet, upper stair, lower ring, sliver room), and constrains choices: the protagonist must navigate vertically, wait for moonlight to heal the sextant, and work within the labyrinth's architecture. Lightning flashes cue key moments (sextant trembling, tower filling with milk blue breath). The setting charges the final image (tower stops leaking, trees gleam as if just rained). High spatial coherence and causal pressure across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The timeframe "at the moment a pin is heard in a silent corridor" is dramatized on-page (paragraph 22: "the pin hit stone with the soft clink of a key admitting guilt") and triggers the descent into the lower ring, shaping one key turn. However, it appears only in the middle third and does not constrain earlier or later beats; the piece unfolds across a longer night-to-dawn arc without further pin-moment pressure. Functional but replaceable with another trigger; lyric reprise is absent. Mid-band integration.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The motivation to discover what trees witness is stated early (paragraph 8), dramatized through the protagonist's attention to roots and the labyrinth's archive ("trees were listening... sometimes answering with their bodies"), and paid off at closure ("I could finally hear the register of their quiet"). The desire drives excavation and the choice to read the tags. One friction: the motivation is slightly abstract and occasionally told rather than tested by competing wants, keeping it shy of 8.0+. Strong closure linkage and beat involvement.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mundane miracles is signaled early ("labyrinth maintenance worker," tools as jurisdiction and conversation) and sustained through diction: practical metaphors (clogged drains, misaligned walls), domestic tools (tea spoon, pocket knife, small wrench), and the line "Mundane miracles are like that, they arrive with schedules and clipboards." Tone modulates under pressure (lyric compression during excavation, calm inventory at dawn) and charges the final image (sextant whole, trees gleaming, jar labeled). Coherent across turns and indispensable to the story's texture and closure effect.</comment>
