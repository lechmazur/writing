<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The restorer protagonist demonstrates agency through concrete choices (introducing the needle, whispering the pier hymn, sealing the mask), and interiority is embodied through tactile perception ("hummed against my skin"). However, internal conflict remains muted—the work proceeds without genuine struggle or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The caretaker is present but applies minimal pressure; their collaboration reads cooperative rather than crucible-forged, and no hierarchy of values is tested with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its lyric pattern early and sustains coherent pressure through density and cadence. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (the masks transition from restless to grounded, spirits from panic to choosing to stay) with felt cost legible in the line "each released a last sip of storm." Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening lines. One meaningful deepening—unraveling the net and freeing trapped breath—sufficiently tightens the dominant stake. Minor deduction: the escalation remains steady rather than introducing a sharp turn or foreclosing option.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary, needle, net, and masks function as micro-setting that constrains choices and charges the closure image. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through the restorer's professional lens ("whalebone polished smooth," "brittle as scripture"). Spatial choreography tracks cleanly (iron stair, net hung high, masks in a ring). The needle and net directly enable the ending's repair action, satisfying the constraint test for 9+ eligibility, though the setting itself does not force a difficult trade-off.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—grounding restless spirits—is signaled early and tightens through the net-unraveling sequence. Agency is clear: the restorer's actions (loosening knots, sealing cracks, touching each brow) drive the resolution. One meaningful deepening occurs when "a line snapped and wind spilled," introducing brief friction. However, no live option is foreclosed with a visible price; the work proceeds without forced trade-offs or moral calculus, and escalation remains linear rather than forcing a hard choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—rest earned through patient tending of unrest—emerges from concrete action (unraveling knots, weighting memories with stones) rather than statement. The final image "chose to stay" and "accepted the shape of the shore" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence and gesture ("the caretaker kissed it and set it in a bowl"). Minor slip: "my work was never to banish, only to ground restless spirits kindly" edges toward thematic summary, though it remains character-voiced and does not overpower the scene work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with controlled psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature (professional restorer's lens: "fisher masks shattered by storms," "whalebone polished smooth"). Voice modulates purposefully—lyric compression in reflective beats, sharper clarity in action. The caretaker's brief speech carries idiom distinct from the narrator's ("his knots have not slept"). Filter verbs ("felt the interlaced hush stretch") are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. Minor deduction: a few lines edge toward elevated diction ("lucid," "footing") that slightly strains the blue-collar restorer register under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings show variety. Information density is high, with most lines advancing atmosphere and action. However, figurative language saturates nearly every sentence without break ("patient rainbows," "ladders on the floor," "a bell struck from the inside," "gentle vacuum where sound would be"), creating density that occasionally obscures rather than clarifies. "Interlaced hush" appears five times, risking template cadence. One paraphrase loop: "The sanctuary held its breath" followed immediately by entering the net sequence without propulsion between. Deduction: −0.6 for figurative saturation in high-pressure beats; −0.3 for phrase recurrence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of mask restoration, silence accumulation, and spirit-grounding through net-unraveling is specific and non-obvious. The restorer's professional frame (whalebone needle, pier hymn) grounds fantastical elements in tactile particulars. Emotional specificity avoids template consolation—joy braided with grief, horror taught to rest. Minor deduction: the core ritual (freeing trapped breath to ground spirits) follows a familiar sympathetic-magic template without a sharp moral or procedural twist that would make this exact configuration irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setup: present from the opening. Development: makes key choices (introducing needle, whispering hymn, sealing mask). Payoff: "touched each brow with the needle" in the ending sequence. The restorer's decisions drive two beats (net-unraveling, mask-sealing) and shape closure. Cost is implied (patience, skill) but not visibly traded against another option. Strong causal work; minor deduction for generic occupational role without irreplaceable specificity.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setup: introduced early ("I brought a tapestry needle"). Development: used to unravel knots and seal the mask's crack. Payoff: "touched each brow with the needle" at closure. Three distinct beats, causal pressure (enables repair), closure linkage. The needle's silence-accumulating property matters mechanically. Deduction: swappability—a similar metaphysical tool could replace it with minor edits; the needle is specialized but not uniquely irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Setup: titled and described early ("filled with an interlaced hush"). Development: the hush is felt, stretched, and drunk by the needle. Payoff: "changed weight, no longer interlaced with panic." The concept shapes stakes (spirits need grounding) and recurs across beats. However, it functions more as atmosphere than a constraint that narrows options. Cost connection is implicit but not sharp. Strong thematic resonance lifts it above mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Setup: the needle "accumulates silence" by paragraph four. Development: "caught each bead without letting it fall," "drank the room." Payoff: silence accumulation enables the spirits to stabilize. Two beats, causal pressure (the trait is mechanically necessary). However, no visible trade-off—silence accumulation never costs something else or constrains a choice. The trait enables rather than complicates. Strong presence but moderate irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setup: signaled early ("To ground the spirits we would need to exhume"). Development: the net-unraveling sequence dominates the middle third. Payoff: exhuming memories and breath directly enables the ending repair. The action is causally central and spans multiple beats. Deduction: "exhume" reads slightly generic (uncover/reveal/release would function similarly); the method (unraveling) carries more specificity than the verb itself. Strong closure linkage compensates.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setup: the net is introduced and its history explained by paragraph eleven. Development: unraveling knots is the primary action across the middle third, releasing trapped breath and memory. Payoff: "strands freed from the net" seal the mask at closure. The method is mechanically indispensable—three beats, high causal pressure, closure participation. The centuries-old net's specific history (drowned fisherman) charges the work with cost. Strong irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setup: opened with "prism sanctuary under starlight." Development: the sanctuary's glass facets, iron stair, and spatial layout guide movement and refract starlight into the wound. Payoff: "prism sanctuary...folded its ladders back into night." The setting enables the repair (starlight refracts through glass into the mask) and charges the closure image. Three beats, causal and poetic pressure. Environment constrains tactics and participates in the ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Setup: mentioned mid-story ("Time moved strangely here, across sharing a secret"). Development: no clear tracking of time's passage or pressure. Payoff: absent from closure. The phrase appears once without shaping decisions or tactics. "Sharing a secret" does not function as a tightening clock. Ornamental mention; swappable. Below functional band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Setup: stated early ("I came to ground those spirits"). Development: the desire drives every action (unraveling, weighting memories, sealing masks). Payoff: "my work was never to banish, only to ground restless spirits kindly" and the spirits' transition to "choosing to stay." Three beats, high causal pressure, closure linkage. Mild friction when "horror rose" and "joy burst," though no genuine conflict between the motivation and a competing want. Strong integration with visible cost (patience, skill).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Setup: the tone is established early (restless spirits, rattling masks, "unrest here was lucid"). Development: tone modulates with pressure—panic in the snapping line, laughter that "made the hush ring," then steadying. Payoff: "no longer interlaced with panic but with choosing to stay." Coherent through turns, charges the final image. The juxtaposition of clarity ("lucid") and disturbance ("unrest") is sustained and reweighted at closure. Strong tonal control with purposeful modulation.</comment>
