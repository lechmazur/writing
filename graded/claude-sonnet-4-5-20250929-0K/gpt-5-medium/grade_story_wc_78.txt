<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist exhibits a clear, consistent internal logic: interpreting environment through sound and converting threat into instrument. Embodied choices are visible throughout ("I lifted the xylophone mallet," "I struck in D"). The final sitting among pears after the storm demonstrates earned endurance with cost (exhaustion, watchfulness). Minor deduction: some interior moves ("I needed a counterstory big enough") edge toward declaration rather than dramatized contradiction under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Closure arrives as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise—the orchard survives through the protagonist's sustained translation of threat into rhythm, and the final image ("listened to the clouds rewrite their letters into silence") reweights the opening premise with felt cost (vigilance, continuous labor). Orientation is swift (who, where, what by line 2). One meaningful deepening when the gale's "mouth" forces escalation to the tower of crates. Cost is legible: unrelenting work, physical and mental toll visible in "restless euphony of repairs."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The floating orchard constrains every choice—drift angle, wind resistance, hull integrity. Micro-setting elements (mallet, crates, rigging) are handled tactilely and shape tactics (tower of perforated crates redirects the gale). The blue hour and approaching storm create atmospheric urgency. Spatial choreography is clear: bow, stern, starboard, deck positions tracked. The orchard's circle and salvaged driftwood charge the final image of survival earned through improvisation within severe constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: survive the gale by transforming obstacles into instruments. Pressure tightens from cloud interpretation to tower construction as the storm "mouth" widens. Agency is continuous—dubbing, striking, stacking—with visible cost (Zaya enlisted, swarm summoned, net hauled aboard). The net-of-knives complication adds a second pressure wave that the protagonist resolves through the same motive logic (dub as Sistrum). One clear escalation: mouth in cloud → tower of beats → lull → net hazard → final passage. Cost legible in labor and tactical pivots.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges wholly from enacted particulars: sound as survival tool, obstacles as raw material for rhythm, naming as control. "Walls made noise, noise became map, map redrew the wall" operates as principle demonstrated across beats, never asserted. The final image—"clouds rewrite their letters into silence"—offers a non-literal answer to the central question (how to survive through translation) without moralizing. Resonance is built through recurring sonic conversion (Bass of Anchors, Sistrum) that accumulates conceptual weight. No thematic echo or sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person, perceptual signature distinct (cloud curls as syllables, resonance as drawing). Diction remains in the character's idiom—technical music terms, maritime vocabulary, poetic compression ("dusk grinding indigo into brine"). Zaya's brief appearance shows differentiated action without voice convergence. Minor penalties: some passive constructions ("was the leeward tide prophet," "was a restless euphony") and filter verbs ("I heard its pitch," "I watched") slightly dull immediacy in peak beats, though they serve the contemplative register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies effectively; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high—most lines advance action, world logic, or sonic method. Minor deductions: occasional figurative stacking without clear vehicle logic ("dusk grinding indigo," "foam teaching itself borders") and some template stems ("I dubbed," "I struck," "I set") create mild cadence repetition in the middle third. No paraphrase loops or major clarity loss. Propulsion remains strong, and the final line lands cleanly with no scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: floating orchard + sound-as-survival + dubbing as renaming creates a non-obvious premise executed with internal coherence. The mallet's evolution (peg → drumstick → judge → timbre pronouncer) and fractal-generating lattice avoid stock tropes. Risk-taking in register (lyric compression, neologism "sketched resonance") heightens rather than obscures. The ending avoids both tidy resolution and false mystery, offering a transformation (storm → silence, obstacles → instruments) that feels inevitable in hindsight. Proximity check clear.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Present from line 2, drives every beat: cloud interpretation → mallet tapping → dubbing layers → beam striking in D → tower construction → net salvage. All major choices trace to this character's agency. Final sitting among pears completes the arc. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Introduced early ("I lifted the xylophone mallet from my belt"), used in at least three beats (tapping fruit/wood, striking beam in D, passed to Zaya for pears, taken back for net floats). Its history (peg → drumstick → judge) adds specificity. Shapes tactics and participates in closure zone when the protagonist sits after the labor. Strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Defined early ("Resonance was a drawing that sound made inside things"). Shapes multiple tactics: tapping fruit, laying spiral lattice, dubbing wind, striking beam. The concept recurs in the crate tower ("tower played itself") and net ("dubbed the lattice Sistrum"). Present in the ending ("orchard's own" note as final sketched resonance). Essential to the plot's internal logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Introduced line 4, exercised immediately ("Tonight the clouds dragged their hems low"). The attribute enables the key escalation move: seeing the "D" pitch in the cloud mouth and striking to match it, which deflects the gale. Visible cost: constant vigilance, physical and mental labor. Shapes closure (listening to clouds "rewrite their letters").</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Present from midpoint, drives the core tactic: dubbing wind as "Bass of Anchors," rigging as "Choir," hull as "Frame Drum." The action redefines the problem space—naming to control—and is irreplaceable. Without dubbing, the storm cannot be managed. The net-of-knives beat ("dubbed the lattice Sistrum") and final passage depend on this action. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Introduced early ("calculated by fractal generating") and applied to the spiral lattice of crates/oars. The method shapes the middle escalation: the tower's perforated structure (drilled "by fractal generating memories of coral") redirects the gale. Specific enough that a generic "pattern" would not convey the nested, self-similar logic. Enables a key beat but slightly less visible than dub or mallet.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Established line 1, pressures every choice: drift angle, wind exposure, hull shredding risk, buoyancy. The orchard's circular salvaged-driftwood base and open-sea location force the protagonist's entire survival strategy. The setting supplies resources (fruit to tap, rigging to dub, deck to arrange) and constraints (no shelter, constant motion). Final image ("I sat down among the pears") crystallizes the space as both crucible and instrument. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Framed in the opening and closing lines ("blue hour" bookends). The timeframe tightens decisions: gale arrives "before moonrise," creating urgency. The "blue hour thickened" marks escalation. The ending shift to "greener note" signals passage and closure. The compression between dusk and darkness shapes tempo and stakes. Strong temporal constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stated line 7 ("My motive was constant"), dramatized in every beat: net-of-knives becomes Sistrum, gale mouth becomes tower duet, cloud threat becomes rhythm. The motivation structures all choices with visible cost (labor, risk, continuous vigilance). The final line ("clouds rewrite their letters into silence") completes the motive as enacted principle. Indispensable to logic and closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Announced line 3 ("restless euphony of repairs") and sustained: poetic compression, musical terminology, layered sonic images. Tone modulates under pressure (intensifies with the gale, calms at lull, resolves to "greener note"). The final sitting among pears charges the image with exhausted accomplishment. Coherent and integral to the story's texture and ending effect.</comment>
