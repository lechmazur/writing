<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interior voice is consistent and poetic, but interiority remains largely contemplative rather than embodying contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Micro-choices appear (delaying the reach, arranging seeds into monuments), yet the pressure never forces a genuine internal conflict or renunciation with visible cost. Embodiment is present in "moss on my knees" and "ash from my hair," but emotional states read as serene throughout rather than contradictory under stress. The final realization "what emerges transformed always is the hearer" arrives as epiphany rather than through dramatized struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors promptly (orderly seed sorter, skyborne arbor, hush timeframe). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered image and ritual, culminating in the insight "what emerges transformed always is the hearer." However, the closure unit—while philosophically resonant—lacks a visible, felt, or conceptual cost on the page; the narrator's role and stance remain unchanged, and no prior option is foreclosed. The final laugh and descent feel celebratory rather than charged with sacrifice or renunciation, making the RR incomplete under the chosen lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The ashen skyborne arbor is vividly rendered with purposeful detail: roots braided into cloud, bark ash-gray, lichens that sip thunder. The arbor constrains choices (leaf placement on trays, monument building) and charges the final image when it "seems to smile" and loans the narrator "a rung of height." Sensory selection is consistent and filtered through the narrator's ritual focus. The setting reads as micro-setting that shapes tactics and the ending, meeting the 9+ gate test for Q3.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—decoding leaf-messages to guide villages—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through the ritual sequence (leaves drift, dust speck warms, phrase emerges), yet no reversal narrows options or forces a trade-off. The narrator's agency is descriptive and observational; the key realization arrives as insight rather than a choice that forecloses a path. Under the Accumulative lens, escalation would require density or cadence shift that reweights cost; the final act (feeding the sentence to the airstream) reads as closure of the ritual loop, not a tightening with visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—transformation through witness, memory, and ritual—emerges from particulars: tiny monuments, leaf-reading, the arbor's conversation. The final insight "what emerges transformed always is the hearer" offers a non-literal answer to the central question. However, the piece borders on overt thematic statement in the penultimate beat, reducing indirection. Motifs (dust speck, monuments, leaves) recur meaningfully and constrain choice, earning credit. The ending resonates but lacks the fully embodied cost that would anchor the theme in dramatic struggle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyric, and consistent: poetic compression ("sift of lightfall," "raftered branches"), archaic register ("tasting river clay and sweetness"), and a perceptual signature that notices ritual minutiae. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. The narrator's syntax and rhythm support the contemplative, elevated tone without significant slips. Minor filter-verb stacks ("I know," "I feel") are present but voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy at peak beats. The piece teaches its pattern early and sustains it through closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("roots braided into cloud," "stippling the air"). However, several paraphrase loops appear: "tiny monuments to forgotten things" recurs three times with minimal variation, and the phrase "emerges transformed always" is repeated verbatim without added pressure. Template cadence is present in multiple "I [verb]" stems across consecutive sentences. These artifacts do not obscure causality but reduce information density. No major clarity breaks, so the Non-closure Accumulation Cap holds the penalty to −0.8 for loops and stems.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The premise—leaf-reading ritual on a skyborne arbor—offers a fresh inflection on divination and memory work. The synthesis of folklore, ritual labor, and lyric voice feels specific rather than generic. However, the emotional and narrative arc could function with different names and images (Transformation test flags replaceability). The final realization, while non-obvious, arrives as philosophical insight rather than earned through a bold structural or perspectival risk. No close echoes of famous lines, and the voice commits fully to its elevated register.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The orderly seed sorter (narrator) makes micro-choices: delaying the reach, placing the leaf on the century-of-embers tray, arranging seeds into monuments, feeding the decoded sentence to the airstream. These choices drive the ritual sequence and appear in the ending. However, none of these decisions alters tactics or narrows options with visible cost; the narrator's stance remains unchanged. Present in setup, middle, and closure, but causal pressure is low.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The moonstone cabochon dust speck appears in three beats: initial description, warming when truth nears, refracting veinwork into legible threads, and cooling at the end when "its work done." It enables the decoding action and charges the ritual's success. However, it does not constrain a choice or introduce cost; it functions as a reliable tool without friction. Present in setup, middle, and closure, with reweighted meaning (warming → cooling), but lacks irreplaceability or visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Regional folklore is mentioned twice: the tree grew from a spared ember carried by cranes, and folklore argues the tree judges while the narrator argues it converses. This frames the narrator's interpretive stance but does not constrain a choice or alter tactics on the page. The concept remains thematic rather than causal. Present in setup and echoed in the middle, but absent from closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Emerges transformed always" is decoded from the leaves and spoken aloud, triggering the arbor's shiver and the instruction to build monuments from seeds. It drives the middle beat and provides the closure insight ("what emerges transformed always is the hearer"). However, it does not constrain a choice with visible cost; the narrator integrates the phrase seamlessly without friction. Present in middle and closure, with thematic weight, but lacks trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Prod" appears twice: the narrator's grandmother prodded roots with a willow pin to tell which grief was ready to sprout, and the narrator prods herself to delay the eager reach. The second instance is a micro-choice that shapes one beat but does not drive a major turn. The action is swappable with "hesitate" or "restrain" without structural impact. Present in setup (via backstory) and middle, but minor causal role.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Building tiny monuments to forgotten things is signaled early, mechanics described (cairns, twig altars, idols of nutshell and bone button), and the method recurs: monuments hum when leaves pass, guiding their tumble; the narrator builds new monuments from seeds in the middle; the method is credited with steadying the world in the penultimate beat. It shapes two beats and is present in the ending reflection. However, no visible cost or constraint is tied to the method. Present in setup, middle, and closure; causal across beats but lacks friction.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ashen skyborne arbor is foregrounded in setup, supplies the leaves and ritual space, and "seems to smile" and loans the narrator "a rung of height" at closure. Its roots, bark, lichens, and raftered branches constrain the ritual (where monuments are built, where leaves land) and charge the final image. Present in setup, middle, and closure; essential to the story's logic and pressure. Micro-setting that alters tactics and charges the ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"During the hush where past meets prophecy" is named in the opening and middle ("I know the hush has arrived"). It frames the ritual's temporal window but does not tighten decisions or constrain tactics with a live clock. The timeframe is atmospheric rather than pressuring. Present in setup and middle, but does not shape closure or escalate stakes.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>To decode the message in falling leaves is the narrator's explicit goal, signaled in the opening and pursued through the ritual: listening for instructions, laying out trays, tilting the dust speck, decoding the phrase. The desire drives the middle sequence and is fulfilled at closure when the decoded sentence is fed to the airstream. However, the motivation is not conflicted or tested with visible cost; the narrator succeeds without friction. Present in setup, middle, and closure; causal but lacks dramatized conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Mossy delight is named in the opening and sustained through the narrator's tone: "laughing under the generous ashen sky," savoring "river clay and sweetness," building monuments with care. The tone is coherent and modulates slightly when the arbor shivers and the narrator feels taller. However, the tone remains serene and celebratory throughout, lacking tonal shift under pressure. Present in setup and closure, charges the final image, but does not deepen or complicate.</comment>
