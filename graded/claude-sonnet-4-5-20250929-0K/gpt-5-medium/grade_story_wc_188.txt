<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is consistently filtered through craft-focused perception ("measuring the air with my feet," "filtered the burned smell from memory"), and the relationship with Lark creates productive pressure. However, the emotional stakes remain largely abstract—the fortress residents' "gravity of hopelessness" is told rather than embodied in choices. The final teaching moment ("how to lean out of sorrow without falling") edges toward therapy-speak without sufficient dramatized cost to earn it. Lark's agency is thin; she functions more as apprentice than co-actor with her own conflicting wants.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds through mosaic imagery (note in mosaic → fireworks sequence → ash-drinking blooms) with a coherent pattern taught early. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the final image of the knot re-tied and walls rechanted, reweighting the opening hopelessness with "what remained possible." Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening lines. The weakness: cost is conceptual and felt rather than a visible forfeiture on the page—the keeper stands straighter, vines tremble, but no trade-off or sacrifice forecloses a path. One meaningful deepening (discovery of the knot and collaborative performance) narrows options under the lens, meeting the 600–800 word requirement.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setting elements actively constrain choices: the mosaic note provides the performance sequence, wind-pooling guides mortar placement, and the ivy-parted tower and cistern shape the choreography. The blooming fortress functions as both atmosphere and tactical terrain. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through craft perception ("jasmine poured down like a gentle waterfall," "ash and retell this note in mosaic"). The micro-setting (cubby of tools, parapet, courtyard echoes) charges the final image when the blooms "drink ash and retell this note." Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: defy hopelessness through fireworks performance. The discovery of the knot and pact with Lark provides one meaningful tightening that narrows options—they commit to the night's performance. However, escalation is largely atmospheric rather than driven by protagonist agency under pressure; the fireworks succeed without visible friction or trade-off. The "gravity loosen, not vanquished, but persuaded" registers as conceptual rather than a choice that forecloses a path. No moment where failure genuinely threatens or where the protagonist must sacrifice one good for another.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the interplay of "serious playfulness," craft as instruction, and the mosaic note as both literal and metaphorical guide. The final image—blooms drinking ash to "retell this note in mosaic"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how ritual and play defy despair. However, phrases like "how to lean out of sorrow without falling" and "this play was our prayer, and this prayer was instruction" edge toward thematic statement rather than letting the image do the work. The piece avoids sermonizing but occasionally over-articulates its own wisdom.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice is consistently lyric and craft-focused with a distinct perceptual signature: "chanting a soft rhythm to keep the wall awake," "filtered the burned smell from memory, keeping only what might become color." Psychic distance and tense remain stable. Dialogue is minimal but purposeful ("I am Lark...I thought the knot belonged to a disappeared uncle"). The prose sustains its elevated, metaphor-rich register without mid-paragraph POV slippage. Weakness: under peak pressure (the fireworks launch), the diction remains uniformly poetic rather than compressing or modulating with urgency; "flame walked the cord, polite as a messenger with wild news" is beautiful but doesn't shift cadence for the climax.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high and mostly coherent ("moonflowers and trumpet vine, their blooms opened wide like listening mouths"), but the final third crosses into overwriting: nearly every sentence in the fireworks sequence carries metaphor without pattern-teaching or escalation. "Flame walked the cord, polite as a messenger" and "seeds of ash...fertile soot" stack vehicles without clear propulsion. Template cadence appears in the setup beats: "We walked...We mixed...We braided...By the time..." creates a rhythmic sameness. Paraphrase loop: "I came to defy the gravity of hopelessness" and later "how to lean out of sorrow without falling" restate the same premise. Apply −0.6 for density in peak beats and −0.4 for template cadence, total −1.0 within Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The mosaic-as-musical-notation premise is fresh and the synthesis of fireworks-as-ritual with architectural instruction feels specific and earned. The voice—craft-focused, ritual-minded, embodied—avoids generic templates. However, the "wandering artisan brings hope to despairing community" frame is a familiar narrative scaffold, and the emotional arc (despair → shared ritual → renewed possibility) follows a well-worn path. The piece transforms through vivid sensory detail and the kerosene knot as talisman, but the central conflict lacks a non-obvious complication or moral friction. The risk-taking in prose style elevates without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Wandering fireworks designer is introduced in the opening line, drives the middle discovery (finding the cubby and knot), and shapes the ending by teaching Lark and executing the performance. Decisions include speaking with the keeper, interpreting the mosaic note, and guiding the fireworks sequence—each alters tactics. The character's craft knowledge enables the resolution. Weakness: the designer's choices face little friction; the performance succeeds without visible cost or sacrifice tied specifically to the designer's agency. Three beats (arrival/discovery, pact, performance) with causal involvement and closure linkage place this in the 6.5–7.2 range; absence of a contested choice or trade-off caps it at 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fire spinner's kerosene rag knot appears in three beats: discovery in the cubby, preparation ("We braided the kerosene rag knot into a long cord"), and the lighting sequence. It functions as fuse and spine for the performance, enabling the fireworks. Final reprise: "Lark tied the rag knot back into its patient shape," reweighting it as a reusable talisman rather than consumable. The knot's transformation from found relic to active tool to symbol of continuity shows evolving use. However, the knot could be replaced by any fuse without major edits—its specific "rag knot" quality doesn't constrain choices beyond generic fuel delivery. Strong setup, development, and payoff with causal pressure; swappability and modest closure charge place it at 7.6.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Note in mosaic is introduced early (base of blue wave), shapes the middle beat by providing the performance sequence ("gave our sequence, rises and rests"), and returns in the final line ("retell this note in mosaic"). It constrains the fireworks design—they must follow the mosaic's musical instruction. However, the mechanics remain vague: how exactly does a visual eighth note dictate "rises and rests"? The concept charges the ending image but doesn't force a difficult choice or reveal a cost. Two-gate presence (setup, payoff) with modest middle involvement; lyric reprise reweights meaning. Causal role in one major beat and closure linkage place it at 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Chants while walking appears in four beats: opening ("humming the road"), following the vine ("chanting a soft rhythm to keep the wall awake"), mapping the courtyard ("I chanted while walking, mapping echoes"), and the finale ("we walked the walls chanting, counting what remained possible"). It enables ambient awareness and rhythm-keeping but doesn't constrain a choice with visible cost—the chanting is method, not obstacle. The trait is specific to the character and recurs with purpose, but removing it would not break story logic; the echo-mapping could proceed silently. Setup, two development beats, closure presence; functional but low stakes. 5.2.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Filter appears in five beats: "filtered the burned smell from memory, keeping only what might become color," "Lark held...and I taught her to filter the fuel through cloth and patience," the salt-and-petal mixture preparation, "filtering fear from the crowd as carefully as I filtered fuel from flame," and implicitly in the ash-drinking blooms that "retell." The action shapes tactics (fuel preparation, emotional management) and structures the thematic arc. However, the fuel-filtering could be replaced by any preparation verb; the emotional "filtering fear" is more metaphor than concrete action. Present in setup, two middle beats, and closure with causal pressure on tactics. Replaceability and mixed concrete/abstract use: 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Through ambient awareness is signaled mid-story ("Through ambient awareness, I felt where wind pooled") and enables the courtyard mapping that guides mortar placement. It also underlies the discovery of the cubby ("ordinary talisman you only notice through ambient awareness"). The method appears in two functional beats and shapes the middle tactical choice. However, it arrives after the opening third and could be replaced by "careful observation" without major loss. Mechanics are vague—what makes this "ambient" versus ordinary attention? Modest causal pressure and late signal; two-beat involvement: 6.1.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Blooming fortress at dusk is anchored in the opening line and provides continuous pressure: the overgrown ramparts and trumpet vine frame access, the mosaic wall holds the note, the courtyard funnels wind and echoes, the towers and cistern dictate mortar placement, and the jasmine-draped parapet becomes the pact site. The setting is not merely postcard—each element (ivy, cistern, walls, vines) alters tactics. Dusk transitions to "iron" night, tightening the timeframe. The blooms drink ash in the final image, completing the cycle. Strong setup, pervasive middle constraint, and closure charge: 7.3.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>During the hush of a night with no stars is announced mid-story ("Tonight, during the hush of a night with no stars") and frames the performance window. The no-stars condition underscores the residents' despair and provides thematic contrast for the fireworks as artificial stars. However, the timeframe doesn't tighten decisions—no clock pressure, no risk of dawn interrupting. The "hush" creates atmosphere but not tactical urgency. Present in setup (via "dusk") and middle framing; low constraint on choices. Lyric function without cost: 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>To defy the gravity of hopelessness is stated in the opening third ("I came to defy the gravity of hopelessness") and drives the middle pact and performance. The final image resolves it: "I felt the gravity loosen, not vanquished, but persuaded." However, the motivation is more told than dramatized—no scene where the protagonist's own hopelessness or doubt creates friction. The desire shapes the goal but doesn't generate internal conflict or force a sacrifice. Setup, goal-driving middle, and closure presence; lack of conflicted choice: 6.3.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Serious playfulness is introduced early ("I came to defy...not by shouting, but by teaching light to play seriously," "Serious playfulness...is how we talk to gravity without insulting its intelligence") and remains coherent through the preparation and performance. The tone modulates subtly: solemn in the opening, collaborative in the middle, celebratory-but-restrained at the climax ("When the final comet rained down in green hush"). The final image—re-tying the knot and chanting what "remained possible"—sustains the tone's balance of ritual gravity and generative play. The tone charges the ending without becoming static or forced. Strong setup, consistent development, closure charge: 7.4.</comment>
