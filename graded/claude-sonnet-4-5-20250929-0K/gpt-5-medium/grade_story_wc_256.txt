<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is richly textured with embodied detail ("my hands are powerfully gentle, calibrated to wake sleeping metal") and the volunteer's moment with the ferry bell offers genuine emotional complexity. However, the piece leans heavily on abstract self-diagnosis ("I am here to discover the texture of connection") and decorative introspection that doesn't always translate into micro-choices under pressure. The final stance—"I will follow, powerfully gentle, because I want to learn the braid we become"—feels more like theme declaration than earned renunciation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes orientation (laboratory, post-outage, bell ringer narrator) within the opening beats and teaches an accumulative/textural lens through the pilgrimage's stations. Closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration via the final image of the city "tuning itself to hope," but the cost remains conceptual and atmospheric rather than legible as a foreclosed path or felt price. The lack of a clear before/after in the narrator's options or knowledge weakens the closure effect under any lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The laboratory's sensory signature—golden shadows, vacuum-tube dust, citrus-chewed fear, carbide-lamp moonlight—is vivid and sustained. The lamp lens and bells function as micro-setting elements that constrain the pilgrimage's structure and charge the final image. Spatial choreography across stations remains clear, though the ending's shift to "school gym, then hospice, then square" dilutes the immediate environment's pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—designing an honest pilgrimage through sound—is signaled early and accumulates texture across stations. However, escalation reads as lateral accretion rather than tightening: each station adds sensory threads without narrowing options or raising cost. The volunteer's moment near the ferry bell offers a micro-turn, but the narrator's own choices never face a trade-off or visible price that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the pilgrimage's mechanics: connection as braid rather than bridge, grief as a tide that can be nudged, sound as repair. The ferry bell's "shallow sandbar we did not expect" and the crystal bell's mapping of shy lovers' benches ground abstraction in particulars. The ending risks a thematic echo ("the city tuning itself to hope") but the earlier stations' specificity and the volunteer's breath steadying the bell offer genuine resonance without overt moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The narrator's perceptual signature—"prism-song bell ringer," calibrated hands, the mathematics of survival—creates a distinct, consistent voice. Diction remains stable and voice-motivated; no head-hopping. The single moment of dialogue (the volunteer's whispered confession) feels natural and goal-driven. Some figurative constructions border on overwrought ("breath braided themselves only in sleep"), but the voice coheres under pressure and the psychic distance remains controlled throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is generally high, with most lines advancing atmosphere or stakes. However, several paraphrase loops and template stems appear: "I am here to discover," "I am the prism-song," "I will follow"; the phrase "powerfully gentle" recurs without evolving pressure. The metaphor "golden shadows" is repeated mechanically across beats. These artifacts dull momentum in non-closure beats but do not obscure the final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The premise—an artificial pilgrimage through recovered sound using a carbide lens to split bells into spectra—offers a fresh synthesis of sensory archaeology and communal repair. The specific details (ferry sunk in winter ice, factory mothers' humming, cutlery bell) personalize the frame. However, the emotional arc and thematic resolution (connection as braid, sound as repair) follow a familiar template of communal healing after crisis; the story does not transform that arc through a non-obvious moral calculus or lived friction.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The bell ringer is present throughout, polishes the lens, rings bells at each station, and frames the pilgrimage's premise. However, most choices are curatorial rather than pressured decisions: selecting bells, placing the lens, speaking "the smallest truth." The lack of a trade-off or foreclosed path limits causal impact.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The carbide lamp lens appears early (unlocked from cabinet, polished), is used functionally at multiple stations to split sound into spectra, and is referenced in the closing beat ("its moonlight lingers on my palms"). It enables the pilgrimage's mechanics and charges the final image. However, its use is primarily illustrative; no cost or constraint tied specifically to the lens alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The artificial pilgrimage structures the entire middle arc, with stations that progress "not by distance but by textures of approach" and a stated plan to travel to gym, hospice, square. It shapes the narrator's goal and informs the volunteer's participation. Yet the concept remains more thematic frame than causal engine; it does not narrow options or impose a visible price at closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The phrase "powerfully gentle" is introduced early, applied to the narrator's hands, and repeated verbatim at closure ("I will follow, powerfully gentle"). However, it functions as a label rather than a constraint: no on-page moment shows the trait enabling a success or forcing a trade-off. The repetition is decorative.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The action "propel" is invoked explicitly ("propel ourselves across rooms of sound") and the pilgrimage's movement depends on it. However, the word itself is more metaphorical descriptor than dramatized action; the physical or tactical mechanics of propulsion are not shown causing a turn or altering cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Questioning assumptions is stated as the pilgrimage's method ("by questioning assumptions about silence, about grief, and about the ownership of sound") and enacted at the volunteer's station ("by questioning assumptions about what grief repeats"). It shapes the pilgrimage's premise and the volunteer's micro-turn. However, the method is more told than dramatized; the narrator's own questions do not visibly constrain a choice.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The laboratory of lost sounds is established in the opening line, provides the jars of vanished bells, the iron cabinet, the workbenches, and the vacuum-tube dust. It supplies the resources (bells, lens) that enable the pilgrimage and anchors the final image. The setting pressures choices insofar as the bells' histories shape the stations' content and the volunteer's reaction.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the power grid stabilizes" is stated in the opening line and referenced again ("During the outages, every street grew skeletal"). It provides context for the city's recovery and the laboratory's resumption of work. However, it does not impose a live clock or deadline that alters tactics; the stabilization is backdrop rather than constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to discover the texture of connection" is stated explicitly and drives the narrator's acceptance of the consortium's request and participation in the pilgrimage. The volunteer's moment offers friction between grief and repair. However, the motivation is more abstract desire than dramatized conflict; no on-page choice pits connection against a competing want with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The tone phrase "golden shadows" appears in the opening paragraph, recurs at multiple stations ("Golden shadows ripple," "In golden shadows we move"), and closes the piece ("In the golden shadows left by the lens"). It coheres through pressure, modulates softly with the pilgrimage's progress, and charges the final image of hope. The tone is integral to atmosphere and closure.</comment>
