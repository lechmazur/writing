<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interior voice is distinctive and philosophically consistent ("gardener of untended laughter"), but lacks embodied contradiction under pressure—the modestly fearless stance remains decorative rather than forcing trade-offs. The woman who died mid-laughter arrives late and her arc (fear → joke-telling) compresses without visible cost or earlier setup. Interiority leans toward poetic assertion ("fear is a better teacher when it is asked to speak softly") rather than specific, contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. No meaningful relationship crucible appears; the woman's voice is heard but not contested, flattening what could be dramatic tension.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: imagery and motif density increase toward the ending, where the woman's laughter "braids with the river's recollection" and climbs "the harp's crooked ladder." Orientation anchors who and where early (lost soul collector, echo gorge), though "when" remains vague beyond "hidden sunrise." The closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (the woman's departure charged by prior listening work), but cost is implied rather than dramatized—no on-page forfeiture or tactical constraint follows her release, only atmospheric brightening. The harp and crocodile's tooth recur with shifted meaning, meeting the Accumulative requirement, but the final "benediction of bent music" asserts resolution without an exact sentence proving cost paid.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Echo gorge functions as more than backdrop: the limestone cleft strings the harp, voices "spill from the rock," and the stone wall accepts the crocodile's tooth, all constraining the protagonist's method. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful ("spectral confessions, trembling like light on oil," "coins of heat"), filtered through the narrator's philosophical lens. The harp-as-spider-web and the river waking under the rock charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate criterion that environment shapes the closure. Spatial choreography remains clear across moves (canyon lip, nearest wall, threshold).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—coaxing lost voices home by integrating laughter into healing—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful deepening occurs when the woman's voice arrives hesitant, confesses fear, and is coaxed through joke-telling until she "climbs the harp's crooked ladder toward a clearing." Under the Accumulative lens, pressure coheres through rising motif density (harp, tooth, river), but escalation is additive rather than narrowing options—no live tactic is foreclosed, no visible price paid that alters subsequent moves. The protagonist remains functionally passive, facilitating rather than choosing under friction. Cost is atmospheric ("light wearing her name") rather than legible as forfeiture or tactical shift.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme—laughter as bridge, survival turning bite into promise—emerges organically from the harp's crooked music and the crocodile's tooth without overt moralizing. The final image (leaving a string for strangers, carrying the next laugh "like water in cupped hands") offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of integration and mercy. Subtext operates in gesture (pressing the tooth to stone, standing aside) and image (the river as midwife-grinning crocodile). The piece resists tidy binaries and allows the woman's fear-of-laughter paradox to complicate closure. Minor deduction: the phrase "modestly fearless breath" and "luminous ache of memory" edge toward thematic echo, though they remain imagistic enough to avoid full sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable first-person throughout with a distinct perceptual signature: philosophical framing ("gardener of untended laughter"), selective noticing (the harp "confesses," the tooth's "yellowed patience"). Diction is elevated but voice-motivated, fitting the narrator's self-fashioned role. No dialogue appears on the page; the woman's voice is reported indirectly ("She said she had died mid-laughter"), which flattens immediacy and denies the chance to test voice distinction. Under peak emotional moments (the woman's breakthrough), the prose maintains its lyric register without compression or syntactic shift, missing an opportunity for rhythmic modulation. Free indirect access to the woman's interiority is absent, keeping her at arm's length.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Figurative density is high and mostly coherent ("voices live after bodies forget them," "sound grew legs"), but several vehicles strain: "light wearing her name until it could let her go" conflates metaphor logic, and "the sun scattered coins of heat that pretended they were just another cloud" introduces simultaneity and mixed agency without clear payoff. Repetitive sentence stems appear ("I listened," "I told her," "I pressed," "I stood," "I gathered") across the middle third, creating template cadence. Information density is strong—most lines do thematic and atmospheric work—but paraphrase loops occur: "laughter is a bridge" is restated as "laughter is a key that unlocks the room" within four paragraphs, synonym churn without added pressure. No filter-verb stacks or therapy-speak appear. Rhythm varies, though the consistent ~20-word sentence length flattens propulsion during the peak beat (woman's laughter climbing the ladder).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of lost-soul collection, misaligned harp, and laughter-as-healing is specific and non-obvious, avoiding template grief-work. The crocodile's tooth reframed as mercy compass and the harp strung across limestone like a spider web offer particular, grounded images. Emotional complexity (the woman's fear-of-laughter, the protagonist's "crack in my sound") avoids sentimentality. However, the core arc—collector arrives, encounters hesitant spirit, facilitates release through gentle coaxing—follows a familiar shape without bold structural risk or a turn that disrupts the reader's early forecast. The ending's image (leaving a string, moving to the next valley) gestures toward open-endedness but plays the expected note. Proximity check passes; no close echoes of famous lines detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Character present throughout; shapes the action by arriving, plucking the harp, listening, and coaxing the woman's voice. Decisions include pressing the tooth to the wall and leaving a string for strangers, but these choices do not narrow prior options or reverse tactics—they affirm the established role. The protagonist observes and facilitates without friction that tests competing wants. Present in setup, middle, and closure, meeting all three gates, but causal pressure and cost are atmospheric rather than forfeiture-based.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Object appears in three beats: introduced as relic in paragraph 9, pressed to the wall in paragraph 26 (triggering the river's memory), and left to rest in paragraph 29, reframed as "compass pointing toward mercy." The reprise reweights its earlier "proof that survival can turn its bite into a promise." However, the tooth does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic under stress—it is held and reflected upon but does not alter the protagonist's approach or the woman's release. Static symbolic use limits the score despite strong thematic charge.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Concept shapes the dominant stake and method: voices spill confessions from the rock, the protagonist listens and responds, and the woman's confession of dying mid-laughter drives the middle turn. The spectral confessions are not merely thematic—they generate the on-page dialogue substitute (reported voice) and the tactical challenge of coaxing without judging. Present in setup (voices "live after bodies forget them"), middle (carpenter's apology, child's giggle, bride's vow), and closure (woman's laughter braiding with the river's story). The concept redefines the protagonist's pursuit as listening-work rather than retrieval-work, altering options.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Attribute mentioned three times: opening ("modestly fearless breath"), midpoint ("I listened, modestly fearless"), and near end ("my modestly fearless breath to keep time"). The trait is asserted rather than demonstrated through a trade-off or constrained choice. No on-page action tests the balance between modesty and fearlessness—the protagonist proceeds without visible friction between caution and boldness, making it label-only. Present in setup and closure (lyric reprise) but does not enable or foreclose a tactic; ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Action frames the entire arc: the protagonist arrives "to coax [voices] home" and concludes by turning "toward the next valley" to "pursue that hush." The pursuit shapes method (listening, plucking the harp, humming counter-melody) and the woman's arc (coaxing her through joke-telling until she climbs away). However, "pursue" could be swapped for "gather" or "seek" with minor edits—the specificity of pursuit (chase, track, close distance) is not leveraged. Present in setup, middle tactics, and closure framing, meeting all three gates and driving two beats, but lacks irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Method introduced early ("listen through the distorted notes of a misaligned harp"), enacted in paragraph 11 ("I plucked the first broken chord"), and returned in paragraph 22-23 ("misaligned harp produced a crooked chuckle," "harp settled, satisfied"). The harp's tuning by wind and its crooked sound enable the protagonist's work and produce the climactic chuckle that helps the woman. The mechanics matter—distortion creates the space for laughter rather than grief alone. Present in setup, two middle beats, and closure, with causal pressure (the harp's output shapes the woman's breakthrough). Specificity high; removing "misaligned" would flatten the thematic link to brokenness.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setting pressures choices and supplies resources: the gorge's cleft strings the harp, the limestone wall accepts the tooth, voices "spill from the rock," and the canyon lip provides spatial staging for the sound's movement. The gorge is not mere backdrop—it is the instrument and archive. Present in setup (opening paragraph), middle (voices from rock, river under rock), and closure (gorge's sigh, harp settled). Spatial choreography clear; the environment's acoustics and geology enable the protagonist's method and charge the final image ("harp's crooked ladder toward a clearing").</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Timeframe anchors the opening ("hush of a hidden sunrise," "when the dawn breathes") and reappears in paragraph 23 ("sun scattered coins of heat"). Time does not tighten decisions—no clock pressure or duration limit constrains the protagonist's listening or the woman's breakthrough. The sunrise functions as atmospheric setting rather than a tactical frame; the story could unfold at dusk or midday without altering the arc. Present in setup and briefly in middle, but missing closure participation and causal involvement; ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Motivation stated early ("my purpose was to integrate laughter into healing") and dramatized through the protagonist's method: plucking the harp to produce spectral confessions, humming counter-melody, laughing until "the sound grew legs," and coaxing the woman through joke-telling. The motivation drives the middle turn (testing the door patiently with the woman) and shapes the closure choice (leaving a string, moving to the next valley). Friction appears when the woman fears laughter will betray her, and the protagonist must balance risk and gentleness. Cost is implicit (the protagonist "stood aside, as my work requires") but lacks forfeiture specificity. Present in setup, two beats, and closure framing.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Tone phrase appears once ("luminous ache of memory like a lantern we refused to set down") and the diction maintains a balance of brightness ("coins of heat," "light wearing her name") and sorrow ("spectral confessions," "choking on a joke"). The tone modulates subtly—poetic density increases at the woman's breakthrough and the river's story—but remains consistent rather than shifting with escalation. The final image ("carry it, like water in cupped hands, until it spills home") charges the ache-light paradox. Coherent through turns, but static mood rather than dynamic pressure modulation; mid-band.</comment>
