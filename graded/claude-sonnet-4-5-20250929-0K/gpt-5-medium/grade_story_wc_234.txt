<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The "pocket-sun alchemist" functions more as a role-label than a dramatized character with contradictory impulses. Interiority remains abstract and decorative ("my loves are scientifically romantic") rather than embodied under pressure. The final promise ("We will spend it carefully") reads as assertion rather than a choice that forecloses a live path with visible cost. Micro-choices during the experiment are present but feel more like procedure than struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing: the "thimble of light" proves "presence is a metal that refuses to alloy with hurry," reweighting the opening dare. Orientation anchors (ember nexus, two friends, twilight) land early. However, the escalation reads as accumulative texture rather than a tightening that narrows options; the experiment proceeds without meaningful reversal or complication. Cost is conceptual (the secret "not endangered anymore") but felt cost—what was risked or forfeited—remains oblique.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ember nexus supplies vivid sensory detail ("ash-petaled," "sparks knitting constellations") and the nautilus curl anchors the ritual physically. The forge-trees and drifting cinders create coherent atmosphere. The curl constrains the pocket-sun's behavior ("a bead of day rolling inward with small decisive clicks"), shaping the experiment's mechanics and charging the final image when it releases the proof.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—capturing "the density of presence"—is signaled early and persists. However, pressure accumulates through lyric intensification rather than escalation that forecloses options. No reversal or complication tests the protagonists' resolve; the experiment succeeds without visible trade-off. The final "we promise to keep the chamber open" gestures toward ongoing cost but does not name what was spent or what path was closed on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete imagery: the nautilus spiral, the pocket-sun's hesitance, "presence is a metal that refuses to alloy with hurry." The closing image—"returning differently, so the presence we caught can keep catching us"—reweights the opening dare with conceptual cost (the chamber must stay open). No overt moralizing. The final line avoids a stated thesis and lets the proof resonate as a non-literal answer to whether this is love.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Voice is consistent and lyric throughout ("an elemental tincture," "witnessed by a curve than blade"), matching the alchemical premise. Psychic distance remains stable in first-person singular with clean focalization. However, diction at peak beats ("scientifically romantic," "palette of resolve") risks slight register drift into prompt-echo phrasing. Perceptual signature is distinct but occasionally ornamental rather than pressure-driven.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense ("juniper and doubt," "eclipse shadow," "moths that have learned metallurgy") and occasionally stacks without pattern-teaching, risking overwriting in high-pressure beats. Paraphrase loops appear: "We do not kiss; we calibrate" followed by "observation is devotion" restates stance without advancing pressure. Template stems recur ("We circle," "We hold," "We place") in the final third. Clarity remains intact but momentum suffers under decorative weight.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The alchemical frame and nautilus-curl mechanics offer fresh specificity; the closing "returning differently" transforms the dare into a relational practice. However, the core arc—friends conduct a ritual that validates their bond—remains somewhat familiar. The lyric mode and technical vocabulary (logarithm, capillary time, sympathetic angles) elevate texture, but the emotional throughline does not risk genuine friction or a non-obvious moral calculus that would push originality higher.</comment>
