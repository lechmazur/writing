<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The net-mender philosopher maintains consistent interiority through embodied perception—"fingers mapping hidden patterns," grief "coaxed into spirals"—and micro-choices that reveal values (giving the whisk to the watching child). Internal contradiction appears when demure audacity drives the public demonstration despite town skepticism. The councilor's arc from dismissal to participation is earned through witnessed specificity rather than assertion, though his transformation accelerates quickly in the final third. Minor therapy-speak intrusion: "teach me the trick of seeing" reads slightly diagnostic but remains anchored in concrete tea-foam observation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly by line 3 (who, where, when). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through fireflies, whisk-foam patterns, and the gathering crowd, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the councilor removes his sash to dry stones and others follow—a crystallized stance-shift with visible relational cost (status gesture) that forecloses the old dismissive posture. The tightening is earned through the whisk demonstration → whistle echo → collective naming of hidden laborers, each beat reweighting the dominant stake (appreciating invisible effort). One persistent constraint (wet parapet, night timing) shapes the demonstration's form and the final collective act. Cost is legible on-page: the councilor's sash repurposed, the crowd's shift from spectators to participants.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The whispering parapet supplies the stage and constraint: wet stones guide the demonstration's choreography, runoff and lichen become teaching tools, and the parapet's breathing/humming response charges the ending. The bamboo whisk functions as micro-setting (tool-as-constraint), enabling the tea-foam galaxy that makes hidden effort visible. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through the philosopher's attention: "laundry wounds bandaged to creaking lines," "fireflies lift and settle, a scintillatingly somber choir with lantern throats." Spatial choreography remains coherent as the crowd rearranges and individuals squat to trace moss. The recurring moon-path motif anchors movement across the district without catalog excess. Minor issue: "demure audacity" as descriptor leans slightly toward label rather than fully embodied contradiction, though actions (sitting presuming the night will listen, offering silence as spectacle) dramatize it adequately.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—appreciating hidden effort before it vanishes—is signaled early and drives all moves. Escalation under the Accumulative lens: whisk demonstration → whistle revealing wet places → pouring tea for named invisible laborers → councilor's sash gesture that catalyzes collective participation. One meaningful tightening occurs when the crowd shifts from passive observation to active wiping of moss, foreclosing the prior dismissive stance. Agency is distributed but coherent: the philosopher's choices (whistling, holding the bowl under lantern light, asking the crowd to name laborers) narrow options and the councilor's unexpected participation locks the turn. Cost is visible: the councilor sacrifices status by using his sash as a cleaning rag, others abandon observer safety to engage physically with the stones. Minor limitation: the turn happens swiftly in the final quarter without significant friction or setback before acceptance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—invisible labor and the quiet dignity of sustaining effort—emerges through tea-foam patterns, net-mending metaphor, the story of neighbors weaving rope by moonlight, and the crowd's naming of unseen workers (night sweeper, hinge-oiler, rooftop beekeeper). The whisk becomes the thematic engine: "whisking teaches wrists to endure repetition without losing tenderness" integrates craft humility with relational ethics. The final image—child cradling the whisk "like a crab rescued from a bucket"—offers a non-literal answer to how gratitude perpetuates care without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the councilor's "almost smiling despite himself" and the crowd's silent rearrangement "like tidewrack." One risk: "courage often appears scintillatingly somber, like lightning seen from offshore" edges toward aphorism but remains grounded in the firefly imagery and the overall tonal coherence. No overt thesis; meaning accrues through enacted particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV distance is stable third-limited, tracking the philosopher's perceptual signature: "laundry wounds," "pocket lighthouse," "demure audacity" establish idiosyncratic diction. Dialogue ("You brought us to watch puddles"; "Keep it, and use it to learn the rhythm of gratitude") feels natural and goal-driven, advancing both plot and the philosopher's pedagogical stance. Perceptual hierarchy reflects craft bias: the net's "each knot remembers a hand" and the whisk's tines "splayed like a sea urchin" reveal occupational lens. Minor register drift: "scintillatingly somber" and "demure audacity" push vocabulary slightly beyond earned voice, though they remain consistent with the philosopher's lyric internal register. No head-hopping; focalization clean throughout. Purposeful compression in the final third (dawn "lurched closer, drunk on our attention") heightens closure without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully: short declaratives ("I nod, and the fireflies nod with me") alternate with longer accumulative sentences. Information density is high; most lines advance image, character, or thematic pressure. Minor loop artifacts: "scintillatingly somber" appears twice (fireflies, courage analogy), and "moon paths" recurs without added function in the second mention. Template cadence surfaces briefly in the middle third: "They lead me… They guide me… Everywhere, hands…" runs three consecutive parallel stems. Figurative density is high but mostly coherent; one mixed vehicle: "storms inside cups" pairs storm (chaos) with foam (ephemeral pattern) without clarifying whether the whisk creates or calms. Strong verbs and specific nouns dominate: "lurched," "mustering courage," "combing our hair with green combs." No grammar errors; tense stable. Overall propulsion maintained despite modest decorative accumulation in descriptive beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—philosopher-as-net-mender demonstrating invisible labor through tea ceremony on a wet parapet—is specific and non-obvious. The whisk-as-teaching-tool and the whistle-as-acoustic-mapping device transform familiar contemplation-of-craft tropes into enacted public pedagogy with legible stakes. Emotional specificity avoids templates: the mother's death memory ("coaxing grief into spirals") roots the whisk's significance in lived loss rather than abstract wisdom. The councilor's sash gesture and the crowd's moss-tracing feel inevitable in hindsight, grown from the philosopher's patient demonstration. Minor derivative note: the wise-outsider-teaches-community frame is a common template, though the piece individualizes it through the philosopher's occupation, the specific method (tea foam, acoustic whistle), and the collaborative rather than hierarchical resolution. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure and lyric diction elevates without obscuring clarity. The piece commits fully to its premise of making the invisible visible through small, deliberate acts.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Net-mender philosopher appears throughout: mending nets in opening, traveling moon paths, staging the demonstration, whistling to reveal lichen, pouring tea, holding bowl under lantern, asking crowd to name laborers, giving whisk to child. Choices drive turns: the demonstration invitation, the whistle that redirects attention, the request to name hidden workers, the gift of the whisk. Agency shapes escalation and closure. Present in all three gates (setup, middle choices, ending act). Causal pressure evident: without this character's decisions, no crowd gathering, no councilor turn, no collective moss-tracing. Slight swappability concern: another contemplative teacher could fill the role with adjustments, though the net-mending/tea-whisking dual craft anchors specificity. Cost tied to character: risking public dismissal, investing night travel and preparation, surrendering the whisk (mother's gift).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Bamboo tea whisk introduced early ("beside me rests"), returns in mother's-death memory (middle reflection), used in the demonstration (spinning, painting galaxies, revealing roads on froth), fireflies drift into its nebula, and finally given to child in closing beat. Handles four distinct beats: initial anchor, backstory anchor, active demonstration (two moves: spinning and light-reveal), closure gift. Causal role: enables the foam-pattern teaching that persuades the crowd; its gift enacts the theme of passing care forward. Specificity high: "tines splayed like a sea urchin," "hummingbird trapped in duty," "pocket lighthouse." Strong irreplaceability: the whisk's unique form (many tines, spiral motion) matters to the metaphor of patience and pattern. Cost linked: surrendering the object tied to mother's memory. All three gates met; multiple beats; closure linkage strong.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Hidden patterns is the core concept: "fingers mapping hidden patterns in wet cord," tea-foam patterns that teach visibility of effort, whistle revealing hidden wet places, initials of unknown guardians traced in moss, neighbors weaving rope by moonlight with no thanks. Shapes stakes: the philosopher's motive is to reveal what others overlook before it vanishes. Tactics: the demonstration method (whisk, whistle, naming) all aim to make hidden work legible. Present in setup (opening net-mending), middle (fisher story, whistle echo), and ending (patterns blur then muster courage, crowd tracing moss). Closure participation: "patterns blur, then gather themselves as if mustering courage" directly precedes the crowd's shift. Slight abstraction risk: concept discussed more than it mechanically constrains on-page choices (the whistle works whether or not "hidden patterns" is named). Cost connection moderate: revealing patterns costs public vulnerability and the whisk, but the concept itself doesn't impose a unique cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Scintillatingly somber" appears twice: describing fireflies ("a scintillatingly somber choir") and courage analogy ("courage often appears scintillatingly somber, like lightning seen from offshore"). Functions as tonal anchor and thematic marker (beauty coexisting with gravity). Constrains choices moderately: the philosopher's method eschews fireworks for quiet spectacle, consistent with somber audacity. Present in setup (firefly description), middle (courage reflection), and implicitly in ending tone (collective moss-tracing without applause). Cost: choosing a subdued demonstration risks dismissal (councilor's "fireworks would have drawn a bigger crowd"). Swappability concern: near-synonyms like "quietly luminous" or "gravely radiant" could substitute with minor edits. Label-only in one use (courage line reads explanatory rather than enacted). Elevates atmosphere but doesn't mechanically drive a turn.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Whistle appears in three beats: initial offer ("I answer with a whistle that skims the parapet and returns shyly"), the echo reveals wet lichen-softened places (turning councilor's attention), and second softer whistle that draws fireflies into the bowl's nebula (enabling the light-roads reveal). Drives two turns: (1) acoustic revelation shifts councilor from dismissal to attention, (2) firefly attraction charges the bowl demonstration. Causal necessity high: without the whistle, no concrete proof of the parapet's hidden softness, no auditory metaphor for invisible care. Setup present (philosopher's answer to councilor), middle development (echo teaching), closure linkage (softer whistle draws fireflies into climactic image). Specificity: the whistle's acoustic function (revealing lichen through echo) is unique to this action. Cost: small but present—whistling is a vulnerable, playful act that risks ridicule. Strong integration across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"By following moon paths" introduced early: "I travel at night by following moon paths across the district. The wet stones shine in channels, silver maps that favor small feet." Guides the philosopher's nocturnal movement to gather stories and supplies (tea, knowledge of hidden laborers). Shapes middle beat: the moon paths enable discovery of masons' carvings, equations in wood grain, the laundry and shuttered stalls. Present in setup (travel description) and referenced in closure when the philosopher recounts the fisher-neighbors story (implying moon-path-enabled knowledge gathering). Swappability: "by following lamplight" or "by memorized routes" could replace with minor edits. Closure participation weak: moon paths aren't invoked in the final image or the crowd's moss-tracing. Cost connection: night travel requires effort and solitude, but the specific method (moon-reflected wet stones) doesn't impose unique constraints at the demonstration. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Whispering parapet after rain is the demonstration stage: wet stones supply the whistle-echo teaching, runoff and gutters are watched ("we watch the parapet breathe, gutters swallow"), lichen softness revealed by echo, moss traced by crowd, and the parapet stops whispering to hum (pleased by service). Shapes choices: the philosopher selects this location for its acoustic and visual properties (water threads, lichen, wet shine), enabling the specific lessons. Present in all gates: setup (opening anchor), middle (whistle echo, water observation), ending (parapet's hum, crowd drying stones and tracing initials). Causal pressure high: without the wet parapet's specific features (acoustic echo, visible runoff, moss to trace), the demonstration's methods fail. Irreplaceability strong: the setting's wetness, whispering/humming, and lichen are integral to the pedagogy. Cost: nighttime, post-rain timing constrains when the demonstration can occur and requires the crowd to gather in less comfortable conditions.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Firefly season anchors the timeframe: fireflies appear in opening ("firefly season"), lift and settle as "scintillatingly somber choir," drift into the bowl's nebula to reveal froth-roads, and "comb our hair with green combs" during the collective reflection. Enables the light-as-teaching-tool: without fireflies, the bowl's froth-roads remain unilluminated. Present in setup (seasonal anchor), middle (choir description), and ending (hair-combing, nebula). Closure linkage moderate: fireflies participate in the bowl reveal but aren't causally necessary to the councilor's turn or the moss-tracing. Swappability concern: lanterns or moon could illuminate the bowl; fireflies add beauty and thematic resonance (small, quiet lights = invisible laborers) but don't mechanically constrain. Time pressure absent: firefly season is a weeks-long window, not a ticking clock that alters tactics. Functional atmospheric element with thematic echo but limited causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Motivation "to appreciate hidden effort before it disappears" is explicit: "My motive is simple: to appreciate hidden effort before it disappears." Drives all choices: traveling at night to observe unseen work, staging the demonstration, telling the fisher-neighbors story, asking crowd to name invisible laborers, pouring tea for "each ghost of labor." Dramatized through actions (net-mending, whisk demonstration, moss-tracing invitation) rather than told-only. Friction present: town wanted fireworks, councilor dismisses puddles initially, risking public failure. Cost: the philosopher invests solitary night travel, surrenders the mother's whisk, and accepts potential ridicule. Present in all gates: setup (stated motive, night travel), middle (fisher story, naming exercise), ending (collective moss-tracing, whisk gift that perpetuates gratitude). Closure linkage strong: the crowd's shift from spectators to participants fulfills the motive with visible cost (status, effort, vulnerability). Specificity high: this exact desire shapes the method (quiet demonstration vs. fireworks).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Demure audacity" is explicit: "I sit with demure audacity, presuming the night will listen." Tone coheres through quiet boldness—offering silence and puddles as spectacle, whistling to teach the councilor, holding the bowl "long enough for patterns to settle" despite crowd impatience. Modulates under pressure: initial presumption, councilor's skepticism ("almost smiling despite himself"), crowd's tentative participation, and final collective humility (no clapping, "because clapping breaks things"). Charges the ending: "demure audacity" is enacted when the child receives the whisk with a bow and the philosopher's instruction emphasizes patient rhythm over display. Present across all beats but label-dependent: the phrase itself is stated once; the rest is inferred from action. Swappability: "quiet confidence" or "humble boldness" could substitute. Cost linkage: the tone risks dismissal and requires the philosopher to endure skepticism without spectacle. Coherent but relies on reader inference more than mechanically distinct tonal constraint.</comment>
