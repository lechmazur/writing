<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>The alchemist's interiority is vivid and image-driven ("fingers inked and singed," "frost traced his eyelashes"), with patience embodied through posture and breath-matching. The sister backstory functions as emotional anchor but risks sentiment; the memory motivates waiting without forcing a present micro-choice that alters tactics. Internal contradiction is absent—he demonstrates singular resolve without competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final act (fitting the plate, sealing with flash-paper) reads as decision but lacks visible cost or renunciation that forecloses a path on the page.</comment>

<comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a situational frame—pressure accrues through image density and pattern-building (orchard → plate → ampoule → lake fissure) until the final sealing reconfigures the world's stasis into guided breath. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph (alchemist, subarctic crater orchard, post-silence epoch). Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): the fitted plate and unsealed fissure allow the aurora to step and hearts to beat into guiding lines, reweighting the prior stillness with conceptual cost (the world can move again, but only along translated routes). One visible causal tightening: the closed-eye bark responds to starlight, validating his method and narrowing the path to the lake center. Cost is conceptual and environmental rather than personal—legible but oblique.</comment>

<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The orchard (branches like ribs, frost-traced trunks, closed-eye bark scar) and the glassed-ash lake constrain the alchemist's navigation and listening method. Sensory detail is dense and POV-filtered: "sap frozen mid-throb," "steam trapped under ice like breath under a sleeping child's quilt," "fissure breathing faint warm air." Spatial choreography tracks clearly from orchard interior → tree with scar → orchard lip → lake center. The closed-eye bark and the breathing fissure both serve as micro-settings that charge the final act: he must find the warmth source to unseal the world's breath. The ampoule and plate function as portable anchors; the bottle-glass crumbs mark a navigable trail, fulfilling the stake's demand for a route others can follow.</comment>

<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake signaled early: translate heartbeats into a followable map so people can leave the silenced world. One meaningful tightening occurs when starlight touches the ladders and shadows bend toward the closed-eye bark, validating his method and narrowing the search to one trunk and then the lake fissure. The alchemist's agency drives the escalation—kneeling, listening, unsealing starlight, arranging discarded items, fitting the plate—but the final act (sealing the fissure seam with flash-paper) resolves by teaching breath to travel rather than forcing a trade-off or visible personal cost. Pressure is coherent under the accumulative lens; the cost is environmental (the world exhales, aurora moves) but the protagonist's renunciation or price is not dramatized on the page.</comment>

<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from image and action: translation of the invisible (heartbeats, trapped breath) into the navigable (maps, lines, routes), with patience and listening as the method that allows stasis to transform into motion. The sister memory ("promising to bring down a comet if only he would wait") seeds the waiting motif and returns implicitly in the final patience, creating a quiet reprise without overt statement. The closed-eye bark and the breathing fissure function as non-literal answers to the central question (how to guide the living without breaking), avoiding sermon. The ampoule's "safekept starlight" and the "world holds its breath" frame risk abstractness but remain grounded in the physical acts of unsealing, listening, and sealing. Subtext operates in gesture (bottle-glass crumbs as emerald trail, flash-paper as fast handwriting) and the final exhale reconfigures prior stillness without a stated moral.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>POV is stable third-limited with close psychic distance; perceptual signature is evident in image-dense diction ("milk-pale and humming like a moth," "wolves trembled to a rhythm he could count"). Register occasionally drifts into elevated lyricism ("canvas of errands, which was the ground itself," "tongues of aurora hung but did not move") that risks decorative abstraction rather than character-specific idiom—acceptable for a stylized narrator but not distinctly the alchemist's working lexicon. No dialogue; interiority is present but sparse, relying on action and image rather than articulated thought. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, though several long sentences stack modifiers without tonal modulation. The piece teaches its lyric compression early and holds it; non-standard punctuation (comma splices in service of flow) reads voice-motivated and legible.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Figurative density is high throughout ("branches like ribs," "sap frozen mid-throb," "steam trapped under ice like breath under a sleeping child's quilt," "emerald crumbs in a white mouth that would not swallow"), approaching overwriting in several beats where metaphor appears in most consecutive sentences without clear pattern payoff. Mixed metaphor check: "canvas of errands, which was the ground itself" reads strained; "orchard's hearts beat into lines" mixes anatomical and cartographic vehicles without clear coherence. Sentence openings vary; information density is strong, with most lines advancing image or action. Loop check: "He had waited then, and he waited now, demonstrating patience physically again" is a near-paraphrase of the earlier patience demonstration, applying −0.2. Template cadence is avoided. No major scaffold or pronoun drift, but the lyricism occasionally prioritizes texture over propulsion, slowing momentum in the middle third (plate listening, ampoule unsealing) where a single tightening image could replace two.</comment>

<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>The premise—translating heartbeats beneath a frozen world into maps for the living—offers a fresh synthesis of post-catastrophe navigation and somatic cartography, avoiding stock apocalypse tropes. The flash-paper alchemist role, the illustration-plate listening dish, and the safekept starlight ampoule combine into a coherent, non-obvious toolkit. Emotional specificity (the sister's comet-promise, the patient waiting, the sealed breath) anchors the fantastical premise in human detail. The transformation test: plot and arc would not survive renaming the orchard and alchemist, confirming originality of synthesis. Risk-taking in structure (accumulative lyric mode, high metaphor density) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, though some images skirt decorative abstraction. No close echoes of famous lines detected; the piece commits fully to its premise and follows its implications to the unsealing without retreat.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Present early (paragraph 2); drives at least three beats (listening at bark, unsealing starlight, fitting plate over fissure, sealing with flash-paper). Causal role: his choices narrow the search (trunk → lake → fissure) and enable the closure (teaching breath to travel). Ending participation: he steps back and the world exhales because of his fitted plate and sealed seam. Irreplaceability: high; the story hinges on his patience, listening method, and translation skill. Cost visible: he waited with baskets before, waits now with frost on eyelashes, and the final stepping-back forecloses active intervention—his role is complete.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Signaled early (paragraph 6); used in three distinct beats: laid against trunk as listening dish (paragraph 9), laid with starlight to braid pulse into lines (paragraph 16), pressed into frost to lift a glitter-breath map (paragraph 18), fitted over fissure (paragraph 24), and edged with flash-paper to seal (paragraph 25). Each use evolves: from passive receptor to active map-lifter to structural seal. Closure linkage strong: the fitted plate allows the fissure's breath to rise through etched roads. Irreplaceability high: the etched wolves and road are unique properties that shape the map's legend and the final sealing. Visible cost: the plate's cold chills his cheek, and fitting it over the fissure commits the last resource.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Present early (paragraph 5); used twice: unsealed to leak starlight across the plate (paragraph 13) and sealed again to save light for return (paragraph 17). Causal role: the starlight braids with the pulse to lay navigable lines, enabling the map. Closure participation indirect: the map it helped create guides him to the fissure, but the ampoule itself does not appear in the final act. Specificity moderate: "milk-pale and humming like a moth" is vivid, but the mechanics of how starlight translates heartbeats remain abstract. Cost visible: he risks wasting it and pinches it shut to conserve, but the tradeoff does not directly shape the ending.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Present early (paragraph 4: "sitting so still that frost traced his eyelashes") and reprised (paragraph 16: "demonstrating patience physically again by lowering his hands to his knees and letting his shoulders soften"). Constraint on action: his stillness allows him to match breath with roots and hear the hush-boom beneath bark. Cost visible: frost on eyelashes, bones crackling when he rises. Middle beat: the shoulder-softening loosens the orchard's ribs, implying his patience unlocks the sound. Closure linkage weak: patience enables listening but does not directly shape the final sealing image. Irreplaceability moderate: trait is specific but could be swapped for "focus" or "stillness" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Appears in three beats: sealing the ampoule after starlight use (paragraph 17), sealing the plate edges with flash-paper (paragraph 25), and the final result ("sealed the seam, not to smother, but to teach the breath to travel"). Major turn: the final sealing enables the lake to exhale and the aurora to move, directly shaping closure. Causal role strong: without the seal, the fissure's breath would not rise through the etched roads. Irreplaceability high: the action's double meaning (closing and teaching) is specific to the story's logic. Cost legible: he uses his last flash-paper and commits the plate, foreclosing retrieval. Introduced mid-story as method, not early setup, applying small late penalty.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Signaled early (paragraph 7: "creating patterns with discarded items"); executed with specifics (cracked ladders, wire loops, seed labels, bottle-glass). Used in three beats: arranging around orchard (paragraph 7), setting wire loops that starlight validates (paragraph 13–14, 16), dropping bottle-glass as trail markers (paragraph 20). Causal role: the arranged arcs and ladders ring when starlight touches, confirming the map's direction. Closure linkage indirect: the patterns guide him to the lake and mark the route for others, but the final sealing does not rely on new pattern-making. Irreplaceability moderate: the method is thematically apt (discarded → repurposed) but mechanically the patterns could be swapped for other navigation aids. Cost minimal: the items are found, not sacrificed.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Present from opening line; anchors all action. Constrains choices: the frozen sap and ribs-like branches force him to listen beneath bark; the crater's cold demands patience and embodied stillness. The closed-eye bark scar (paragraph 15) is micro-setting that drives a key beat (the sound emerges from it). Orchard ends at glassed-ash lip, leading to the lake—setting structures the journey and escalation. Closure linkage: the orchard's hearts beat into lines that guide home, directly shaping the final image. Irreplaceability high: subarctic crater and withered orchard are unique to the story's logic (post-silence world, frozen mid-throb). Cost visible: the environment's hostility (frost, bones crackling) taxes his body.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Signaled early (opening line, paragraph 11: "world held its breath," "aurora hung but did not move"). Functions as metaphoric and literal constraint: no compass works, people cannot wander, he must translate heartbeats. Timeframe tightens implicitly: the world waits, and his task is urgent (he saves starlight for return, marks a trail for others). Closure payoff: "the lake exhaled, the aurora took a patient step," inverting the held-breath state. Cost legible: the stasis forces his method and the stakes (guide or remain trapped). Irreplaceability moderate: the held-breath frame is thematically resonant but mechanically the urgency could be stated via other time pressure. Development weak: the timeframe does not narrow options in middle beats beyond establishing the premise.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Stated early (paragraph 3: "to translate heartbeats into maps, to listen beneath bark and basalt for a route the living could keep without breaking"). Dramatized through action: kneeling, listening, unsealing starlight, arranging patterns, fitting plate. Desire is coherent and drives all beats. Friction moderate: the sister memory adds emotional weight (he waited before, waits now) but does not create on-page conflict between want and cost—his resolve is uncontested. Closure linkage strong: his final act (sealing the fissure) fulfills the motivation by teaching breath to travel and guiding others home. Irreplaceability high: the motivation is specific to the story's fantastical logic. Cost visible: his body suffers (frost, crackling bones), but the internal price (e.g., renouncing return, risking failure) is not dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Signaled opening line ("the air practiced a moving stillness"); sustained through diction ("hush," "hush-boom," "held its breath," "patient step," "letting his shoulders soften until the ribs of the orchard loosened"). Tone modulates subtly: stillness in orchard beats, faint motion when starlight touches, exhale and aurora step at closure. Coherent through turns: the oxymoron (moving stillness) mirrors the story's premise (frozen world learning to breathe again). Charges final image: the aurora's "patient step" and orchard hearts beating into guiding lines fulfill the tone's promise of motion within stasis. Irreplaceability high: the tone is integral to theme and the accumulative lens. Cost implicit: the tone's restraint forecloses dramatic confrontation, demanding patience from reader and character alike.</comment>
