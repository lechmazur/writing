<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The custodian's interiority is concrete and voice-particular, with embodied perception through retrocognition and the shard of hush. The arrival of Lio introduces relationship pressure, and the shared labor on the beacon feels earned. However, the protagonist's emotional arc remains somewhat externalized—we see actions and perceptions but limited internal contradiction or competing impulses under pressure. The final choice to remain custodian and the tears over his mother's pencil scratch land with warmth but feel more thematic than a character crucible with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational accents. The piece accumulates layered particulars (star paths, prism, shard, Lio's map) toward a tightening at the repair and rekindling that reweights the opening isolation into communal belonging. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise leaning toward Earned Stasis)—the protagonist remains custodian, the pavilion "sang us forward," and the cost is oblique but present in "the silence between hums I heard purpose click into place." Orientation is clean by the second paragraph. The accumulation is purposeful, though the final third leans toward summary ("By morning the dunes shook with feet") rather than a single decisive image, softening the charge.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The glass humming pavilion is vivid and functional: its ribs, fused silica, and acoustic properties constrain the custodian's work and enable the beacon's rekindling. The shard of hush, the broken prism, mirrors, and star-path etchings all pressure the solution. Micro-setting (the shard trimmed with heated wire, phosphor poured into the lantern cup) charges key beats. The dunes, saltlands, and post-collapse atmosphere anchor tone and time. The pavilion's "diary" and retrocognitive memory provide a lyric frame that recurs at closure ("the pavilion was writing us back into its diary"), meeting the 9+ gate for constraint and charged reprise.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: rekindle the beacon to call lives from the saltlands and prove coincidences have meaning. The custodian's agency drives pressure—tracking star paths, adjusting mirrors, recognizing the shard's role. Lio's arrival tightens the problem (matching star map, missing constellation), and the repair sequence escalates through tactile struggle ("trimmed the shard with heated wire, listening to its mute cries"). The resolution is earned by their joint work, and the campfires answering the beam show visible consequence. Cost is present but muted: the protagonist remains in role, and the ending tilts toward communal uplift rather than a hard trade-off or foreclosed path, keeping this mid-7s under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—coincidence as choreography, meaning stitched from particulars—emerges organically through the star-path match, Lio's scars timed to the ancestor's etching, and the pavilion's retrocognitive memory. The final image ("the sound that coincidences make when meaning opens") reprices the opening question without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the shard of hush, the beam that "exhaled like a sleeper releasing a dream," and the beam's "soft fluting" as grammar of belonging. The piece resists tidy closure, offering Charged Poise over resolution. Minor drift: the ending's "we rekindled the grammar of belonging" edges toward thematic summary, though it grows from prior particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person, with a distinct perceptual signature: "retrocognitively blessed," "scenes like dew suspended on spider silk," "winds that sounded like scissors being cleaned." Diction is elevated and lyric, mostly consistent with the custodian's contemplative voice. Lio's brief dialogue ("his scars were from a childhood fall") reads more as compressed backstory than dramatized speech, limiting voice distinction. Distance control is clean, with no head-hopping. Register remains high throughout, even under pressure (e.g., "trimmed the shard with heated wire, listening to its mute cries"), which is voice-motivated but risks flattening urgency. Purposeful compression and metaphor density are taught early and sustained, meeting experimental tolerance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm is lyric and controlled, with varied sentence structure and high information density. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("prayer-soldered struts," "misted geometry," "thistle-blown hope"). However, several beats approach overwriting: "dew suspended on spider silk," "winds that sounded like scissors being cleaned," and "the sound that coincidences make when meaning opens" stack metaphor without clear tactical need. Template stems recur ("I was," "I saw," "I told," "We trimmed," "We taught") across multiple beats, creating mild cadence drag. The final paragraph summarizes rather than dramatizes the communal arrival ("By morning the dunes shook with feet"), softening propulsion. No loops or causality breaks, but figurative density in peak beats triggers −0.4.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of retrocognition, the shard of hush, star-path etchings, and the glass pavilion feels specific and non-obvious. The realization that silence must be set into the prism's crack to "give the light a seam of silence to travel" is earned and fresh. The collapse-world frame and the pavilion's acoustic architecture avoid generic post-apocalypse tropes. Emotional specificity (Lio's tears, the custodian's insistence on coincidence-as-stitch) anchors the lyric register. Minor swappability: the traveler's role and the star-map match lean on familiar lonely-beacon-meets-ally structure, though the details transform it. Risk-taking in sustained metaphor and accumulative closure elevates within band (+0.3).</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The custodian drives all major beats: tracking star paths, tuning mirrors, cupping the shard to sharpen retrocognition, recognizing the shard's role in the prism, trimming and installing it, and rekindling the beacon. The character's choices create the central turn (repair) and the closure (remaining custodian, teaching others). Early signal, three+ beats, causal pressure, and closure linkage all present. Cost is oblique but present in "the silence between hums I heard purpose click into place." High integration.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The broken prism is introduced early ("The beacon's heart was a broken crystal prism"), pressures all repair attempts ("scattered every answer into contradictions, fracturing beams into useless misted geometry"), and is causally resolved when the shard is set into its crack. It appears in three+ beats and directly shapes the closure (the beam exhales when the prism is repaired). The specific gap and the shard's fit are irreplaceable. High causal pressure and closure linkage; indispensable to the ending.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The shard of hush is introduced early, used to sharpen retrocognition, and becomes the solution when its "stilled core" reveals the fallen constellation and is set into the prism to "give the light a seam of silence to travel." It appears in three beats, constrains middle choices (cupping it to access memory), and is causally essential at closure (trimming and installing it). The concept is irreplaceable—swapping "shard of hush" for another material would break the story's logic. High integration; specific cost tied to its use (heated wire, "mute cries").</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Retrocognition is signaled early ("retrocognitively blessed") and used in two beats: hearing "yesterday breathing from the panes" and, within the shard's hush, seeing the fallen constellation. It enables the custodian's recognition of the solution and charges the final image ("the pavilion was writing us back into its diary"). However, it does not constrain a choice with visible cost—it functions as perceptual access rather than a trait with trade-offs. Early signal, two beats, closure linkage present; causal pressure and cost are weaker. Mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rekindling is the central action, framing the entire narrative. The custodian's goal is stated early ("I planned to rekindle the beacon"), all middle beats serve it (tracking paths, tuning ribs, adjusting mirrors, repairing the prism), and the climax dramatizes it ("turned the wheel to rekindle the long-dark throat"). The beam's rekindling triggers the communal response (campfires, arrivals) and the closure image. Irreplaceable; removing this action collapses the story's logic and stakes. Early signal, three+ beats, high causal pressure, closure indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Tracking star paths is signaled early ("by tracking star paths scratched into the pavilion's underside"), used in middle beats ("by day I charted where the sun sneaked through cracks to teach angles," "aligned the mirrors by tracking star paths"), and returns at closure ("Each evening we recalculated by tracking star paths anew"). The method is specific and causally necessary (Lio's star map matches the etchings, enabling the repair). Three beats, causal pressure, and closure linkage. The method could be replaced with another navigation technique with edits, limiting irreplaceability slightly, but it is tightly woven.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The glass humming pavilion is introduced in the opening line, provides the acoustic and spatial frame for all action (ribs to tune, mirrors to adjust, underside etchings, lantern cup), and returns at closure ("the pavilion sang us forward"). It supplies resources (the structure's hum, the star-path etchings) and pressures choices (tuning, alignment). The setting is irreplaceable—removing it would break the story's mechanics and tone. Early signal, three+ beats, high causal pressure, closure charge. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The timeframe is signaled in the opening line ("After the collapse of civilization") and establishes the post-apocalyptic context (no airships, ravaged saltlands, toppled pylons). It shapes the custodian's isolation and the beacon's significance. However, it does not tighten decisions within the narrative present—there is no live clock or deadline that alters tactics. The seven-week marker and "By morning" timestamp orient but do not pressure. Early signal, thematic presence, but weak tactical constraint. Mid-band; lyric resonance at closure ("a future that remembered our past") lifts slightly.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation is stated early ("to prove that coincidences have meaning") and drives the custodian's interpretive lens: the ancestor's etchings match the custodian's dreams, Lio's map matches the etchings, and the dates align with the final track. It shapes the custodian's choices (insisting on the map, recognizing the shard's role) and is repriced at closure ("the sound that coincidences make when meaning opens," "coincidence as stitch"). Two+ beats, causal shaping, closure linkage. Cost is oblique (the protagonist's isolation, the faith required), not a visible trade-off, keeping this upper-mid-7s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The tone—melancholy hope laced with post-collapse fragility ("thistle-blown hope," "stories snipped by winds that sounded like scissors being cleaned")—is coherent and modulates with pressure. The opening is mournful, the middle gains warmth with Lio's arrival, and the ending exhales into communal uplift ("the pavilion sang us forward"). The tone charges the final image ("we stitched our shreds with thistle-blown hope"). However, the ending tilts toward declarative summary ("We rekindled more than light; we rekindled the grammar of belonging"), which flattens the tonal complexity slightly. Early signal, coherent across turns, closure linkage; mid-7s for modulation and charge.</comment>
