<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The archivist POV carries a distinct perceptual signature ("subtle puzzle archivist, perceptively calm") but interiority remains mostly performance rather than contradiction under pressure. The final choice—leaving the corridor outdoors—is consistent but feels predetermined rather than fought for. Embodied emotion is present ("hands stay perceptively calm, not to hide my own tremble") yet the narrator's own stake never crystallizes into a micro-choice with visible cost. Secondary characters (mayor, fisherman, seamstress, child) apply immediate pressure and the collective healing shapes the stakes, but the protagonist observes and guides without personal risk on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure—the piece builds density through the ritual, then deepens via the mirror reveal and the corridor walk. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the town moves from "too many years of sirens and layoffs" to "breathing with a less fractured chest," and the map case "weighs more than paper, as if it has swallowed a small future." Orientation anchors (archivist, lavender field, factory ruins, dove gray map case) land cleanly in the first ~10% and the causal chain is legible. One meaningful deepening occurs when the mirror layer is revealed and the circle laughs, reweighting grief into collective agency. Cost is felt (the corridor left outdoors to weather, the mayor's fidgeting replaced by a joke) but remains somewhat oblique—no decisive path is visibly foreclosed on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The lavender field and factory ruins form a charged micro-setting that guides the ritual's spatial choreography: bees, diesel ghosts, and factory ribs anchor the tactile world. The dove gray map case with its mirror bottom functions as a recurring object that charges the closure. Sensory hierarchy is selective and filtered through the archivist's professional lens ("wind smelled like old engines and moonlight"). One constraint check: the corridor placement along field rows alters the town's collective walk, so the setting constrains choice and charges the final image, qualifying for higher bands.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: collective healing after "too many years of sirens and layoffs." One meaningful tightening occurs when the archivist asks for "one moment when the factory breathed for them," narrowing the town's options from abstract grief to specific memory. The mirror reveal ("the bottom is a mirror, so every person sees their face tangled with ribbon and light") deepens pressure and the circle's laughter signals a micro-turn toward agency. The final ask—"a word each, not about loss, but about what the town could give a stranger tomorrow"—reweights the ritual with felt cost (bread, patience, blue, sparks, lavender, room). Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, but the archivist's personal stake never forces a trade-off on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme (collective grief transmuted into shared agency) emerges through concrete particulars: ribbon, twine, photographs, the mirror layer, and the lavender corridor. The final image—"some maps are meant to stay outdoors, weathered into kindness by bees and seasons"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and image: the mayor's hat-wringing, the fisherman's winter steam, the seamstress's lavender sprigs. One strong moment: "humor is the hallway where fear forgets its shoes and wanders outside to feel the grass" lifts into essayistic register but earns its place by anchoring the mayor's joke and the circle's shift.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature ("I am a subtle puzzle archivist"). Voice carries a lyric, essayistic texture ("wind smelled like old engines and moonlight, a ridiculous pairing") that modulates consistently across beats. Dialogue is sparse but functional: the mayor's question, the town's stories, and the final word-list all advance the ritual. One register slip: "transmute pain into a masterpiece" and "humor is the hallway where fear forgets its shoes" lift into aphoristic diction that risks breaking immersion, though the former is plot-integrated. Free indirect access to the circle's collective interiority ("relief often sounds like a bell testing its own metal") reads as the archivist's framing rather than head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies across beats with purposeful compression ("We test the route by placing the photographs along the field rows") and lyric expansion ("as vines climb the factory walls, as vines climb the fences, as vines climb the old ideas"). Clarity holds but sentence openings show modest stem repetition: "I said," "I asked," "I note," "I slide." One paraphrase loop: the vines-climb refrain recurs without added pressure mid-scene. Figurative density ("wind smelled like old engines and moonlight," "stories need coaxing through gentle patterns") elevates texture but risks overwriting in a few beats ("relief often sounds like a bell testing its own metal"). Information density is high; most lines do two jobs, though the essayistic turns occasionally abstract away from scene immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise—a puzzle archivist charting collective grief via photographs, ribbon, and a mirrored map case—synthesizes occupational specificity with lyric ritual in a fresh combination. The lavender field / factory ruins juxtaposition and the "map that could guide collective healing" transform the grief-work template through concrete, grounded choices. One risk: the tone walks the line between earnest whimsy and sentimentality but commits fully to its lyric stance. The mirror reveal and the corridor left outdoors to weather are specific, non-obvious turns that feel inevitable in hindsight. Transformation test passes: plot and arc depend on this exact archivist, this map case, and this town's particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The archivist is present throughout and drives the ritual design: asks the circle to share stories, laces photographs with twine and ribbon, reveals the mirror layer, and teaches the town to walk the corridor. Setup by first paragraph, middle development in the mirror reveal and corridor test, and closure participation when the archivist leaves the corridor outdoors and walks among the ruins. Two distinct beats (mirror reveal, final instruction) and some causal pressure (the archivist's method narrows the town's grief to actionable ritual). Specificity is high ("subtle puzzle archivist, perceptively calm") but swappability moderate—another facilitator with similar methods could perform the role. Cost connection is oblique; the archivist's personal stake never forces a visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dove gray map case appears in the first paragraph, opens to reveal ribbon/twine/photographs in beat two, reveals its mirrored bottom in the middle ritual, and closes "now the case weighs more than paper, as if it has swallowed a small future" near the end. Three distinct beats with evolving use: container → toolbox → mirror → vessel of future. Causal pressure is present (the mirror layer forces the circle to see themselves entangled with memory) and closure linkage is strong (the case's new weight charges the ending). Specificity is high (dove gray, brass hasp, mirror bottom) and swappability is low—the mirror layer is irreplaceable. One friction: the case is carried but not actively handled on the page between opening and closing.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Collective healing is the dominant stake, signaled early ("chart their grief, to make a map that could guide collective healing") and shapes every tactic: the circle formation, story-sharing, photograph placement, mirror reveal, corridor walk, and final word-gift. Present in setup, middle development (the circle's laughter after seeing themselves in the mirror), and closure (the corridor left outdoors, the town "breathing with a less fractured chest"). Two to three distinct beats and moderate causal pressure (the concept narrows the town's options from abstract grief to shared ritual). Cost connection is felt but somewhat abstract—no single participant's path is visibly foreclosed. Swappability is moderate; "community rebuilding" or "grief work" could substitute with edits.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Perceptively calm is introduced as a character label in the third paragraph ("I am a subtle puzzle archivist, perceptively calm") and reinforced once mid-scene ("My hands stay perceptively calm, not to hide my own tremble, but to give their nerves a rhythm to borrow"). Setup present, one middle beat with modest causal work (the trait enables the town to borrow steadiness), but no closure participation. The trait does not constrain a choice or impose a visible cost—it remains primarily descriptive. Swappability is high; "steady," "composed," or "patient" could replace it. One positive: the aside "not to hide my own tremble" adds internal texture, but the tremble itself never complicates the archivist's actions.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Linger appears in the title of the archivist's role, recurs in "We linger among spools and frames," and closes the piece: "I linger at the gate and listen to the chorus of crickets and machines cooling." Setup by midpoint, middle development in the ritual's extended duration, and strong closure participation (the final linger reweights the archivist's method as patient witness rather than directive architect). Two distinct beats with thematic resonance. Causal pressure is modest—the action does not narrow options but deepens the ritual's texture. Specificity is moderate; "remain," "stay," or "dwell" could substitute with minor tonal loss. Cost connection is oblique; no path is foreclosed by lingering.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The method ("via arcs in black-and-white photographs") is signaled early ("I said I would begin via arcs in black-and-white photographs, because prints curve toward truths when they are bent in friendly hands") and executed across the middle beats: photographs are laced to stories with twine and ribbon, set along the curve of smoke and field border, and placed along the field rows to form the corridor. Setup by first quarter, middle development in the photograph placement and corridor test, and closure participation when the photographs are slid back into the case. Two to three distinct beats with moderate causal pressure (the method structures the ritual and enables the corridor walk). Specificity is high (black-and-white, arcs, bending) but the mechanics remain somewhat abstract—the reader does not see the physical arcs constrain a choice on the page.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lavender field and factory ruins anchor the entire ritual: the field edge is where the circle gathers, the bees stitch punctuation, the lavender perfumes the corridor, and the factory ribs guard the horizon. Setup in the first paragraph, middle development when the corridor is placed "along the field rows" and the perfume blends with "diesel ghosts," and closure participation when the corridor is left outdoors "weathered into kindness by bees and seasons." Three distinct beats with strong causal pressure (the field provides the spatial resource for the corridor and the factory ruins charge the town's history). Specificity is high (lavender, factory skeletons, bees, diesel ghosts) and swappability is low—the juxtaposition of soft/industrial is irreplaceable. The setting constrains the ritual's form and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "as vines climb" is introduced mid-scene ("We linger among spools and frames, the circle tightening as vines climb the factory walls, as vines climb the fences, as vines climb the old ideas") but functions as lyric metaphor rather than a live clock. The phrase recurs in the same beat without tracking elapsed time or altering tactics. No setup in the opening, one ornamental middle mention, and no closure participation. The timeframe does not constrain a choice or impose a visible cost—it remains primarily atmospheric. Swappability is high; any slow-transformation metaphor could replace it. One positive: the triple repetition ("as vines climb the factory walls, as vines climb the fences, as vines climb the old ideas") creates rhythmic texture, but the effect is textural rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The motivation to "transmute pain into a masterpiece" is stated mid-scene ("I tell them our aim is to transmute pain into a masterpiece, using nothing but what they already carry") and shapes the ritual's tactics: story-sharing, photograph placement, mirror reveal, corridor walk, and final word-gift. Setup delayed until midpoint, moderate middle development (the masterpiece concept frames the corridor as walked/sung/remembered), and closure participation when the map case "weighs more than paper" and the corridor is left outdoors. One to two distinct beats with modest causal pressure (the motivation justifies the ritual's form but does not force a trade-off). Cost connection is felt (the town must walk the corridor twice, offer words without breaking) but the friction between wanting transformation and fearing exposure is told rather than dramatized in competing impulses. Swappability is moderate; "healing ritual" or "shared monument" could substitute.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Earnest whimsy is introduced in the second paragraph ("a ridiculous pairing that suited my earnest whimsy more than I would admit aloud") and modulates across beats: the wind/engine/moonlight pairing, the archivist's "subtle puzzle" framing, the mayor's joke about a machine turning curses into nails, and the lyric turns ("humor is the hallway where fear forgets its shoes"). Tone is coherent through the ritual and charges the final image when the archivist walks among the ruins "until their shadows admit they are not monsters." Setup early, middle development in the joke beat and lyric passages, and closure participation in the final whimsical reframe. Two to three distinct beats with moderate tonal pressure (the tone permits the town to shift from grief to laughter). One friction: the tone risks slipping into preciousness in the essayistic turns, though it holds under the lyric lens. Swappability is moderate; "gentle humor" or "wistful playfulness" could substitute with tonal loss.</comment>
