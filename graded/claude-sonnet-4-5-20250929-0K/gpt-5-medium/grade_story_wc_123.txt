<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The storm recorder's professional identity is distinctive and drives micro-choices (decoy charts, coded message), with embodied contradiction—"credibly curious" versus "nights ask for restraint." Internal conflict operates in scene when they note "serenity and threat balanced like two needles." The lateral escape and the final stance show earned endurance with visible cost (leaving work behind, accepting witness status), though the interiority occasionally edges toward label-speak ("integrity is a barometer").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the protagonist refuses the pursuer's script, delivers evidence laterally to the archivist, and accepts the role of "witness with a craft" rather than hero—foreclosing confrontation with felt cost. Drive lens is Causal with Accumulative touches (weather imagery threads through); the pigeon's second use and the decoy-chart tactic create motivated escalation. Orientation anchors (courtyard, dusk, follower's presence) arrive promptly and the because/therefore chain holds through the final image of the ledger accepting weather "as it pleased."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The courtyard at dusk functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: the fig and arch enable the lateral escape, the fountain's metronome rhythm charges the atmosphere, and the bench becomes the stage for the decoy exchange. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("barometric tremors braided with rumor," "dusk pooled"). The storm recorder's professional lens (isobars, pressure geometry) colors perception throughout, and the final window and lamp ground the closure image with tactile presence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving integrity and delivering unedited storm data despite surveillance—is signaled early and tightens through the message-tube threat and the figure's arrival. The protagonist's agency drives escalation: choosing to craft a second coded message, using decoy charts, and progressing laterally rather than submitting or fleeing. The lateral escape is a visible trade (public confrontation avoided, but the archivist now holds evidence). Pressure coheres under the Causal lens; coincidence (pigeon arrival) complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—integrity as witness versus institutional control—emerges from particulars: the storm recorder's refusal of "poor maps," the rogue quarantine's missing seal, and the choice to send truth laterally rather than confront power directly. The final image ("integrity is a barometer too, and tonight it steadied somewhere brave and private") risks mild abstraction but is earned by prior particulars and offers a resonant answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence (the figure's doubt, the pigeon's circle) and the weather-as-conscience metaphor deepens without becoming allegorical.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistent: formal yet sensory ("layered tranquility," "outcomes choosing alleys"), with professional idiom woven through perception. Psychic distance is stable; the protagonist's knowledge bounds hold (they infer the watcher's shape without naming). Dialogue is sparse, purposeful, and carries subtext—"leave the rest alone" versus "I refuse poor maps"—with clear goal pursuit. Figurative language occasionally densifies in non-peak beats ("pressure fell sideways," "storms tell truths"), but remains controlled and legible throughout, with no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmically controlled with varied sentence openings and purposeful compression. Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot. Minor template cadence appears in the middle third ("I listened… I placed… I folded…") and a few metaphors edge toward stock ("doubt rose like heat"), but these do not touch closure. The final paragraph's clarity and propulsion are exemplary ("the pigeon became a dot, the dot a memory, the memory a pressure rising toward rain"). No paraphrase loops or major artifacts; line-level execution supports rather than hinders momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—storm recorder as integrity-keeper against rogue quarantine surveillance—is specific and non-obvious, with the lateral-escape method and coded weather message adding fresh angles. The metaphor of weather as conscience and storms as truth versus institutional editing offers conceptual depth. The piece commits fully to its premise without retreat. However, the "integrity as barometer" closure risks mild abstraction, and the courtyard-confrontation structure follows a recognizable evasion template, limiting the score's ceiling despite strong execution within the frame.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The meticulous storm recorder identity is present from the opening, drives the coded-message tactic (isobars, annotated maps), enables the decoy-chart choice, and shapes the final ledger image. Observation paired with decisional agency (send evidence laterally, use decoys, refuse surrender) across three beats with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The carrier pigeon's message tube appears in two distinct uses: first carrying the threat ("LEAVE THE CHARTS"), then repurposed with the protagonist's coded weather data to the archivist. This reversal drives a key turn and charges the closure (pigeon as "dot… memory… pressure"). High integration with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The rogue quarantine zone frames the threat (riverfront district fenced off, no trusted seal) and motivates the protagonist's resistance ("I refuse poor maps"), but its mechanics remain abstract. It shapes stakes and the figure's dialogue ("storms are inside the zone now"), appearing early and influencing the ending choice, though it could be swapped for a similar authoritarian premise with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Credibly curious" is stated early and constrains one choice: the refusal to "leave the rest alone" despite risk. The trait enables the lateral tactic and persists to closure ("not because I hunger for secrets, but because I refuse poor maps"), but the phrase itself is more label than embodied friction; the cost is present but the attribute's irreplaceability is middling.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Intuit" appears explicitly in the plan ("I had to intuit the shape of the watcher without naming them") and drives the coded-message choice and the lateral escape. The method is signaled early, used to decode threat geometry, and shapes two key beats. It could be replaced with "deduce" or "infer" with minor tonal loss, capping the score below 7.5.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"By progressing laterally" is signaled early ("my work is often solved by progressing laterally"), demonstrated in the courtyard escape ("I stepped not back or forward, but sideways"), and explicitly echoed at closure. The method's mechanics matter: lateral versus direct confrontation defines the resolution with visible cost (evasion over heroism). High specificity and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The quiet courtyard at dusk is present from the opening, supplies tactical resources (fig, arch, fountain), and charges the final image (window, lamp, ledger). The setting enables the lateral escape and holds "layered tranquility" through pressure. Micro-setting (bench, gate, sycamore) alters tactics and the courtyard's geometry shapes the confrontation with felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"After being followed home" frames urgency and opens/closes the piece as a bookend. The timeframe (dusk pooling, pressure of the follower's arrival) tightens decisions and the "pending storm" metaphor sustains temporal pressure. The clock is implicit rather than tracked beat-by-beat, but the after-pursuit context alters all tactics and the resolution references it directly.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"To nurture integrity in solitude" is stated early, tested by the threat ("protected for your own good"), and dramatized in the choice to send coded evidence rather than submit or confront. The friction between integrity and safety drives the lateral escape with visible cost (witness versus hero). The motivation persists to closure and shapes the final ledger image with felt price.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Layered tranquility" is seeded in the opening ("building stones held a layered tranquility"), sustained through pressure ("I did not run, because I keep the tone of my life tuned to layered tranquility"), and charges the closure ("the fountain kept time, and the weather entered the ledger as it pleased"). Tone modulates without breaking; the final image reconfigures tranquility as earned stance rather than passive calm.</comment>
