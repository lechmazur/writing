<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is consistently embodied through sensory perception (river foam on wet stones, chrysalis in palm) and the "symphonically minded" trait alters how she processes water and polymer design. Internal contradiction operates when she claims atonement but acknowledges "there was more, a listening that had guided me since childhood," showing competing drives. The final choice to carry the chrysalis "into every meeting" and return with "a plan that would change the plant" is earned by the river's teaching, though the shift from confession-avoidance to public action could bear more on-page friction. Minor deduction: the sister and mentor remain abstract pressures rather than embodied presences that test her resolve in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors promptly (braided ravine, notebook, compass, polymer chemist identity). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through layered observation (alder shade chrysalis, foam patterns, swallows) until the climactic sketch of the Braiding copolymer with "reversible rings" that close "when calm returned." Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the vow to carry the chrysalis and the plan to change contracts reconfigures her stance from flight to repair, with visible cost signaled ("lawsuits and scorn"). Cost proof is legible in "I could not bear a lab's confession, nor the courtroom's, so I came to the river" versus "I returned to the city... a plan that would change the plant, the contracts, and the apologies." The ellipsis between sketch and implementation is purposeful compression that fits the lyric mode.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The braided ravine directly constrains her insight: "the channel braided into silver threads, breaking and rejoining" teaches the design principle for reversible polymer rings. Micro-setting elements (chrysalis, foam on wet stones, cobbles) are handled and charge the final image ("empty chrysalis lay between pages... I vowed to carry it into every meeting"). Sensory detail is filtered through her professional lens ("polymers recast as orchestration, chain lengths a choir") and the ravine's physical structure (islands of sand and willow, alder shade) supplies the metaphor that becomes the solution. The setting is indispensable to the discovery and closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (atonement for packaging failure that harmed wildlife) is signaled early and deepens when she reframes it: "to atone is not to erase... but to keep listening until damage finds its counterpoint." The tightening occurs through accumulative observation that narrows to a single actionable insight (reversible rings at pH shifts). Agency is decision: she sketches the Braiding architecture, climbs the cobbles, and commits to returning with a plan despite anticipated "lawsuits and scorn." Cost is felt ("my sister would answer my paper with a margin note instead of silence") and conceptual (rejecting mentor's definition of strength). One meaningful deepening suffices for this length under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme (separation and reconnection, rigidity versus adaptive release) emerges organically from river braiding, chrysalis metamorphosis, and polymer redesign without stating a moral. The ending offers a non-literal answer through image: "the ravine kept time for my first unbroken day" reprices her "broken" design as a necessary rupture toward mending. Subtext operates in the chrysalis lesson ("answered by not cracking"), the swallows' "black seams that did not bind," and the sister's potential margin note as fragile reconnection. The final vow to carry the chrysalis layers atonement as ongoing practice rather than erasure. Reflection is anchored to present stimuli (foam, chrysalis) and tilts present stance (sketch, vow) throughout.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single first-person POV remains stable; psychic distance modulates purposefully from lyric compression ("Once, I was simply a polymer chemist") to embodied present ("I curled my fingers around it"). Perceptual signature is distinct: water speaks "in motifs the way long polymer chains whisper curvature and stress," filtering all observation through symphonic-chemical synthesis. Diction stays within the focalizer's lexicon (polymer, pH shifts, cross-links) while achieving lyric density ("loosened grief hung over the water like a mist the sun kept almost, but not quite, lifting"). No head-hopping; elision (between sketch and return) is purposeful compression that charges the ending. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies sentence length and structure; opening lines anchor voice and the final line resolves by image that recharges prior motifs (ravine, unbroken). Information density is high: most sentences do multiple jobs (e.g., "I diverged from my mentor, from my sister, from the consensus" establishes professional conflict, family rift, and design philosophy simultaneously). Minor deduction for two paraphrase adjacencies: "I could not bear a lab's confession, nor the courtroom's" followed immediately by "so I came to the river" slightly delays propulsion, and "The foam taught me that connection is not a single bond but a score of entrances" is then restated as "I heard my polymers recast as orchestration." No loops touch the closure beat. Figurative language (mist, chrysalis, swallows) is controlled and purposeful, though density approaches the ~60% line in the middle third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of polymer chemistry, river morphology, and metamorphosis as parallel systems for adaptive design is specific and non-obvious. The premise (atoning scientist seeks nature's lesson) could trend familiar, but the execution transforms it through technical specificity (reversible rings, pH shifts, cross-links as percussion) and the symphonic lens that unifies water, insects, and polymers. Risk-taking in lyric compression and reflection-led pacing heightens stakes without obscuring causality. The chrysalis as hinge between closed rigidity and clean parting avoids symbolic convenience by arriving early and being handled twice (beside notebook, tested in palm, carried forward). Minor deduction: the ravine-teaches-humility arc echoes eco-redemption templates, though the polymeric detail and professional cost (sister, mentor rifts) elevate it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Polymer chemist identity frames the stakes (patent responsibility, design failure), constrains perception (everything filtered through chemical-symphonic lens), enables the sketch of Braiding copolymer with reversible rings, and drives the decision to return with a plan. Present in setup, middle discovery, and closure action.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Chrysalis appears in alder shade (setup), is tested in palm ("curled my fingers... it answered by not cracking"), and is vowed to be carried "into every meeting" at closure. Its seam-parted form and lesson (departure as arrival, aging cleanly without piercing) directly shapes the polymer redesign. Reweighted in final image as "hinge and a hush."</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Divergence is the protagonist's path from mentor, sister, consensus, and the failed design. It drives the isolation that sends her to the river, shapes her refusal of "stronger always meant better," and culminates in choosing "a divergent path that sounded like relief." The concept alters options throughout and is named explicitly at closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Symphonic mindedness filters all perception ("water speaks in motifs the way long polymer chains whisper curvature and stress") and enables the orchestral reframing ("chain lengths a choir, cross-links like percussion"). It constrains her away from linear analysis toward pattern listening. Present early and active in the insight, though it could impose a visible cost or tradeoff to reach higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Atonement is the stated motivation that brings her to the river, deepens into "keep listening until damage finds its counterpoint," and shifts at closure to carrying the chrysalis and returning with apologies and a plan. The action structures the arc from avoidance to repair and shapes the sister reconciliation thread.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>River foam tracing is the method: "I watched for hours, tracing river foam patterns with my fingertip on the wet stones, letting eddies answer each other like voices." It yields "not a diagram but a cadence" and teaches that "connection is not a single bond but a score of entrances." The method is signaled, enacted, and directly produces the Braiding sketch. Indispensable to the discovery.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Braided ravine's physical structure (channels breaking and rejoining, islands of sand and willow) is the causal engine for the polymer insight. The setting constrains her to observe non-linear flow, supplies the metaphor ("reversible rings, small as river loops"), and is invoked at closure ("the ravine kept time"). Removing this exact setting would break the story's discovery logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The phrase "as the pieces fall into place" marks the insight moment when foam patterns cohere into the Braiding design. It signals a perceptual threshold rather than a clock, fitting the Accumulative lens. Present at a key turn but does not tighten decisions temporally or impose a live deadline.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The motivation "to translate separation into connection" is dramatized in her observation of braiding water, the chrysalis's parted seam, and the sketch of polymers that "swap partners in rain, reconnect in hush, and release what it trapped." It drives the middle discovery and the closure vow. Friction appears in the cost: "lawsuits and scorn" and the sister's uncertain response.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Tone of loosened grief is established early ("hung over the water like a mist the sun kept almost, but not quite, lifting") and modulates through contemplative observation to the bittersweet closure ("the ravine kept time for my first unbroken day"). Coherent throughout; it charges the final image of fragile hope without resolving into triumph.</comment>
