<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's characterization shows clear motivation ("preserve the shape of hope") and embodied choices—trading her stored dreams, whispering to vines—but interiority leans heavily on lyric abstraction ("felt something in herself lean toward the sorrow") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice (pouring dreams into soil) is dramatized but Ilen remains functionally passive, a recipient rather than a pressure source. No diagnostic label-speak, but the lyric density occasionally replaces embodied struggle with figurative summary.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure lands via Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid): Mira sacrifices her unlived life to restore Ilen's shadow, foreclosing her own "roads she never walked," and the library accepts the bargain by inking her name into the sky—cost is visible and felt. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when the vines tighten and Mira trades her dreams; the cadence shift and charged final image reweight the dominant stake. A micro causal slip: the river stone "anchors" the shadow, but the mechanics of how memory acquires mass remain gestural rather than earned by prior rule-setting.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The blooming library above clouds is vivid and consistent, with vines, orchards of mist, and stairways unfurling like petals. The river stone constrains Mira's choice (she uses it to anchor the shadow) and charges the ending when she returns it to Ilen. Sensory selection is purposeful—dew on pages, river light braiding through iron—filtered through Mira's trained "dusk noticer" perception. Spatial choreography remains clear across balcony, aisles, and shelves; the environment subtly guides action (library "jealous," vines tighten) without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: restore Ilen's shadow to preserve hope. One meaningful tightening occurs when the library's vines resist, forcing Mira to trade her stored dreams—an on-page choice that narrows options and carries visible cost (the empty casing where her dreams had been). The shadow's separation is established early; the river stone anchors it in a charged beat. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, though Ilen's agency is minimal—he kneels and remembers, but Mira drives all turns. The resolution is earned by Mira's sacrifice; the price (her unlived life) alters the final image and forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—hope requiring sacrifice, preservation through renunciation—emerges from concrete particulars: Mira's trade, the river stone's return, the library drinking "luminous regret." The final image (blossoms inking her name into the sky) offers a resonant, non-literal answer without stating a moral. Subtext operates in gesture (pressing the stone back into Ilen's palm) and implication (the "empty casing" of her unlived life). No overt moralizing. One minor slip: "luminous regret" risks becoming a decorative label rather than an embodied tension, though it is tied to visible cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited on Mira, with consistent perceptual filtering ("a sharp-eyed dusk noticer"). Diction is purposefully elevated and lyric ("orchards of ideas rooted in mist," "horizons the color of cooled embers"), matching the fantastical setting. Filter verbs ("felt," "saw") are present but voice-motivated and legible. However, the prose leans heavily on figurative compression—nearly every sentence deploys metaphor or abstraction—which occasionally obscures immediacy under pressure. Ilen and the shadow lack distinct speech or internal texture; Ilen's single line of dialogue is neutral. No head-hopping, but the lyric register risks flattening micro-emotional gradations during key beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, with longer lyric constructions alternating with shorter beats at climax ("Light rained from the rafters, not burning but washing"). Information density is high, but figurative language appears in most sentences—"borrowed reveries that fluttered like fragile birds," "shadow wrote looping questions on the floor," "wish forming, as if the shadow wanted to metamorphose"—creating a consistent lyric texture that occasionally obscures causal linkage. No paraphrase loops or template cadence, but elevated diction in peak beats (e.g., "luminous regret," "testimonies that patience can sculpt gentler futures") drifts into abstraction. One minor clarity slip: "the stone anchored it long enough for Ilen to kneel and remember the taste of first rain" mixes memory-as-anchor with an unexplained sensory cue. Grammar and tense are clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The "blooming library above clouds" housing borrowed dreams is a fresh synthesis; the unbound shadow searching for its owner through video reels adds specificity. Emotional truth (the cost of nurturing others' hope with one's own unlived life) avoids generic templates. The river stone as anchor, both literal and figurative, transforms a familiar motif through causal use. One friction: the "decades apart" video-footage method and the fantastical library logic sit uneasily together—technology and myth blend without clear rule coherence. The ending's resonance (name inked into sky by luminous regret) is earned but leans on lyric abstraction rather than a non-obvious synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira, the "sharp-eyed dusk noticer," drives two key turns: agreeing to help Ilen (middle) and trading her dreams to free the shadow (climax). Her observation enables the video-footage search, and her deliberate action (pouring dreams into soil, whispering to vines) alters tactics and forecloses her own path. Present in setup, middle choice, and closure. The trait "sharp-eyed" is more functional than the "dusk noticer" metaphor, which remains partly ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The river stone appears in three beats: Mira carries it as a reminder (setup), places it in the shadow's silhouette to anchor memory (middle turn), and presses it back into Ilen's palm at the end, reweighted as a gift of steadiness for future trembling. It constrains a middle choice (anchoring the shadow) and charges the closure through its return with altered meaning. Early signal, causal pressure, and closure linkage all present; cost tied to the element (Mira gives up the anchor she relied on).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"A shadow unbound" shapes the central conflict: Ilen's shadow separated during shared dreams and never reattached. The premise drives all tactics (searching footage, testing distance, anchoring with the stone) and the climax (the shadow gathers itself and reaches Ilen's feet). Present in setup, middle beats, and closure. The concept is specific and irreplaceable—removing it breaks the story's logic and stakes. Cost is visible: Mira sacrifices her dreams to free the shadow from the library's jealous roots.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Softly deliberate" describes Mira's gait in the opening and recurs in the penultimate paragraph ("softly deliberate again"). It frames her approach but does not constrain a specific on-page action with visible cost—she moves deliberately throughout without a moment where haste would have altered outcome. The trait is consistent and thematically coherent (patience, care) but functions more as label than tactical limiter. Lyric reprise reweights her return to routine after sacrifice, lifting it above ornamental, but causal pressure is weak.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Metamorphose" appears once as the shadow's wish: "a wish forming, as if the shadow wanted to metamorphose into a path home yet feared the cost." The concept (transformation, return) underlies the entire arc, but the verb itself is used only in this reflective beat and not dramatized as a turning action. The shadow does gather and reattach (a metamorphosis), but the text does not explicitly tie that climax to this word. Thematically present, causally indirect; swappable with "transform" or "return" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The method—comparing silent video footage from decades apart—is introduced at the story's midpoint and drives one extended beat: Mira and Ilen unspool reels, watch Ilen at nineteen and later under a bridge, searching for the moment the shadow flinched away. It shapes the search tactic and provides the clue (the shadow testing distance, scaling walls). Present in middle development and causally active, but not signaled in setup and absent from closure. The footage does not return or pay off at the end; the stone and vines resolve the conflict instead.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The "blooming library above clouds" is established immediately and pressures every choice: vines tighten to resist the shadow's return, the library is "jealous," and Mira must trade her dreams into the soil beds to win the library's cooperation. The balcony, aisles, shelves, and rafters are spatially coherent and functionally active. The library constrains tactics (forcing the bargain), supplies resources (the reels, the soil), and charges the closure (blossoms ink Mira's name into the sky). Early signal, causal pressure across beats, and decisive closure participation; irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"After dreams become shareable" is a worldbuilding premise stated in the third paragraph but never shapes urgency or tactics. No on-page clock tied to dream-sharing; Mira's task (restore the shadow) is not time-bound. The phrase establishes the library's function (tending "borrowed reveries," "bottled slumber") but remains backdrop rather than pressure. Present in setup, absent from middle choices and closure; ornamental to the escalation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira's motivation—"to preserve the shape of hope"—is stated when she agrees to help and dramatized at climax when she pours her stored dreams into the soil, sacrificing her unlived life to honor that commitment. The final paragraph confirms her decision to "continue to notice, to preserve the shape of hope for strangers." Friction between desire (help Ilen) and cost (her own dreams) is visible on the page. Present in setup, drives the climactic choice, and reappears in closure; the cost is felt and forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Luminous regret" appears explicitly twice: "joy arrive carrying luminous regret" after the shadow reunites, and the library "drinking her luminous regret until it sweetened the roots." Tone coheres through lyric melancholy, charged by loss and beauty in tandem (dusk imagery, "cooled embers," "empty casing"). The phrase charges the final image (blossoms sweetened by regret, name inked into sky) and modulates with pressure—rising as Mira realizes the price. Coherent across turns, purposeful at closure, and distinct enough to shape emotional aftereffect.</comment>
