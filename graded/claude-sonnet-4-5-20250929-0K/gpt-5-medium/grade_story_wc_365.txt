<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interior voice is concrete and specific—"maps are not lines, but scents, textures, vibrations"—and the central choice (accepting culpability for the REDIRECT action) is earned through parallel-universe observation rather than declaration. The embodied emotion arrives through sensory anchors: "the shard warms against my palm, green as planetfall, and I weigh it without flinching." Minor slips: the mother's characterization ("vigilant and indelicate") is told rather than shown, and the child-self lacks contradictory impulses at the pivotal button moment, reading more as mythic echo than conflicted actor.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors emerge gradually—sensory map maker, abandoned repair bay, green glass shard—but "who" and "when" cohere by approximately line 10, within the allowable window. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the protagonist accepts the withheld truth ("I was the one who pressed REDIRECT") and redirects the path outward by mapping routes for survivors, foregrounding a visible cost (carrying the weight, folding the child into the chart). The Accumulative lens holds: layered sensory details and parallel-universe threading tighten until the final image reweights prior material. However, the causal linkage between the child's touch and the fuel redirect remains abstract—"obedient to a pattern that moved me like tide"—which clouds agency and slightly weakens closure clarity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The repair bay is vivid and constraining: "ozone and rain," "hanging chains," "tools arranged...like a prayer wheel." The shard functions as both object and micro-setting, focusing photologs and charging the final image with "green as planetfall." Spatial choreography across parallel universes is legible, and the terminal becomes a tactile anchor that shapes the discovery beat. The prose filters setting through the POV's occupational bias (sensory mapping) without slipping into catalog mode.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—"to discover the weight of a withheld truth"—is signaled early and tightened through the shard-to-terminal action, which narrows options by forcing the protagonist to witness her own hand on the button. The Accumulative lens supports one meaningful deepening: the withheld truth becomes internalized responsibility, and the final tactic (mapping routes for survivors) forecloses evasion with visible cost. Pressure coheres, though the abstract phrasing of the child's agency ("cyclically spontaneous, obedient to rhythms") slightly diffuses escalation at the pivotal beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—responsibility, memory, and the cartography of guilt—emerges through the shard's refractive return, the mother's deleted logs, and the closing directive to "redirect the lost." The final image ("I redirect the lost, one heartbeat per world, until our cycles meet again") answers the central question without moralizing: the protagonist folds the child into the chart rather than erasing her, accepting cost as measurable weight. No thematic echo or diagnostic label-speak mars the ending, and the non-literal answer reweights prior material with earned resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: "fear is a scent and I can sort scents," "maps are...woven between worlds." Psychic distance tightens under pressure ("I watch my own back, bending closer"), and the prose rhythm modulates with escalation—longer, layered sentences in the parallel-universe discovery, shorter cadence at acceptance. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks in peak beats, and diction remains character-bound (sensory mapper's idiom). Purposeful compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high—most lines do double duty (world-building plus interiority)—and sentence rhythm varies purposefully. Minor loop: "cyclically spontaneous" appears twice in similar phrasing without added pressure. A handful of elevated metaphors ("a planetary aurora poured into cheap tempered glass") approach overwriting but remain legible and voice-motivated. No paraphrase loops or template cadence, and the final line propels without scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of sensory mapping, parallel-universe travel, and inherited guilt is specific and non-obvious, with the shard functioning as prism, record, and anchor. The turn—protagonist as unwitting saboteur—feels inevitable in hindsight, grounded in the "cyclically spontaneous" trait and the mother's protective silence. Risk-taking (accumulative structure, lyric cadence, abstract mechanics) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The emotional truth (accepting rather than erasing culpability) resists template consolation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sensory map maker shapes perception throughout, drives the shard-to-terminal action (causal beat), and defines the ending tactic: mapping routes for survivors. Signaled in line 2, involved in the discovery beat and the closure image, with occupational idiom constraining choices.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Green glass shard is handled in the opening (tactile anchor), pressed to the terminal (enabling discovery), and returns in the final paragraph with reweighted meaning ("green as planetfall...I weigh it without flinching"). Appears in three distinct beats, charges closure, and its specific properties (prism, canopy sliver, refraction) matter causally.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Weaving between worlds is the protagonist's method for discovery, appearing in the opening ("I travel best by weaving between worlds"), the middle parallel-universe threading, and the final exit ("through parallel universes gently aligned"). Shapes tactics (splice coordinates, step without closing eyes) and the closure stance, though mechanics remain abstract.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Cyclically spontaneous is mentioned twice (in the map-making ethos and echoed at the button moment) but functions more as theme label than visible tradeoff. The trait does not constrain a choice with on-page cost; the child's action is attributed to it retroactively rather than dramatized as a struggle between impulse and consequence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Redirect appears in the console command ("REDIRECT FUEL PRIORITY"), the child's button press, the mother's cover-up, and the closing vow ("I redirect the lost"). The action redefines the protagonist's entire stake—from discovering the mother's secret to accepting her own culpability—and the final image hinges on the verb's repurposing. Indispensable across setup, turn, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Through parallel universes is signaled early ("splice coordinates through parallel universes"), enacted in the discovery sequence (engineers shout/whisper/sing across strands), and present at closure ("through parallel universes gently aligned"). The method matters tactically: the protagonist watches the same moment in different strands to piece together causality. Could be swapped for another multiversal mechanism with minor edits, limiting score ceiling.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Abandoned spaceport repair bay frames the entire piece, supplies the terminal (tool that enables discovery), and closes with the protagonist walking it "in waking and in dream, laying markers." The bay's state (sealed locks, hanging chains, coolant) constrains the mystery and charges the final image. Appears in all three gates with causal work.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>In the murmur of half-remembered dreams sets atmospheric tone but does not tighten decisions or alter tactics. The timeframe is vague—neither urgent nor tracked—and the phrase is ornamental after the opening line. Missing middle development and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>To discover the weight of a withheld truth is declared in line 18, dramatized in the shard-to-terminal beat, and resolved in the closing acceptance ("I have measured the truth, found it heavy"). The motivation drives the middle action and charges the final stance with visible cost (folding the child into the chart, redirecting survivors). Friction between desire and cost is legible on the page.</comment>
