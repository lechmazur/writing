<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lida's motivation—to evolve tradition with intent rather than accept implanted destiny—is clear and generates contradictory pressures: loyalty to elders versus self-determination. Her interior voice is consistent and embodied through plant-mediated perception, though the final choice feels slightly underdramatized; the vine "borrowed breath" and she "showed" it images rather than wrestling with a visceral trade-off. The council's refusal and her solitary act create genuine stakes, but the ease with which the embryo accepts her vision ("listening, learning us") softens the cost. Internal conflict is present but could be sharper at the closure beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The drive lens is Causal-Accumulative Hybrid: Lida's discovery of the kite → decoding → unsealing the embryo → the seedling's growth forms a clear because/therefore chain, while the plant-whisper motif accumulates density and charges the final image. Orientation anchors (Lida, hot springs, reconstruction era) land by the second paragraph. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise—crystallizes the choice between preserved destiny and steered tradition; the seedling's scaffold and children's laughter reweight prior pressure. Cost is visible (council opposition, solitary defiance) but felt cost at the moment of unsealing could be more acute; the amber "softened like honey" reads smooth rather than wrenching. One meaningful tightening occurs when the council refuses and Lida acts alone, narrowing options with social and philosophical price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The volcanic hot springs function as more than postcard: the "hottest pool" vault, mirrored steam, and porous rock all enable the unsealing ritual and root the seedling, constraining Lida's tactics. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through Lida's plant-attuned perception ("sulfur wind," "gray water cradled bubbles like secrets"). The bathhouse reconstruction, aqueduct, irrigation ditch, and basalt path create coherent spatial choreography. The springs charge the final image when the seedling roots "by her knee" and the "spring flared a brighter white," making the setting an active participant in closure. Minor: the broader valley and occupier-era details remain lightly sketched, but at this length the tight focus on the springs suffices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to unseal the embryo and claim agency over tradition—is signaled early and escalates through the kite discovery, council refusal, and solitary vault descent. One meaningful tightening occurs when the council folds into refusal, forcing Lida to choose between waiting and acting. The unsealing itself is protagonist-driven and forecloses the path of passive preservation; the seedling's acceptance and the children's laughter on the scaffold confirm the new order. Cost is legible: Lida defies the council oath, acts alone at night, and stakes the valley's future on her interpretation. The vine "borrowed breath" moment and the "declared map into living wood" could be higher-stakes—there's little doubt the embryo will cooperate—but the social and philosophical price is clear.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the conflict between implanted destiny (occupiers' "soft net") and self-determined tradition ("gardener trains a vine to accept a better trellis"). The kite as messenger, the embryo as contested future, and the plant chorus as democratic counsel all avoid on-the-nose symbolism; the final image of children testing "learning stairs" offers a resonant, non-literal answer without stating a moral. Lida's declaration—"intent would be the ongoing law"—risks thematic echo but is contextualized by the council's arrival and the seedling's listening posture, reading as dramatized stance rather than thesis. The piece invites reflection on stewardship, consent, and the difference between honoring and freezing culture. No false complexity or balanced toggles; the story commits to Lida's position with visible cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited through Lida; perceptual signature is plant-mediated and consistently filters sensory detail ("reeds along the shore kept whispering strategy," "mince of syllables slide through cattail"). Diction is controlled and voice-motivated, with phrases like "destiny like iron nails in seed" and "wet loaf" grounding the lyric register in concrete texture. The council's dialogue is minimal but goal-driven ("tradition must arrive on its own feet"). Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the unsealing ritual. Minor slips: "borrowed breath" and "declared map" drift slightly toward abstract poeticism at peak moments, and the phrase "learning stairs" in the penultimate paragraph feels like helpful-narrator labeling rather than discovered image. No head-hopping; focalization remains clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high; most sentences advance character, world, or pressure. The opening ("Steam rose…") anchors voice and stakes efficiently. Figurative language is frequent but generally coherent ("mirrored steam," "borrowed breath," "roots while thinking of tomorrow"). However, several lines approach overwriting: "the mince of syllables slide through cattail and scarlet moss" stacks metaphor without clear payoff, and "wet loaf" for the amber feels strained. Template cadence appears in the council-argument paragraph: "She answered that waiting was also a choice, and that intent mattered, and that implanted destiny was only tradition…" (three parallel "that" clauses). The phrase "memory of roots while thinking of tomorrow" in the kite instruction is abstract and could be sharper. No major loops, but the penultimate paragraph's density ("borrowed breath," "braid of futures," "declared map," "translate her promise") risks register drift into poetic scaffolding. Clarity holds, but figurative load in peak beats edges toward −0.4 to −0.6 range.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of post-occupation reconstruction, plant telepathy, and bio-engineered tradition is specific and non-obvious. The kite-as-code-carrier and "embryo in amber" avoid stock sci-fi or fantasy templates; the hot-springs vault and learning-stairs scaffold feel particular to this world. The premise transforms familiar "ancients vs. modernity" material through Lida's lived detail (shrapnel-and-sap accident, clandestine kite messages, tubers saved in blankets). Emotional complexity is genuine: Lida honors tradition while refusing to be frozen by it, and the story commits fully to that stance without hedging. The final image—children testing the seedling's stairs—offers fresh inflection on the "elders pass torch" arc. Minor: the embryo's cooperative acceptance and the swift scaffold growth feel slightly convenient, reducing friction. Risk-taking in structure (plant-chorus interiority, lyric compression) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, meriting +0.2 within band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lida is present from the opening and drives every major turn: she follows the reeds to the kite, decodes the script, argues with the council, descends to the vault, and performs the unsealing ritual. Her choices—to read the kite, to act alone, to "show the vine" her vision—are causally linked and redefine options at closure. The seedling's response and the children's laughter are direct results of her agency. Setup (paragraph one), development (kite discovery, council refusal, vault descent), and payoff (unsealing and scaffold emergence) are all present. Visible cost: defying the council oath, acting in secret, staking the valley's future. The element is indispensable; removing Lida would collapse the story's logic and stakes.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The embryo is introduced early (paragraph five: "embryo in amber locked in the vault"), drives the central conflict (council preservation vs. Lida's intent to unseal), and is physically handled in the unsealing ritual. It appears in at least three beats: vault description, Lida lifting it ("heavy as a wet loaf"), and the unsealing ("amber softened like honey…a thin vine within woke"). The embryo's transformation—from static relic to listening seedling—charges the closure: the scaffold and "learning stairs" are its direct product. Cost is tied to it: Lida risks the council's wrath and the valley's future. The element is irreplaceable; a different object would not carry the same "implanted destiny" weight or enable the plant-telepathy link. Setup, development, payoff all present; causal pressure and closure linkage are strong.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Implanted destiny" is signaled early (paragraph three: "the old world had planted destiny like iron nails in seed") and recurs as thematic pressure throughout. It shapes Lida's motivation ("she remembered the way the occupiers spoke of implanted destiny…a soft net") and the council's refusal ("tradition must arrive on its own feet, not be coerced"). The concept drives tactics: Lida's choice to unseal is explicitly framed as rejecting implanted destiny in favor of steered intent. It charges the closure when she tells the council "she had unsealed a path, not a prison, and that intent would be the ongoing law." Cost is conceptual and social: defying the council's preservation stance and the occupier legacy. The concept is not merely thematic backdrop; it changes options on the page. Setup, development, payoff present; causal pressure and specificity elevate the score.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lida's plant telepathy is introduced early (paragraph two: "accidentally telepathic with plants…the reeds along the shore kept whispering strategy") and enables multiple on-page actions: the reeds guide her to the kite, the ivy guides her fingers to the pulse lock, and the reed chorus translates her promise to the seedling. The trait constrains her perception (she hears plant advice, not human) and shapes the unsealing ritual's success. Cost is implicit: reliance on plant mediation rather than direct human consensus. The attribute is irreplaceable; without it, Lida could not find the kite, decode via plant names, or communicate intent to the embryo. Setup, development (kite discovery, vault entry, unsealing translation), and payoff (reed chorus and seedling listening) all present. Visible tradeoffs and causal pressure justify high integration.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The unsealing is the story's climactic action, prepared by the kite discovery and council refusal, executed in the hot-springs ritual, and directly producing the seedling and scaffold. It appears in at least three beats: the council's rejection of unsealing, Lida's vault descent to retrieve the amber, and the ritual itself ("she placed the amber in the mirrored steam…the amber softened…a thin vine within woke"). The action redefines options: from preserved stasis to steered evolution. Cost is visible (council defiance, solitary risk) and conceptual (the valley's future now depends on ongoing intent). The unsealing is irreplaceable; no other action could resolve the story's central conflict. Setup (kite method, council refusal), development (vault descent), and payoff (seedling emergence, scaffold) all present. Causal pressure, closure linkage, and specificity are maximal.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The kite is introduced midway (paragraph ten: "An abandoned kite…its tail stitched with a cryptic script") but is prepared by earlier mentions of "clandestine days" and messages that "flew where checkpoints could not reach." It enables the unsealing by providing the method ("Place the amber in the mirror of fire water…speak the memory of roots while thinking of tomorrow"). Lida decodes it via plant names, linking it to her telepathy. The kite appears in two distinct beats: discovery and ritual decoding. Its mechanics matter: without the script, Lida could not unseal safely. Cost is indirect but present: the method requires solitary interpretation, bypassing the council. Late first appearance (second third) and single causal role cap the score near 7.6. Setup is delayed; development and payoff are clear. The kite is nearly irreplaceable but could theoretically be another coded message.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The hot springs are present from the opening and shape multiple beats: the vault beneath "the hottest pool," the "mirrored steam" where Lida places the amber, and the porous rock where the seedling roots. The setting enables the unsealing ritual (the springs' heat and mineral properties are implied to activate the amber) and charges the closure (the spring "flared a brighter white"). The reconstruction context frames stakes and the bathhouse scaffolding mirrors the seedling's scaffold. The springs constrain Lida's tactics (she must go to the vault, perform the ritual at the water's edge) and supply the medium for transformation. Setup (opening), development (vault descent), and payoff (ritual and rooting) all present. Spatial choreography is clear; the springs are irreplaceable. Causal pressure, closure linkage, and specificity justify high integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The reconstruction timeframe is established early ("during the reconstruction," "crews fit new beams," "ash years," "laboratories collapsed") and subtly pressures Lida's choice: the community is rebuilding, and the embryo represents a contested future. The council's preservation stance and Lida's steered-intent argument both reflect reconstruction-era tensions. The timeframe is not a ticking clock but a situational constraint: post-occupation, pre-stability, when decisions about the future carry extra weight. It appears in the opening and closing (children testing stairs, council arriving "by morning") and frames the stakes. Cost is indirect: acting during reconstruction means Lida's choice will shape the new order. The timeframe is somewhat replaceable (another liminal era could work) and does not narrow tactics beat-to-beat, capping the score near 7.2. Setup, payoff present; development is diffuse.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lida's desire to "evolve tradition with intent" is stated early (paragraph four) and dramatized through conflict: she wants to "train a vine to accept a better trellis," not destroy tradition or leave it frozen. The motivation drives her to decode the kite, defy the council, and perform the unsealing. It generates friction: the council accuses her of "coercing" tradition, and she must argue that "waiting was also a choice." The motivation is tested and confirmed at closure: she tells the council "intent would be the ongoing law" and the seedling "kept listening, learning us, letting us learn it." Cost is visible (social defiance, solitary risk) and conceptual (the valley's future now depends on ongoing stewardship). The motivation is irreplaceable; a different goal would alter the story's moral calculus. Setup, development (council argument), and payoff (unsealing, scaffold) all present. Causal pressure, friction, and closure linkage are strong.</comment>
