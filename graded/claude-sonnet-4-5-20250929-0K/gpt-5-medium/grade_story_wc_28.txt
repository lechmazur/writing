<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation is clear and embodied through steel arms and the tessera-handling, with the "warm coldness" paradox creating consistent interiority. However, the POV remains abstract throughout—"I" is a concept more than a character with contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The renaming ritual provides micro-choices, but the narrator's stance never wavers or costs them anything on the page; they operate as a conduit rather than an agent under pressure. The boy and the men receive decisions, but the narrator's own internal conflict between "heat and frost" stays declarative rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who: steel-armed narrator; where: ancient plaza; when: after fire) arrive early. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the renaming ritual deepens from boy to perpetrators, and the tessera returns with reweighted meaning in the final line. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the past "loosens" after the men are rebound to labor), but the cost remains atmospheric—no visible forfeiture or tactical shift on the page makes the "loosening" legible as a before/after with price paid. The dominant stake (mending through renaming) coheres, and one meaningful deepening occurs when the narrator moves from helping the boy to confronting the arsonists.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The plaza is concretely rendered (ash halos, broken columns, mosaic tessera, stepping stone) and the tessera directly enables the renaming mechanic—it "speaks" patterns twice, shaping both the boy's and the men's outcomes. The "shattered sky" and retrocognitive fog create consistent atmosphere. However, spatial choreography during the crowd scene (boy, narrator, men, onlookers) remains vague; we don't know distances or how the crowd physically relates to the ritual. The micro-setting (tessera + bottle caps on stepping stone) charges the closure when the narrator "places the tessera back on the ground" and feels release.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—renaming to bind harm to repair—is clear and tightens once when the boy's request escalates to the perpetrators' trial. The narrator's choice to rename rather than condemn forecloses the "easy echo" path and forces the crowd to accept "a different labor," but the men's compliance arrives without visible resistance or cost to the narrator. Agency reads as decision (the narrator "calls for the men," "asks them to kneel"), yet coincidence assists: the tessera and caps simply "yield four names" without struggle or failure. The resolution depends on the plaza's voice more than the protagonist's alteration or renunciation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—mercy as repair rather than absolution—emerges through the renaming mechanic and the "aberrant mercy" motif without overt moralizing. The tessera's return in the final line ("feel the past loosen inside me") offers a resonant answer to "whose grief must be lifted" without stating a thesis. However, several lines edge toward thematic declaration: "a resisting of the easy echo," "to bind the hand to the task," "we rename not to erase" approach thesis-statement territory. The "warm coldness" paradox recurs enough to feel purposeful but risks becoming a label for complexity rather than embodying it in scene pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single-POV first-person maintains stable distance with a distinct lyric-philosophical register: "retrocognitively trapped," "prayer that forgot its god and kept its music," "warm coat of frost." Diction remains elevated and consistent, though some phrases ("aberrant mercy," "gentle radical") feel like concept-labels rather than lived perception. The boy's dialogue is minimal but natural ("His mother cannot sleep because her name is Asha and it sounds like ash"), and no head-hopping occurs. Purposeful compression (the men's transformation summarized in four lines) fits the accumulative design. The perceptual signature—seeing markets that no longer exist, reading accident patterns—is character-specific and maintained under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully with short declaratives ("This is my aberrant mercy") alternating with longer lyric constructions. However, multiple paraphrase loops appear: "rename without forgetting, to rename without lying" restates the same idea; "warm coldness" recurs four times with minimal variation; "the plaza" appears as sentence subject eight times, creating template cadence. Stock metaphors accumulate: "song climbs a throat," "wound that refuses bleeding," "breath so careful it could survive underwater." Filter-verb stacks in the opening third ("call me," "hearing markets," "drift through me") dull immediacy. High density in the renaming beats partially offsets these issues, but artifacts cluster enough to trigger the patterned-artifact penalty and disallow 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The combination of post-conflict reconciliation, a mystical renaming ritual, and the steel-armed mediator offers specificity, but the underlying template—restorative justice administered by a wise figure—is familiar from fantasy and post-apocalyptic fiction. The tessera-reading mechanic and the labor-based new names (Bearer, Tanner, Chisel, Watch) provide fresh detail. The "gentle radical" and "retrocognitively trapped" phrases feel concept-forward rather than lived. The transformation test is mixed: the emotional arc (empathy vs. easy punishment) would survive setting changes, but the tessera mechanic and steel-armed embodiment are load-bearing. No close echoes of famous lines, and the risk of confronting perpetrators with renaming rather than exile elevates the premise within its template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The "gentle radical" label appears in line 4 and frames the narrator's mending-versus-ruin stance. The character makes two key choices: offering "Sila" to the boy and calling the men to rename them, both of which narrow the plot's options. However, "gentle radical" itself is a descriptive label rather than a trait that constrains action with visible cost—the narrator's choices align with the label but don't pivot on it. The narrator's radicalism (insisting on repair) is present in both beats, satisfying the middle gate, and the ending ("feel the past loosen") reflects the stance, satisfying the closure gate. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage (stance reflected in final line) +0.8, minus label-only friction −0.3 and some swappability ("empathetic mediator" could replace with edits) −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The tessera is picked up in the first third, used to generate "Sila" for the boy (middle beat), joined with bottle caps to yield four names for the men (second middle beat), and placed back on the ground in the final line where it triggers the narrator's interior release. Setup, development (twice), and closure gates all met. The object's chipped-crescent shape and minaret-mosaic origin provide specificity, and its patterned reading is irreplaceable to the renaming mechanic. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage (placed back, triggers loosening) +1.2, causal pressure (enables both renamings) +1.0, specificity +0.5, minus slight ornamental opening (described before first use) −0.3, minus no visible cost tied to the tessera itself −0.2. Total reach ~7.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Aberrant mercy" is named in line 12 and governs the narrator's refusal to punish the arsonists, instead offering "a different labor." The concept shapes the climactic choice (rename rather than condemn) and alters the crowd's reaction ("a breath from the crowd that feels like a warm coat of frost"). It appears in both the middle confrontation and the closure paragraph. Setup +0.4, middle development (shapes choice with perpetrators) +0.8, closure presence (narrator refuses "easy echo," men begin work) +0.9, causal pressure (narrows tactics to renaming) +0.8, cost connection (crowd's ambivalent breath, men's unnamed heads) +0.4, minus label-speak ("aberrant mercy" as phrase) −0.3, minus some thematic declaration rather than pure dramatization −0.4. Total ~6.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Retrocognitively trapped" is declared in line 7 and grounds the narrator's hearing of vanished markets and drifting footprints. However, this trait functions primarily as atmospheric color; it does not constrain a choice or impose cost on the page. The narrator's memory "opens like a wound" when picking up the tessera, but this interior event does not narrow options or alter tactics in the renaming beats. Setup (first third) met, middle development weak (no choice hinges on past-vision), closure absent (final loosening is release, not constraint). Early signal +0.5, ornamental/atmospheric use −0.7, label-only (trait named but not causally active) −0.5, no cost −0.4. Total ~4.9, capped at 4.6 for missing closure gate.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Renaming is signaled in line 4 ("to cradle empathy"), executed twice on-page (boy's mother → Sila; perpetrators → Bearer/Tanner/Chisel/Watch), and the final line ("feel the past loosen") reflects the cumulative effect of having renamed. The action is indispensable; removing it collapses both the boy's resolution and the perpetrators' path to repair. Setup +0.7, three beats (boy, men, ending release) +1.4, closure (loosening follows renaming) +1.5, causal pressure (names "bind the hand to the task") +1.2, irreplaceability +0.7, cost (men's sullen compliance, crowd's ambivalent breath) +0.5, minus slight summary in final men's paragraph −0.3. Total ~8.1.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The "chipped patterns on a mosaic stepping stone" method is introduced when the narrator places the tessera on the stepping stone with the boy's bottle caps, and the plaza "reads their accident patterns" to yield "Sila." The method repeats with the four perpetrators: tessera + caps → four labor-names. The stepping stone is present in both beats and shapes the outcome each time. Setup (first third, stepping stone named early) +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure (tessera placed back on ground, though the stepping stone itself is not named in final line) +0.5, causal pressure (patterns "speak" names) +1.0, specificity (chipped/crescent detail, accident-reading mechanic) +0.6, minus stepping stone not explicitly named in final beat −0.4, minus the plaza's voice somewhat externalizes agency −0.3. Total ~7.6.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The "ancient plaza beneath a shattered sky" is named in the opening line and remains the sole location throughout. The plaza pressures choices by "tightening around us" and "drifting in close, like a teacher bending over a desk," and its mosaic stepping stone supplies the renaming mechanic. The setting's post-fire desolation frames the stakes (mending ruin). Setup immediate, middle development (plaza "speaks" names twice) strong, closure (narrator feels past loosen "inside me" after placing tessera on ground) present. Early +0.8, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.8, causal (stepping stone enables plot) +1.0, specificity (shattered sky, ash, tessera) +0.5, minus some postcard description (columns, ash halos without choice-constraint) −0.5, minus vague crowd choreography −0.3. Total ~6.9.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"After the great fire" anchors the timeline in the opening line and recurs in line 18 ("After the great fire, the old names became knives"). The past-fire frame motivates the renaming project and the men's guilt, but no live clock tightens decisions on the page—events unfold in a single extended ritual without urgency or deadline. Setup met, middle development weak (timeframe provides context but does not compress choices), closure weak (no countdown or cost tied to elapsed time). Early +0.6, context for stakes +0.4, minus no tactical pressure from time −0.8, minus static/backdrop use −0.5, late-penalty waived (present from line 1). Total ~5.2, capped at 4.6 for missing development and closure gates; adjustment to 5.2 reflects strong thematic setup.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To cradle empathy in arms of steel" is stated in line 5 and motivates both renaming acts: the narrator offers shelter-names to the boy and labor-names to the perpetrators. The desire is dramatized in the tessera-handling ("steel crooks like a cradle around each shard") and tested when the crowd expects condemnation. Setup early, middle development (choice to rename rather than punish) strong, closure (past loosens after empathy is enacted) present. Early +0.7, two beats +0.9, closure +0.8, friction (desire vs. crowd's verdict) +0.6, cost (crowd's ambivalent breath, narrator's maintained vulnerability) +0.4, minus some label-speak ("cradle empathy" as phrase) −0.3, minus want not sharply conflicted with fear on-page −0.4. Total ~6.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Warm coldness" is named in line 13 and recurs in lines 13, 41, and implicitly in the final "loosening." The tone is consistent: the narrator offers shelter (warmth) within unyielding structure (coldness), and the crowd's reaction is "a warm coat of frost." Tone modulates subtly—cool philosophical distance in the opening, closer embodied action with the boy, cooler again with the perpetrators—and charges the final image (loosening without softening). Setup +0.6, development (tone guides both renaming beats) +0.9, closure (loosening reflects warm-cold paradox) +1.2, coherence +0.8, charges final image +0.7, minus label repetition without fresh embodiment −0.4, minus some declaration ("It is my chosen climate") −0.3. Total ~7.3.</comment>
