<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivations are clear and consistent—professional thoroughness and a desire to witness genuine transformation. Interiority is richly embodied through sensory perception ("the resin breath raised stray hairs") and contradictory impulses (selling counterfeits while wanting authentic change). Rhea's internal conflict between cartographic precision and empathic connection drives her choices. Minor deduction: the client's transformation feels slightly told rather than fully dramatized in micro-choices, though the final image of her breathing "with the patience of an animal" earns the shift.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered sensory detail, conceptual language ("half truths as stable carriers"), and the ritualized exchange. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Rhea's transformation crystallizes in the final image with felt cost ("her future had learned to walk beside others"). Orientation is clean by the opening paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when Rhea articulates the herd's faith and the narrator responds with the core insight about listening versus pretending to be landscape, which reweights the stakes and leads directly to the affectionate-detachment resolution.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The amber grotto is vividly rendered with sensory specificity ("honeyed hush pressed between stones," "fossils like almonds in glass") and constrains the encounter through its static-charged atmosphere. The blotter petal functions as micro-setting, handled twice and charging the final beat when Rhea presses it to her wrist. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. Minor gap: the grotto's properties feel more atmospheric than tactically essential—the static could occur elsewhere with minor adjustments.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: Rhea must reconcile insight with empathy before grant money ossifies into meaningless charts. The pressure deepens through the dialogue about the herd's half-truths and culminates in the narrator's key constraint: "the chest must not pretend to be landscape, only to be listening." Agency is exercised through shared ritual and Rhea's acceptance of the counterfeit as a bridge. Cost is visible in Rhea's acknowledgment that it's borrowed feeling, and her transformation forecloses the path of pure data or pure longing. One substantive tightening under the Accumulative lens is sufficient for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme—truth as motion rather than purity, practiced through affectionate detachment—emerges from concrete particulars: the herd reading "heat as water," the counterfeit balanced between burn and oblivion, half-truths as bridges. The final image of Rhea breathing "with the patience of an animal that understands direction" answers the central question non-literally, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates richly in silence and gesture (the spark between thumbs, the petal curling). Minor note: occasional abstract phrasing ("humane arithmetic," "nervous weather") flirts with thesis statement but remains tethered to scene pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single-POV first-person voice is distinct and sustained: lyric, philosophical, with a professional's measured cadence. Perceptual signature is strong—sensory detail filtered through the dealer's expertise in static electricity and emotional calibration. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext ("She asked what I wanted, since sellers always want something"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully. Minor deduction: some sentences compress multiple metaphoric vehicles in ways that occasionally slow immediacy under pressure ("the grotto's static serving as braille between our pulses" stacks sensation densely but remains legible).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is densely figurative with strong rhythmic control and varied syntax. Information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. Deductions: pervasive metaphoric density in nearly every sentence creates mild cognitive load ("sandalwood listened for regret, bergamot pressed for alertness") that occasionally slows momentum rather than sharpening it. A few near-paraphrase loops appear ("counterfeit" recurs as theme-word without always advancing pressure). The figurative language is coherent but borders on over-saturation in the middle third, triggering −0.5 for density without full pattern-teaching.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Premise is fresh: a dealer in counterfeit emotions who values client transformation over transaction offers a non-obvious synthesis. The lens of "half truths as stable carriers" and the sensory method (static electricity as emotional braille) feel specific and earned. Voice and concept cohere as singular artistic stance. Risk-taking in the lyric-philosophical register heightens stakes without gimmickry. The emotional specificity—Rhea's cartographic precision versus empathic pulse, the herd's faith-walk into dust—avoids generic templates. Minor note: the grotto setting and fragrance-work echo familiar mystical-transaction frames, but character detail and thematic rigor transform them.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Protagonist present throughout; decisions shape all key beats: choosing the specific counterfeit recipe, waving the petal, withholding touch, offering the bridge metaphor, and charging little. The dealer's choice to "witness a client subsume the product" drives the ending and its emotional cost. Three gates met; closure hinges on the dealer's professional and personal stance.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Blotter petal introduced early, handled in two distinct beats (waving beneath noses, Rhea taking it with the spark), and charged at closure when she presses it to her wrist. Its volatile properties and eventual curling signal satisfaction. Removal would collapse the transaction's physicality and symbolic weight. Specific irreplaceability: the paper-and-fragrance medium is integral to the method.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Half truths" frame the entire exchange, shaping stakes and tactics: the dealer explains them as "stable carriers," Rhea applies the concept to the herd reading heat as water, and the final transaction depends on accepting borrowed feelings as a bridge. The concept constrains the dealer's professional method and provides the moral calculus for affectionate detachment. Present across all three gates and causally active.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Professional thoroughness appears in the opening ("my work is professionally thorough when hearts are involved"), shapes the dealer's questioning and choice of counterfeit, and informs the careful withholding of touch ("careful as a surgeon"). It enables the transformation but also creates distance—a visible tradeoff. The trait could be slightly more tested under pressure; it reads more as consistent competence than contested constraint.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Subsume" appears as the dealer's explicit desire ("I wanted…to witness a client subsume the product") and Rhea's enacted transformation: she internalizes the counterfeit until "no one could tell who authored kindness." The action redefines the transaction's success and charges the ending. Present in setup (dealer's explanation), middle (Rhea's incorporation), and closure (the dealer believes "her transformation to complete"). Swappable with "integrate" or "internalize" only with tonal loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Static electricity signaled early as the dealer's sensory method ("sensing through static electricity like a bat of skin"), used in two beats (coat buttoned against the charge, the spark between thumbs), and tied to the grotto's amber properties. It shapes how the dealer reads clients and validates the exchange. Middle gate is thinner—the method is more atmospheric than tactically decisive. Lyric reprise at closure (static "purred around her") reweights but does not drive a choice.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Amber grotto introduced in the opening line, its static-charged atmosphere constrains the ritual, and fossils in glass appear at closure as the light thins. The setting's resin and trapped light create the conditions for the transaction. The grotto supplies resources (static, intimacy, symbolic weight) but could plausibly be replaced with another charged liminal space. Two gates solid; middle development is more tonal than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"As the transformation completes" is quoted in dialogue, framing the timeframe as process rather than deadline. The dealer tracks Rhea's shift ("her nervous weather cleared," "her eyes were steady") and withholds closure until transformation is legible. Time shapes pacing but does not tighten decisions under a live clock. Lyric accumulation rather than urgency; the phrase reweights the ending but time itself does not constrain tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rhea's desire to "fuse insight with empathy" is dramatized in her admission that charts are "warning flares" while her chest wants to answer the herd. The friction between cold edges and empathic pulse drives her choice to accept the counterfeit. The dealer's response—"the chest must not pretend to be landscape, only to be listening"—directly addresses the motivation and provides the resolution. Cost is visible: she must subsume borrowed feelings to bridge the gap. Three gates met with strong causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Affectionate detachment is named explicitly and enacted throughout: the dealer loves clients "for tougher reasons," offers a bridge "against my habit," and withholds touch while holding space. The tone modulates with pressure (tenderness at Rhea's herd story, restraint at the transfer) and charges the final image: "I stayed in the amber, available to no one in particular." Coherent and purposeful, though the explicit naming slightly reduces subtlety.</comment>
