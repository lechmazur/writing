<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The conjurer's motivation to understand his sister's disappearance through emotion-as-mathematics is present but often told rather than shown through pressure-driven choices. The flashback of the sister teaching fractions is anchored and does tilt present stance, staying within BRR allowances. However, interiority leans heavily on abstract formulation ("emotion can be graphed," "sorrow approaches a limit") rather than embodied contradiction under stress. The final choice to carry the theorem without solving it reads as renunciation with cost, but earlier beats lack the micro-choices that would make the arc feel fully earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is established by ~80 words (conjurer, cavern orchard, post-moon silence). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): he cannot solve the theorem but chooses to carry it, dovetailing the rope into his sleeve as memento and intention—a renunciation with felt cost. One meaningful deepening occurs when the mosaic yields the cracked theorem and he realizes longing is a variable, reweighting his prior grief. Escalation is gentle but present: the ritual builds through fruit arrangement and eye-threading until the stone "replies" with the theorem, which he then decides to live rather than test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The cavern orchard—mineral blossoms, dripping stalactites, fruit like cooled tears—is vividly rendered and functions as micro-setting. The stalactites provide the rope-anchor point and the drip-count for time, directly enabling the ritual. The stepping stone placed "on a flat root" and the eyes catching moonlight through a fissure are specific environmental constraints that shape the conjuring. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered, reflecting the conjurer's grief-charged attention without tourist cataloging.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: to achieve coherence between his sister's absence and his daily life ("the hinges stop squealing"). One meaningful tightening occurs when the mosaic's chipped geometry provides the theorem, narrowing his options from seeking reunion to accepting carriage of uncertainty. Agency is renunciation with cost—he leaves the eyes and carries only the rope-end, forgoing spectacle for "gentler mathematics." However, much of the escalation is contemplative rather than pressure-driven decision; the orchard invites rather than forces, and coincidence (moon threading through fissure) enables rather than complicates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—grief as unsolvable equation, coherence over reunion—emerges organically through ritual particulars and the mosaic's theorem. The final image (theorem he can carry but not solve) offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in the glass eyes' "counterfeit certainty" and the dovetailing gesture. The sister's laugh surviving "like a theorem whose proof is lost" is a strong particular. Minor slip: "love equals attention multiplied by time…" teeters near formula, but the piece frames it as cracked/provisional and immediately grounds it in the decision to adjust variables "the way he adjusts wicks."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited with strong perceptual signature: mathematics, performance, and mineral imagery filter all observation. Diction is elevated and lyric ("calcified into ambiguous loss," "dovetail her absence with his days") but remains internally consistent and voice-motivated. No head-hopping. Purposeful compression and patterned metaphor (fractions, theorems, equations) teach a lexicon early and hold it through closure. Minor debt: a few sentences approach register drift ("theorem whose proof is lost," "mislabel each other") where the abstractness risks pulling out of scene presence, but the POV's occupation as conjurer and grief-scholar makes the diction credible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, multiple paraphrase loops and template patterns appear: "He learned to fold silence…a gently inventive ritual" echoes "His conjuring is secretive…by craft"; "He wonders if emotion can be graphed" is restated as "if sorrow approaches a limit"; "dovetail" appears three times in similar constructions. Several sentences open with "He [verb]" across consecutive lines. Figurative language is dense throughout (mineral sweetness, theorem wearing festival clothes, lacquer taking fingerprints) without clear pattern-teaching, risking overwriting in a high-pressure beat. Applying patterned-artifact penalties: paraphrase loops −0.4, template cadence −0.4, density without payoff −0.3, total −1.1 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of grief-as-mathematics, taxidermy eyes as vision-ledger, and cavern ritual is specific and non-obvious. The mosaic theorem and the dovetailing gesture feel earned in hindsight. Emotional truth (ambiguous loss, the desire for coherence over reunion) anchors the conceptual frame. The piece commits fully to its lyric-metaphoric mode. Minor limitation: the cavern-as-theatre-for-private-conjuring and the use of symbolic objects to process grief are familiar templates in literary short fiction; transformation is present but not radical.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Secretive conjurer: present throughout, frames expectation early. He unpacks the box, arranges fruit, speaks names, threads the rope, ties it to the stalactite, and decides to leave the eyes and carry the rope-end. Two to three beats involve choices (arrangement, threading, departure gesture). The secretiveness shapes tone and the final pocket-dovetail. However, most beats are contemplative observation rather than high-stakes decision that alters tactics under pressure. Causal involvement is moderate; swapping "conjurer" for "mourner" or "ritualist" would require only minor edits. Score: setup +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage (pocket gesture) +0.5, causal pressure (moderate) +0.4, specificity (moderate) +0.3, late full agency (final third) −0.3, ornamental in middle −0.5. Baseline 3.0 + 1.8 = 4.8, round down 4.8 but score reflects stronger presence, 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Taxidermist's glass eye pair: unpacked early, placed toward ceiling, balanced (one in palm, one on stone), threaded with rope, left to keep watch. Four distinct beats; strong setup and payoff. The eyes' "counterfeit certainty" and their role as pendulum/vision-ledger charge the closure choice. Specificity high (taxidermist origin, clouded with age, swaying like pendulums). However, their use is primarily symbolic rather than mechanically constraining a tactic under pressure; removing them would weaken resonance but not break plot logic. Score: setup +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.6, causal pressure (symbolic, not tactical) +0.5, −0.4 swappability (other ritual objects could serve). Baseline 3.0 + 3.7 = 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Ambiguous loss: named once directly, but the entire story enacts it—sister's disappearance "calcified into ambiguous loss rather than clean grief," the survival of her laugh without body, the desire for coherence rather than reunion. It shapes the dominant stake and the final theorem (carry without solving). On-page choices (ritual, leaving eyes, carrying rope) all flow from this loss-state. The concept is not merely thematic echo; it changes the conjurer's options from seeking reunion to accepting uncertainty. Score: setup +0.7, beats (pervades but not discretely named in each) +0.6, closure linkage +1.2, causal pressure +1.0, cost connection +0.4, late explicit naming −0.2, some abstraction −0.5. Baseline 3.0 + 3.2 = 6.2, but "ambiguous loss" as phrase appears only once and much is implication, so 5.2.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Gently inventive: appears twice as label ("gently inventive ritual," "inventive as a tailor"). The ritual itself—threading eyes, knotting rope, arranging fruit in spirals—demonstrates inventiveness. The gentleness is visible in "whispers to the stone," "knotting them gently," and the renunciation of spectacle for "gentler mathematics." However, the trait is more descriptive than constraining; it flavors tone but does not create a visible tradeoff or foreclose an option. Score: setup +0.4, one beat (tailor knot) +0.4, payoff (gentler mathematics) +0.5, cost connection (renounces spectacle) +0.3, label-only in places −0.3, swappable (could be "patient ritualist") −0.4. Baseline 3.0 + 0.9 = 3.9, but presence across arc lifts to 4.9.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dovetail: used three times—"dovetail her absence with his days," chipped tesserae "dovetail with the constellations," and "dovetails the rope's end into a hidden pocket." The final gesture is the key turn: merging memento and intention, carrying the theorem forward. The verb's precision (carpentry join, seamless fit) charges the closure image. However, earlier uses are more metaphorical than mechanical; the middle use (tesserae/constellations) does not drive a plot turn. Score: setup (first use mid-story) +0.3, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.4, specificity +0.6, causal pressure (final gesture alters departure) +0.8, late first use −0.3, middle use ornamental −0.5. Baseline 3.0 + 3.2 = 6.2, round down to 6.1.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Via the chipped patterns on a mosaic stepping stone: the stone is unpacked early, placed on a flat root, eyes turned toward it, and it "replies with a cracked theorem" by showing "two curves meeting, approaching, never touching." The method is signaled and its mechanics (chipped geometry as language) matter at the midpoint revelation. However, the stone itself does not constrain earlier attempts or shape tactics; it is more oracle than tool. Score: setup +0.6, one major beat (theorem revelation) +0.4, payoff (stone maps a shifting proof) +0.7, specificity (chipped tesserae, mosaic language) +0.5, causal pressure (moderate, provides answer but does not force choice) +0.4, late full payoff (second half) −0.3, summary-only mechanics −0.4. Baseline 3.0 + 1.9 = 4.9, but the revelation is pivotal, so 5.4.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Cavern orchard nourished by dripping stalactites: setting is foregrounded immediately, provides the stalactite anchor for the rope, the drip-count for time, the mineral atmosphere, and the silence that frames the ritual. The orchard's hush and the ticking water directly shape the conjurer's pacing and mood. Fruit arrangement uses the space. The setting is not postcard; it pressures choices (where to place stone, where to tie rope) and charges the final image (stalactites ticking as he departs). Score: setup +0.8, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.0, causal pressure +1.2, specificity +0.7, cost connection (time constraint, mood) +0.4. Baseline 3.0 + 5.5 = 8.5, but some description is atmospheric rather than tactical, so 7.6.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>After the orchard grows silent beneath the moon: timeframe is signaled in the opening line and the moon's light through the fissure is essential to the ritual (eyes catching moonlight, rope of light). However, "after…grows silent" is vague and the passage of time within the ritual is unmarked except for stalactite drips. No urgency or deadline tightens decisions; the conjurer could wait indefinitely. The moon enables but does not pressure. Score: setup +0.7, one beat (moon/light rope) +0.4, moderate payoff (promises to return when moon remembers) +0.4, swappable (any night-quiet would serve) −0.6, vague duration −0.4. Baseline 3.0 + 0.5 = 3.5, but moon's thematic charge lifts to 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>To understand the mathematics of emotion: stated early as his purpose and enacted throughout (fractions memory, graphing emotion, sorrow as limit, love theorem). The ritual is an attempt to dramatize this desire. However, much is told rather than shown through conflicted choice; the desire is asserted more than tested against cost. The final theorem and decision to carry it without solving fulfill the motivation with visible renunciation. Score: setup +0.7, pervades but not discretely tested in beats +0.6, closure linkage +1.2, friction (wants understanding but accepts uncertainty) +0.8, cost connection +0.5, told-heavy in middle −0.5, some abstraction −0.6. Baseline 3.0 + 2.7 = 5.7, but thematic coherence lifts to 6.3.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Buried optimism: present in "buried optimism needs narrow tunnels, and tonight he can crawl through one," the moon lowering a rope of light, and the closing "which is enough for now." Tone modulates from grief-weight to tentative hope without sentimentality. The optimism is earned by the ritual's small success (a theorem to carry) and charges the final image. However, the phrase "buried optimism" appears only once and much of the piece is elegiac rather than hopeful; the tonal shift is subtle and could be missed. Score: setup (appears mid-story) +0.3, one key beat (moon-rope moment) +0.4, closure linkage (enough for now) +1.0, coherence through turns +0.5, charges final image +0.6, late first explicit mention −0.3, single-mood dominance (elegy) −0.5. Baseline 3.0 + 2.0 = 5.0, but the final note lifts to 6.0.</comment>
