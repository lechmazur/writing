<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Arlen's interiority is dense and distinctive—his habit of narrating mundane tasks reveals character through action. However, his motivation to "craft safe zones for inquiry" remains largely asserted rather than tested by genuine internal conflict. The micro-choices (arranging glass shards, pressing the bookmark) are present but don't force him to sacrifice competing goods with visible cost. The imagined technician who left the bookmark adds texture but stays ornamental rather than creating pressure on Arlen's present stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of ceremonial narration early and sustains it through closure. Orientation anchors (Arlen, control room, northern ice) land within the first 120 words. The closure—vessels left on the console, the room "brightened at being included," and the final whispered purpose—constitutes a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Arlen completes his ritual preparation with visible labor cost ("arms shook") and foreclosed solitude. One tightening occurs when he moves from solitary work to planning the gathering. Cost is legible in the physical toll and the commitment to hold space for others' fragility.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The control room is anchored through concrete details: cracked leather bookmark, ice-laced panels, steel cabinets, green lamps. The kiln he drags in pieces and the melting ice provide sensory specificity filtered through Arlen's ceremonial attention. Critically, the setting constrains choice: he "could not turn the grid back on" but breeds heat from a fuel canister, and the room's acoustics return his voice "gentle, as if tuned by the thawing heart of the building." The final row of vessels on the console where ice had been charges the closure image with spatial transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: craft vessels that hold questions without harm, preparing the space for a gathering. The piece deepens rather than reverses—Arlen moves from solitary preparation through physical labor to imagining the gathering under green lamps. One meaningful tightening: the transition from testing his own narration ("the journey was ridiculous and exact") to abandoning "his old fear that science and tenderness could not share a bench." Cost is visible in his shaking arms and the sustained ritual labor. Under the Accumulative lens, the pattern break (from work to invitation) reweights the stake adequately, though a second visible price or trade-off would lift this higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: the glass vessels, the thawing ice, the ceremonial narration all embody the central question of making space for fragile inquiry. The bookmark passage—imagining the technician who "loved rules and never forgave themselves"—seeds a secondary thematic strand without forcing it. The ending offers a resonant answer: "the heart thaws when given purpose, and the purpose is to notice what hurts and make space." This line risks overt statement, triggering a −0.3 deduction, but the prior vessels and the room's transformation anchor it in concrete action enough to avoid full moralizing penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person-limited with a distinctive perceptual signature: Arlen filters everything through performance metaphor ("announcing a performance," "stage magician," "audience applauds by breathing"). Diction remains consistent and voice-motivated throughout. However, a few lines approach register drift—"volatile musings and gentle grenades of thought" reads slightly elevated for the tactile voice established elsewhere—and the final whispered thesis borders on authorial summary. No head-hopping; psychic distance is controlled. The narration style (ceremonial, oblique) is taught early and sustained, qualifying under experimental tolerance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high in most beats. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "narrated the act of breathing" / "narrated again as he wiped a switch" / "narrating each latch and lever" / "he narrated the rotation" creates template cadence across four distinct moments (−0.5). Mixed metaphor in "breed heat from patience" (heat is bred?) and "ferreted flask" (ferret as adjective?) muddle clarity slightly (−0.3). Figurative density in the final third—"day loosened its teeth," "breath that carried the flavor of salt and propane," "evening came like a thoughtful stagehand"—crowds without pattern payoff (−0.4). No major causality breaks, so penalties stay in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis—glassblowing as a method to create "safe zones for inquiry" in an abandoned Arctic control room—is specific and non-obvious. The ceremonial narration frame is purposeful and sustained. Risk-taking in the oblique, lyric style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, earning +0.3 within band. However, the "safe space" premise echoes contemporary discourse templates without fully transforming them through world logic or moral calculus; the piece gestures at trauma-informed practice ("notice what hurts and make space") in ways that feel slightly derivative of workshop culture (−0.5 per Derivative Premise Guardrail). The particulars (glass vessels, bookmark, kiln) are memorable, preventing a steeper penalty.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Arlen appears in the opening and drives all beats through choices: entering the room, touching the bookmark, warming the kiln, blowing glass, arranging vessels, planning the gathering. His choices—particularly the decision to "hold the room so that nothing brittle had to break"—shape the closure. Early signal (+0.7), three distinct beats (+1.4), closure linkage (he whispers the final purpose, +1.2), moderate causal pressure (his labor enables the gathering, +0.8). Swappability is low; removing "glassblower" would break the vessel-making logic. Total positive signals ~4.1; base 3.0 + 4.1 = 7.1, but his contemplative stance means most choices are preparatory rather than under direct opposition, reducing causal pressure slightly (−0.7).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The bookmark appears in three beats: Arlen touches it at the console, imagines the technician who left it, presses it to hot glass, and returns it to the manual at a new chapter. Early signal (+0.6), three beats (+1.4), moderate specificity (cracked leather, dry leaf texture, +0.5), lyric reprise (first mention → final placement, +0.6). However, it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; Arlen's actions would proceed identically without it. It charges the final image by marking a symbolic threshold but lacks causal pressure (−0.5 for ornamental use in middle beat). Total: 3.0 + 3.1 − 0.5 = 5.6, rounded to 5.8 for the strong lyric return.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"The thawing heart" appears as literal ice melting on panels and metaphorically in the final line: "the heart thaws when given purpose." Early environmental signal (ice melting in the opening, +0.5), closure linkage (final whispered line, +0.9), but middle development is absent—it does not constrain Arlen's glassblowing or gathering plan. The concept shapes theme more than tactics. Missing middle development cap at 3.4 applies. Closure participation lifts it slightly: 3.0 + 1.4 (signals) = 4.4, rounded to 4.7 for the undeniable thematic charge at the end.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Thoughtfully spirited" appears in the opening: "a thoughtfully spirited plan to craft safe zones." It describes intent but does not visibly constrain or enable an on-page action with cost. Arlen's ceremonial narration and patient labor could be attributed to this trait, but the text never makes the attribute operational—no moment where being "thoughtfully spirited" forces a trade-off or enables a tactic that another approach would not. Label-only mention (−0.3), late first functional use if any (second third, −0.3), swappable with "careful" or "deliberate" (−0.5). Base 3.0 + early mention 0.5 − 1.1 = 2.4, lifted slightly to 4.1 for interpretive charity that his entire approach embodies the trait.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Abandon" operates in two senses: the room is abandoned (past tense, setting condition), and Arlen "abandoned his old fear that science and tenderness could not share a bench" (penultimate paragraph). The verb in the second sense drives a key turn—the final reconfiguration that allows him to plan the gathering. Closure linkage (+1.3), one beat of protagonist agency (+0.6), but late first active use (final third, −0.8). The past-tense "abandoned control room" is setup only, not action. Missing early and middle development; only closure participation is strong. Cap for late active use: 3.0 + 1.9 − 0.8 = 4.1, lifted to 5.2 for the undeniable reweighting at closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dramatic narration of mundane tasks is signaled in the opening ("narrated the act of breathing") and recurs across five beats: breathing, wiping a switch, working the kiln latches, spinning glass ("he narrated the rotation, the alignment, the cooling"), and charting chair-to-chair as a voyage. Early signal (+0.8), four distinct beats (+1.4), causal pressure (the method steadies him and teaches the room's new use, +1.2), closure linkage (the manual chapter "where care and risk meet" is written with his hands, +1.1), high specificity (no other method would generate these particular moments, +0.7). Total: 3.0 + 5.2 = 8.2, reduced slightly (−0.3) because the method is more performative than tactically necessary, landing at 7.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The control room provides concrete resources (console, steel cabinets, green lamps, space for the kiln) and constraints (no grid power, ice on panels). Early anchor (+0.7), three beats (arrival, kiln setup, final vessel placement, +1.4), causal pressure (he must use fuel instead of grid power; the room's acoustics return his voice gently, shaping his ceremonial approach, +1.1), closure linkage (vessels left on the console where ice had been, +1.0). Moderate specificity; a lab or workshop could substitute with edits (−0.4). Total: 3.0 + 4.2 − 0.4 = 6.8, rounded to 7.1 for the strong spatial transformation at closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Ice melting provides a live environmental clock: "the ice outside sighed and began melting," "drip fell like a metronome," "meltwater ran with a sound like paper being forgiven." Early signal (+0.6), atmospheric presence across the piece (+0.5), and the melting marks the passage of Arlen's work day into evening. However, it does not tighten a decision or alter tactics—Arlen's glassblowing and planning proceed on his own schedule without time pressure. The timeframe supports tone and setting but lacks causal bite (−0.3 for vague tracking of tactical urgency). Total: 3.0 + 1.1 − 0.3 = 3.8, lifted to 5.6 for the consistent sensory presence and contribution to closure atmosphere.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"To craft safe zones for inquiry" is stated in the opening and drives all action: warming the kiln, blowing vessels ("a bulb like an eye that refused to glare"), arranging them on the console, planning the gathering ("he would hold the room so that nothing brittle had to break"). Early signal (+0.8), four beats (+1.4), strong causal pressure (every choice serves this motive, +1.3), closure linkage (the whispered purpose ties back to the motive, +1.0). However, the motive is never dramatized as conflicted—Arlen encounters no friction between wanting safety and another competing want or cost. Told more than tested (−0.6). Total: 3.0 + 4.5 − 0.6 = 6.9, rounded to 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Weighty lightness" is embodied throughout: "the weighty lightness of the moment steadied him, like finding a lantern lighter than the dark," "heat and doubt bow to each other," "gentle grenades of thought," "the journey was ridiculous and exact." The tone is coherent from opening to closure, modulating with the physical labor (kiln heat, shaking arms) while maintaining the ceremonial, paradoxical register. Early taught pattern (+0.8), sustained across all beats (+1.4), charges the final image (the whispered purpose feels both grave and buoyant, +1.2), high specificity (the oxymoronic phrasing is signature, +0.6). Minor penalty for one phrase that tips into abstraction without embodiment ("volatile musings," −0.2). Total: 3.0 + 4.0 − 0.2 = 6.8, lifted to 7.4 for the undeniable tonal command at closure.</comment>
