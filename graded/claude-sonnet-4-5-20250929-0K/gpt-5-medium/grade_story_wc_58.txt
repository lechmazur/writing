<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation and method are articulated but remain abstract—"projecting presence" and "geography of healing" label rather than embody interiority. The woman client is given concrete emotion ("eyes are archives of low tides"), yet her choice to hire the narrator and accept the pages lacks visible conflict or cost; we see weeping but no trade-off. Micro-choices are minimal; the thread ritual and the bridge-walk feel performed rather than contested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (harbor, garden, narrator's role) arrive early. The closure—woman reads, weeps, receives the thread as pilgrim trail—lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: her shoulders "learn a slope that a future can rest on"). Cost is felt but oblique: she must navigate her house differently, and the man remains absent. The palace thread and quince-drop approval charge the final image, though the causal chain is thin; the narrative relies on density and cadence shift rather than because/therefore links.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The shadowed garden in autumn and the cracked fountain anchor the scene vividly. Quince trees bruise themselves fragrant, leaves spend shine, and the garden "recognizes" the narrator—all purposeful and filtered through the narrator's lyric lens. The thread as micro-object constrains the ritual (knotted, laid along names, looped on wrist) and charges the closure when it becomes the woman's pilgrim trail. Spatial choreography (stone lip, ivy door) remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—explaining the man's living absence so the woman can "sit at the table without drawing a second cup"—is clear. Pressure accumulates through the ritual (four names, thread song, bridge-walk), but no reversal or tightening forecloses a live option on the page. The man's confession ("the shape of their street would not let him breathe") arrives without resistance, and the woman's acceptance feels inevitable rather than won. Cost is signaled (future navigation, ongoing absence) but not tested.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—grief, absence, and the geography of healing—emerges through concrete ritual and image rather than statement. The final paragraph offers a resonant reconfiguration: "the space beside the teacup is not an ache but a small inland sea awaiting tide" reweights prior material without moralizing. The quince dropping "as if approving" and the thread as pilgrim trail avoid symbolic convenience by grounding resonance in the narrator's established method. No thematic echo mars the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Single POV, stable distance, and a lyric texture ("leaves like small coins spending their shine") create a distinct perceptual signature. Diction remains elevated and consistent, though some constructions verge on over-articulation ("I project presence across the slick stones"). The woman's single line of dialogue carries goal and subtext. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks; the compressed bridge-walk ("We speak without mouth or wind") fits the lyric mode and is taught early.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense and often purposeful ("lonesome splendor," "intimate geometry"), but some images clash or over-elaborate: "eyes are archives of low tides" and "wavering light" stacks metaphors without clear vehicle coherence. Paraphrase loops appear: "the season is always now" and "I work here because grief has seasonality" restate adjacently. Template cadence in the middle third ("He tells me... I understand... I write...") flattens momentum. The closure image is vivid and artifact-free, limiting total penalty to −0.8 in this category.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The premise—obituaries for the living, projecting presence via thread—is fresh and commits fully. The palace thread knotted to names and the pilgrim-trail repurposing show ingenuity. Risk is present in the lyric compression and non-confrontational closure. However, the emotional arc (woman arrives sad, leaves irrigated) follows a familiar template, and the man's absence-as-healing thesis feels abstractly resolved rather than tested. Specificity (quince, wolfshead prow, copper and kelp) anchors the vision.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The narrator-traveler frames the story, performs the thread ritual, walks the bridge, and drafts the obituary—all on the page across multiple beats. However, these are method applications rather than contested choices; no turn arises from the narrator's decision under pressure. The character enables the plot but does not alter tactics or face visible cost. Present in closure (hands over pages, loops thread) but not causally active there.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The palace carpet weft thread appears early ("I carry a palace carpet weft thread"), is used in the ritual (laid along names, knotted, hums), walked as a taut note, and returned with reweighted meaning when looped around the woman's wrist as pilgrim trail. Three distinct beats, closure linkage strong, specificity high (knotted ends, taut note, tide-pull firmness). Causal pressure moderate: it enables the ritual but does not narrow options under contest.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Explained absences" is named in paragraph two, shapes the narrator's method and the woman's request ("Explain his absence so that I may sit at the table"), and the obituary itself is the on-page artifact of this concept. It drives the dominant stake and the ritual structure. However, the concept remains more thematic than tactically tested; it does not constrain a choice or force a visible cost. Closure participation is indirect (the woman reads the document off-page).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Vividly descriptive" is enacted on nearly every page through figurative density ("quince trees bruise themselves fragrant," "small coins spending their shine," "eyes are archives of low tides"). The trait enables the narrator's method and voice but does not constrain or alter a key choice under pressure. It charges the final image effectively. No explicit cost tied to this trait; the density itself borders on over-elaboration in mid-beats, suggesting a trade-off between clarity and texture.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Intimate" governs the stone-lip seating ("an intimate geometry that makes bold the quiet"), the bridge-walk exchange ("intimate the way mirrors are"), and the thread-looping closure ("soft as breath and firm as tidepull"). It appears in three beats and charges the final image by reweighting distance into connection. The trait enables the narrator's method and the woman's acceptance. Causal pressure moderate; it does not force a contested turn, but removal would flatten the emotional arc and closure resonance.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Projecting presence" is introduced early ("I write by projecting presence into the gaps"), demonstrated in the bridge-walk ritual ("I lean until memory becomes a harbor wall, and I project presence across the slick stones"), and results in the meeting with the man. The method shapes two beats and enables the obituary. However, its mechanics remain abstract and untested; no cost or constraint tied to the projection itself. The element is more thematic device than tactical necessity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The shadowed garden in autumn frames the entire encounter, provides the cracked fountain seating, the quince-drop approval, and the ivy door exit. It anchors who/where by the third paragraph and charges the closure with "stubborn brilliance of leaving things." The garden "recognizes" the narrator post-ritual, suggesting reciprocal pressure. Micro-setting (stone lip, quince trees) constrains the intimate geometry and rhythm. Three beats, closure linkage strong, specificity high.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"After the last ship sails" appears in the opening line and in the woman's dialogue ("after the last ship sails, even a faithful clock keeps the wrong weather"). It establishes the world state and mood but does not tighten decisions or tactics on the page; no clock pressure or deadline alters the narrator's method or the woman's choice. The timeframe is thematic backdrop rather than narrative constraint. Two mentions, no causal work, no closure participation beyond atmosphere.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"To understand the geography of healing" is stated once near the bridge-walk ("my motivation, walled and windowed inside me, is to understand the geography of healing"). It labels the narrator's desire but is never dramatized in friction or choice; the narrator enacts the method without visible conflict between want and cost. The motivation does not shape a turn or constrain a tactic. Single mention, told-only, no closure participation. Thematic presence without on-page pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Lonesome splendor" is named in paragraph four ("paths lit by a lonesome splendor") and sustained throughout via diction: "wavering light," "quiet," "intimate geometry," "stubborn brilliance of leaving things." The tone coheres across beats and modulates appropriately (weeping as irrigating, not breaking; shoulders learning a slope). It charges the final image powerfully. The tone is not tested under pressure but remains consistent and purposeful, elevating the closure resonance without contradiction.</comment>
