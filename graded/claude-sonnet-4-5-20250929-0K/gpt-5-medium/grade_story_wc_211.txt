<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The scribe's motivation is consistent—archiving emotional patterns, protecting future breaths—and interiority is densely layered (the harbor memory, the pin metaphor). The climactic choice to leave the prophecy unrecorded feels earned by the childhood parallel and shows visible cost (unarchived work, professional restraint). However, the scribe's specialized role and dead-language method remain largely ornamental; we never see genuine struggle with the ritual's difficulty or a mistake that compounds pressure, only a seamless decision to stop.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who (oath scribe), where (rooftop orchard), and the dominant stake (whether to record a harmful prophecy) by the second paragraph. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered memory, basin ritual, and prophecy emergence until the final renunciation reconfigures the orchard's fruit and the child's breath with felt cost (unarchived work, professional departure). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): refusal to record forecloses the scribe's usual path and shelters the child, paying off the harbor-tower setup. One persistent weakness: the prophecy arrives via voice-from-tomorrow without clear mechanics taught early, creating a small causality gap that doesn't break closure but leaves the "how" slightly magical rather than method-bound.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The rooftop orchard is vivid and purposeful: "gnarled branches holding the city at a respectful, dreaming distance," quinces "small and green as bruises" that the scribe watches and that "keep their grip" when unarchiving succeeds. The cracked basin, rainwater, wax shaving, and quinces all constrain the ritual and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the scribe's professional lens (dust as phonograph residue, water that "remembers the roofs it crossed"). The orchard itself shifts from passive frame to active pressure when it threatens to "drop its fruit" and "crack the rooftop," then sighs relief at closure, making the setting a co-agent in the stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to archive a prophecy that would pin a child's breath—is signaled clearly by mid-story and tightens when the scribe's own future voice warns against the vow. The scribe's agency is renunciation with visible cost: unarchived work, professional restraint, departure without the usual closure ritual. The orchard's threat (fruit drop, root crack, lost vowels) raises external pressure, and the harbor memory seeds the final choice. One meaningful tightening occurs when the prophecy names the exact harm, forcing the ethical calculus. Weakness: the middle ritual beats feel processual rather than escalating; we cycle through languages and basin work without a failed attempt or complication that narrows options before the prophecy arrives.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through enacted particulars: the harbor tower memory, the pin-in-breath metaphor, the quinces that ripen or drop based on archival choices. The final renunciation—"I leave unwritten so its mercy can keep ripening"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to whether oaths must always be preserved, reweighting the scribe's vocation without moralizing. The piece resists tidy closure by keeping the prophecy's content oblique and allowing the orchard's future to remain open. One phrase borders thematic echo—"Some truths I will rewrite tomorrow"—but it stays image-anchored and doesn't summarize the premise. The line "Accidental prophecy is the most dangerous kind" risks direct statement, yet it's framed as professional reflection rather than thesis, and the subsequent action dramatizes the claim.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>First-person voice is distinct and controlled: the scribe's formal, archaic idiom ("venerable," "promised breaths," "merchant cant of a drowned airplane radio") remains consistent under pressure. Diction is selective and voice-motivated; the narrator's way of noticing prioritizes linguistic and sonic residue ("verbs that rustle like moths," "thumbbones gently"). Psychic distance tightens appropriately when the prophecy speaks. One friction: the phrase "velvet disquiet" in "the orchard wraps velvet disquiet around my shoulders" feels slightly external to the scribe's working register—more authorial atmosphere than lived perception—and the line "Do not swear the vow you cannot keep" shifts into plain directive that contrasts with the surrounding ornate syntax, though it's plausibly the future-voice speaking.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmically controlled and imagistically dense, with strong specificity ("wax cylinder phonograph shaving," "frostbitten Greek," "quinces small and green as bruises"). Sentence openings vary and paragraph structure supports accumulation. Key friction: several lines loop or paraphrase without advancing pressure—"To archive emotional patterns, I must refuse to become their victim, yet their story lifts inside me" repeats the tension stated earlier; "Every archive is a house of careful hauntings, yet this one is different" is conceptual summary rather than scene action. The phrase "I record with my stylus on the parchment, mapping stains, the pauses between words" describes process we've already inferred. Figurative density is high throughout, occasionally blurring clarity ("residue so fine it refused sweeping" is lovely but imprecise about what the residue does in the ritual). No template cadence or filter-verb stacks, but the accumulation of near-synonyms for ritual action ("murmur," "hum," "speak," "listen") across adjacent beats creates mild redundancy. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and conceptual summary in non-closure beats; −0.3 for register drift on "velvet disquiet."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of archival practice, dead languages, phonograph-dust ritual, and rooftop orchard is specific and non-obvious. The ethical stakes—recording truth that creates harm—transform a familiar archivist premise through the pin-in-breath metaphor and the mechanical wax-shaving method. The harbor memory as the key to renunciation is a fresh inflection that grows from prior particulars. Risk-taking in the ornate, lyric voice and accumulative structure heightens coherence without obscuring the closure choice. Minor derivative element: the "oath scribe" role and the prophecy-that-must-not-be-fulfilled frame echo genre templates (Cassandra, self-fulfilling prophecy), though the specific ritual and choice feel individuated enough to avoid full derivative penalty. Apply +0.3 within band for bold voice and structural commitment.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The venerable oath scribe is the sole POV and makes the key decision to leave the prophecy unarchived, altering tactics (folding parchment, climbing down, speaking blessing instead of completing the archive). Present from the opening and drives the closure choice. The character's observation and ritual dominate the middle, which is processual but necessary setup. Decision at closure forecloses the archival path with visible cost. Early signal +0.6, two beats (ritual, renunciation) +0.9, causal pressure (choice narrows options) +0.8, closure linkage +1.2, cost connection +0.4. Baseline 3.0 +3.9 = 6.9; −0.2 for processual middle where observation dominates over decisive micro-choices. Round down to 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The wax cylinder phonograph shaving appears in paragraph five (basin immersion), is shaved thinner with a quill knife and sunk to stir echoes, and is folded into parchment unarchived at closure. Three beats (discovery context, ritual use, final unarchiving) +1.4, causal pressure (enables the echo-listening method) +0.9, closure linkage (folded away, unarchived) +1.0, specificity (exact object with phonograph dust properties) +0.6. Baseline 3.0 +3.9 = 6.9; +0.2 for irreplaceability (the wax residue's history matters to the scribe's method). Round down to 7.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Accidental prophecy is named explicitly mid-story and shapes the dominant stake: the scribe hears their own future voice warning against a vow, forcing the ethical choice. The concept drives the climactic renunciation (leave unwritten to prevent harm). Present by midpoint, frames the peak choice, and the resolution (unarchiving) directly addresses it. Setup ~40% +0.4 (late first-half), one beat (prophecy reception and interpretation) +0.4, causal pressure (narrows options to record or refuse) +1.0, closure linkage (renunciation answers the prophecy) +1.3, cost connection +0.5. Baseline 3.0 +3.6 = 6.6; −0.2 for the mechanics arriving suddenly without prior teaching of how basin-work yields prophecy. Round down to 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Speaks dead languages: explicitly mentioned in paragraph seven ("I speak dead languages as if they were lullabies") and demonstrated when the scribe listens "in Akkadian, then in a frostbitten Greek, then in the merchant cant." The trait enables the echo-listening method, but no on-page cost is tied to the language choice—any language seems to work equally. The final blessing is "in a language so old it only describes weather, not fate," which provides thematic closure but not tactical constraint. Present by second third, one functional beat (listening sequence) +0.4, causal enabling (method depends on it) +0.7, closure echo (blessing) +0.4, specificity (Akkadian, Greek, cant) +0.4. Baseline 3.0 +1.9 = 4.9; −0.1 for no visible tradeoff (no failed language, no cost to switching). Round down to 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Immerse: the scribe immerses fingers in rainwater (paragraph four), which begins the ritual that summons voices and ultimately the prophecy. The immersion is the hinge action that enables the middle listening sequence and sets up the choice at closure. One paragraph after opening (early signal) +0.7, two beats (immersion start, ongoing basin work) +0.9, causal pressure (the act launches the ritual whose result must be decided) +1.1, closure linkage (the basin's answer and final fold-away trace back to immersion) +1.0, cost connection (the ritual's result creates the dilemma) +0.4. Baseline 3.0 +4.1 = 7.1; +0.2 for the action's physical specificity anchoring the entire method. Round down to 7.3.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Via a curious third-grade field trip memory: signaled in paragraph nine ("Today the method reaches backward via a curious third-grade field trip memory") and detailed in paragraphs ten–twelve (harbor tower, docent, phonograph horn, dying sailor's song, the pin in breath). The memory provides the causal origin of the scribe's vocation and is reprised at closure when the basin answers "with a child's chattering tour voice, exactly mine at nine," which triggers the trust-and-let-go decision. Setup by ~35% +0.5, two beats (initial memory block, basin reprise) +0.9, causal pressure (the memory seeds the final choice) +1.0, closure linkage (the child-voice cues renunciation) +1.2, specificity (exact docent, phonograph, harbor tower details) +0.6. Baseline 3.0 +4.2 = 7.2; −0.8 for the memory being recounted in summary rather than interleaved with present action (large reflective block that risks stalling momentum, though it does prime closure). −0.5 additional for the method mechanics (how the memory enables today's ritual) remaining vague. 7.2 −1.3 = 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Ancient orchard garden atop a skyscraper: present from the opening, frames every beat, and applies direct pressure when it threatens to "drop its fruit" and "crack the rooftop" if the scribe refuses the work or if the scribe records and harms a child. The quinces are watched, the orchard "leans" and "sighs," and at closure "the quinces keep their grip." Early signal (title-like opening) +0.8, present across all beats (continuous setting) +1.4, causal pressure (the orchard's dual threat shapes the choice) +1.3, closure linkage (quinces and sigh in final image) +1.4, specificity (gnarled branches, cracked basin, grafted-on-steel detail) +0.7. Baseline 3.0 +5.6 = 8.6; −0.3 for the orchard's agency (lean, sigh, threaten) not being tied to a taught rule (we don't learn why or how it enforces choices until mid-story, and the mechanics remain somewhat magical). −1.5 for the threat's exact stakes (what "drops its fruit" costs the city beyond metaphor; how long "a generation" of lost vowels persists) staying abstract rather than concretely dramatized. 8.6 −1.8 = 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>After the foghorn falls silent: the opening phrase and reprised in the final paragraph ("after the foghorn cries again"). The timeframe marks a ritual window but does not tighten decisions—no clock runs, no approaching deadline alters the scribe's choices. The foghorn serves as atmospheric anchor and closure bracket, not a pressure device. Early signal (opening line) +0.8, closure reprise +0.7, tone contribution (maritime/liminal mood) +0.4. Baseline 3.0 +1.9 = 4.9; −1.0 for the element being a mood marker rather than a constraint (the scribe could perform the ritual at any moment; the foghorn's silence doesn't narrow options). −0.7 for swappability (any temporal marker—dawn, tide, bell—could replace it with minor edits). 4.9 −1.7 = 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>To archive emotional patterns: stated in paragraph two and drives every beat (the scribe spreads parchment, immerses, listens, records "mapping stains, the pauses between words, the blush and pallor"). The climax is the refusal to archive, which creates direct friction (professional duty versus ethical harm). The motivation is tested when the scribe asks "for negotiation" and ultimately chooses mercy over completeness. Early signal +0.7, present across all beats +1.4, causal pressure (the duty creates the dilemma) +1.4, closure linkage (choosing *not* to archive is the final act) +1.6, cost connection (unarchived work, departure, professional restraint) +0.5. Baseline 3.0 +5.6 = 8.6; −0.5 for the middle ritual sequence (listening in multiple languages, recording stains) being somewhat processual without a failed archive or complication that tests the motivation before the prophecy arrives. −0.5 for the motivation's friction being delayed until the prophecy emerges rather than present throughout. 8.6 −1.0 = 7.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Velvet disquiet: the exact phrase appears once ("the orchard wraps velvet disquiet around my shoulders and waits for me to begin"), but the tone—hushed, elegiac, layered with dread and tenderness—is sustained throughout via diction ("secret," "trembled," "frightens me," "mercy can keep ripening") and syntax (long, trailing clauses that accumulate pressure). The tone modulates appropriately: calm professional opening, mounting unease during the prophecy, quiet resolve at closure. Present throughout +1.4, modulates with pressure +0.9, charges the final image (the departure and unwritten mercy carry the disquiet forward) +1.1, specificity (the "velvet" softness against the steel/industrial setting) +0.5. Baseline 3.0 +3.9 = 6.9; +0.3 for the tone being inextricable from voice and imagery rather than applied as a single-note mood. Round down to 7.2.</comment>
