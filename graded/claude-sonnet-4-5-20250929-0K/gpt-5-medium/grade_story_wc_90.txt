<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is richly embodied through the gravitational weight mechanic, which physicalizes emotional states in a character-specific way. Internal contradiction appears in the pacifist caretaker forced to "push open" and the balance between joy and grief that must act simultaneously rather than sequentially. The shadow-work beat in the greenhouse ("naming the angers I never used") dramatizes genuine self-confrontation with visible micro-choices. Minor slip: a few moments edge toward therapy-speak ("shadow work," "workable buoyancy") but recover quickly through concrete action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its pattern early (lyric fragments, thematic density) and deepens pressure through the weight-balance constraint until the final turn when the lock opens and reveals seeds rather than weapons. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): "I sealed the door behind me, but not with locks; I stitched a promise along the seam with my breath" reweights the entire opening stake with visible cost (renunciation of conquest, acceptance of tending). Orientation anchors are present by line three (ship, caretaker, post-human timeframe). One meaningful deepening occurs when the protagonist realizes the chamber holds "a library that taught the art of beginning again," which narrows the mission from unlocking to stewardship.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The recycled spaceship, photograph albums, greenhouse, and the stone constrain multiple choices: navigation via tear-shimmer, the weight-sensitive lock mechanism, and the final decision to tend rather than conquer. Spatial choreography is clean (portholes, bulkhead scale, rail catch). The body-as-micro-setting (gravitational weight shifts) directly charges the closure when joy "loosens my boots from the floor" and the narrator must catch the rail. Minor gap: the comet anchorage and chamber interior receive less tactile grounding than earlier beats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unlock the dimension) is signaled early and tightens through the balance constraint: too light or too heavy seals the lock. The greenhouse shadow-work beat narrows options by requiring self-integration before approach. Peak escalation occurs when the door "tasted my balance and my grief, and asked for a story paid in breaths," forcing the protagonist to offer oral testimony rather than mechanical force. Closure choice (seal with a promise, not locks) forecloses the conquest path with visible cost: perpetual tending and solitude. One clean reversal when the chamber reveals seeds rather than a weapon redefines the mission with immediate ethical weight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the balance constraint and shadow-work particulars: compassion requires holding contradictions rather than purging darkness. The orchard and pacifist-woman stories in the climax concretize the theme without stating it. The final image—"tending sprouts that finally dare to rise, and watching the balance of my heart"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to whether unlocking means conquest or stewardship. The kwan yin's tear recurs with reweighted meaning (cool restraint enabling integration). No thematic echo or explicit moral; the piece trusts the reader to infer from the seed chamber and stitched promise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: the narrator notices weight, texture, shimmer, and emotional calibration in character-specific ways. Diction is largely stable and lyric ("ghostly resolve," "lunar rain," "minnows in a jar"). Distance control is clean; no head-hopping. Two slips lower the score: "shadow work" is therapy-speak that breaks register in the greenhouse beat, and "workable buoyancy" feels slightly clinical under peak pressure. Rhythmic control is strong through the lock sequence, but a few template stems appear in the album-memory passage ("I told it about... I told it about..."). Free indirect style is otherwise clean and the voice reads singular.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Information density is high; nearly every line advances stake or image. Sentence openings vary and the read-aloud rhythm modulates well. Two artifact clusters: paraphrase loop in the middle third (the "compassion without its shadow is brittle" beat restates prior interiority without added pressure) and a brief synonym run when describing the chamber contents ("seeds and sleeping words," "blueprint for a conversation," "library," "catalog" in rapid succession). The stock metaphor "moths" for futures feels generic. Minor filter-verb stack ("I felt myself lighten," "I felt joy rise") in the closure sequence reduces immediacy slightly. No loops touch the final beat directly, so closure clarity remains intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The premise (post-human caretaker unlocking a dimension via emotional weight calibration) synthesizes fresh elements with specificity. The gravitational-weight mechanic and tear-map navigation avoid stock tropes. The reversal (seeds/library rather than weapon) feels earned by the pacifist frame. Emotional truth in the shadow-work and balance sequence grounds the speculative elements. Risk: the lyric compression and omitted connective tissue between beats could obscure, but the closure remains legible. Minor proximity concern: "ghostly resolve" and "moth" imagery trend toward familiar idiom without full transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The steadfast pacifist trait is signaled early ("born a steadfast pacifist") and shapes two key decisions: the refusal to "wrench" the lock (using forgiving weight instead) and the climactic promise to "only unseal what could be tended, not conquered." The pacifism constraint enables the lock-opening tactic (stories rather than force) and charges the closure choice. Present in setup, middle choice, and ending. Cost is visible: perpetual solitude and tending rather than conquest. Slightly weakened by told-rather-than-shown origin ("born... not from doctrine"), but the on-page choices are decisive.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Kwan yin's tear appears in three distinct beats: discovery in the temple photograph, use during shadow-work ("held kwan yin's tear and let my fists unclench"), and implicit presence when the narrator achieves "workable buoyancy" at the lock. The stone enables the emotional calibration tactic and its cooling property contrasts with the protagonist's heat of anger. Present in setup, constrains middle choice, and its teaching (forgiving weight) directly shapes the final approach. Cost connection: without it, the balance likely fails. Specificity is high (lunar rain, cooling pulse). Cap at mid-7s because it does not appear in the final image itself, only its lesson does.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Shadow work is named explicitly in one beat ("The counselors of old would have called it shadow work") and dramatized in the greenhouse sequence where the narrator names unused angers and unclenches fists. This internal integration is causally necessary for the lock to "murmur" and open. The concept shapes the middle tactic (self-integration before approach) and the thematic premise (compassion requires holding contradictions). Present in setup (hinted via "half-life" and "brittle compassion" earlier) and middle, but does not appear in or shape the final image directly. The closure is about tending, not shadow work per se. Mid-band: one strong beat involvement, causal pressure, but no closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The gravitational weight trait constrains on-page action in at least four beats: initial description, the lock's mechanism ("listened to weight like a judge"), the climactic approach ("I felt myself lighten into a workable buoyancy"), and the final moment when joy "loosening my boots from the floor" requires the narrator to catch a rail. The trait is signaled early, enables the central tactic (emotional calibration to open the lock), and charges the closure image with visible physical consequence. Irreplaceable: no other attribute could substitute without breaking the lock logic. Cost is legible: the protagonist must achieve precise emotional balance under existential pressure, and even post-closure must manage it to avoid floating off.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Stitching appears in three forms: metaphorical ("stitch more than circuits; I had to stitch myself, thread to shadow"), the promise stitched "along the seam with my breath" at closure, and the broader integration work (shadow to self). The final seal-by-stitching is a non-violent closure act that fits the pacifist frame and transforms the initial "push open" directive. Present in setup metaphor, implied in middle integration work, and literal in the ending action. Causal role in one major beat (closure). Mid-band: the stitching metaphor threads through but the literal act occurs only at the end, limiting beat count. Elevating factor: the closure image depends on it.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The tear-shimmer navigation method is introduced early ("I navigated via the faint shimmer of long-dried tears on faded photographs"), used in the approach ("Under starlight, the salt veins glowed, pointing through the portholes"), and referenced at closure ("the maps of tears faded, their work complete"). The method enables wayfinding across space and charges the thematic link between grief and guidance. Present in setup, middle approach, and closure acknowledgment. Three-beat involvement with causal pressure (without the maps, the lock's location remains unknown). Specificity is high (dried tears as salt veins, glow under starlight). Cap just below 7.0 because the mechanics are asserted more than dramatized in tactical detail.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The recycled spaceship provides the greenhouse (site of shadow work), photograph albums (navigation tool), portholes (observation points), bulkhead scale (lock interface), and rail (physical anchor at closure). The setting supplies multiple resources that alter tactics and outcome. The "quilt of hulls and histories" framing charges the theme of repurposing and care. Present throughout, constrains choices in middle beats (greenhouse introspection, album-guided navigation, scale approach), and the rail catch at closure prevents the protagonist from floating away. Strong micro-setting work (body, stone, albums function as setting extensions). Slightly undercut by the comet anchorage being told rather than shown affecting a choice.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the last human is born" is signaled early and establishes existential stakes (no future humans to serve) and the mission's purpose (access unborn futures). It motivates the protagonist's isolation and the "final echo" self-concept. However, the timeframe does not create a live ticking clock or alter tactics within the plot. The post-human condition is thematic context rather than a pressure mechanism. Present in setup, informs motivation, but does not tighten decisions or constrain middle moves. No closure participation beyond ambient tone. Mid-low band: functional context, but replaceable with minor edits (e.g., "last generation" would work similarly).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation to unlock the dimension is established in the first paragraph ("my purpose was to push open a locked dimension") and tested throughout: the balance constraint forces emotional integration, the lock "asks for a story," and the climax reveals seeds that redefine the mission from unlocking to stewardship. Desire faces friction between the protagonist's pacifist nature and the "push" directive, creating authentic tension. The final choice to "only unseal what could be tended, not conquered" is a motivated evolution of the initial goal. Present in setup, drives middle tactics (shadow work, calibrated approach), and reconfigures at closure with visible cost (perpetual care). Strong causal pressure and cost connection.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Ghostly resolve appears in the opening ("moving with ghostly resolve through rooms that used to hum"), recurs at the peak choice ("I promised, with ghostly resolve, to only unseal what could be tended"), and modulates through the piece: quiet determination in the greenhouse, calibrated patience at the lock, and tempered joy at closure ("laughing softly, because that laughter was ballast, not escape"). The tone is coherent through reversals and charges the final image (the protagonist remains alone but resolved, tending sprouts). Diction and rhythm support the tone without static repetition. Strong integration: the tone is both descriptor and engine, shaping how pressure is met.</comment>
