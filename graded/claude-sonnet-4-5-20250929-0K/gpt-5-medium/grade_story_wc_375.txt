<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The portrait artist's interior is vividly embodied through charcoal-stained hands and mnemonic gift, with contradiction visible in the tension between selling "quick smiles" and suppressed wild creativity. The decision to descend and open the strongbox is motivated by grief and economic survival, and the cost—returning to face Vera's death and their abandoned calling—reads as earned. Minor slip: the faces in crystals "nod as if relieved" edges toward convenient external validation rather than pure internal reckoning, but the choice to bring pages upstairs with Vera's name forecloses the path of pure survival.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who (artist), where (carnival/boardwalk), and when (after closing) by the opening lines. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure accrues through the descent, crystal faces, broken lock, and charcoal-sketch solution, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise + micro Decisive Change) where the artist commits to signing pages with Vera's name, reweighting the survival-versus-calling tension. Cost is legible: "something in me has opened that will not close" forecloses the purely commercial path. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length, and the lens holds without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The subterranean crystal cave constrains the climactic choice—charcoal drawn on crystal aligns imaginary tumblers with steel, a micro-setting move that charges the closure. Sensory detail (mineral air, violet/green glow, damp stalagmites) is selective and filtered through the artist's mnemonic POV. The recurring charcoal—from boardwalk to cave to final frame—acts as both tool and thematic object, present in the final image. Minor: the carnival stalls above receive less tactile grounding than the cave, but spatial choreography remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncork suppressed creativity versus survival economy—signals early and tightens through the descent. The broken lock becomes the escalation point: knowledge (mnemonic recall) alone cannot turn grief-split metal, forcing the artist to use portraiture (charcoal sketch) to solve it, a choice that embodies the calling. Cost is visible: retrieving wild pages and committing to sign them with Vera's name forecloses the commercial-only path. One meaningful tightening drives the closure under the Accumulative lens; no multiple reversals required at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—inescapable calling versus economic survival—emerges through concrete image: charcoal veins, hidden door, broken lock, faces in crystal, and the wax-sealed jar. The final act (signing with Vera's name, "a door beneath home") reweights prior material without stating a moral. The strongbox containing "first fearless mistakes" and the gallery contract that "tried to own the cave's light" root the thematic question in specific conflict. The closing image—"something in me has opened that will not close"—offers resonant, non-literal closure. No Thematic Echo penalty; the artist's realization is embodied in action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Single POV, stable distance, and a distinct perceptual signature: "recall cheeks and crow's feet like streets in a town I can walk blindfolded." Diction is lyric and controlled ("auroral sorrow," "breathless, patient glow") with purposeful compression that reads as pattern-taught early and paid off at closure. Minor slip: "auroral sorrow that always swells at the end of noise pours through" edges toward elevated register in one beat, but the voice remains consistent and the metaphoric density serves the accumulative design. No head-hopping; elision of backstory (Vera's death, gallery contract) is strategic and anchored in present stimuli.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High information density with sentences that layer action, image, and theme. Rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language (crystal "like frozen dawn," tumblers "thrum") is coherent and voice-motivated. Template-cadence check: the repeated structure "after the last echo of laughter fades" (opening, midpoint, near-closure) reads as intentional motif rather than loop, since each instance reweights the phrase. Minor artifact: "the broken combination lock mocking how knowledge alone cannot turn what grief split" stacks metaphor and abstraction in one line, momentarily slowing the beat. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The synthesis—portrait artist uses charcoal drawing to repair a physical lock in a crystal cave—is specific and non-obvious, transforming the mnemonic-gift premise into a tactile closure mechanism. The combination of carnival setting, hidden subterranean studio, and the contract theft grounds the calling-versus-survival theme in particular stakes. Risk: the lyric density and accumulative structure could obscure causality, but the piece teaches its pattern early and holds it through closure. The transformation test passes: plot and arc would collapse with generic substitutions. No close echoes of famous work detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Character present throughout, drives the descent and lock-opening decision, and the choice to sign pages with Vera's name closes the arc. Three beats: boardwalk sketching, cave descent, strongbox opening. Causal pressure: mnemonic recall fails, forcing use of portraiture skill to solve the lock, which embodies the calling and rectifies suppressed creativity. Early signal, closure linkage, and cost all present.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Object appears twice: recalled as broken when the artist mentions spinning the dial "by ear" before Vera's death, then physically encountered and opened via charcoal sketch. It narrows options (knowledge alone cannot turn it) and enables the climactic act. Cost tied directly: grief split the mechanism, and the repair-by-drawing enacts the calling. Present in closure beat. Early setup, beat involvement, causal pressure, and closure linkage all met.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Concept shapes stakes explicitly: Vera's belief in "inescapable callings, the kind that tug like undertow" motivates the descent and frames the artist's survival-versus-calling tension. The final line—"I am called, and though I will sell quick portraits tomorrow, something in me has opened that will not close"—dramatizes the concept with visible cost (foreclosing the purely commercial path). Present in opening third, middle reflection, and closure. Two beats and closure linkage met; causal pressure moderate but sufficient.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Attribute enables two key actions: recalling the lock combination "without effort" and sketching faces that populate the cave crystals. It also constrains: memory alone cannot turn the broken mechanism, forcing the artist to use drawing instead, which embodies the deeper gift. Cost visible: the mnemonic skill stores "maps under your skin" but "knowledge alone cannot turn what grief split." Early signal, beat involvement, causal pressure, and cost all present.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Action frames the entire arc: the artist descends "to rectify the wrong the world did to strange makers," retrieves pages to "rectify the theft of my younger courage," and closes with "start rectifying the ledger." The strongbox contains the gallery contract that tried to own the cave's light—the original wrong. The final decision to sign pages with Vera's name enacts rectification with visible cost. Early setup, two beats (descent purpose, closure commitment), causal pressure, and closure linkage all met. Irreplaceable: the action defines the stakes.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Method signaled early: "a painting with something behind it, my mentor Vera's skylit harbor scene decoying the door we built." Used twice on-page: lifted to reveal the stair at descent, then "slide[d]...into place" at return, with sensory payoff ("frame is snug, the hallway smells of salt and graphite"). The hidden-door motif returns in the final image ("a door beneath home"), charging closure. Early setup, two beats, and closure reprise all met. Specificity high: the exact painting and its concealment matter.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setting constrains the climactic choice: the artist sketches the lock "across the smoothest crystal," and "drawn tumblers thrum, aligning their imaginary notches with the wounded steel as lights shiver"—the cave's properties enable the solution. Sensory detail (violet/green shards, mineral air, damp) is filtered through POV and integrated into action. The cave also supplies the strongbox and Vera's lamp. Early arrival, causal pressure at climax, and closure participation (faces "nod," climb back toward "a world like a painting") all met. Irreplaceable: no other setting would allow this mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Timeframe signals opening, midpoint, and near-closure: "after the last echo of laughter fades" marks carnival closing, the descent, and the strongbox moment, each instance reweighting the phrase. The temporal marker creates rhythm and charges the ending ("the night seems less intent on silence"). Two beats and closure reprise met. Moderate causal pressure: the timeframe does not tighten a live clock but does modulate tone and frame transitions. Early setup and closure linkage present; lyric reprise lifts the score into mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation dramatized early: "to uncork suppressed creativity, to loosen the bottle stopper pressed into my throat by grief, embarrassment, and the economy of survival." Conflicted in choice: the artist has "shut the door below" for economic survival, and the descent risks confronting Vera's death. Payoff: opening the strongbox and committing to sign pages with Vera's name enacts the uncorking with visible cost (foreclosing pure survival). Early signal, two beats (descent decision, strongbox opening), causal pressure, and closure linkage all met. Cost tied directly to motivation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Tone established early: "auroral sorrow that always swells at the end of noise pours through the empty stalls like a soft tide." Modulates with pressure: the descent carries "hush," the cave "breathless, patient glow," the laugh "lands and rolls...until it is thin," and the return scene "smells of salt and graphite" with "the night seems less intent on silence." Coherent through turns and charges the final image. Early setup, consistent presence across beats, and closure participation all met. Distinct and voice-integrated.</comment>
