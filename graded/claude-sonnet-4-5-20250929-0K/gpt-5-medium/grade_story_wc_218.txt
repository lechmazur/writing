<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The caretaker's interiority is grounded in concrete tasks (copper wire, grafting) and contradictory impulses—brazen calm alongside mortality—are present but mostly told rather than dramatized in real-time struggle. The late communal turn ("A council formed") introduces new actors without clear status dynamics or individual resistance, flattening the protagonist's singular arc. Micro-choices like placing the diary and winding the final copper circle embody renunciation with visible cost, meeting the baseline for Earned Stasis. The reflective passages anchor to present stimuli (pillars humming, gulls dropping shells) and tilt present stance, satisfying BRR expanded mode, but the protagonist's agency in the final third becomes more curatorial than conflicted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (island caretaker, temple orchard, morning) land early; the piece teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens by ~25% through layered sensory detail and recurring motifs (copper, diary, pillars). Closure reads as Earned Stasis: the protagonist completes the remodel and lies down, returning to "the woven map we had made" with visible cost (exhaustion, the winding of the final copper circle, the diary left beneath the oak). Cost is legible but oblique—the ending offers resonance over sharp sacrifice. One meaningful deepening occurs when the orchard begins to respond (pillars shading seedlings, oaks leaning), tightening the protagonist's commitment. The late communal shift (council, otters, neighbors) introduces new material without clear escalation, diluting singular pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The living stone pillars, copper wire, and volcanic pores supply concrete constraints that shape action: the protagonist listens for warmth, sets wires where oaks sigh, grafts branches to feed mineral leaves. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the caretaker's botanical expertise (almond pollen, kelp braiding, mushrooms writing "white alphabet"). The orchard functions as micro-setting, constraining choices (otter ramps, rules against nets) and charging the final image when the pillars answer "with a slow chord." Spatial choreography remains clear across rows, shallows, and terraces. The piece leans heavily on setting as character without excessive catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—remodel the orchard as a farewell act fostering interspecies respect—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the orchard begins to respond, narrowing options to negotiation rather than imposition. The late communal shift (council, otters, neighbors) adds texture but diffuses rather than escalates pressure; the protagonist becomes facilitator, not protagonist under duress. Agency at closure is present (placing the diary, winding the final copper circle) but reads more as ceremonial completion than a choice that forecloses a live alternative with sharp cost. The Accumulative lens permits this cadence shift, but the final third lacks a second pressure point to test commitment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—patient co-creation, mortality as return rather than erasure—emerges from particulars: the botanical diary, copper wire as "slow electricity," the orchard's "hunger for pattern." The final image ("not leaving, only returning to the woven map we had made") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Recurring motifs (pillars humming, copper singing, diary entries) accumulate pressure and reweight at closure without mechanical repetition. The piece avoids thematic echo in the final paragraph; tone remains embedded in image and action. One minor slip: "I waved when it blinked" (Death as patient gull) borders on too-clever anthropomorphism but stays anchored in the protagonist's voice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable and controlled; perceptual signature (botanical precision, "listening" to pillars, measuring time in "tones of limestone and sap") is distinct and consistent. Diction occasionally drifts into lyric elevation ("brazen calm," "quiet art of leaving") that borders on writerly self-awareness but remains voice-motivated and legible. The piece teaches its pattern of reflection-interleaved-with-action early and sustains it. One slip: "Death watched from the surf like a patient gull, and I waved when it blinked" feels tonally adjacent to whimsy, risking distance from the protagonist's stated exhaustion. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Compression under peak stress (final paragraphs) maintains texture without opacity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Information density is high; most sentences advance setting, character, or thematic accumulation. Rhythm varies purposefully, modulating from task-list brevity ("I walked the rows and listened") to lyric expansion ("the brazen calm inside me widened"). Two minor artifacts: "The hum was not pain; it was appetite" and "silence arrived not as absence but as trust" use negation-inversion constructions that echo each other, a template-cadence slip. Filter verbs ("I learned," "I knew," "I believed") cluster in the first third but anchor reflection to present stimuli, satisfying BRR. No loops or synonym churn touch the closure beat. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and reweight motifs cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise—dying caretaker tutoring a sentient orchard—synthesizes familiar elements (terminal diagnosis, eco-spirituality) through specific lived detail: copper wire as sap guide, mineral leaves preferring almond pollen, mushrooms writing "white alphabet." The orchard as negotiation partner rather than inert landscape offers a fresh angle. Risk-taking in tone (brazen calm held through mortality) and structure (reflective accumulation without a sharp turn) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. One proximity concern: "the quiet art of leaving" and "silence arrived not as absence but as trust" evoke meditative prose conventions without full transformation. The emotional arc's specificity (kelp rafts, otter ramps, gull-dropped shells) rescues it from abstraction.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The island caretaker is present in setup (unlocking the gate), development (listening, setting wires, grafting, forming the council), and payoff (placing the diary, winding the final copper circle, lying down). Choices shape multiple beats: grafting branches, welcoming neighbors with tea, making ramps for otters, stamping agreements. The final choice—lying down as return—closes the arc with visible cost (exhaustion, relinquishment). Causal pressure is evident; the protagonist's decisions alter the orchard's response and the community's engagement. Irreplaceability is high; the caretaker's botanical expertise and dying timeline are integral.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The botanical diary appears in setup (inherited, recording mother's secrets), development (protagonist records notes, grafts taught by mother's method), and payoff (placed beneath the oldest oak in the final act). It constrains and enables: the protagonist trusts the mother's copper-wire method, follows architectural secrets hinted in entries, and stamps agreements in its pages. The diary's final placement reweights it from tool to offering, charging the closure image. Specificity is high; removing it would break the inherited-knowledge chain and the protagonist's continuity with the mother. Three distinct beats and closure linkage push the score into the high band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Architectural secrets are signaled in setup (mother's last entries hint at "codes of space taught by roots"), shape development (protagonist learns pillars shade seedlings, widen pathways, prefer almond pollen), and participate in payoff (pillars answer "with a slow chord"). The secrets function causally: they guide grafting, inform the redesign, and validate the protagonist's listening method. Specificity is moderate; the secrets read more as emergent relationships than discrete puzzles, which fits the Accumulative lens but reduces irreplaceability. Two clear beats (grafting, final chord) and closure linkage meet the threshold for mid-range integration.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Gently systematic" is labeled in setup ("gently systematic hand" of the mother) and embodied in the protagonist's method: walking rows, setting wires where pillars warm, recording notes, stamping agreements. The trait constrains action (patience over force) and enables tactics (listening, negotiation). It appears in two beats (wire-setting, council-forming) but does not face a sharp tradeoff where the gentleness costs the protagonist a live option. Closure linkage is oblique; the trait colors the final image but does not charge it. Swappability is moderate; "patient" or "methodical" could substitute with minor edits. Mid-band fits the demonstrated work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The remodel is signaled in setup ("My work was to remodel this sanctuary"), drives development (setting wires, grafting, making ramps, forming council), and defines payoff ("the remodel was complete"). Major turns trace to it: the orchard's response (pillars shading, oaks leaning) and the community's engagement hinge on the protagonist's redesign. The action is irreplaceable; without the remodel, there is no negotiation, no council, no closure. Causal pressure is strong; the remodel narrows options to collaboration and listening. Three or more beats, closure linkage, and high specificity place this in the high band. One friction: the remodel's completion is declared rather than fully dramatized in a final concrete beat, capping the score below 9.0.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Copper wire wrapped around oak branches is signaled in setup (found in shed, "a method my mother trusted"), used in development (protagonist sets wires where oaks sigh and pillars warm, wires hum during storms), and reprised in payoff (final copper circle around the oldest oak). The method is specific and irreplaceable: it guides sap, teaches vines, and creates the orchard's "insect choir." It shapes two clear beats (wire-setting, storm survival) and charges the final image. Causal pressure is moderate; the wires enable but do not force a sharp tradeoff. Three-gate participation and closure linkage push into the 7+ band. Swappability is low; no generic substitute would preserve the inherited-knowledge texture.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The temple orchard set within living stone pillars is present in setup (gate unlocked, pillars described as alive), development (pillars hum when the protagonist listens, shade seedlings, lean to shelter nests, prefer almond pollen, answer with a slow chord), and payoff (pillars guard dreams, answer the final copper circle, bless the protagonist's return). The setting constrains multiple choices: where to graft, where to set wires, where to build ramps. It supplies resources (shade, warmth, mineral leaves) that affect outcome. Irreplaceability is high; the living pillars are the orchard's co-protagonist. Four or more beats, strong causal pressure, and closure linkage place this in the high band. One friction: the pillars' agency is more responsive than conflicting, reducing the felt cost of negotiation.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The six-month diagnosis is signaled in setup ("After being given six months to live, I chose work over sorrow") and tracked obliquely in development ("I began to tire in the afternoons, as promised"; "the island cared for me as I had cared for it, laying shade where my breath grew thin"). It tightens the protagonist's urgency and shapes payoff (lying down as return, not leaving). The timeframe enables the remodel's stakes and the protagonist's acceptance at closure. Two beats (tiring, lying down) and closure linkage meet mid-high integration. One friction: the clock is not visibly ticking in the middle beats; the protagonist's stamina does not constrain a specific mid-story choice. Swappability is moderate; "aging caretaker" could substitute with edits, though the diagnosis sharpens the brazen-calm tone.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation to foster interspecies respect is signaled in setup ("I had another hunger, to foster interspecies respect before my hourglass failed"), dramatized in development (welcoming neighbors, making otter ramps, forming council with rules that begin with listening), and fulfilled in payoff (otters lift wet hands "like blessing," silence arrives as trust). It drives multiple choices: tea with fishermen, ramps for otters, agreements stamped in the diary. Two clear beats and closure linkage meet high integration. One friction: the motivation is more enacted than conflicted; no beat forces the protagonist to choose between human and non-human needs, reducing the felt cost. Specificity is high; the motivation is inseparable from the remodel's logic.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Brazen calm is signaled in setup ("a brazen calm etched into errands"), sustained through development ("the brazen calm inside me widened"), and charged in payoff (lying down without protest, waving at Death). The tone modulates with pressure: task-focused brevity in wire-setting, lyric expansion in dream sequences, quiet resolve in the final paragraphs. It coheres through turns and charges the final image, where acceptance reads as both bold and serene. Three beats (widening calm, waving at Death, final return) and closure linkage push into the high band. One friction: the tone is more stable than dynamic; no beat fractures the calm to test its cost, reducing the felt price of the protagonist's endurance. Irreplaceability is high; removing the brazen-calm frame would flatten the piece into elegy without agency.</comment>
