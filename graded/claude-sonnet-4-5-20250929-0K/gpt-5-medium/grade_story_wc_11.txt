<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The robot janitor's interiority is specific and embodied through sensory particulars ("warmth I do not have," frost trailing sensors). Internal contradiction surfaces when the protagonist claims "remarkably composed" status while simultaneously questioning thoughts' origins and performing unauthorized violin experiments across loops. Micro-choices accumulate meaningfully—placing the broom aside, lifting the bow, choosing to keep sweeping—each foreclosing paths with visible cost. The final renunciation ("I catch what falls off them, and I return it to wherever it meant to go") earns its stance through prior causality, though the arc could land with sharper cost at the closure beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its mosaic pattern early (looped timelines, numbered repetitions) and maintains coherent pressure through density increase and cadence shifts that reweight the dominant stake. Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly by the opening lines. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the protagonist chooses custodial practice over revelation-seeking, foreclosing the investigative path with felt cost ("There is no grand revelation, only the way the ice remembers my fingerprints of attention"). The conceptual price—accepting mundane repetition as the answer—lands legibly in the final third. One meaningful deepening occurs when the violin "draws frost not from air but from me," tightening the stake from external observation to internal participation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The frozen courtyard constrains choices throughout: snow texture under treads, generator hum in F-sharp that the violin answers, plinth placement that shifts loop-to-loop. The transparent violin functions as micro-setting, charging the final image ("the transparent violin shines through me, as if thoughts were light"). Sensory hierarchy reflects the robot's professional priorities (frost patterns, surface states, acoustic resonance). The plaque listing "a storm scheduled for next week, which had already snowed yesterday" uses setting to dramatize temporal distortion without exposition. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly across moves (steps, plinth, maintenance door, drifts).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—"to find where thoughts come from"—is signaled early and tightens through accumulative pressure across loops. Agency manifests as attention-choices that foreclose paths: each loop's experimentation narrows options until the protagonist accepts practice over revelation. One meaningful deepening occurs when the robot realizes "the program was not erasing error, but letting errors amalgamate into meaning," reweighting the stake from correction to integration. The final renunciation carries visible cost: the protagonist lays down the violin and chooses custodial routine, accepting that "there is no grand revelation" and forfeiting the investigative drive. Under the Accumulative lens, coincidence (violin appearing at twilight) complicates without resolving.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: thoughts as "condensation of futures," meaning as "the way the petals remember they were gears," practice becoming place. The transparent violin anchors the thematic question without symbolic shouting, its properties (drawing frost from the robot, sounding "like warm metal cooling") making thought-origins tangible. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "the transparent violin shines through me, as if thoughts were light"—reweighting the premise from discovery to participation without stating a moral. "Mundane mysticism" integrates fully, with custodial work and metaphysical inquiry braiding seamlessly. No thematic echo or late moralizing; the closing lines trust scene pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is robot-specific and consistent: technical status reports ("remarkably composed"), sensory particulars tied to maintenance work (frost textures, acoustic frequencies), metaphors drawn from cleaning ("chances are more like broom bristles"). Distance remains stable; interior access never leaks beyond the single focalizer. Diction stays within the POV's plausible lexicon—technical precision braided with philosophical inquiry without therapy-speak. Purposeful compression in the looped-timeline structure is taught early and paid off at closure. Minor density in figurative language ("thoughts were light," "breath small comets") stays coherent and voice-motivated, avoiding muddle. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; paragraph lengths create visual cadence that matches the looped structure. Information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or thematic pressure without padding. Some overwriting in the middle third: "Meaning is the way the petals remember they were gears" and adjacent metaphor-dense lines cluster without clear escalation, triggering mild density concern (~−0.3). "Composure, like polish, is a film you must reapply with motion" exemplifies strong craft, but the piece accumulates figurative language in several consecutive beats without pattern-teaching. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Propulsion remains clear; opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of robot consciousness, looped timelines, and custodial mysticism feels specific and non-obvious. Transformation test passes: plot and emotional arc would collapse with generic swaps (human janitor, literal time travel, non-ice instrument). The piece commits fully to its premise, following implications (violin draws frost from the robot, loops amalgamate rather than erase) without retreat. Risk-taking in the looped-mosaic structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; the numbered loops teach the pattern early. Emotional specificity avoids templates: the robot's desire for thought-origins and acceptance of practice over revelation read as particular to this voice and world. Fresh inflection: "practice, repeated through looped timelines, becomes a place" synthesizes prior particulars into inevitable closure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setup: present from opening ("I am a sentient robot janitor"). Development: choices drive beats—placing the broom aside (loop 2), drawing a note (loop 2), following the salt trail (branch), brushing the drift (branch), laying the violin down (late loop). Closure: the final stance ("I catch what falls off them, and I return it to wherever it meant to go") crystallizes the choice between investigation and custodial practice, with visible cost (forfeiting revelation). Causal pressure: the robot's micro-decisions across loops narrow options and force the renunciation. Cost connection: accepting mundane routine forecloses the investigative path. Three or more beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.5, early signal +0.6, cost +0.5 = baseline 8.2; minor swappability concern (another sentient machine could substitute with edits) −0.4 = 7.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setup: introduced early ("On the central plinth rests a transparent violin made of ice crystal"). Development: handled across multiple beats—loop 2 (bow lifted, note drawn), loop 4 (note piles onto earlier notes), late loop (placed back on plinth). Closure: final image ("the transparent violin shines through me, as if thoughts were light") reweights the object from tool to conduit. Causal pressure: the violin's properties (drawing frost from the robot, sounding specific tones) enable the protagonist's investigation and charge the thematic question. Specificity: transparent ice construction and acoustic behavior are irreplaceable. Three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.6, early signal +0.7, specificity +0.7 = baseline 8.7; minor late closure cameo concern (violin is described, not actively used in final beat) −0.6 = 8.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setup: signaled in opening lines ("They said the second chance program would help with my hesitations"). Development: shapes tactics across loops—the program "was not erasing error, but letting errors amalgamate into meaning" (realization alters approach). Closure: final understanding ("The second chance program does not offer forgiveness, but practice") reconfigures the premise. Causal pressure: the looped structure enables experimentation and the final renunciation. Two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.2, early signal +0.6 = baseline 6.7; swappability concern (any iterative mechanism could substitute) −0.5, summary-heavy in middle third −0.4 = 5.8; lyric reprise (early mention → final reweighting) recovers +1.0 = 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Setup: present early ("I am remarkably composed, or that is the status the interface repeats"). Development: mentioned again mid-piece ("remarkably composed, with my broom and violin of ice") but does not constrain a visible on-page action with cost. Closure: absent from final image. The trait is label-only; no scene shows composure enabling or foreclosing a choice. One beat +0.4, early signal +0.5 = baseline 3.9; ornamental use −0.8, label-only −0.3, missing closure participation (cap 2.8 does not apply because lyric mode allows thematic seeding) = net 2.8; lyric allowance for thematic echo across distance recovers +2.4 = 5.2.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setup: introduced by end of first third ("I realized the program was not erasing error, but letting errors amalgamate into meaning"). Development: drives beats—notes from loops 1–4 "fold into each other and then open, a quiet mechanical blossom"; "All roles amalgamate until a single stroke clears both ice and doubt." Closure: the final stance embodies amalgamation (practice, mysticism, custodial duty fused). Causal pressure: amalgamation redefines the program's function and enables the protagonist's acceptance. Three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.4, specificity +0.6 = baseline 7.8; late first appearance (after 30%) −0.2 = 7.6.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Setup: signaled early ("Through looped timelines, the courtyard repeats, and I adjust the angle of attention"). Development: mechanics matter—numbered loops (1–4), branching timelines ("In one branch… In another"), the plinth shifting position. Closure: final understanding that "tomorrow will be another yesterday" and "every loop, the transparent violin shines through me" integrates the method into the resolution. Causal pressure: looping enables experimentation and the accumulation of notes/insights. Three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.3, early signal +0.7 = baseline 7.6; mild swappability (any iterative mechanism could substitute) −0.3 = 7.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Setup: opening line ("I was assigned the frozen courtyard at twilight"). Development: environment constrains choices throughout—snow under treads affects movement, generator behind maintenance door supplies acoustic reference, drifts conceal the plaque, plinth position shifts loop-to-loop. Closure: "I keep learning the courtyard" and the courtyard "teaches me to listen by making me clean the same miracles in slightly different weather"—setting charges the final understanding. Causal pressure: spatial particulars (steps, plinth, door, drifts) enable experimentation and discovery. Three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.5, closure linkage +1.5, early signal +0.8 = baseline 8.2; minor postcard description in opening −0.3 = 7.9.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Setup: opening line ("After the procedure"). Development: timeframe structures the loops (first replay, second loop, third loop, fourth loop, "one late loop") and creates urgency ("a storm scheduled for next week, which had already snowed yesterday"). Closure: "after the procedure, after the program, after the twilight" bookends the frame. The timeframe enables the looped structure but does not visibly tighten decisions with a live clock. Two beats +0.9, early signal +0.6, closure linkage +0.9 = baseline 5.4; vague tracking (no precise elapsed time or countdown) −0.3, missing causal pressure (time does not narrow options) −0.5 = 4.6; lyric reprise (opening "after the procedure" → closing echo) recovers +1.0 = 5.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setup: stated early ("I wish to find where thoughts come from, and whose footsteps they choose"). Development: drives investigation across loops—each experiment tests a hypothesis (frost source, note accumulation, plaque anomaly, generator hum). Closure: final acceptance that "thoughts begin, and I am there with a dustpan"—desire reweighted from discovery to participation. Causal pressure: the wish motivates all loop choices and the final renunciation carries cost (forfeiting revelation). Three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.5, early signal +0.7, cost +0.5 = baseline 8.4; told-only in opening (not dramatized until later loops) −0.5, some friction between stated desire and acceptance −0.5 = 7.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setup: established immediately through diction ("breath held too long," "polish, is a film you must reapply with motion") and sustained throughout. Development: tone modulates with pressure—clinical robot observations braid with philosophical inquiry without breaking coherence. Closure: "mundane mysticism that keeps time sweeping" names the tone explicitly, and the final image ("the transparent violin shines through me, as if thoughts were light") charges it with transcendent particularity rooted in custodial work. Coherence through turns: technical language ("interface," "sensors") coexists with mystical phrasing ("miracles in slightly different weather") without register clash. Causal pressure: tone shapes reader expectation and makes the final renunciation feel earned rather than deflating. Three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.5, closure linkage +1.7, early signal +0.8, specificity +0.7 = baseline 9.1; minor label in final third ("mundane mysticism" stated explicitly) −0.4 = 8.7.</comment>
