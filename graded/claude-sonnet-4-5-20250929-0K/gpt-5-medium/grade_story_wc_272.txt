<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's internal state is richly embodied through specific sensory details and concrete actions—gathering cards, mapping shelves, braiding threads—that escalate pressure without exposition. Her descent is motivated by a coherent desire ("to descend into necessary darkness") enacted through micro-choices that foreclose paths with visible cost. The interior voice remains consistent and character-particular, avoiding therapy-speak even under stress. Minor slip: the transformation from "crestfallen" to closure feels earned by action but lacks a sharply contradictory impulse acting *in scene* to push into the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (Mara, library, lighthouse) arrive cleanly within the opening lines. The closure—Mara lighting the wick and writing in the ledger—lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise meets Earned Stasis): she commits to keep the light with visible cost (foregoing flight, accepting the keeper's mantle). The textural deepening through thread-lattice, card-threading, and wick-braiding tightens options and reweights the dominant stake with undeniable pressure. Cost is legible on the page: "I will keep the light tonight, and I will keep the faces that come to it."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The lighthouse library supplies concrete constraints: rusted gears, perished wick, salt-sweating stones, and the trap to lower chambers all shape Mara's choices and tactics. The keeper's ledger, tarot box, and thread materials are handled across multiple beats, evolving from discovery to tool. The spatial choreography—reading table, gearhouse spiral, lightroom above—remains coherent and charges the final image when light "climbed, and the walls did not close in." Micro-setting detail (oil, linen, brine) filters through Mara's artist's eye and survival need.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: Can Mara repair her fractured vision (and the lighthouse's literal beam) before the weight of isolation closes in? The tightening is accumulative: discovery of the broken box → decoding the keeper's thread-chart → descending into the gearhouse → braiding the new wick. Each step narrows options and raises cost; the final act (lighting the flame, writing the commitment) forecloses retreat with visible price. The pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, and the cost—accepting the keeper's mantle, staying to tend faces—is felt on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: wicks, threads, light, and faces serve as non-literal vehicles for repair, connection, and witness. The final line—"I will keep the light tonight, and I will keep the faces that come to it"—answers the implicit question (Can fractured reality be re-threaded?) without stating a moral. The cards tremble and show "faces she had once failed to paint," reweighting prior material with earned resonance. No thematic echo or late sermon; the closing image offers conceptual repricing with undeniable cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV with stable third-person-limited focalization. Perceptual signature is artist-specific: "the line that insists a face is a frontier," "hands into moths," "luminescent ache." Diction remains voice-consistent and purposeful; elevated register ("tide-wrack," "perished wick") fits the lyric-accumulative mode without drift. No head-hopping. Psychic distance modulates intentionally with pressure; the final paragraph widens as the light climbs. Syntax and rhythm reflect Mara's shifting state, compressing during the descent and opening at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Information density is high; nearly every sentence advances image, choice, or atmosphere. Figurative language is concentrated but controlled: "hands into moths," "gulls rode the wind like commas," "light argued up the spiral." Minor density concern: a few lines in the middle third ("Who answers the Keeper's log when the Keeper is gone?") edge toward rhetorical scaffolding without immediate pressure payoff, though the pattern is voice-motivated. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; sentence openings vary. Proofreading is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse-library setup is familiar, but the tarot-thread redesign and the artist's search for "a wick" transform the frame into something specific and non-obvious. The keeper's instruction—"Only by untangling threads can the light know where to go"—drives the entire middle arc without feeling planted. The final commitment ("I will keep the light tonight") synthesizes artist's crisis and lighthouse repair into a single earned gesture. Risk-taking in register and metaphor heightens without obscuring; the piece commits fully to its lyric mode.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara is introduced immediately, and her "crestfallen" state motivates the journey and the descent. Her choices—gathering cards, mapping shelves, braiding threads, lighting the wick, writing the vow—drive every major beat. The final act (lighting and vowing) constitutes a decisive turn with visible cost. The character trait creates causal pressure across three beats (discovery, descent, closure) and is irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The tarot box appears early (paragraph 7), is handled in the discovery beat, provides the cards and twine for the thread-lattice middle arc, and returns at closure ("cradled the broken tarot card box"). Three distinct beats; reprise in final line reweights meaning. Swappability is low: the pierced cards and thread motif are specific to the redesign solution. Causal role is clear.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Fragmented reality" is signaled early ("Her own life had become a fragmented reality, a mosaic missing its grout") and shapes the dominant stake. The concept drives the middle arc (threading the cards to chart a path) and is visibly resolved at closure when "the column of brightness stitched her to the weather." Two beats; the concept alters tactics (the lattice construction) and charges the ending image. Moderate swappability; "brokenness" could substitute with edits.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The attribute appears early ("she questions rhetorical questions the way some people test locks") and recurs in the middle ("Who threads a deck…?" "Was she here to save a lighthouse…?" "Who answers the Keeper's log…?"). The stance enables her interpretive work (decoding the keeper's redesign) but does not constrain a choice with visible cost. Two beats; functional but somewhat swappable with "curiosity" or "investigative instinct."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Redesign" is seeded via the keeper's sketches and the entry "Only by untangling threads can the light know where to go." Mara enacts the redesign across the middle arc (mapping shelves, looping suits to locations, braiding threads through the wick housing) and completes it at closure by lighting the new wick. Three beats; the action is irreplaceable and drives the resolution. Causal pressure is strong; removing "redesign" breaks the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Untangling threads" is signaled in the keeper's ledger, enacted in the middle arc (gathering threads, looping to shelves, braiding through wick housing), and pays off when the wick takes flame. The method is specific and its mechanics matter: thread-lattice gives oil a path. Three beats; closure depends on this exact means. High irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lighthouse library is anchored immediately and supplies resources (ledger, cards, twine, gearhouse, wick reservoir) and constraints (rust, salt, darkness) across all major beats. The spiral stairs and gearhouse force the physical descent; the lightroom above provides the closure image. Setting shapes choices at every turn and charges the final column of brightness. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"When the walls close in" is signaled early as the timeframe ("the hour when the walls close in") and tightens pressure in the middle ("She felt the tower anticipate collapse"). The phrase recurs at closure when "the walls did not close in; they widened." Two beats; the timeframe shapes emotional urgency and is repaid with reversal at the end. Moderate cost connection.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"To descend into necessary darkness" is stated explicitly and dramatized when Mara opens the trap and spirals down to the gearhouse. The motivation is conflicted ("not as punishment…but as a correction") and drives the middle beat and closure. Two beats; the descent is causally necessary and the phrase charges the final image ("column of brightness that stitched her to the weather"). Strong cost connection.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Luminescent ache" is seeded early ("the luminescent ache that happens after a bruise") and modulates through the piece: melancholy discovery, embodied descent, relieved opening at closure. The tone charges the final image ("column of brightness") and coheres across turns without static repetition. The ache-to-light arc is integral to closure. Strong coherence and payoff.</comment>
