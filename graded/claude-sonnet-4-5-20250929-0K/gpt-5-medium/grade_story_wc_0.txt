<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is concrete and embodied through her scientific reflex meeting practical repair, showing contradictory impulses (researcher vs. sweeper) acting simultaneously. The progression from "flamboyant fireworks at data" to patient dust-tracing demonstrates earned change through prior causality. Micro-choices—pinning plastic, placing the slide, distributing tasks—reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost (abandoning drama for incremental progress). Minor weakness: some interiority edges toward abstraction ("preprocesses reality by habit") but recovers through immediate sensory anchors.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, taught early through dust-patterns metaphor and held through closure. The final beat—dust resettling into a new map after Mara's breath—delivers Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): options crystallize around patient noticing vs. spectacle-chasing, with conceptual cost legible in the renunciation of "theatrics." Orientation anchors (Mara, greenhouse, post-flood) land by line 3. One meaningful deepening occurs when neighbors arrive and collective sweeping reweights individual heroism. Cost is visible in the surrender of rescue narrative for "rehearsal."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse as micro-setting constrains multiple choices: broken panes frame clouds "like equations," punctured roof requires plastic sheeting, silt patterns guide sweeping strokes. The butterfly-wing dust functions as both tool and recurring object, charging the final image when it resettles. Sensory detail is filtered through scientific POV (vortices, topography, angles) without catalog excess. The algae, tomatoes-to-filaments, and compost barrels layer texture that reflects urgency and decay. Spatial choreography remains clear across all moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—stripping needless drama from recovery—is signaled immediately and tightens through one decisive turn: Mara's invitation to colleagues to "test the new filter on the backlog of sky and the backlog of soil." This choice forecloses the solo-hero path and commits to collective, incremental work. Agency is enacted through renunciation (broom instead of model, patience instead of prophecy) with visible cost: the old methods are explicitly abandoned. Pressure accumulates under the Accumulative lens via density increase and cadence shift, reweighting spectacle vs. gentleness. The price—giving up "the theater of prediction"—is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme (recovery as patient accumulation vs. dramatic rescue) emerges organically from greenhouse repair and pulsar research without statement. The butterfly-dust slide and the pulsar printout "hum the same patience," offering a resonant answer to the central question: how does one honor gradual change? The final image—dust resettling, world agreeing "to be read without being dramatized"—reweights prior material with conceptual cost (the surrender of heroic narrative). Subtext operates through juxtaposition (star/soil, explosion/decay) and the quiet refusal embedded in "not to mourn, but to strip." No moralizing; wisdom arises from concrete sweeping and slide-gazing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable single third-person limited with strong perceptual signature: scientific idiom ("preprocessing," "pulsar glitches," "calibration") filters all observation. Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during dust-tracing and opening for cosmic parallels. Diction occasionally edges into elevated register during non-peak beats ("kindled humility gathered around her like steam") but remains legible and voice-motivated. Dialogue is minimal and functional; neighbors are "apologetic and laughing" without individuation, acceptable at this length. Minor slip: "a faint brown whisper" and "earthy arithmetic" verge on decorative metaphor but advance mood without obscuring cause.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally with strong propulsion in sweeping and pinning beats. Information density is high: most lines layer action, atmosphere, and thematic resonance. Two friction points lower the score: (1) Paraphrase loop between "proceeded through accumulated dust patterns" (line 9) and "through accumulated dust patterns their hands learned" (line 23)—same phrase, restated concept, −0.3. (2) Template cadence in cosmic parallels: "a neutron star spins… not a melodrama but an accumulation" echoes "recovery is not a rescue but a rehearsal"—parallel "not X but Y" structure across three instances without taught pattern, −0.4. No filter-verb stacks or register drift. Figurative language (spiral, topography, vanes) serves clarity. Closure image is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of astrophysics and greenhouse repair through "accumulated dust patterns" is specific and non-obvious, earning high originality. The trope of scientist-learns-humility is transformed via concrete tools (broom, slide, lens, plastic sheet) and the dual timescales (flood/star) create fresh tension. Risk: the extended cosmic metaphor could flatten into allegory, but particulars (butterfly-wing angles, nitrogen decay, pulsar microsecond widening) anchor universals. Proximity check passes; no famous-line echoes detected. The piece commits fully to its premise without retreat, though the final notebook entry edges toward thematic summary.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara appears immediately, drives all major choices (sweep, pin plastic, place slide, invite colleagues), and her research background enables the core metaphor. Her decision to train the algorithm "to notice gentleness first" alters tactics and forecloses the "flamboyant fireworks" approach. Causal across three beats; closure hinges on her breath across the slide. Strong setup, development, and payoff with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Butterfly dust is handled in two distinct beats: traced under the lens mid-story and blown/resettled in the final image. Its "angles, tiny vanes, topography" provide specificity; its return charges closure by demonstrating the world agreeing "to be read without being dramatized." Setup at line 16, payoff at closing lines. Cost: fragility (wing "long since flown or drowned") shadows the rebuild. High irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Gradual change shapes every on-page stake: flood recovery vs. instant fix, pulsar slowing vs. burst-chasing, seedling yellowing vs. explosion-bias. It narrows Mara's options (she chooses slow sweeping over rescue drama) and charges the final image ("the star would slow again, but the work would continue"). Present in setup (line 2 "simpler mathematics"), developed through algae/compost/tomato decay, and drives closure. Conceptual cost is renunciation of spectacle. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Preprocesses reality" enables Mara's reflex to turn "noise into sequences" (line 5), directly shaping her choice to sweep methodically and trace vortices. Label-only in one sentence but demonstrated through subsequent actions: studying swirls, plotting spirals, noticing dust-pattern syntax. Visible in setup and middle beats; implicit cost is that the reflex must be retrained ("to preprocess reality without the bias for explosions"). Swappable with "pattern-recognition habit" at minor edit cost, capping below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Decay appears in tomatoes-to-filaments, nitrogen foretold by yellowing, pulsar friction, and the star "coming to terms with friction the way a town does." It drives the thematic calculus (decay vs. rescue) and Mara's choice to log slow inclinations. Present across three beats; shapes the ending's "slow subsiding" image. Cost: accepting loss without drama. Could be replaced with "deterioration" or "entropy" without major plot break, capping at mid-7s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Method is signaled early ("proceeded through accumulated dust patterns," line 9) and mechanics matter: Mara traces spirals, maps shorelines, chalks water signatures, and colleagues sweep aisles to "learn the long sentence the storm had written." The algorithm's training hinges on this method. Appears in setup, middle, and closure ("dust resettle into a new map"). Specific enough to be irreplaceable; removing it breaks the pulsar-greenhouse metaphor and the closure image.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The greenhouse pressures every choice: shattered panes frame clouds, punctured roof requires plastic sheeting, silt dictates sweeping paths, broken aisles guide neighbor tasks. Its state (storm-damaged) defines the stakes and supplies the dust, vines, algae, and compost that populate beats. Micro-setting elements (slide, lens, gutters) alter tactics. Present in setup, shapes middle choices, and charges closure ("gutters would clog again"). Indispensable; removing it collapses all causality.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"After the flood" anchors the inciting condition and tightens the decision to rebuild vs. mourn. It defines the shorelines, silt, and water signatures that guide sweeping. Present in setup (line 1) and implicit across beats (neighbors arrive, "new shorelines" are mapped). Does not create a live ticking clock, but the aftermath state shapes all tactics. Middle development is present; closure participation is indirect (the implicit future: "Tomorrow the gutters would clog again"). Two gates met; causal role in one beat. Replaceable with "after the storm" at minor cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation is dramatized immediately: Mara "came not to mourn, but to strip needless drama," then enacts it by sweeping, pinning plastic, and inviting colleagues with seeds instead of spectacle. Friction is visible in the renunciation of "flamboyant fireworks" and "theater of prediction." The want (simplicity) conflicts with prior habit (dramatization), creating authentic tension. Present in setup, drives middle choices (algorithm retraining), and charges closure ("without being dramatized"). Cost: giving up heroic narrative. Strong across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Tone is established in the opening ("looking smaller than the shattered panes") and modulates under pressure: quiet refusal ("not to mourn"), collaborative warmth (neighbors "apologetic and laughing"), and final acceptance ("agree to be read without being dramatized"). Coherent across turns; the diction of "patient ledger," "calm pulse," "modest," and "honest" sustains it without static repetition. Charges the final image by making the dust's resettlement feel like a moral stance. Indispensable; removing it flattens the thematic reconfiguration.</comment>
