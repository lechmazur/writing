<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The undertaker's interiority is richly specific—"measures days by the weight of names," "inadvertently stubborn in the way a tide forgets how to reverse"—and the embodied stakes ("grief taught me to lift what the living cannot carry") anchor motivation. The final renunciation ("I was never brave, only hired to look unafraid") earns the endurance path with visible cost. Minor deduction: the shift from reactive observer to active agent arrives late, and some micro-choices in the library feel driven more by the manual's instruction than by contradictory impulses acting in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orientation is clear by the opening beat (mortuary, package, sea); the Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early through lyric patterning and held through closure. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis + Charged Poise): the undertaker commits to giving rest a permanent address, and the final image ("he is at work") crystallizes the shift with conceptual cost (he forgoes return, becomes registry-keeper). The meaningful tightening occurs when the lens hums and reveals the manual, narrowing options from passive receipt to active construction of the beacon. Cost is legible in the etch ("forwarding order") and the open-ended vigil.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The underwater library constrains every choice: thin water held by tired barriers, shelves that lean, books on tethers. The broken lens becomes a tool that shapes tactics (angling to vents, arranging mirrors), and the final image charges when the city keeps its lights as "patient registry." Spatial choreography is clean (service well descent, dome, reading desk, aisles), and sensory selection (kelp tea, candles, algae light) reflects urgency without catalog. The library's micro-setting—card catalog as address system—directly enables the closure solution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: "give rest a permanent address, somewhere the lost can forward themselves without fear of eviction." One meaningful deepening occurs when distress signals become a new question ("Where shall we rest"), reweighting the task from passive beacon to active registry. The mantled thing tests the dome but withdraws once addresses are assigned, providing external pressure that validates the internal shift. Minor gap: the escalation is conceptual rather than a narrowing of live options under time pressure, and the protagonist's agency is more interpretive than decisional until the final third.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme (rest as location, not surrender) emerges from concrete particulars: the card catalog becomes street names, distress signals become invitations to stay. The closing image—"the undertaker is not missing; he is at work"—offers a resonant answer without moralizing: vocation as permanent address. Subtext operates in gesture (etch, tap code, aligning shards) and the mantled thing's patient withdrawal. The broken lens as mosaic (not mirror) charges the final beacon with accumulated cost, and no element arrives late to harvest points.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person, distance controlled, and the perceptual signature is distinct: "chased stillness," "cataloging distress signals sent by ships that never made it home," "kelp tea and candles." Diction remains within the undertaker's plausible lexicon (weary, linen, forwarding order) and modulates under pressure without breaking voice. Free indirect interiority is clean; no head-hopping. Minor deduction: a few lines approach elevated register ("civilized hush," "knitting a harbor") that slightly tension the mortuary idiom, though they remain legible and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally, information density is high, and sentence openings diversify. Figurative language is purposeful and mostly coherent ("inadvertently stubborn in the way a tide forgets," "shelves lean like old divers"). Deductions: "chased stillness" recurs frequently as a label without sufficient fresh embodiment in each use (−0.3), and a few lines approach paraphrase loops ("I keep arranging shards" appears twice in close succession; "distress signals" cycling through beats without new pressure adds −0.2). The closure beat is clean, so caps remain above 8.0, but high-band entry requires tighter loop discipline.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes mortuary work, underwater library, and distress-signal semiotics into a specific vision: rest requires an address, not just peace. The transformation test passes—plot and arc depend on these exact particulars. The beacon-as-mosaic and card-catalog-as-street-grid are fresh inflections. Risk is present in the lyric compression and the choice to let the mantled thing withdraw without confrontation, heightening stakes through restraint. Minor reservation: the underwater-city-as-lost-archive is a familiar motif; the story earns originality through execution and the forwarding-order conceit, but the frame itself is not wholly novel.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Undertaker's choice to descend (setup), follow the manual's instruction (middle), and etch the forwarding order (ending) drives all three gates. The trait "weary" colors perception throughout, and the final self-assessment ("never brave, only hired") reweights the vocation. Causal pressure: the decision to keep aligning shards despite the mantled thing's test narrows options and forecloses easy return. Present in closure beat with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lens appears in the package (setup), hums and scatters light to reveal the manual (middle turn), and is opened to vents to release the beacon (closure). Used in at least three distinct beats with evolving function: diagnostic tool, then mosaic transmitter. The shard-alignment work constrains tactics and the final beacon image depends on its fractured state. Irreplaceable: a whole lens would not carry the mosaic logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distress signals frame the library's catalog (setup: "three shorts and three longs"), pivot when the undertaker taps a new code asking "Where shall we rest" (middle choice), and transform into SOR at closure. The concept alters options on the page: old signals perpetuate loss, the new code invites staying. Present in closure beat and charges the final beacon. Causal pressure and specificity both high.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Inadvertently stubborn" is introduced early ("inadvertently stubborn in the way a tide forgets how to reverse") and recurs once in the middle ("I am inadvertently stubborn, and I refuse to stop aligning shards"). The trait enables the choice to persist despite the manual's warning and the mantled thing's test, shaping one key middle beat. Cost is implicit (continued risk) but not dramatized as a visible tradeoff. Lyric reprise without sufficient middle constraint for higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Revitalize" appears in the manual's diagram, drives the lens-alignment action across multiple beats, and culminates in the beacon that "revitalizes staying, knitting a harbor." The verb is irreplaceable: "restore" or "repair" would not carry the life-versus-death stakes. Present in setup (manual), middle (glow and rune), and closure (beacon release). High causal pressure and specificity; visible cost in the open vigil.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Method is introduced early ("occupy impossible spaces between bubbles and beams"), used explicitly in the middle ("slipping myself between broken panes of time where water cannot reach"), and implied in the final registry work. The mechanics matter: the method enables the lens-venting tactic. Present in two distinct beats with causal function, but the "how" remains somewhat abstract—enough to shape attempts without full dramatization of the impossibility's cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Library appears in setup (map circle, descent), pressures every middle choice (thin water, tethers, vents, card catalog), and becomes the permanent address in closure ("keeps its lights, a patient registry"). The card catalog as street-grid is irreplaceable and drives the solution. Spatial constraints (dome, aisles, reading desk) alter tactics throughout. Environmental cost is visible: the dome's tired groan, the mantled thing's test. Indispensable to story logic and final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Timeframe is signaled in the title phrase and opening line ("After the mysterious package arrives"), anchoring the inciting moment. The sequence is clear (package → descent → library work → beacon release → climb), but no live clock tightens decisions within the library. The "after" frame provides setup and a loose forward press, shaping one turn (the decision to go), but does not constrain middle tactics or charge the ending with temporal cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation is introduced early ("I have long wanted to give rest a permanent address") and drives the descent, the lens work, and the final etch. Conflicted in the choice to "keep building the message" despite the mantled thing's threat, visible friction between the desire for rest and the risk of miscalling storms. Cost is dramatized: the undertaker forgoes return and becomes registry-keeper. Present in three beats with causal pressure and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Chased stillness" appears in the package beat ("quiet itself wants out of its binding"), prowls the aisles during the library work ("urging me to hurry or hush"), and takes the shape of the mantled thing before dimming at closure. Tone modulates from pursuit to patient withdrawal, charging the final image where the undertaker "breathe[s] for the first time like it belongs to me." Coherent through turns with purposeful evolution, though the label recurs more than the embodiment varies. Strong closure linkage and specificity.</comment>
