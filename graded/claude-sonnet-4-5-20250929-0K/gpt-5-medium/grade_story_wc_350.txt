<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara's core trait—"empathetically decisive"—is labeled but not tested under pressure; we see her coordinate and coach, yet no scene dramatizes a choice where empathy conflicts with decisiveness at visible cost. Her interiority remains abstract ("feels the pull like a tide") rather than embodied with contradictory impulses. The grain elevator's personification and the townspeople function as chorus rather than sources of friction that force Mara into a renunciating or foreclosing decision. No meaningful change or credible endurance with felt cost is earned on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The piece signals an accumulative/textural lens—montage of bridge-building beats and multilingual refrains—but never tightens or deepens pressure toward a single closure moment. The ending recapitulates the premise ("Bridges hold because songs repeat") without a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing; no on-page cost or foreclosed path is legible. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early, and the mosaic pattern is taught, but the closure image merely restates the status quo rather than reweighting it. Cost proof test fails: no sentence in the final third demonstrates a visible or felt price paid.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The astronomical clock tower, silos, and grain elevator are vividly sketched with functional specificity (gears, catwalks, conveyor belts), and the cuckoo clock weight physically constrains the first bridge span. However, the environment primarily serves as backdrop; it does not pressure a choice or charge the final image—Mara's plan unfolds without spatial friction. Micro-setting allowance is partially satisfied by the weight's counterbalance role, lifting the score into the 6-band, but no single setting element reweights options at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—rehabilitate the silos and braid the town—is signaled early but never faces meaningful opposition or cost. The town agrees ("no one feels bulldozed"), the bridges succeed without setback, and the elevator cooperates; pressure remains static across all beats. No on-page reversal, tightening choice, or deepening that narrows options is visible. The resolution is declared rather than earned through protagonist agency under pressure, and no visible price alters later tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The theme of connection versus isolation emerges through recurring bridge and language motifs, and the multilingual canon ("Dona nobis pacem, give us paz…") offers a concrete image. However, the final paragraph moralizes overtly ("Bridges hold because songs repeat, because decisions were made with empathy") rather than letting the image resonate, triggering the thematic-echo penalty. The story invites reflection but resolves into a tidy moral instead of embracing complexity or ambiguity. No non-literal answer to the central question appears; the ending restates the premise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited focalization through Mara is stable, and the prose carries a distinct lyric texture with purposeful compression ("the arcs whisper and remind the lungs to breathe"). Multilingual interjections and the elevator's personified voice are voice-motivated and legible. However, the narrator's perceptual signature is generic rather than character-particular—Mara's way of noticing does not reveal idiosyncratic bias or priorities. Psychic distance remains consistent, and no head-hopping occurs, but the voice does not modulate meaningfully under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense and often lovely ("borrowed starlight," "voices like gravelled rain"), yet runs of elevated metaphor in almost every sentence dilute clarity and create register drift unanchored to Mara's librarian POV. Paraphrase loops appear: "separate" recurs across three paragraphs without pressure change; "under the hush of borrowed starlight" is repeated verbatim as a refrain without earned cost. Template cadence is visible in parallel constructions ("give us paz, give us shalom, give us salaam"). No loops touch the closure beat directly, so the cap at −0.8 applies, but propulsion suffers from lyric density that does not advance stakes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The personified grain elevator and multilingual bridge-building offer a fresh angle, and the specificity of the cuckoo clock weight as counterbalance is memorable. However, the emotional arc—lonely town becomes connected community—is familiar, and the conflict unfolds without friction or trade-offs, making the outcome feel preordained. The transformation test is borderline: swap the tower for any tall structure and the silos for any symbol of division, and the plot functions unchanged. Risk-taking in voice and structure (lyric, mosaic) is evident but does not heighten stakes or complicate the premise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mara appears in most beats (tower work, door-knocking, bridge coordination, final balcony reading) and her librarian identity is established early. However, her choices—"knocks on doors," "gives a downbeat," "reads to the air"—coordinate rather than decide under conflicting pressure; no scene shows her empathy in tension with decisiveness or a cost tied to her role. She is present across the arc but does not drive a key turn through a choice that narrows options. Setup and development are met; closure participation is observational (she listens at midnight) rather than causal. Swappable with "community organizer" or "teacher" without loss.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The cuckoo clock weight is introduced early with backstory (farmhouse, harvests), physically used to counterbalance the first bridge span ("Mara lowers the weight slowly, calling uno, two, tre"), and reprised at closure as "honorary baton, returned each dawn to its resting hook." It appears in at least three beats: introduction, bridge-building, and final status. Its mechanical function—counterbalance—is specific and irreplaceable for that beat, but the reprised meaning (baton) is decorative rather than causally charged. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met; causal pressure and closure linkage are partial. Mid-7s would require a final-image cost or decision tied to the weight.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The grain elevator's voice appears in two extended beats—first speaking greetings and confessing desire for "passageways, songs," then in the later rehearsal answering and exhaling—and directly shapes the town's willingness to engage with Mara's plan. Its speech ("hola, shalom, salaam") introduces the multilingual method and its request for rehabilitation defines the central stake. The concept is present early, pressures the middle choice (whether to meet it halfway), and participates in closure (counting, "eins, dos, trois"). Swappability is low; remove the talking elevator and the story's causal spine and thematic charge collapse. Visible cost is absent—no one risks or loses anything by engaging with it—keeping the score below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Empathetically decisive" is labeled in paragraph six ("Her manner is vigorous tender, and her choices are empathetically decisive") and asserted again during door-knocking ("Because she is empathetically decisive, no one feels bulldozed"). It does not constrain or enable a dramatized action with cost; no scene shows empathy in tension with decisiveness or a visible trade-off. Setup is met (early label); middle development and closure participation are summary-only. Swappable with "thoughtful and confident" or "kind and firm" without loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rehabilitation appears as Mara's plan ("rehabilitate its purpose without erasing its scars"), the elevator's request ("whether it can be rehabilitated to carry something kinder"), and the crew's work ("Mara and the elders polish the leg casings, rehabilitate the head pulley"). It is present in setup (the elevator's ask), drives the middle turn (town agreement and bridge-building), and shapes closure (the elevator talks "less of fear and more of dinners"). Removing "rehabilitate" and substituting "repurpose" or "transform" would preserve logic but lose the specific connotation of healing and retention of scars, which ties to theme. Causal pressure is strong; closure linkage is clear; visible cost is implied (labor, rewiring) but not dramatized in a single beat with stakes.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Interspersing languages is introduced early in Mara's reply to the elevator ("Merci…spasibo…grazie"), used during door-knocking (uno, two, tre; si, yes, da), and made explicit in the canon ("Dona nobis pacem, give us paz, give us shalom"). It shapes the method of connection and appears in at least three beats. Its mechanics—switching mid-sentence or mid-count—are shown on the page and matter to the theme of braiding separate voices. Setup, development, and payoff are met; causal pressure is moderate (it enables the chorus but does not constrain a choice with cost). Closure linkage is present (the elevator counts multilingually at the end). Swappability is low; removing multilingualism would collapse the central metaphor.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The astronomical clock tower is introduced in the opening line and serves as Mara's base, rehearsal space, and launch point for the bridges. It provides the balcony for staging banners and the parapet anchor for the first span. Its gears and planetary motions are described but do not constrain a choice or supply a resource with stakes; it functions as vivid backdrop. The tower appears in setup, middle work (bridge launch), and closure (Mara reads from the balcony), meeting all three gates. However, swappability is high—replace with any tall civic building and the plot holds—and no specific tower feature (gears, clock mechanism) alters tactics or charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Under the hush of borrowed starlight" appears verbatim in three paragraphs as a refrain marking night rehearsals and Mara's midnight listening. It signals atmosphere and recurs at closure, meeting setup and payoff, but does not constrain a choice or tighten a decision window; no clock or deadline pressures tactics. The timeframe is stable (night) but not a live constraint. The lyric reprise reweights mood but not stakes, placing it in mid-band. Missing middle development (no choice shaped by this specific time) and lack of felt cost keep it below 5.5.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation—"to construct bridges from silos, not just across them"—is stated early and drives her plan (door-knocking, gathering the crew, designing footbridges and lantern lines). It appears in setup (her arrival and speech), middle beats (the planning and building), and closure (the town "once siloed, cradles itself in a chorus"). However, the desire is told rather than dramatized with internal conflict or visible friction; no scene shows her wanting to braid the town in tension with a cost or competing fear. Swappability is moderate—"unite the community" or "connect isolated neighbors" would function similarly. Causal pressure is present but not charged with on-page trade-offs.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The tone descriptor "vigorous tender" is applied to Mara's manner in paragraph six and colors the narrative voice—lyric compression ("arcs whisper and remind the lungs to breathe") paired with physical action (knocking doors, lowering the weight, polishing casings). The tone is coherent across beats and modulates slightly (gentle crescendos, patient knuckles), but remains static rather than tightening under pressure or charging the final image with emotional cost. Setup is met (early label); development is present in the lyric-practical balance; closure participation is weak (the ending restates harmony without tonal shift or surprise). A strong tonal charge at closure—tension, ambiguity, or a break in the vigorous-tender balance—would lift the score above 6.</comment>
