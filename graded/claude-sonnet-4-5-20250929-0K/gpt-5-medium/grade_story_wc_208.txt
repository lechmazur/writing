<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The sculptor's traits are established early—"reads knots the way others read lines on palms"—and agency appears in the decision to beach the skiff and construct the gate. However, interior contradiction is minimal; the protagonist proceeds with unwavering competence and no genuine struggle between wants. The grandmother and future-girl silhouettes guide choices without cost, functioning as helpful spirits rather than crucible pressures. The final "vow" feels asserted rather than earned by on-page foreclosure of a live option.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates images (GPS failure → storm → lantern slide → gate construction) and ends with a Resonant Reconfiguration (vow to build bridges). Closure is legible as Charged Poise: the protagonist crystallizes a stance with undeniable pressure, though the cost remains conceptual rather than felt. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (breakwater, skiff, archway). The main issue: the cartographer's words and the slide's instructions remove protagonist struggle, flattening the escalation into a guided tutorial rather than a narrowing of options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The storm-tossed archway, driftwood, and lantern slide are vivid and purposeful. The archway's "rib cage of stone" and "ferric" air create a charged space. The slide's light "pools in my palms" and guides construction, directly constraining the final image. Sensory detail is selective—"turbine-hum," "threaded needles"—and filtered through the sculptor's craft priorities. Spatial choreography stays clear throughout the beach-to-arch sequence, and the gate's construction anchors the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: to reimagine passage when markers vanish. The GPS failure introduces loss of navigation, and the storm pressures the protagonist toward the archway. However, escalation is minimal; the cartographer's gift and the slide's layered meanings provide solutions without forcing trade-offs. The gate construction proceeds smoothly with ghostly collaborators who "nod" approval. One tightening occurs (storm turns from "anger" to "rhythm"), but agency feels more like execution of instructions than a choice that forecloses a path. Cost is announced ("vow to keep building") rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—alliances across time, joining with patience—emerges organically from the lantern slide and gate construction. The image of "timewoven alliances" integrates with action rather than being stated. The final line "letting timewoven alliances hold the weight of passage" reweights the archway's function and the protagonist's craft. However, the cartographer's lesson is delivered as aphorism ("let your unions be not nails but joins cut true"), and the grandmother/future-girl appearances feel like spectacle rather than thematic pressure. No false equivalence or tidy moral, but the resolution leans abstract.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single POV, stable first-person distance throughout. The perceptual signature is consistent—"knots the way others read lines on palms," "grain the way surgeons trust arteries"—and the sculptor's craft filters all description. Diction remains within the voice: "spirited," "turbine-hum reverie," "ferric." Purposeful compression in the lantern-slide mechanics ("layered meanings click like mortises finding tenons in air") is legible. Minor weakness: some phrases drift elevated ("perpetually learning," "scaffold complexity with simplicity") and approach prompt language, slightly reducing texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, and many lines carry double duty—"Tonight, thunder silhouettes the old causeway" anchors setting and raises stakes. Figurative density is high but mostly coherent: "threaded needles," "turbine-hum," "mortises finding tenons in air." Two issues lower the score: paraphrase loops appear ("I tell the archway…I tell the sea…") and template cadence in the construction sequence ("Grandmother's silhouette shows me…the future girl marks…"). Register drifts slightly elevated in peak beats ("timewoven alliances," "scaffold complexity"). Clarity remains high, but momentum sags mid-construction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The driftwood sculptor, magic lantern slide, and ghost-collaborator frame combine into a fresh synthesis. The specific craft angle—mortise-and-tenon, reading grain—particularizes the "building bridges" metaphor. The lantern's "layered meanings" mechanic is inventive. However, the core arc (artist receives magical tool, uses it to complete a transformative work) follows familiar template beats, and the grandmother/future-girl appear as convenient guides rather than obstacles. Risk-taking in structure and tone is modest; the ending delivers expected resonance without surprising reversal.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The spirited driftwood sculptor is present throughout, beaches the skiff (beat 1), unwraps and uses the lantern (beat 2), and constructs the gate (beat 3). Choices include pressing on through the storm and beginning the frame under the arch. However, these are execution moves rather than constrained dilemmas; the cartographer's instructions and the slide's guidance remove friction. The vow at the end is announced rather than tested. Present in closure ("I will keep building bridges") but without visible cost that the sculptor's hands pay. Mid-band: shapes multiple beats, but swappable agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The magic lantern slide appears in beat 1 (gift from cartographer), beat 2 (unwrapped, fed into lantern, image spills onto stone), and closure (douses flame, wraps slide, carries vow). Its projection of "braiding of hands" and silhouettes (grandmother, future girl) directly shapes construction choices: "Grandmother's silhouette shows me where to let a curve breathe." The slide's "layered meanings" click like "mortises finding tenons." Without it, the gate could not be built. High integration: drives two beats, charges the ending, irreplaceable mechanics. Does not quite reach 8.5+ because the slide's function is assistive rather than creating cost or conflict.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Timewoven alliances" is named by the cartographer ("pacts signed in patience across storms") and demonstrated through the slide's projection of figures (grandmother, future girl) who collaborate. The concept shapes the protagonist's understanding ("We work as one body, timewoven alliances made tangible") and alters construction tactics. Present in closure ("letting timewoven alliances hold the weight of passage"). However, it reads more as theme label than on-page constraint; the alliances appear as helpers rather than forcing a choice between competing goods or imposing a visible cost. Mid-band: one key turn (gate construction) and closure presence, but swappable with "collaboration across generations."</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Perpetually learning" appears in paragraph 4 ("I travel the coast perpetually learning") and closure ("a teacher for those perpetually learning"). It frames the protagonist's stance but does not constrain an on-page action with visible cost. The sculptor's openness to the cartographer's lessons and the slide's teachings could function identically without this exact phrase. The trait is told rather than tested under pressure; no moment where "perpetually learning" forecloses impatience or forces a slower, costlier path. Functional label, replaceable with "open to teaching" or "seeking wisdom." Below mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Reimagine" is established as intent in beat 2 ("I have come to reimagine what passage means when markers vanish") and executed in beat 3 (gate construction that transforms the archway from "crush" to "cradle"). The action is distinct from mere repair or navigation; it redefines the archway's function. Present in closure ("reimagined contour of passage"). However, the mechanics of reimagining are delivered by the slide's layered meanings rather than protagonist struggle, so the action could be swapped for "transform" or "rebuild" with minor edits. One strong turn plus closure presence, but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Layered meanings" is signaled when the slide is introduced ("layered meanings upon the cliff") and demonstrated in beat 2 ("layered meanings click like mortises finding tenons in air"). The method shapes construction: silhouettes guide where to place slats. Without "layered meanings," the slide's projection could still instruct through direct vision. The phrase appears in closure consideration ("In every piece of driftwood, I will hear the layered meanings"). Present across two beats and thematically charged, but the method's mechanics are told more than dramatized, and swappable with "hidden guidance" or "subtle instructions." Mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The storm-tossed archway is introduced early (paragraph 5), pressures the protagonist to beach and shelter, and becomes the literal frame for the gate construction. Its "rib cage of stone" and "keystone" anchor spatial choreography. The archway's transformation from potential crusher to cradle is the story's central image and shapes the closure vow. Without it, the protagonist has no crucible or canvas. Present in setup, middle construction, and closure. Drives two beats and charges the final image. Does not quite reach 8.5+ because the archway is more canvas than constraint; it does not impose a cost or force a tactical choice.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"After the GPS fails" opens the story and establishes disorientation ("steering by the sea's pulse and gull cries"). It motivates the search for an alternate navigation system. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions; the protagonist has no deadline, and the storm's turn is environmental rather than clock-driven. The vow to "mark my skiff with its pattern so that even after the GPS fails again" returns the phrase at closure but without urgency. Present in setup and closure, but replaceable with any inciting loss. Swappable with "after the compass breaks" or "when charts are lost." Below mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Scaffold complexity with simplicity" is stated by the cartographer (beat 1), repeated by the protagonist as intent (beat 2: "I wish to scaffold complexity with simplicity, to make bridges from bones and song"), and demonstrated in the gate construction (beat 3: pegging slats by whorls, trusting grain). The motivation shapes the protagonist's method—choosing driftwood joints over nails—and aligns with the ending vow. However, the desire is told more than conflicted; no moment where simplicity costs the protagonist a faster or safer option. Present across beats and in closure, but without friction or visible trade-off. One key turn plus thematic presence, mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Turbine-hum reverie" is established in paragraph 2 and maintained through lyric syntax and compression: "threaded needles," "tide-light," "moonwash." The tone modulates from contemplative ("reverie") to active construction ("We work as one body") to vow ("satisfied hush"). Coherent across turns and charges the final image ("turbine-hum recede into a satisfied hush"). However, the tone is stable rather than dynamic under pressure; the protagonist's voice does not crack or shift register during the storm or construction. Present throughout and integral to voice, but does not tighten or deepen with stakes. Strong execution, just below essential band.</comment>
