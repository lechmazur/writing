<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marek's "logically emotional" trait is stated but rarely embodied in contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The seeker's arc from hunger to collaboration feels compressed; her shift occurs through exposition ("my village drowned... but the village also learned") rather than dramatized internal conflict. The key-weighing moment gestures toward hierarchy of values but arrives late. Interiority leans on abstract phrasing ("storms behave like creditors") that distances rather than grounds emotion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid): Marek offers shared guardianship, the seeker accepts with visible ache, and together they commit to the work. Cost is felt in "a smile that did not hide its ache" and the renunciation of ransom. Escalation reads as density increase and cadence shift when sound fills the space and the seeker's hunger "shifted shape." One meaningful deepening is present and sufficient for this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina, lighthouse stair, and lens room are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (ice floes nudge "like shy animals," landings smell of "salt and lamp oil"). The crypt keeper's key constrains access and charges the final partnership. Spatial choreography is clean. However, the ice and weather remain largely atmospheric; they do not actively narrow a tactical choice or alter the confrontation's outcome, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (protect the artifact from ransom) is signaled early. The arrival of the seeker tightens pressure. Marek's choice to open the lens room and let sound operate rather than argue is a meaningful turn under the Accumulative lens, and the seeker's renunciation forecloses the ransom path with visible emotional cost ("a smile that did not hide its ache"). Escalation is driven by Marek's agency (sonic absolution strategy) and the stone's response. Cost is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme of mercy through alignment rather than erasure emerges from the stone's chord and Marek's teaching ("tuning yourself until the world forgives your need"). The seeker's realization that her village "learned to build on stilts" offers a non-literal answer rooted in prior loss. Subtext operates in the key-weighing beat and the ache that persists despite collaboration. The final image of two keepers "by logic, by feeling, by sound" reweights the opening opposition without stating a moral, though "fleshly ethereal" recurs as a descriptive label rather than earning full resonance through charged particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "storms behave like creditors," "neighbors" for ice. Diction is elevated and lyric ("fleshly ethereal," "vibrational matching") but remains legible and voice-consistent. Dialogue carries subtext and goal pursuit ("I know why you came... because storms behave like creditors"). However, elevated register in peak beats ("sonic absolution," "measure tides, and to sing when the wind miscounted") risks drifting from naturalism. Free indirect style is clean, no head-hopping. Psychic distance is stable. Minor filter-verb presence ("felt," "asked") is voice-motivated and does not obscure immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies, figurative density is high but mostly coherent ("foghorn sigh," "freckles of dying light"). Line "vibrational matching" and "sonic absolution" recur without loops. One paraphrase slip: "storms behave like creditors when they smell leverage" / "storms want work rather than spectacle" restates similar content. Template cadence in early expository lines ("He had sworn," "He had studied," "He would adapt") triggers −0.4. Elevated diction in peak beats ("shepherd danger into a different harbor") adds −0.2 for register drift. Figurative language in most sentences of the lens-room confrontation (sound "poured," "thorough," "chimed faintly," "remembered drowned orchards") densifies without mixed metaphors but nears overwriting threshold. No causality break; artifacts penalized here only.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The premise (lighthouse keeper uses resonant artifact to defuse conflict through sound rather than force) offers a fresh synthesis. "Vibrational matching" as both literal and emotional mechanic is specific. The seeker's pivot from ransom to partnership is earned in hindsight by the stone's demonstration. Risk-taking in lyric diction and non-violent resolution heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. However, the "guardian persuades rival through artifact's power" frame is recognizable; transformation arises from the sonic-absolution specificity and the seeker's agency in choosing to weigh the key's responsibility.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marek frames expectation early, his choices drive the middle (unlocking the stone, tuning breath, opening the lens room to the seeker), and he offers the key and shared guardianship at closure. His decisions alter tactics and foreclose the ransom path. Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong. Specificity: his "logically emotional" approach and years studying the stone's mood are irreplaceable. Visible cost in accepting a partner he did not choose. Setup, development, and payoff gates all met.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The key appears in setup (sealed pouch), middle (unlock with "courteous click"), and closure (offered to the seeker to weigh responsibility, then returned). It constrains access and charges the partnership decision. Beat involvement: two distinct uses. Closure linkage: the act of weighing and returning the key forecloses ransom and seals collaboration. However, the key's physical properties ("cold teeth taste his palm") are mentioned once and not revisited; reweighting is conceptual rather than sensory. Strong integration, not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Sonic absolution is signaled early ("answer with sonic absolution"), enacted in the lens room (the chord that "filled the space" and caused the seeker's hunger to "shift shape"), and explained at closure ("tuning yourself until the world forgives your need"). It drives Marek's tactics and the seeker's renunciation. Setup, development, and payoff gates met. Causal pressure: the concept enables the non-violent resolution. Cost: the seeker must accept alignment rather than erasure. Not fully indispensable (dialogue could theoretically substitute) but deeply integrated.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Logically emotional" is stated in setup ("a man who graphed feelings against facts and followed the resultant vector") and echoed at closure ("by logic, by feeling, by sound"). It labels his approach but does not visibly constrain a choice with cost. The breathing-tuning and key-offering decisions read as general composure rather than a specific friction between logic and emotion. Setup and payoff present; middle development absent. Lyric reprise reweights but without dramatized trade-off. Functional, mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Adapt" is signaled early ("He would adapt, not defend with force"), enacted when Marek opens the lens room instead of arguing, and fulfilled at closure when both keepers "adapt together." The decision to let sound operate rather than forcefully defend is the story's major turn. Setup, development, and payoff gates met. Causal pressure: adaptation redefines options and enables the peaceful resolution. Cost: Marek accepts shared control. Strong integration; removing "adapt" would require rewriting the entire confrontation logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Vibrational matching is explained in setup ("learning its forgiveness through vibrational matching"), performed in the middle (Marek tunes his breathing, lengthens exhale until "his ribs chimed faintly"), and taught to the seeker at closure ("the intervals that anchor the stone to mercy"). It shapes Marek's method and the seeker's education. Setup, development, and payoff gates met. Causal role in one major beat (the sound demonstration). However, the mechanics are stated more than shown; the breathing and rib-chime detail is brief. Functional specificity but not indispensable; "resonance" could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina anchors setup vividly ("ice floes nudged the pilings like shy animals") and provides the approach route for the seeker's skiff. The ice and harbor "rang with thin bell-notes" create atmosphere. However, the ice does not constrain a tactical choice or alter the confrontation; the lens room is the true action space. Setup and development present (skiff arrival), weak payoff (ice mentioned in passing at closure). Atmospheric contribution, one beat involvement, but replaceable with another cold-water harbor.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Fleeting golden sunset" appears in the opening line and again at closure ("the sunset thinned to brass"). It marks time's passage but does not tighten a decision or create urgency; the confrontation unfolds without a live clock. Setup and payoff present (lyric reprise), middle development absent. The time pressure is implied by "fleeting" but never operationalized. Ornamental use; swappable with "dusk" or "twilight" without structural loss. Lyric reprise lifts it slightly above purely decorative.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Protection is stated early ("sworn to protect a sacred artifact"), tested when the seeker demands the stone, and resolved when Marek offers shared guardianship ("help me keep the stone singing only for safety"). Setup, development, and payoff gates met. The desire is dramatized in Marek's choice to unlock the stone and his offer of partnership. Cost: accepting a collaborator he did not choose, sharing control. Friction between the desire to protect alone and the need to adapt with another. Strong integration, drives closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Fleshly ethereal" appears three times: opening ("steps struck the planks with a fleshly ethereal hush"), middle ("their work felt fleshly ethereal"), and implicitly at closure (lighthouse "relieved" as if embodied). The tone is coherent through turns, marrying the physical (ice, breath, lamp oil) with the numinous (sonic absolution, forgiveness). It modulates appropriately: tactile in the climb, charged in the confrontation, resolved in the partnership. However, the phrase itself is repeated as a label rather than earned through varied imagery. Setup, development, and payoff present. Charges the final image but not indispensable; "grounded yet mystical" could substitute.</comment>
