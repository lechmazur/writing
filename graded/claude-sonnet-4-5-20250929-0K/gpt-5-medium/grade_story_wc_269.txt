<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation is clear and embodied through the practice of tapping, which reveals a diver's observational discipline. Internal contradiction appears in the tension between scientific record-keeping and the need to translate data into human-scale guidance for the villagers. The choice to radio the village and choreograph the crossing is earned by weeks of puzzle-solving, though the emotional stakes remain more conceptual than visceral. Minor deduction for the dreamed-spine image feeling slightly external to the established interiority.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the corridor's breathing pattern is discovered, marked with lanterns, and affirmed to return predictably—the narrator and station share "one pulse, drifting moored." Cost is legible in the atlas page that "had to live alone" and the acceptance that assembled structures must move to survive. The accumulative lens holds cleanly from beat to beat, with the tapping rhythm serving as the through-line that stitches discovery to action. Orientation is anchored early (monitoring station, new keeper, post-ban world) and the causal chain from bleaching → wave-shift → corridor emergence is motivated and paid off on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The monitoring station as a workplace is vividly realized: pylons, console, brushed steel key, metal bench, and the humming interaction between keeper and instruments. The "breathing corridor" of sand constrained by lunar peaks and spawning-night slicks directly shapes the final choice to mark timing rather than place. Sensory detail is filtered through the narrator's diver training (tap-count swells, night surveys, plankton-lit shallows). Minor gap: the village and mangrove geography remain slightly abstract, though the western flats gain specificity at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—why paths vanish where maps promise footing—is signaled in the opening quarter and drives all investigation. Pressure accumulates through the assembling of tide logs, torn page, and tapping-code revelation, culminating in the radio call and lantern choreography. The tightening is meaningful: the corridor exists but drifts in time, so the solution redefines the problem from spatial to temporal. Cost is visible in the elders' tears, the nightly reset of lanterns, and the acknowledgment that "nothing assembled stays assembled if it cannot move."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the breathing corridor metaphor: systems of knowledge (maps, data, rhythms) must flex to remain useful, and revelation is collaborative rather than solitary. The atlas page torn out and living alone crystallizes the piece's inquiry into permanence versus adaptive endurance. "Periodically eternal" and "drifting moored" operate as conceptual anchors rather than decorative labels, each constraining the narrator's final understanding. The ending image—vertebrae as lanterns, the page that cannot return to its book—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and internally consistent: a scientist-observer who thinks in counts, intervals, and embodied metaphor ("like hinges in the dark," "vertebrae were lanterns gatehinged to the sea"). Psychic distance remains stable; filter verbs ("felt," "understood") are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. The perceptual signature is clear: the narrator notices rhythms, marks, and tidal geometry. Minor slips include "delayed revelation tugged, patient as kelp," where the passive phrasing slightly weakens agency, and occasional elevated diction ("permutations of the tide") that brushes against but does not break the established register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and purposeful, with most lines advancing image, discovery, or conceptual weight. Sentence rhythm varies effectively, and figurative language is coherent (breathing corridor, spine of dots, lanterns as hinges). However, paraphrase loops appear: "drifting moored" recurs four times, and "assembled/assemble" cycles without always adding pressure. The phrase "delayed revelation" is named rather than purely shown. Template cadence in the middle third ("I pressed," "I slowed," "I understood") reduces propulsion slightly. No major clarity breaks, but the density of metaphor in some beats (dreamed spine, vertebrae as lanterns) risks ornament over action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise—tidal causeway that drifts in time rather than space, revealed through rhythmic data archaeology—is fresh and specific to this narrator's skill set. The coral-bleaching witness recruited to read sea-level futures offers a non-obvious synthesis of ecological loss and adaptive knowledge. The torn atlas page as schedule rather than map is an earned turn. Risk-taking in the lyric accumulation and the breathing-corridor metaphor heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Minor reservation: the "tapping as communication with the station" device, while well-integrated, edges toward familiar sentient-environment tropes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The coral bleaching witness is the narrator's core identity, shaping perception (bleaching reports matched to tapping intervals) and motivating the investigation. The choice to radio the village and choreograph the crossing with drum and lanterns is the story's climactic decision. Present in setup (recruited from ruined reef), middle (matching bleaching to lunar peaks), and closure (elders' recognition that "the reef tried to breathe").</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The torn atlas page appears in three beats: discovered in the drawer with "Follow," re-examined as a schedule of dots with measure-bar notation, and rewritten each morning with new beats. Its shift from spatial guide to temporal score drives the revelation. The final image—"the page had to live alone, like our shore"—charges the closure with thematic cost. Indispensable to the narrative's hinge.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Delayed revelation" explicitly names the concept midway and structures the entire investigation: the narrator assembles clues over weeks, the old keeper's taps are slowed and decoded, and the corridor's nature is revealed only after patient pattern-matching. It constrains tactics (no shortcuts, only methodical layering) and pays off when the radio call organizes collective timing. The concept is slightly over-articulated ("A delayed revelation tugged") but otherwise integral.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Periodically eternal" describes the ribbon's pulse, the corridor's recurrence, and the breathing cycle of the reef. It appears in three lines and colors the tone, but does not directly constrain a choice. The adjective phrase functions more as thematic resonance than as a material attribute that alters tactics. Present in setup and closure, but its causal pressure is oblique.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Assemble" is the console key pressed twice: first to stitch tide/wind/satellite into a ribbon, then to reorganize by tapping beats and reveal the drifting corridor. The action is named in the radio call ("Assemble at dusk") and thematically echoed in the final lines ("nothing assembled stays assembled if it cannot move"). The verb drives the story's major turns and is irreplaceable; swapping it would collapse the layered meaning.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Tapping rhythms appear in setup (diver training habit), are practiced nightly at the console, matched to the old keeper's recordings, decoded as lunar/bleaching schedule, and answered by the current meter. The method enables the climactic discovery and becomes the means by which the village crosses ("paced by the tapping code"). The specificity of "tap tap pause tap" and its mechanical role in data retrieval make it essential across beats and closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The sea level monitoring station provides the console, recordings, metal bench, and the "Assemble" key—all materially necessary for the investigation. The station "hums back" when tapped, creating the human-instrument duet that structures the discovery. Its location on pylons above the tide positions the narrator as observer-translator between data and villagers. The setting constrains the narrator's solitary nights and supplies the archive that makes the solution possible.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"After the fossil fuel ban" anchors the world in a post-crisis regime where "instruments kept ticking, as if endurance were the last arithmetic left." It justifies the monitoring station's existence and subtly colors the tone of careful stewardship. However, the timeframe does not constrain choices or create deadline pressure; it functions primarily as world-building context. Present in setup but does not drive escalation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The motivation "to discover why some paths disappear" is dramatized across the entire arc: drawer search, log assembly, tapping experiments, and the final radio call. Friction appears in the gap between the narrator's scientific method and the villagers' embodied knowledge ("barefoot fishers swore they had walked since childhood"). The desire forecloses the option of accepting mystery and compels the weeks-long investigation with itsVisible cost in solitude and obsessive focus.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Drifting moored" is introduced in the second line ("Everything felt drifting moored, held in place but sliding within memory") and recurs in the closing paragraph ("drifting moored beneath the permutations of the tide"). The oxymoron organizes the story's central tension—stability through movement—and modulates from anxious disorientation to collaborative poise. The tone charges the final image of the breathing corridor and lantern resets, making impermanence purposeful rather than loss.</comment>
