<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The negotiator's interiority is well-embodied through the drawer pull and the careful navigation of both sides' needs. Micro-choices are visible throughout—showing the pull, untethering the boy, holding silence—each revealing hierarchy of values. The internal contradiction between wanting to "recycle mistakes" and the immediate risk of saying the wrong thing creates authentic tension. Minor deduction: the trait "uncommonly thoughtful" is told rather than purely shown, though subsequent actions support it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the negotiator stands alone with the cooled drawer pull after successfully brokering the exchange, the cost legible in the widening parapet and thinning mist that signal temporary relief but ongoing cyclical work. The causal lens holds cleanly—each exchange decision flows from prior negotiation ("names of hunger moved quicker than names of sovereignty"), and the protagonist's choices (showing the pull, invoking shared history) earn the final moment of respite. One meaningful tightening occurs when the second trade snags on a misremembered name, raising stakes before resolution. Orientation is clear within the first 120 words. Minor gap: the conceptual cost of this being one exchange in an endless cycle could be slightly more felt in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The storm-worn parapet constrains every choice: slick stones force careful steps, narrow space creates proximity that defuses anger, mist limits visibility and creates acoustic intimacy. The drawer pull functions as micro-setting, handled three times and charging the final image when it cools. Sensory detail is purposeful—"furrowed hush," "wet flags," "teeth of stone"—and filtered through a negotiator's attention to threat and footing. The environment's metaphoric work (neutral territory as "spine of stone") never becomes overt symbolism; it remains tactile and pressuring throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: complete the prisoner exchange without violence or collapse. The tightening occurs when the second trade snags on a misremembered raid name and "tempers climbed the steps," forcing the protagonist to intervene with the drawer pull speech. Agency is decisive—the negotiator's choice to show the tarnished brass and invoke shared loss directly earns the resolution. Visible cost: the protagonist must stand alone in the cold afterward, the recurring task unending ("the metal cooled"). The escalation is modest but sufficient for this length, driven entirely by protagonist decisions under the inferred causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly through the drawer pull's transformation from grandmother's desk tool to negotiation talisman, embodying "recycle mistakes into wisdom." The final image—standing with the cooled metal after successful exchange—answers the central question (can peace be brokered from shared trauma?) without stating a moral. Subtext operates in gesture: Raglen's grunt and nod, Della's grain gift, the boy's attempted smile. The piece resists false equivalence; both sides are exhausted but not equally sympathetic. The ending's quiet resonance (parapet widening, mist thinning) reweights prior material, suggesting fragile success with inevitable repetition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinctive and consistent: compressed, lyric syntax ("a furrowed hush," "the coins of our breath steadied") matched to a negotiator who must weigh every word. Psychic distance is stable first-person throughout. Brief dialogue carries subtext—Raglen's grunt equals "an hour of speech," Della speaks through urgency about the boy. The perceptual signature is character-specific: noticing small weights, synchronization methods, the width of the parapet under tension. Minor deduction: a few lines approach over-figuration ("wind combed the mist like cold fingers," "moon hung... like a clipped coin") but remain within the established lyric register and don't obscure clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; nearly every line advances character, atmosphere, or conflict. Rhythm varies purposefully, slowing for reflection ("between apology and forgiveness there is a narrow weather") and tightening for action beats. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent and voice-motivated. Two issues prevent higher score: "furrowed hush" appears twice (opening and closure), reading as light echo rather than purposeful reprise; and the metaphor density in the opening paragraph ("wind combed," "spine of stone," "loose thought can topple") approaches overwriting without quite breaking legibility. Closure beats remain clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The premise—neutral-ground negotiator using grandmother's desk hardware as peace talisman—offers a specific, non-obvious synthesis. The piece transforms the prisoner-exchange trope through the drawer pull's dual function (personal anchor and rhetorical tool) and the synchronization-by-moon-phases detail. Voice and setting cohere into a singular vision. The "recycle mistakes into wisdom" frame could feel abstract, but grounding it in the physical object and grandmother's post-war seed swaps earns the concept. Risk-taking in the lyric compression and non-linear exposition heightens stakes without obscuring causality. Deduction: the setup (two sides, prisoners, neutral mediator) is familiar; transformation through voice and the object's use is strong but not fully indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The negotiator role is signaled in the second sentence, drives every major beat (raising hand to halt, setting the ledger, showing the drawer pull to defuse the naming dispute, untethering the boy, standing alone at closure), and the final image depends on this exact role. All three gates met with strong causal pressure and closure linkage. The story would collapse without this character in this function.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The drawer pull appears in five distinct beats: initial pocket mention establishing its origin and purpose, placed atop the ledger as shared-past symbol, shown to the boy with treaty explanation, held up between thumb and forefinger during the naming dispute with the dual-tarnish speech, and held until it cools in the final image. Early signal, repeated handling, causal pressure (defuses the second-trade conflict), closure charge, and irreplaceability (its grandmother/desk/treaty history is specific and load-bearing). Removing it would break the story's logic and emotional scaffold.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Neutral territory is named in the opening, constrains every choice (no horns, no banners, synchronized moon-only meetings), and the parapet's physical neutrality (narrow, shared, dangerous) pressures both tone and tactics. The concept shapes the stake (complete exchange without breaking the truce) and charges the ending when the space "widened again" after departure. Setup, development, and closure participation all clear; specificity high.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Uncommonly thoughtful" is stated in paragraph three as survival trait, then demonstrated in micro-choices: careful word selection ("Listen" as first trade), showing the drawer pull at the right moment, invoking shared history to calm tempers. The attribute enables the defusal of the naming dispute but is also told rather than purely enacted. Two-gate participation (setup, middle constraint) with modest causal pressure. Swappable with "careful" or "deliberate" without major structural change.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Untether" recurs as the action and metaphor: negotiator untethers the boy, Raglen untethers the last captain, and the broader goal is "to untether people from mistakes." First exchange hinges on this physical act, the word returns in the resolution, and the final image of cooling metal suggests temporary untethering from immediate crisis. Early signal, beat involvement across two trades, thematic and literal integration, closure linkage. Removing or replacing with generic "release" would weaken the story's semantic spine.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Synchronizing through moon phases is introduced as the reason for tonight's meeting (both calendars lie, only sky trusted), the first-quarter moon signals the exchange after three postponements, and the moon is checked during the list exchange. Setup and middle use clear; the method constrains timing and underscores distrust. Closure participation is indirect (the moon is not revisited in the final image), capping the score. Functional and specific but not indispensable to the ending itself.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The parapet is introduced in the opening line, its physical features (storm-worn, windblown, mist-shrouded, narrow with "teeth of stone," slick flags) constrain movement and create acoustic intimacy throughout. The environment pressures every choice: soldiers' careful steps, proximity that defuses anger, the narrowing under tension and widening after departure. Closure participation is strong—the widening parapet and thinning mist signal relief. Early signal, beat involvement, causal and closure linkage all met.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Between apology and forgiveness" is named as the temporal/conceptual space where the negotiator works, returns in the direct address to both sides, and implicitly frames the ending (neither full apology nor forgiveness achieved, but a step taken). Setup and thematic development clear; the phrase constrains rhetorical choices. Closure participation is conceptual rather than on-page temporal urgency. Lyric reprise that reweights the stake but is not load-bearing for plot logic; mid-band appropriate.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation is stated early (paragraph seven) and demonstrated: using the drawer pull to invoke grandmother's post-ration seed swaps, telling the boy "we might find the paper we forgot to sign," holding the dual-tarnish brass to calm the naming dispute. The desire to recycle mistakes drives the choice to show shared history rather than assert authority. Setup, middle constraint, and thematic closure linkage all met. Deduction: the phrasing "recycle mistakes into wisdom" trends abstract; grounding in the object and grandmother's example rescues it but does not fully erase the label quality.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Furrowed hush" is introduced in paragraph four and recurs in paragraph thirty-seven when silence moves across the stones. The tone—muted, careful, weighted—is consistent through all turns, modulates under the naming-dispute tension (shoulders drop "as if armor exhaled"), and charges the final image of mist thinning and metal cooling. Coherent through pressure, present in closure atmosphere, and the specific phrase reappears with added meaning. Strong tonal control that supports rather than dominates the ending.</comment>
