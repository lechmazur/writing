<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's voice is distinct and embodied ("I garden the edges like I am speaking softly to a skittish animal"), with micro-choices that reveal values under pressure. Internal contradiction appears subtly when the narrator admits lateness yet proceeds as keeper of memory. The cashier's appearance feels earned through the bread-communion logic, and her biographical sketch (oven crack, rent hike, son's birth) grounds the stakes. Minor deduction: the final choice to return "with a trowel" reads as stated intention rather than foreclosing a path with visible cost on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its pattern early (lists of tiny surrenders, guerrilla gardening metaphor) and builds density through tea-house uncloaking, bread-breaking communion, seed-planting. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the narrator accepts the ongoing work ("still a noticer, still refusing the lazy gravity of forgetting") with visible cost (feeling "lighter but not exonerated"). The tea house "locks us" beat crystallizes the contract. Minor gap: the cost is felt but could be more concretely tied to a foreclosed path; the ending gesture leans slightly toward future promise rather than present price paid.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The overgrown courtyard constrains access (thorn, nettle test patience) and the tea house breathes with moss and peeling lacquer, all filtered through the narrator's archival attention. The bread placed "in the middle table" and crumbs tucked "where the cracked sill meets the earth" function as micro-setting that charges the communion beat. The final image of "seeds crowding the seams and a table waiting" reconfigures the space from forgotten to re-inhabited. Spatial choreography remains clear (path, balusters, sundial, low structure, doorway, rafters, table, sill, garden seams).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: honoring small losses and refusing creeping normality. The narrator's choice to uncloak the doorway, speak names, brew tea, and plant seeds demonstrates agency; the cashier's arrival deepens pressure by revealing the systemic forces (landlord, cracked oven) behind the bakery's vanishing. The beat where they sweep crumbs and press seeds into seams tightens the commitment with on-page cost (returning tomorrow, holding the line thrown from shore). Minor issue: escalation is more additive than dramatically narrowing; each beat enriches rather than forcing a harder trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: bread cooling but history warm, "creeping normality" as comedian, seeds as counter to forgetting. The final image—birds returning to find "no miracle, only careful company"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of absolution without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the communion gesture (passing bread "as if passing a name back to its owner") and the tea house locking them in an "embrace of bone-dry timbers." The only slip: "tenuous absolution" is named once too explicitly mid-story, though the ending earns it through image and gesture.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is unmistakable: "creeping normality noticer," "heuristically gentle hands," "guerrilla gardening rather than conquest." Diction remains voice-consistent under pressure ("the living remember how we touch them," "a communion through guerrilla gardening for ants and roots"). The cashier's brief dialogue ("if I have been keeping watch all this time") carries subtext and advances the ritual. Distance is stable; focalization is clean. The only micro-slip: "I recognize her from memory more than sight" introduces slight filter distance at a peak beat, but it recovers immediately and the voice never falters.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Information density is high; nearly every line advances character, image, or theme. Rhythm varies naturally ("The courtyard accepts me... testing the patience... then offering a rustle"). Minor deductions: a few lines lean into decorative phrasing without added pressure ("etiquette" in "cloaked itself in moss and etiquette"; "thinking of snow" in the penultimate paragraph feels ornamental). One paraphrase loop: "guerrilla gardening" appears three times across the piece, twice as metaphor and once as method, but the third use adds no new pressure. No template cadence or major artifact, but the figurative density occasionally slows momentum in non-peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of archivist-narrator, guerrilla gardening, vanished bakery, and secret tea house feels specific and non-obvious. "Creeping normality noticer" as occupation reframes gentrification witness; the bread-as-communion and seed-planting ritual avoids sentimentality through concrete gesture. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure and lyric diction heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Minor limitation: the "cashier who smiled without permission" line and the tea house's moss-and-ivy reveal echo familiar urban-ruin motifs; the transformation is strong but not wholly unprecedented.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The "creeping normality noticer" trait frames the opening and closing, drives the choice to seek the tea house, and shapes the final commitment to return with tools. It appears in at least three beats (opening self-description, litany of losses mid-story, tomorrow's return) and the closure image ("still a noticer") reweights it as ongoing practice. The trait constrains tactics (gentle approach, cataloging losses) and the cost is felt in "lighter but not exonerated." Cap at mid-6s because the observation role is more thematic backdrop than pivot that narrows options on the page.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The bread appears in four beats: carried from the bakery, placed on the table, cracking "as if remembering heat," torn and shared with the cashier, crumbs swept into garden seams. It enables the communion ritual that summons the cashier and charges the closure. The object is handled, evolves meaning (devotional → offering → seed), and its final dispersal into the garden ties directly to the planted-seed ending. Strong integration; the only gap preventing 8.5+ is that the bread's role, while essential to ritual logic, could theoretically be replaced by another bakery relic with similar edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Tenuous absolution" is named once explicitly mid-story ("know such absolution is necessarily tenuous") but the concept shapes every beat: the narrator seeks it, performs gestures toward it (tea for the absent baker, bread-breaking, seed-planting), and the ending crystallizes it as an ongoing hold rather than a granted release ("lighter but not exonerated," "a line thrown from shore that I will have to keep holding"). The stakes and tactics (gentle uncloaking, litany of losses, no locking) all serve this concept. It charges the closure image. The explicit mid-story naming is the only friction.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Heuristically gentle" appears twice: once in the opening courtyard beat ("heuristically gentle hands") and once near the end ("heuristically gentle and reversible"). The trait constrains the uncloaking action (pruning knife, one tender slice at a time) and the seed-planting method (not conquest). It colors the narrator's entire approach and ties to the closure theme of careful company. Cap in mid-6s: the trait is more descriptive voice texture than a choice-point that visibly alters tactics with a dramatized cost; it enriches but does not pivot the story.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Uncloak" drives the tea house discovery beat: "I uncloak the doorway with my pruning knife, one tender slice at a time, revealing lattice and peeled lacquer." This action enables entry, sets up the communion ritual, and metaphorically frames the entire project of revealing what has been hidden. The method (tender, incremental) aligns with the trait and stakes. It appears early-middle, shapes a key turn, and the final image of the tea house "unlocked" by embrace echoes it. Strong integration; cap below 8.5 because swapping "uncloak" for "clear" or "open" would not break story logic, only weaken metaphor.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Guerrilla gardening" is named three times and enacted in four beats: clearing sightlines in the courtyard, tucking crumbs at the sill, sweeping crumbs into garden seams, pressing seeds into damp pockets, and the planned return with trowel. The method shapes tactics (gentle, reversible, anti-conquest) and ties directly to the closure image of seeds crowding the seams. It is signaled early and its mechanics matter throughout. Cap just below 8.0: the method is more thematic container than irreplaceable mechanic; "gentle restoration" or "incremental care" could substitute with moderate edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The "secret tea house in an overgrown palace courtyard" is the spatial anchor for the entire piece. The courtyard's thorn and nettle test patience; the path unscrolls; the tea house's moss, lattice, peeled lacquer, rafters, table, and cracked sill all supply resources and constraints. The setting enables the communion ritual, the cashier's appearance, and the seed-planting closure. It appears in the opening, structures every middle beat, and charges the final image ("a table waiting"). Strong integration; the only gap preventing 8.5+ is that the tea house could theoretically be another abandoned urban space (bakery, library) with similar ritual logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"After the birds fly south" anchors the opening and the closing ("if the birds come back in spring"), creating a seasonal frame that implies time passing and a future test. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or alter tactics on the page; it functions as atmospheric bracket rather than live clock. The piece's pressure comes from the narrator's internal stakes, not temporal urgency. The reprise at the end earns thematic resonance but does not constrain middle choices. Cap at mid-4s for setup and lyric payoff without developmental pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"To find the sacred in the ordinary" is explicitly stated mid-story ("My motivation has never been heroics; I came here to find the sacred...") and dramatized through every ritual beat: warming the room by breathing and telling names, brewing cheap tea, speaking the litany, bread-breaking, seed-planting. The desire is conflicted (lateness, inability to prevent the tarp, "tenuous" absolution) and the cost is legible in the narrator's ongoing commitment. The motivation shapes all choices and charges the closure. Minor deduction for the explicit mid-story declaration; otherwise fully integrated.</comment>
