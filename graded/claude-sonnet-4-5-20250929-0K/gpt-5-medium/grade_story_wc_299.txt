<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotional contradictions ("my practiced distance flutter like a tarp, then still itself"). The protagonist's micro-choices—cataloging the locker, assigning the scrap differential value, writing the interpretive note—reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Internal conflict is present but largely sequential rather than simultaneous: the promise to "not feel anything" versus the hand that "knew exactly which cabinet." The final renunciation (pricing some items low, elevating the scrap) is earned by prior causality with visible cost, meeting the core test for this length.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. The piece accumulates through layered reflection anchored to present objects (locker contents), building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—the protagonist writes a recommendation that honors memory over market value, foreclosing pure professional distance with visible conceptual cost. Orientation anchors (quarry office, narrator alone with Bowers, post-radio-failure timeframe) arrive within the first ~10% and remain stable. One meaningful deepening occurs when the scrap "insisted on naming itself" and the narrator decides "facts could hold space without bricking it shut," shifting from emotional insulation to integration. Cost is legible in the final catalog entry and the phrase "sometimes you keep a rock not for hardness but for echo."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The quarry office functions as micro-setting: "file boxes, rock dust frosting my boots," the locker "laid open on a desk dinged by boots and quartz." The scrap itself becomes setting-as-object, its houndstooth weave and cigarette singe grounding memory in tactile detail. Sensory selection reflects urgency and professional habit (ruler, glue odor "sick sweetness like old soda syrup"). The setting charges the final image: "the pit glittered with puddles and mica, an echo valley longing made visible." The physical space (quarry) and its acoustic memory ("hold sound like a lung holds breath") constrain the narrator's stance, meeting the 9+ gate criteria for environment shaping the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: reconciling professional distance with unresolved grief after public failure. The tightening occurs when the narrator's hand recognizes the scrap and "my practiced distance flutter[s]," forcing a trade-off between cataloging as "petty cash" and honoring "memory load disproportionate to market." The protagonist's agency (decision to assign differential value and recommend museum placement) drives the resolution. One visible price: the narrator abandons pure emotional insulation, the "professional tape that kept cables from tangling into grief," accepting that "facts could hold space without bricking it shut." The escalation is driven by protagonist choice under the accumulative lens, and the cost is unmistakable on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: grief as persistent echo, the gap between professional detachment and human memory, the choice to honor rather than monetize loss. The central question—how to live after the applause stops—is answered non-literally in the catalog entry: "memory load disproportionate to market." The final image ("the pit glittered... an echo valley longing made visible, and the wind carried back our breath") reweights prior material without stated moral. The scrap, tuning fork, and "echo valley" motif recur with shifted meaning, constraining the protagonist's choice at closure. No thematic echo; the resolution emerges from scene pressure rather than assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct and consistent: the narrator filters through roadie and appraiser lenses simultaneously ("professional tape," "ruler whose edge had bitten a thousand cardboard flaps"), with diction that blends technical precision and lyric compression ("rock dust frosting my boots like evaporated applause"). POV distance is stable; knowledge remains character-bound (the narrator recognizes the scrap from lived experience, not omniscience). Rhythmic control under pressure is exceptional: short declaratives tighten at recognition ("But facts tilted"), then expand into reflective fragments that remain anchored to present stimuli. Bowers's brief dialogue ("the quarry remembers") feels natural and advances the thematic stakes. No head-hopping; focalization is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Information density is high: most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "I used to wrest amps from vans in the rain, then coil hope onto spindles" establishes backstory, metaphor, and emotional signature). Rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating at recognition ("my hand knew exactly which cabinet, and which night, and why the corner was burned") and breathing in reflective passages. Minor issues: occasional figurative density in mid-pressure beats ("grief kept finding the gap between stories and sleep" followed closely by "the applause sloshed off the shale like water") and one near-paraphrase loop ("facts first" / "facts could hold space" / "facts tilted"). No major scaffold or loops touch the closure beat. Syntax varies; sentence openings avoid template runs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—failed appraiser confronts grief artifact in a former concert venue—feels specific and non-obvious. The narrator's dual lens (roadie/appraiser) transforms stock redemption-after-failure material into a story about how professional distance and memory can coexist rather than cancel. The scrap's houndstooth pattern and cigarette singe are irreplaceably particular; the catalog entry ("memory load disproportionate to market") offers a fresh inflection on valuation. Risk-taking in lyric compression and reflection-heavy design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The piece commits fully to its premise (echo as both acoustic and emotional phenomenon) and follows its implications to a resonant, non-sentimental ending.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ex-roadie/appraiser character drives two key beats: taking the quarry job after public failure (setup), and deciding to assign the scrap differential catalog value with museum recommendation (closure choice). The dual expertise constrains tactics (measuring weave, dating glue) and enables the final act of professional-personal integration. Early signal in paragraph six; causal pressure shapes the ending; specificity (roadie knowledge of speaker grilles, appraiser protocols) makes the role irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The speaker grille cloth scrap appears in three distinct beats: initial catalog examination, recognition via houndstooth pattern and cigarette singe, and the final differential pricing with interpretive note. It narrows options (hand recognition breaks emotional insulation), enables the closure choice (museum placement recommendation), and charges the final image via "memory load disproportionate to market." Early signal (paragraph thirteen); causal pressure and closure linkage are strong; the scrap's specific physical properties (weave, singe, glue odor) make it irreplaceable. Visible cost: the narrator abandons pure detachment.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"After the applause" shapes the dominant stake (living after loss and failure) and reappears with shifted weight in the closure catalog entry ("the night after the applause"). It constrains present choices by establishing that public failure and Leon's death both followed moments of acclaim, making the narrator wary of exposure. Present in setup (paragraphs nine–ten), middle reflection (Leon's death "after the applause came sirens"), and closure recommendation. Functional across beats but could be replaced with a near-synonym timeframe ("after the acclaim," "post-performance") with moderate edits, limiting score ceiling.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Confidently uncertain" appears once as a label in paragraph six ("confidently uncertain about my worth") and is enacted when the narrator measures the scrap with practiced skill while emotional certainty wavers ("my practiced distance flutter like a tarp, then still itself"). The trait enables the final hybrid catalog entry that balances professional protocol with subjective memory load, but the on-page cost is oblique—more opportunity cost (foreclosing pure monetization) than visible consequence. Late first use and label-only initial mention lower the score; enactment at closure provides moderate lift.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Wrest" appears once in paragraph five ("I used to wrest amps from vans in the rain") to establish the narrator's roadie past and physical competence. It primes the recognition beat (hands that wrestled amps now handle the scrap) and contrasts with the gentler appraiser work ("lift without breaking"). The action shapes backstory that informs present skill but does not directly drive a major turn; the narrator's current choices hinge on recognition and cataloging rather than physical force. Lyric reprise quality (early seed, thematic payoff) but mid-scene causal role is limited. Swappable with "haul" or "pull" without major structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Insulating emotionally with facts" is signaled early (paragraph four: "my old roadie trick, insulating emotionally with facts") and mechanically enacted across multiple beats: measuring the scrap with a ruler, cataloging weave and ash residue, assigning GPS coordinates. The method fails under pressure ("facts tilted because my hand knew"), forcing the protagonist to revise the approach ("facts could hold space without bricking it shut"). This revision drives the closure choice (catalog entry that integrates emotion and fact). Early signal, causal involvement in middle and ending, and visible cost (abandoning pure detachment) meet all three gates and demonstrate necessity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The quarry office trailer anchors the scene spatially (paragraphs one–two: "squatted in the cut," "file boxes, rock dust") and its desk supplies the surface where the locker is examined. Bowers's presence and thermos add lived-in texture. The setting provides the catalyst (demo crew's find) but does not constrain later choices; the narrator's catalog decision could occur in any appraiser workspace. The final exterior image (pit with puddles, mica, echo valley) charges the ending thematically but arrives as backdrop rather than tactical constraint. Setup and thematic payoff present; middle development (setting altering choice mechanics) is weak.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The timeframe "after failing publicly two weeks ago" is established in paragraph three and motivates the narrator's defensive stance ("I had promised myself I would not feel anything here"). It explains why the narrator took the quarry job ("discover purpose after loss") and adds urgency to the need for professional redemption. The two-week gap does not tighten on-page decisions—no clock pressure within the scene—but the recent failure primes the vulnerability that makes the scrap's recognition potent. Setup and motivation present; live tactical pressure from elapsed time is absent, capping the score in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"To discover purpose after loss" is stated in paragraph twenty-four ("discover purpose after loss by listening to rocks") and dramatized through the catalog choice: the narrator finds purpose not in pure appraisal but in honoring memory's claim. The desire conflicts with the professional need to remain detached and monetarily accurate, creating friction when the hand recognizes the scrap. The final catalog entry and museum recommendation embody the discovered purpose with visible cost (foreclosing pure market logic). Setup via stated motivation, middle friction (facts versus memory), and closure enactment meet all gates. The motivation shapes the ending choice with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Echo valley longing" as tone is coherent and purposeful throughout: sensory details emphasize reverberation and absence (heater ticking, blasts "already asleep," the quarry that "hold[s] sound like a lung holds breath"), diction layers melancholy with technical precision, and the final image ("echo valley longing made visible") crystalizes the tone as both setting and emotional state. Tone modulates under pressure: initially detached and catalog-focused, then destabilized at recognition, then integrated in the closing lines where longing is accepted rather than insulated against. The tone charges the final image and shapes the narrator's voice across all beats, meeting high-integration criteria.</comment>
