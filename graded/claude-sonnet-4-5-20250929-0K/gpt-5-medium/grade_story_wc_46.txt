<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is concrete and embodied through the polishing action, with contradiction between grief (brother, fire) and devotion to slow craft. Micro-choices—selecting glass, testing warmth on tongue—reveal a hierarchy of values. The brother backstory anchors present stance without flattening pressure, and the final choice (offering garland to village) forecloses the quick-fire path with visible cost (patience over spectacle). Emotional progression is realistic, layering mourning with quiet determination.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the garland's gentle light reconfigures the village's relationship to fire and the narrator's grief, with conceptual cost legible in the final image (brother may "finally anchor" only if he accepts patience over speed). The accumulative/textural lens holds—density increases through polishing beats, backstory interleave, and village installation, culminating in a cadence shift where "dusk and mist" replace torch-light. One meaningful deepening (polishing→stringing→village acceptance) tightens the dominant stake. Orientation anchors early (grotto, mist, tide). The brother's absence and potential return charge the ending without requiring his on-page appearance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The grotto constrains the work spatially (damp light, mist, pebbles) and the sea glass itself functions as micro-setting, polished against slate, leather, coat—each surface choice mattering. Sensory detail is vivid and selective: "petal-cool softness," "salt brightness," "kelp fiber." The garland's interaction with grotto breath at closure charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clear (grotto→cliff stairs→village lane). The body and tools (tongue, slate, cuff) constrain action throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (sharing light without fire) is signaled early and pressure coheres through accumulative deepening: solo craft→remembering brother/village fire→carrying garland up→village acceptance. One tightening occurs when the garland "learns its work" and village faces soften, narrowing the either/or (fire vs. darkness) into a third option with visible cost (patience, no spectacle). Agency is renunciation and endurance—refusing quick fire, embracing slow polishing—with the final image foreclosing the torch path. The village's "wary of sparks" constraint shapes the resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: patience vs. quickness, harm vs. safety, breath vs. blaze. The sea glass and polishing process constrain the thematic answer without stating it. The final image offers a non-literal answer to the central question (how to bring light safely) through the metaphor of "listening" glass and village breath synchronizing with tide rhythm. No moralizing; the brother's potential return and need to "weigh the word safer against the word patient" leaves resonance open. Subtext operates in silence (brother's absence) and in the garland's mechanics (no matches needed).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout: "zephyr bloom unfurling," "waves continue inside it, round as a heartbeat," diction tied to sea and stone. Psychic distance is stable (close first-person). Purposeful compression ("softened by years of salt and tumble") and lyric rhythm ("round as a heartbeat," "milk into tea") are pattern-taught and support accumulative pressure. No head-hopping. Slight register drift in "betrays the line between water and air" reads elevated but remains voice-motivated and coherent with the contemplative stance. Rhythmic control under emotional pressure (fire memory) holds without flattening.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High information density with purposeful figurative language: "compass inside my chest," "lantern made of patience and tide." Rhythm varies (short declaratives alternate with longer accumulative clauses). Some minor template cadence in mid-section ("I pick... I circle... I set...") but not pervasive enough to trigger heavy penalty. Zero paraphrase loops; sentences advance. Clarity and momentum remain strong. "Reflectively vibrant" reads slightly ornamental in isolation but is integrated through the polishing arc. The opening and closing lines anchor voice and recharge motifs effectively.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of sea glass polishing as both literal craft and metaphor for patient light-sharing feels specific and non-obvious. Transformation of the fire-vs.-darkness trope through gradual, breath-powered luminescence avoids template plots. The grotto setting and the narrator's earthbound stance (vs. brother's horizon-chasing) create fresh particularity. Risk-taking in lyric compression and the quiet, tool-based climax heightens stakes without gimmickry. Minor proximity to "pearl" and "lantern" metaphors in contemplative literature, but the garland mechanics and village integration distinguish it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Earthbound star watcher is named early, frames the narrator's stance (staying vs. brother leaving), and drives key turns: choosing to polish rather than light fire, carrying the garland to the village, stringing it publicly. The identity shapes tactics (ground-level craft, not height-seeking) and charges the closure (waiting for brother's return to a changed village). Present in all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sea glass appears early (between pebbles), is handled and transformed across multiple beats (weighing, polishing against slate/leather/coat, warming on tongue, stringing with kelp, hanging in village), and its state evolution (rough→smooth→light-holding) drives the escalation. Essential to closure: the garland's reflective function makes the village ending possible. Removing it would break story logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Pearl of stillness" is named mid-story as a descriptor for the polishing result and shapes the dominant stake (creating calm light vs. fire's quickness). It reappears in the closure image when the glass "drinks the dim and gives it back as a layered hush." Functional but somewhat replaceable with similar metaphor. Present in setup and payoff; middle development is implicit.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Reflectively vibrant" describes the polished glass once, labeling its quality. It does not constrain an on-page action with cost; the reflection matters more than the vibrance. Late signal (second third), ornamental use, swappable with "luminous" or "radiant." Present in middle development (description after polishing) but not clearly in setup or closure beats.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Weigh" appears twice: weighing sea glass against palm (testing for polishing) and the brother potentially weighing "safer against patient" at closure. Both uses are causal—first drives selection of material, second frames thematic resolution. Essential to the decision-making texture and closure linkage. Present in setup and payoff; middle use is functional.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Gem polishing is signaled early ("the method the old woman taught"), its mechanics matter (circling against slate, leather, coat), and the process shapes the entire middle arc. The patience required and the resulting "tender lantern" drive the dominant stake. Essential: without this method, no garland and no resolution. Present in all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Serpentine grotto provides the spatial anchor, supplies resources (pebbles with sea glass), and its mist and breath return at closure to activate the garland. Micro-setting constrains the polishing work (damp light, stone arches) and the grotto-to-cliff journey structures the turn. Removing it would require major restructure. Present in all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"As memories resurface" signals a time layer (present polishing interleaved with past fire/brother). The timeframe enables thematic contrast (quick fire then vs. patient craft now) and primes closure (waiting for brother's return). Functional but does not create a ticking clock; the tide turns but does not tighten decisions. Present in setup and payoff; middle involvement is thematic rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"To share light without using fire" is stated early and drives every beat: selecting sea glass, polishing instead of burning, carrying the garland, waiting without matches. Friction between desire (light for the village) and cost (patience, no spectacle, brother's absence) creates pressure. Essential to closure: the garland's success validates the motivation. Present in all three gates with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Zephyr bloom" is named once as a descriptor for breeze texture and sets the lyric, gentle tone. Tone remains coherent (contemplative, patient, soft) throughout and modulates slightly with the fire memory (grief) before returning to calm at closure. The final image (glass breathing, faces brightening without glare) sustains the tone and charges the ending. Functional across the piece but not indispensable; a different tonal anchor could serve. Present in setup and payoff.</comment>
