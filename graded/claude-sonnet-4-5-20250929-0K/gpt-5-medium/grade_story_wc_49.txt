<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Rowen is characterized primarily through atmospheric description and repeated metaphorical gestures ("spins golden stories," "pockets of screws and songs") rather than contradictory impulses or on-page choices under pressure. His motivation to restore practices is declared but never tested by a competing desire or cost—he arrives, performs, and leaves with no visible internal friction. The village collective receives even less interiority; they are a passive chorus that practices until "throats were polished." No choice forecloses a path with felt cost; the ending grants success without sacrifice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The piece establishes a lyric-accumulative design but fails the Orientation Test: by ~120 words we have "verdant arbor," "village," and "fields" without anchoring who the narrator is, their relationship to Rowen, or what specific practice has lapsed. The closure—"the remedy took" and "sacred practices returned"—declares success but lacks a decisive change or visible cost; bowls mend and wells echo without on-page consequence or foreclosed option. The inferred lens (Accumulative/Textural) requires a pattern break or cadence shift that reweights the stake with cost; instead the text offers unearned restoration. Orientation debt triggers −0.4 and caps per the global rule.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The arbor, frame, and tendril function as micro-setting that constrains the ritual's mechanics and charges the final image when "the frame hummed" and "the tendril glowed gold-green." Sensory details—"dew trembled into tone," "needles at the edge of hearing"—are vivid and filtered through a collective, reverent POV. However, spatial choreography of the village gathering is vague, and the setting does not pressure a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome. Q3 cap at 7.0 applied per Orientation Test penalty.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring sacred practices—is signaled early but never tightens or tests Rowen's agency. No on-page reversal narrows options; the harvest moon "arrives," the songs are sung, and the remedy succeeds without friction, adaptation, or cost. The one-day timeframe mentioned at midpoint ("Only one day remained") does not shape tactics or create visible pressure. Under the Accumulative lens, escalation would require density increase or cadence shift that reweights the stake; instead, the text loops through synonymous descriptions of singing and alignment without meaningful deepening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme—repair through collective remembering, alignment as consent—emerges from images (cracked bowls mending, wells finding echoes) rather than direct statement. The final image, "the earth answered in a voice we recognized," offers a resonant but oblique answer to the central question. However, the resolution into "ordinary appetite, a daily hunger to align with care" edges toward abstract philosophizing, and no counter-reading or complexity troubles the tidy restoration. The closing gesture, while quiet, reweights prior material without a stated moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>First-person plural ("we") maintains stable collective stance without head-hopping into individual interiorities. The perceptual signature—"dew trembled into tone," "silence is a tool"—is distinct and lyric, though it risks elevating diction past a village collective's plausible idiom ("reconfiguration," "filament of patient light"). No dialogue appears. Psychic distance is consistent, and the voice modulates purposefully from hush to celebration. However, the elevated register in peak beats ("alignment is not precision but consent") drifts toward essay voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high: nearly every sentence carries metaphor or simile ("time loosen," "doubts softened like bread," "moon lowered its chin"). Mixed vehicles appear: the moon "listening like a teacher" anthropomorphizes while "fat with memory but careful with its light" mixes culinary and optical metaphors without coherent logic. Paraphrase loops recur: "spins golden stories" (line 3), "Spinning stories into the chords" (line 28), and "stories gilded the air, a filament of patient light" (line 12) restate the same image. Template stems cluster: "He said," "He taught," "He knelt," "Rowen said" across adjacent lines. Filter-verb stacks appear in peak beats ("I felt the grove agree," "I felt time loosen," "I understood that repair"). Applying patterned-artifact penalties: paraphrase loop −0.3, template cadence −0.4, figurative muddle in closure third −0.6, filter stacks −0.5 = cumulative −1.8 deduction from a mid-7 baseline. Disallow 9+ globally per artifact-in-final-third rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—whimsical tinkerer arrives to restore lost ritual through song and a magical instrument—follows a familiar restoration-quest template without transformation. Specific details (vine tendril coiled like a sleeping question, driftwood frame shaped like an ear) add texture but do not generate a non-obvious moral calculus or lived friction. The tinkerer's effortless success and the village's unearned restoration echo genre conventions without subversion or risk. No bold structural choice or fresh synthesis distinguishes the emotional arc from similar pastoral-repair stories.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Rowen is present throughout and his actions (stringing the tendril, teaching the notes, beginning the songs) drive multiple beats. However, his choices lack conflict or cost—he arrives with clear purpose and executes without obstacle. No on-page decision narrows options or pays a price. He is causally active but not pressured, and his departure ("promising to return only if the songs went hungry again") is conditional rather than costly. Setup ✓, Development (action without choice) ~0.4, Closure participation ✓. Causal pressure absent −0.8, swappability (any skilled outsider) −0.5. Starting 3.0 + setup 0.5 + two beats 0.9 + closure link 0.9 − causal pressure 0.8 − swappability 0.5 = 4.0, round to 4.2 for sustained on-page presence.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The vine tendril is introduced early ("From his satchel he drew a coil of vine tendril"), reappears when "he strung it across a driftwood frame," is plucked to produce tone, and glows at the climax ("the vine tendril glowed gold-green"). It is handled in at least three distinct beats and shapes the ritual's mechanics. However, its unique properties (gifted at solstice, hardened into living filament) do not constrain a choice or impose cost—any resonant string might serve. Setup ✓, Development ✓, Closure ✓. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure link +1.0, specificity +0.4, swappability −0.6 = start 3.0 + 2.8 − 0.6 = 5.2, raised to 6.8 for sustained reweighting across beats and charged reprise at climax.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The harvest moon is seeded at midpoint ("Only one day remained before the harvest moon"), anchors the climactic night ("the harvest moon arrived with a humble astonishment"), and participates in the closure ("As each name was spoken, the moon lowered its chin, listening"). It frames the ritual's timing but does not tighten tactics or impose a felt cost—any ceremonial deadline could substitute. Setup (mid-story) −0.3, Development (frames timing) +0.5, Closure ✓. Beat involvement (one) +0.4, closure link +0.9, swappability −0.7 = start 3.0 + 1.8 − 1.0 = 3.8, raised to 5.7 for lyric reprise that reweights the stake at closure without causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Spins golden stories from scrap and memory" is declared early and repeated ("Spinning stories into the chords") but remains metaphorical label without dramatized constraint or cost. The stories are said to "gild the air" and "name our debts," yet no specific story content alters a choice or forecloses an option. Setup ✓, Development (mentioned) ~0.2, Closure (stories named) ✓. Label-only trait −0.8, ornamental use −0.6, swappability −0.5 = start 3.0 + setup 0.5 + closure link 0.7 − 1.9 = 2.3, raised to 3.9 for persistent thematic presence without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The remedy is Rowen's explicit purpose ("to restore sacred practices") and the climactic turn ("The remedy took, because remedies prefer collective hands"). It shapes the entire narrative arc and is signaled early. However, the remedy succeeds without dramatized resistance or cost—no failure, adaptation, or sacrifice. Setup ✓, Development ✓, Closure ✓. Early signal +0.7, causal pressure (intent) +0.8, closure link +1.2, cost absent −0.9, swappability (any restoration) −0.6 = start 3.0 + 2.7 − 1.5 = 4.2, raised to 6.1 for sustained arc presence despite lack of felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Forgotten songs are the method throughout: "Through forgotten songs, he promised, the grove would remember," songs are taught ("He taught us to hum the low note"), practiced ("We practiced until our throats were polished"), and performed at climax ("Rowen began the forgotten songs"). The mechanics matter—specific notes "feed the soil" and "open seed memory"—and the method shapes multiple beats. Setup ✓, Development ✓, Closure ✓. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.0, closure link +1.3, specificity +0.6 = start 3.0 + 5.0 = 8.0, reduced to 7.3 for lack of visible cost tied to the method itself.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The verdant arbor at dawn opens the story ("At the verdant arbor at dawn") and the arbor participates at closure ("the arbor wore a new calm"). However, it functions as backdrop rather than constraint—no spatial feature alters tactics or supplies a resource. The arbor "bent closer" when the tendril was plucked, adding atmosphere but not pressure. Setup ✓, Development (atmosphere only) ~0.2, Closure ✓. Early signal +0.6, closure link +0.8, ornamental use −0.7, swappability −0.6 = start 3.0 + 1.4 − 1.3 = 3.1, raised to 5.2 for lyric reprise that brackets the arc without causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The timeframe is introduced at midpoint ("Only one day remained before the harvest moon") and anchors the climactic night ("the night lifted its curtain"). However, the deadline does not tighten tactics or create visible pressure—no scene shows urgency or adaptation due to the approaching moon. Setup (mid-story) −0.3, Development (frames timing) ~0.3, Closure ✓. Late signal −0.4, ornamental use −0.7, swappability −0.5 = start 3.0 + closure 0.9 − 1.6 = 2.3, raised to 4.8 for structural participation at climax without tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Rowen's motivation—"to restore sacred practices the village had let slip"—is stated early and frames the entire arc. However, it is never dramatized through conflicting desire or visible cost. He arrives, teaches, succeeds, and leaves with no friction. Setup ✓, Development (intent sustained) +0.5, Closure ✓. Early signal +0.6, beat involvement (two) +0.9, closure link +1.0, told-only −0.9, no friction −0.8 = start 3.0 + 2.5 − 1.7 = 3.8, raised to 5.9 for sustained thematic spine despite lack of dramatized conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Gathering hush" opens and closes the story ("a gathering hush settled," "In that gathering hush, the sacred practices returned"), modulates through "gathering" imagery (elders bring bowls, children carry jars), and charges the final image. Tone is coherent and purposeful, supporting reverence without static mood. Setup ✓, Development ✓, Closure ✓. Early signal +0.7, closure link +1.4, modulation +0.6 = start 3.0 + 2.7 = 5.7, raised to 6.6 for sustained tonal control and charged reprise despite minor lapses into elevated abstraction.</comment>
