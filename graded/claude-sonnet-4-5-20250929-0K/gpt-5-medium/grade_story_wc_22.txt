<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The coachman's motivation is clear and embodied through repeated concrete actions—cracking pods, pulling bayonets, kneeling to plant—that show patient reclamation work. Interiority remains thin; we see what he does and infer purpose, but contradictory impulses or internal friction never surface. The final choice to leave and return tomorrow feels inevitable rather than costly, more ritual than renunciation. Embodied emotion is present in gesture ("thumb and palm finding the seam") but the piece leans descriptive over psychological pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered images (reef death, battlefield reclamation, dead languages, bird-guided planting) and the final image reconfigures the jetty as "narrow as mercy," reweighting the opening "narrow vastness." Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration—the garden's hold quiets ghosts without dismissing them—but cost remains conceptual and diffuse rather than legible in a specific forfeiture. Orientation anchors who and where by the second paragraph, though "after the reef dies" provides temporal context without dramatic urgency. The piece coheres under its lens but the ending image, while charged, lacks a sharp visible or felt price that would elevate closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and particular: salt-slick boards, shell holes filled with rain, rusting cannon wheels, morning glory braiding planks. The jetty and battlefield constrain the coachman's work—he must fertilize cracks, navigate remnants of war, train vines on bayonet lattices—and the blooming jetty charges the final image directly. Sensory detail is dense and purposeful, filtered through his craft (kelp ash, bone dust, pulverized shells). Micro-setting (the cart, the pods, the lattice) functions as active constraint and participates in closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—letting a garden reclaim the battlefield—is signaled early and pursued consistently. Pressure accumulates through textural density rather than sharp reversals: he plants, he listens, he removes bayonets, he recites prayers. The closest tightening is the discovery of the bayonet pit and the choice to convert it into a lattice, which narrows his method but doesn't foreclose a live option or impose visible cost. The ending deepens by naming the jetty "narrow as mercy," but cost remains atmospheric rather than a specific trade-off on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—submerged concord, a treaty between brine memory and seed breath, growth as apology—emerges organically from particulars: reef death, dead languages revived for gulls, bayonets converted to trellises. The final image ("narrow as mercy") offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. Subtext operates consistently in silence, gesture, and the layered meaning of "fertilize" and "translate." The piece invites reflection through purposeful ambiguity (what treaty, with whom?) without confusion, and complexity is honored rather than resolved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited; distance is consistent and controlled. Voice is distinct—"salt-bitten but sturdy," "narrow vastness," "delete gnats from the air"—with a rhythmic, lyric texture that modulates under pressure (shorter clauses during planting, longer during reflection). Perceptual signature is clear: he notices cracks, seams, bird grammar, and the physical vocabulary of his craft. No dialogue appears; internal thought is handled through free indirect ("He thinks of the coach road..."). The voice occasionally edges toward archaic register ("unseam the wind," "bless, mapping pressure lines") but remains legible and purpose-driven.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("narrow vastness," "small thunder promising leaf," "margin for fragrance"). Several metaphors strain or layer without sharpening sense: "harbor smooth as weed," "soldiers of dill, fleets of poppies," "battlefield unlaces under green." Template stems recur ("He [verb]" x7 in quick succession mid-piece), creating a drumbeat that flattens momentum. Paraphrase loops appear: "submerged concord" is named three times with minimal reweighting until the end. Information density is high but some lines do decorative work rather than advance pressure. Closure image is clean; line-level artifacts do not touch it directly but accumulate enough to prevent high-band entry.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—coachman-gardener-linguist reclaiming a battlefield via dead languages and bird calls—feels specific and non-obvious. The piece transforms the "post-war garden" trope through the unusual trifecta of kelp ash, Phoenician prayer, and gull-guided navigation. Voice and subject cohere as a singular vision. Risk is moderate: the lyric density and elliptical causality heighten atmosphere but occasionally obscure immediate stakes. The ending ("narrow as mercy") arrives inevitably from prior particulars and avoids generic resolution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Present throughout; his choices to fertilize, pull bayonets, train vines, and recite prayers drive multiple beats. Decisions alter tactics (converting bayonets to lattice, following bird maps) and the final choice to return tomorrow frames endurance. Cost is implied but not sharp; no single choice visibly forecloses a path. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage elevate the score, but swappability (another restorer/gardener could perform similar actions) and diffuse cost prevent higher placement.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Pods appear in burlap sacks at the start, are cracked mid-piece ("thumb and palm finding the seam"), scatter seeds across the battlefield, and are gathered empty at the end ("still whispering"). They enable the fertilization action, constrain his method (measured arcs, "small thunder"), and return with reweighted meaning in the final beat. Specificity is high (dried, rustling, seamed); they participate in three distinct beats and shape closure. Cost connection is indirect (tools of the treaty) but their physical presence and evolving use across the arc justify this score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Submerged concord" is named three times and described as "the pact between drowned reef and living shore." It frames the coachman's motivation and thematic lens, but does not constrain tactics on the page—he would plant and fertilize regardless of whether "concord" were invoked. The concept charges the final image ("narrow as mercy" echoes the treaty logic) and reweights prior material thematically. Setup is early, closure linkage is clear, but middle development is minimal; the concept remains more thematic resonance than plot driver.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Present early ("speaks dead languages") and demonstrated in two beats: humming back to gulls in a dead tongue, reciting Phoenician prayer over water. The trait enables communication with birds (though causality is loose) and adds texture to the fertilization ritual. Cost is absent—no moment where speaking dead languages forecloses another option or imposes a trade-off. The trait is colorful and consistent but functionally ornamental; near-synonym "knows bird calls" could replace it with minor edits. Setup and closure presence (Phoenician prayer) lift it above pure decoration.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fertilization is the central action: he fertilizes cracks with kelp ash and bone dust, spreads seeds in measured arcs, tips ash at the jetty edge, and "salts the wounds of earth with sweetness." The action drives at least four distinct beats and defines the dominant stake (reclaiming the battlefield). It constrains method (listening to birds, following their grammar, choosing beds by currents) and is causally linked to the blooming jetty and the final image. Cost is implied (patience, labor, return tomorrow) but not sharp. High beat involvement, early setup, and closure linkage justify this score; irreplaceability is strong (no other action would enact "growth as apology").</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Bird calls guide fertilization in three beats: "understanding bird calls" selects where to spread mixtures, "gulls turning scouts," and "birds whistle a latitude of calcium and wind, telling him where the soil remembers." The method is signaled early, shapes his tactics mid-piece, and frames his interaction with the land. Mechanics are impressionistic (how exactly do calls indicate soil memory?) but consistent within the lyric mode. Cost is absent; no moment where relying on birds forecloses another approach. The method is specific and plot-active but not indispensable—he could rely on direct observation with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The jetty appears in the opening beat ("blooming jetty at twilight"), mid-piece ("At the jetty edge"), and the closing line ("cross the blooming jetty, narrow as mercy"). It constrains action (salt-slick boards he must navigate, cracks he fertilizes, planks braided with morning glory) and supplies the visual anchor for closure. "Blooming despite the salt" provides a micro-reversal that primes the theme. Specificity is high (boards, cracks, twilight sheen); the jetty is both setting and outcome. Tone modulation is present (purple sheen → star-flowers and moth wings). Strong setup, development, and closure linkage support this score.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the reef dies" frames the story's premise and motivates the coachman's work (reef guarded the harbor; now it is a pale grave; fishes exiled). The timeframe sets the emotional stakes (loss, exile, reclamation) but does not create urgency or tighten decisions on the page. No clock or deadline presses his choices; he works at dusk and will return tomorrow. The element provides context and thematic weight but does not constrain tactics or alter the tempo of action. Setup is early, thematic linkage is clear, but middle development and cost connection are absent.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Motivation is stated early ("to let a garden reclaim the battlefield") and dramatized through repeated actions: planting soldiers of dill, pulling bayonets, training morning glory, fertilizing with sweetness. The desire is conflicted implicitly (growth as apology suggests guilt or debt) and shapes every beat. Cost is present but diffuse (labor, patience, return tomorrow) rather than a sharp trade-off. The motivation drives the arc and participates in closure ("the battlefield unlaces under green"), but lacks a moment where want clashes visibly with a competing impulse or price. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage elevate it; absence of sharp friction caps it.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>"Narrow vastness" is named in the opening beat ("evening emptiness sharpens the harbor into a narrow vastness") and returns transformed in the closing line ("narrow as mercy"). The tone—constrained immensity, compression within expanse—is coherent throughout: salt-slick boards, folded knuckles, wrist of stone, small path through an ocean. Modulation is subtle: twilight → darkness, purple sheen → star-flowers, emptiness → fragrance. The tone charges the final image decisively, reweighting "narrow" from spatial constraint to ethical compression. Setup and closure linkage are strong; tonal consistency across turns supports the score.</comment>
