<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The fortune-cookie writer POV is concrete and sustained, with internal contradiction between wanting to be heard and accepting cryptic silence. Embodied moments work well: "my palm warms the shell until the rooms in it loosen their doors." However, the character never makes a genuine choice under pressure—they describe mapping memories and conducting silence without dramatizing tradeoffs or costs that foreclose an option. The transformation is told (understanding fortunes were breath instructions) rather than earned through on-page decision.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered memory-rooms and sensory motifs until the final paragraph reconfigures fortunes as breath instructions with cost (the diner's ribs will feel the dawn). The closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the fortune-writing premise is reweighted from riddle to conductor's score—with felt cost implied in "the shell cools, sated by its own echo." Orientation anchors (Glass spire, frozen lake, fortune writer's room) arrive early. One modest density increase when dawn "takes the podium" and the conductor metaphor crystallizes suffices for this length and lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The Glass spire, frozen lake, frost-pane, and nautilus shell constrain the conductor's method: notches on frost become the score's staff, the shell marks crescendos by fog. Sensory detail is vivid and selective: "whale-slow groans beneath the mirrored horizon," "dust turned sunbeams into measured bars." The body and shell function as micro-setting that charges the final image when "the shell cools, sated." Spatial choreography remains coherent across the room, sill, and window.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—to conduct unheard symphonies—is signaled early and tightens when the protagonist realizes "to conduct what cannot yet be heard, you first tend to what hears you back," forcing a shift from command to invitation. The escalation reads as accumulative deepening: mapping memories, scoring breath, inviting elements to join, and finally recognizing the orchestra's listening is "louder than any noise." The cost is conceptual and felt: the protagonist finishes "before exhaustion hits" and the shell cools, implying depletion. Agency is enacted through attention and renunciation of force.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: breath as the medium of symphony, listening as louder than noise, fortunes as instructions rather than riddles. The final image—"some night a diner will break one and read the hush inside, and feel the dawn performing in their ribs"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. The hospital tick, library motes, and kitchen steam accumulate into the score without symbolic convenience. No thematic echo or prompt-label intrusion; the conceptual cost (the shell cooling, exhaustion's limit) is legible.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV distance is stable, the perceptual signature consistent: "I wrote like a lighthouse blink, visible and inscrutable." Diction remains elevated yet coherent ("upturned hush," "bone-white edge of the shell," "tremolando"), and the lyric register is voice-motivated. Psychic distance compresses appropriately under accumulative pressure without head-hopping. No dialogue to judge. Purposeful compression and patterned repetition ("in, out, in, out") are taught and serve the closure's rhythm.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>High information density and varied rhythm support the accumulative design. However, overwriting clusters in mid-passage: "whale-slow groans," "delicate way," "exact tempo of the noon I lost," and "sated by its own echo" stack figurative language without clear payoff. A paraphrase loop appears: "I do not dare write words now; I diagram breaths" restates the prior beat's shift from pen to shell. Minor template cadence in the memory sequence ("First the kitchen…Then the classroom…Next the library…Finally the hospital") is functional but mechanical. No loops touch the closure beat, so deductions cap at −0.6 total in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis—fortune-cookie writer as conductor of memory-scored silence—is specific and non-obvious. The mirrored-horizon image and the shell-as-baton device feel fresh. Risk-taking in the lyric, associative design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The transformation of cryptic fortunes into breath-scores is earned in hindsight by the memory-mapping mechanics. Some metaphors approach ornament ("wings slice time into edible slivers") but the closure's conceptual repricing feels inevitable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character present throughout and shapes beats: maps memories, scores fortunes, invites elements. The realization that fortunes were breath instructions and the decision to "finish the first movement before exhaustion hits" alter tactics. However, no high-cost choice that forecloses a path is dramatized; the conductor observes and adjusts rather than decides under friction. Appears in closure (copying the score into fresh fortunes) but without causal transformation. Setup + development + payoff gates met; beat involvement (three: mapping, conducting, finishing) + closure linkage + modest causal pressure place mid-5s; cost connection is conceptual but not tied to a choice the character makes.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Shell used in multiple beats: held to ear for surf memory, pressed against pane to create staff, marks crescendos by fog, cools at closure. Evolving function from listening tool to conducting baton to closure marker. Specificity (nautilus spiral, bone-white edge) matters. Setup early, development (diagrams breaths, marks crescendos), payoff ("the shell cools, sated by its own echo"). Causal pressure modest (enables the score method) but closure linkage strong. Early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.5, cost connection +0.4 = ~7.0 neighborhood.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mirrored horizon appears early ("sky echoing sky until the world doubts which way is applause") and returns at closure ("the lake opens a seam like a smile no one can see"). Shapes the upturned-hush tone and the uncertainty of direction. However, it does not constrain tactics or force a decision; it functions as atmospheric motif that reweights meaning without altering options. Setup + payoff (no middle development) allow ~6.0; lyric reprise that reweights the stake adds +0.3 to +0.4. Early signal +0.5, closure linkage +0.9, lyric reprise +0.3, swappability −0.5 = mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Label introduced early ("chronologically homesick, stranded between tenses") and motivates the memory-mapping method. However, it remains largely decorative—a trait claimed rather than dramatized through constrained choice. The attempt to recover "the exact tempo of a vanished noon" is described, not shown with visible tradeoff. Setup + development (mapping memories as remedy) but payoff absent from closure beat. Early signal +0.4, one beat +0.4, ornamental use −0.7, swappability −0.5 = low-5s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dawn threads into the spire early, "takes the podium as if it were the oldest conductor," and at closure "the diner will…feel the dawn performing in their ribs." It marks the beginning of the score and the moment the orchestra's listening becomes louder than noise. Drives two beats (dawn as conductor cue, dawn as transferred performance) and shapes closure. Setup +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.4, causal pressure +0.9, specificity +0.5 = high-7s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Method signaled explicitly ("By mapping childhood memories, I coax the mute rooms of the past to hum") and executed on-page: kitchen, classroom, library, hospital each become notes. The method enables the score and appears in the closure realization ("my fortunes were…instructions for breath"). Setup early, development (four memory beats), payoff (score copied into fortunes). Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.0, causal pressure +0.8, swappability −0.4 (any memory set could serve) = mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Glass spire and frozen lake present early, supply the frost-pane staff and ice's basso echo, and the spire "flickers with approval" at closure. Setting constrains the method (frost as notation surface, panes as instrument) and the lake's seam-smile charges the ending. Setup +0.7, two beats (frost staff, ice echo) +0.9, closure linkage +1.1, causal pressure +0.7, specificity +0.6 = low-7s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Timeframe introduced in opening ("Before exhaustion hits") and returns at closure ("I finish the first movement before exhaustion hits"). However, it does not tighten tactics—no clock is tracked on the page, no decisions accelerate under time pressure. Setup + payoff without development. Early signal +0.4, closure linkage +0.8, no beat involvement 0, no causal pressure 0, late reprise without mid-scene tracking −0.7 = mid-4s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Motivation stated early ("To become the conductor of unheard symphonies") and dramatized through the mapping, inviting, and scoring beats. The realization that "the orchestra I invented is only listening" shows friction between the want (to command) and the cost (to yield to listening). Development across multiple beats and present in closure realization. Setup +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +0.9, friction with cost +0.5, some exposition −0.4 = mid-to-high 6s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Tone—upturned hush—is coherent and sustained: "my little room is a throat within the tower, speaking in an upturned hush that even the ice respects," returns as "I lower my voice until it meets the upturned hush," and charges the closure ("read the hush inside"). Modulates under accumulative pressure (wind plucks, ice groans, horizon brightens) without breaking. Setup early, development (lowering voice to meet hush), payoff (hush inside the fortune). Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.3, coherence under turns +0.8, specificity +0.5 = mid-7s.</comment>
