<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is concrete and specific—"I had failed to seal a breach, and the village eastward learned how fragile thresholds could be"—with embodied grief driving the return. Internal conflict surfaces in the contradiction between swearing never to lift the flute again and ultimately using it to weave the seam. The final choice to "gentle the phrase to follow" rather than force it is earned through prior causality and shows a hierarchy of values with visible cost: humility replaces pride. Minor weaknesses: Lane's presence is felt more through assertion ("friends of Lane, or so the part of me that hoped insisted") than dramatized texture, and some reflective passages lean toward summary rather than lived contradiction in the moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with visible cost: the protagonist weaves the seam clean through patient technique and leaves driftwood markers as both penance and guidance, foreclosing the path of shortcuts with felt humility. The Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early (canyon hush, threading seams, weaving metaphors) and holds through the final tightening when the market "breathed" and the seam "knit clean." One meaningful deepening occurs when the flute's note reveals the failure site and the protagonist shifts from forcing to gentling the tempo. The Orientation Test is waived: who (driven relic keeper), where (Thunder-echo range), and when (after the guardianship) anchor by the opening lines. Deduction: the breach mechanics and the "worlds wove like strands" remain somewhat abstract; the middle passage where the protagonist steps "where the air cooled in a straight, unnatural line" could benefit from sharper spatial stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The Thunder-echo range supplies concrete sensory texture—"canyon hush pressed like velvet," "chalky dirt," "air cooled in a straight, unnatural line"—and the environment constrains tactics: driftwood markers guide because "its grain later told which winds had lied." The flute warming "as if remembering fingers that were not mine" charges the closure image. Spatial choreography stays coherent across the ridgeline descent and gully approach. Deduction: the "vacant market" and "colored awnings" read slightly generic; more sensory specificity or a single odd detail (a broken stall, a particular color pattern) would sharpen the stakes of loss and make the place irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—mending the breach without repeating the pride-driven shortcuts—signals early and tightens when the flute's first note "found the seam, the place I had failed, and it would not let me pretend ignorance." The protagonist's agency drives escalation: stopping the hurried tempo, arranging driftwood to guide the weave, and "gentling the phrase to follow" rather than forcing it. The cost is legible: "I had taken shortcuts, trusting the flute to mend what I tore, and the markets paid in emptiness." One micro-turn (the note ghosting back) deepens pressure without requiring multiple reversals. Deduction: the "answer came slowly, woven of miscounts and pride" verges on summary; dramatizing one specific miscount in flashback or present perception would make the lesson more visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—humility and listening as antidotes to pride-driven shortcuts—emerges from concrete events: the protagonist's hurried weaving caused the breach, and the closure repays it with patient tempo and "enough humility to hear their warnings." The final image (the seam knitting clean, driftwood lane left for travelers, ravens carrying apology) reweights the opening loss without stating a moral. The flute as threshold, reeds remembering the river, and driftwood grain telling which winds lied form a coherent pattern that charges the ending. No thematic echo or moralizing mars the final paragraph. Minor note: "Weaving between worlds had seemed a craft, not a gamble" edges toward explicit articulation but stays rooted in the protagonist's retrospective stance and serves the turn.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: "the silence comes down like a house, swift and entire," "threads need lanes as much as feet." Diction remains within the protagonist's register—technical craft terms (shuttle, seam, tempo) blended with lyric compression. The prose modulates with pressure: terse notes during the weaving, longer reflective clauses when mapping failure. Deduction: some lines approach elevated diction without full voice-motivation—"Avalanchingly quiet but gathering with every patient measure" reads slightly imposed rather than emerging from the protagonist's idiom under stress. Filter verbs ("I could hear," "I saw") appear but don't stack densely enough to penalize. No head-hopping; no dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high: most sentences advance both atmosphere and choice. "The flute was our shuttle, bright and sly, a way to thread seams without tearing either side" compresses backstory into present stakes. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and recharge motifs effectively. Deductions: paraphrase loop between "I had failed to seal a breach" and "the breach had opened beyond a gully" restates without added pressure (−0.2). "Avalanchingly quiet" appears twice without functional shift, reading as decorative recurrence rather than evolving meaning (−0.3). "The answer came slowly, woven of miscounts and pride, a ledger of timings I had hurried past" uses elevated register ("ledger of timings") that drifts slightly from the established voice (−0.2). Template cadence in sequential "I [verb]" openings across the middle third is mild but present (−0.3). Total artifact debt −1.0; no closure-beat contamination. Propulsion remains strong.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise—mending a dimensional breach through musical weaving after a pride-driven failure—offers a specific synthesis of craft metaphor and magical threshold. The protagonist's shift from forcing to gentling the tempo, and the use of driftwood markers in both physical and liminal spaces, feels non-obvious and earned. Emotional specificity (grief for Lane, humility replacing pride) avoids generic templates. Deduction: the "worlds wove like strands" and "vacant market" imagery leans on familiar portal-fantasy tropes without fully transforming them through visceral sensory detail or an unexpected social consequence. The ravens as Lane's friends and messengers trend toward symbolic convenience rather than bold risk. Still, the closure's synthesis—patient weaving, driftwood lanes, apology carried across—reads as a fresh inflection on failure-and-repair arcs.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The driven relic keeper's choices create all key turns: returning to the breach site, uncasing the flute despite the vow, stopping the first note when it ghosts back, shifting to patient tempo, and arranging driftwood markers in the market. Each decision narrows options or alters tactics under pressure, and the closure (seam knit clean, driftwood lane left) traces directly to the protagonist's final agency. Early signal (first paragraph), beat involvement (at least four distinct moments), causal pressure, closure linkage, and visible cost all present. The character is indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The gilded reed flute appears in at least four beats: uncasing it with groaning bark, the first note threading the canyon and ghosting back, the second note stepping toward the seam, and the third note guiding the final weave. Its properties—reeds remembering the river, threading seams without tearing—shape the protagonist's tactics and constrain the weaving method. The flute's warming "as if remembering fingers that were not mine" charges the closure image. Early signal, multiple beat involvement, causal pressure, closure linkage, specificity, and cost connection all satisfied. Minor friction: the flute's exact mechanics (why gilding matters, how tempo affects seam tension) remain slightly abstract, preventing full 8.5+ irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Weaving between worlds shapes stakes (the breach that cost the village), tactics (threading the seam without tearing, adjusting tempo to let threads rest), and the closure action (the market breathing, the seam knitting clean). The concept is present in setup (first paragraph mentions guardianship and thresholds), development (walking the seam, the flute curving toward the gully, stepping where air cooled), and payoff (the final weave). It generates causal pressure: the protagonist's prior shortcuts caused the breach, and the resolution requires patient weaving. Cost is visible: the village lost, Lane died, and humility replaces pride. The concept is essential but not wholly irreplaceable—another metaphor for dimensional repair could substitute with moderate edits.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Avalanchingly quiet" appears twice: once describing the range's storms that "leave stones Avalanchingly quiet for years" and again in the market where the crowd murmur returns "avalanchingly quiet but gathering with every patient measure." The trait frames the protagonist's return and modulates the closure tone, but it does not constrain an on-page action with visible cost—it remains atmospheric rather than tactical. Setup and payoff gates met, but no middle development that alters a choice. Lyric reprise reweights the dominant stake (the market's return) but the effect is sonic-thematic rather than causal. Late first appearance (second paragraph for the range, final third for the market) and ornamental use limit the score.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Uncasing the flute is the inciting action that commits the protagonist to confronting the breach: "I uncase the gilded reed flute I had sworn never to lift again, its case groaning like dry bark." The act appears in setup (paragraph ~10–12% mark), drives the middle beats (playing the first note, the second, the third), and shapes the closure (the seam knit clean through the flute's patient weaving). Without uncasing the flute, the breach remains unmended and the story loses its central pressure. Early signal, beat involvement, causal pressure, closure linkage, and cost (breaking the vow, confronting failure) all present. Minor friction: the uncasing itself is a single sentence; the choice to play the notes carries more weight than the physical uncasing, so the action is slightly less irreplaceable than the flute itself.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Arranging driftwood as directional markers appears in three beats: setting markers along the talus (early-middle), arranging them on the market tiles ("Arranging driftwood as directional markers within the vanished market felt absurd, but threads need lanes as much as feet"), and the closure ("I left the driftwood lane for travelers who might return"). The method shapes tactics: driftwood "kept shape where cairns toppled" and its grain "told which winds had lied," and the protagonist uses it to guide the weave in the liminal market. Early signal, beat involvement, causal pressure, and closure linkage present. Cost: the method is humble and patient, replacing the protagonist's prior shortcuts. Friction: the mechanics (how driftwood guides the flute's weaving) remain slightly abstract, and the method could be replaced with another marker system (cairns with added weight, carved symbols) without full structural collapse.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Thunder-echo range supplies concrete constraints: the canyon hush that "pressed like velvet," the gully "where thunder echoes turned corners and bumped your ribs," the chalky dirt, the air cooling "in a straight, unnatural line" at the seam. The environment shapes the protagonist's route (following the ridgeline, placing the last marker) and the flute's sound (the note curving toward the gully). The setting is present in setup, development (guiding the descent and approach), and payoff (the market within the range's liminal boundary). Causal pressure and closure linkage present. Friction: the setting provides atmosphere and navigation but does not impose a hard constraint that alters a key choice—the protagonist could reach the breach through a different terrain feature with moderate edits. Specificity (Thunder-echo, chalky dirt, talus) elevates but does not reach full irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"After the guardianship" anchors the protagonist's state (stripped of rank, driven by failure) and motivates the return. The timeframe is present in setup (first paragraph), frames the middle reflection (Lane's death, the breach), and subtly charges the closure (the protagonist's penance and new profession). It does not impose a live ticking clock or narrow a decision window—the protagonist works at the pace the weaving requires—but it establishes the before/after logic that makes the closure legible as earned change. Setup and payoff gates met; middle development is thematic rather than tactical. Cost is retrospective (the village lost, Lane died) rather than a present constraint that alters a move. Lyric resonance (past failure → present humility) reaches mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"To harvest insights from failure" is stated early ("I came back to harvest insights from failure, not forgiveness, and to study what slipped through") and dramatized through the protagonist's actions: mapping the breach, uncasing the flute despite the vow, letting the note reveal the seam, and adjusting tempo when "the answer came slowly, woven of miscounts and pride." The motivation generates friction (the desire to understand conflicts with the impulse to avoid the flute and Lane's memory) and drives the closure choice (patient weaving, leaving markers as apology). Setup, development, and payoff gates met. Causal pressure, closure linkage, and cost (confronting failure, humility) present. Minor friction: the motivation is told explicitly in the opening rather than inferred entirely from action, and "harvest insights" reads slightly abstract compared to the visceral weaving.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Canyon hush is established early ("canyon hush pressed like velvet against my ears") and modulates through the story: "Avalanchingly quiet" after storms, the silence that "comes down like a house," the market's "kind of silence that bruises," and the final "avalanchingly quiet but gathering with every patient measure." Tone is coherent, purposeful, and charges the final image (the seam knitting clean in patient quiet, the apology carried across). The tone reflects the protagonist's grief and shapes the reader's experience of the weaving as meditative rather than explosive. Setup, development, and payoff gates met. The tone is indispensable to the story's emotional register and thematic resonance.</comment>
