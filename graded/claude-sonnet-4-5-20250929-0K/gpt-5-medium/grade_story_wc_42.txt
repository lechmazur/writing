<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The sage repairer shows competence balanced with genuine problem-solving struggle; the move from diagnosis through micro-adjustments to final insight feels earned. Interior texture is character-specific ("I promised nothing, only that I would restructure") and embodied through tool-handling. The climactic realization about the chronometer burr lands with visible cost—the night's labor—but the protagonist's emotional arc remains somewhat static, with the final memory turn arriving more as lyric meditation than transformation under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens: the story builds through patterned repair beats (cameras, guiding motors, imager, chronometer) toward a closure image where the Moon "spoke" and the narrator "would answer." The quake serves as inciting pressure; each repair compounds understanding until the final tea scene crystallizes stance with felt cost (exhaustion, hope against habit). Orientation anchors cleanly by line 3. The closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the team dares to hope and commits to "restructure more than instruments"—with visible cost in the night's labor and shift from certainty to listening.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The observatory setting constrains every choice: cracks from the landslide, the misaligned pier, cooling lines, mounting collars. Tools (diaphragms, capacitors, arbor) are handled across multiple beats and the misalignment directly alters tactics ("I loosened the mounting collar, a quarter turn"). The recurring leaf-sound anchors the POV's perceptual filter and charges the final memory callback. Micro-setting (sensor housings, monitor, cloud sea below) saturates the action without postcard drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capture the Moon's faint thermal tremor—is signaled early and tightens through the misalignment discovery, which narrows options and raises cost (precision tuning under deadline). The chronometer subplot braids neatly: what others fear as failure becomes a message requiring "stubborn ears," then a burr solved on-page. Agency is consistent: the protagonist diagnoses, adjusts, interprets, with each move altering tactics. One meaningful deepening (the belief shift from "certainty is a luxury" to answering the Moon's speech) with visible cost (the exhausted vigil, the gamble on hope).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—listening to what instruments confess, trusting ephemeral signals over rigid certainty—emerges through concrete repair work and the Moon's shy thermal breath rather than statement. The leaf-sound motif recurs with reweighted meaning: first metaphor for delicate signal detection, finally the memory anchoring why the narrator persists. The ending resists tidy closure ("dared ourselves to hope") and offers a resonant answer to the central question (unlearn silence, answer in kind) without moralizing. The final line's recognition that memory is "as fleeting as any photon" reprices constancy and justifies continued labor.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistent: lyric-technical diction ("small cities," "braided shadows," "ribs thrum"), with elevated register fitting the sage's contemplative stance. POV distance is stable; perceptual filter prioritizes sound and tactile cues ("I felt its ribs thrum," "sanded it with breath"). No head-hopping. The prose compresses time cleanly ("until dawn stroked the clouds") without losing present anchor. Minor strain in a few lines ("a gray coin refusing to spend itself") where metaphor vehicle feels decorative rather than voice-essential, but control under pressure holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most sentences layer action, setting, and interiority. Rhythm varies purposefully, slowing for tuning beats, quickening at the image-click moment. A few near-loops touch Q7 limits: "changelessly constant" echoed twice within three paragraphs, and the leaf-falling motif restated four times without always adding new pressure. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "burn scar" Moon, "trapped mayfly" hand, "flake of doubt" burr work well. One mixed vehicle: "pale claws" for tides then "shy shadows" for ridges feels register-inconsistent. No template cadence or filter stacks. Closure beat is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The sage-repairer frame and observatory quake premise are not novel, but the leaf-sound method and the chronometer-as-plea turn offer fresh inflection. Emotional specificity (the ache of touching sharpness, daring hope over tea) avoids template. The synthesis—repair as listening, instruments as colleagues—feels coherent and specific to this voice. Structural risk is modest: accumulative design with lyric compression fits but doesn't surprise. The leaf callback and Moon-speaking closure are earned in hindsight without radical originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setup: present from line 1. Development: diagnoses misalignment, tunes motors, adjusts imager collar (three distinct beats with on-page decisions). Closure: reassembles chronometer, chooses to "restructure more than instruments," final memory anchors persistence motive. Choices narrow options (quarter-turn adjustment) and reweight meaning (unlearn silence). Irreplaceable: the "sage" patience and listening skill drive every turn. Visible cost: exhausted vigil, gamble on hope.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setup: introduced paragraph 4 as "ridiculous whirl." Development: narrator reinterprets it as "plea, not tantrum" (reweighted meaning), then disassembles and finds the burr (causal action). Closure: reassembled hand "paused between beats as if listening with me"—the object's final state mirrors protagonist stance and charges the ending image. Three beats, cost tied to night's labor. Swappable test: any other instrument would weaken the listening/plea metaphor.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Setup: "escape velocity" appears paragraph 12 as metaphor for lost photons. Development: no middle action constrained by this concept. Closure: absent from final image. The phrase colors tone but does not shape tactics or redefine options. Functional but ornamental; could be replaced with "irretrievable" without structural loss. Present in theme layer (ephemeral signals) but not dramatized with cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Setup: "changelessly constant" appears twice in paragraphs 8–9, describing the Moon's pretense and the narrator's memory. Development: the Moon's false constancy is contradicted by tidal pulls and faint tremor (one beat). Closure: final line reprices memory as "fleeting," inverting the attribute with felt cost. Lyric reprise reweights the stake. Swappable with "unchanging" but the closure turn earns mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Setup: announced paragraph 11 as protagonist's promise. Development: restructures instrument stack (ground loops, mirror balance, imager mounting—three beats), each alteration narrows options and raises precision. Closure: paragraphs 37–38 extend restructuring to conceptual stance ("unlearn the idea that the Moon owed us silence"), decisive shift with visible cost (abandoning certainty). Irreplaceable: "repair" or "recalibrate" would lose the conceptual pivot. Cost legible on page.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setup: leaf-sound introduced paragraph 13 as translation metaphor. Development: paragraph 24 uses it to tune guiding motors ("always the leaf, brushing the floorboards"), altering on-page action. Closure: final two paragraphs recall the leaf as origin memory anchoring why narrator persists. Three touches across first/middle/end; method shapes one tactical choice and charges final image. Specific mechanics (listening for micro-sound) constrain the repair approach.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setup: "lunar observatory above the clouds" in opening line. Development: landslide cracks constrain work (paragraph 7), pier misalignment causes smear (paragraph 15), mounting collar adjustment solves it (paragraph 26)—three causal beats. Closure: cloud sea and dawn anchor the vigil's end, tea scene. The setting supplies the problem (quake damage), tools (imager, chronometer), and atmospheric pressure (thin air, isolation). Irreplaceable: any other observatory would lose the landslide stakes and altitude constraints.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setup: "first night since the landslide when foundations shake" signals the inciting event (paragraph 7). Development: quake aftermath (cracks, misalignment) drives middle repair urgency. Closure: "until dawn" marks the vigil's cost and resolution timeframe. The temporal frame tightens decisions (one-night window to prove instruments work) and the ending tea scene pays off elapsed time with exhaustion. Cost legible: stamina spent, hope gambled on one session.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setup: "to harness the ephemeral before it dispersed" stated paragraph 11. Development: each repair beat (capturing photons across pixels, modeling faint heat exhale) dramatizes this desire under friction (instruments confess in dialects, precision eludes). Closure: final realization that memory is "as fleeting as any photon, and that was why I stayed" reprices the motive with conceptual cost (constancy itself is illusion). Want versus obstacle runs through three beats; the ending reweights rather than satisfies.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Setup: "luminous ache" in paragraph 2 establishes tone. Development: tone modulates from diagnostic calm ("I promised nothing") to tactile intimacy ("hurt" sharpness, "shy shadows") to fragile hope ("dared ourselves"). Closure: final image layers ache (memory as fleeting) with luminous persistence (why I stayed). Coherent tonal spine with purposeful shifts under pressure. The ache charges the ending without static repetition, balancing melancholy and resolve.</comment>
