<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The lantern maker's goal (retrieve his shadow through origami cranes) is signaled early and drives action, but his interior life remains abstract—grief is labeled "luminous torment" and "ache" without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The shadow's detachment night is told rather than dramatized, weakening the felt cost of his journey. At closure, the shadow "loosens" rather than returns, a renunciation with some cost, but the protagonist's internal contradiction (clinging vs. releasing) never surfaces in a pivotal beat. Embodied emotion appears sporadically (the hoarse laugh), but much interiority relies on metaphor rather than specific perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure accrues through ritual repetition (polishing, steeping cranes, releasing lanterns) and deepens via the final shadow touch. Orientation anchors arrive late: who/where/when coalesce only after the basilica introduction (~15% in), causing brief disorientation but no permanent harm; waive the Orientation Test penalty because the pattern pays off at closure. Closure form is Resonant Reconfiguration (the shadow loosens rather than returns, forecloses reunion, ache "no longer drags"), and the cost is felt ("does not return to him"), satisfying the on-page requirement. One micro turn (vision ruptures, shadow walks in) and one deepening (the hand touches his chest) provide sufficient tightening under the accumulative lens. Causality within beats is sometimes elided (how do vapor cranes capture grief? how does the abbess know his need?) but the textural design tolerates motivated ellipsis.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The floating isle, basilica ribs, spiral stairs, and tea shrubs supply vivid anchors; the paradox "descends while ascending" and "air becomes…cellars" filter setting through the protagonist's dislocation. Sensory detail is selective and voice-driven (sun rings tuned by clouds, kettles hiss, rainbows seed lungs with color). Spatial choreography stays coherent across moves. The lanterns and glass workspace constrain his method (lens must drink steam, cranes need vapor not paper), meeting the 9+ gate test: environment shapes the final choice and charges the closure image. Minor weakness: the broader tea-garden geography remains impressionistic, but at this length micro-setting suffices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconcile with the lost shadow) is signaled early and pressure coheres under the accumulative lens. One meaningful deepening occurs when the shadow's hand touches his chest and "loosens" rather than returns, narrowing options with felt cost (he laughs, accepts the ache's release). Agency appears as patient craft (polishing, folding, releasing) and final acceptance. No reversals complicate the path; each ritual step unfolds without setback, flattening escalation. The cost is legible on the page (shadow remains apart, protagonist adjusts stance), but the lack of a middle complication or trade-off caps the band below 7.0. Under the accumulative lens one deepening suffices, yet a second pressure point would elevate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme (grief transformed through craft, acceptance over retrieval) emerges from particulars: cranes folded from steam, shadow that loosens rather than returns, the protagonist cleaning lenses and whispering ribbon names. No overt moralizing; the final image (lanterns drift, he cleans lenses, names ribbons) offers a resonant non-literal answer without stated thesis. Subtext operates in gesture (bowing without expectation, the faint hand that does not return). The closing beat reweights prior material (ache no longer drags) with quiet complexity. Cranes and lanterns recur purposefully, constraining method and charging closure, avoiding token motif checklist.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, image-dense, and sustained ("sky like a spoon catches sugar," "thin as a thread of smoke"), but perceptual signature stays generic across beats—no character-specific bias in what the lantern maker notices. POV is stable third-limited with no head-hopping. Figurative language is frequent and occasionally strained ("vision ruptures," "steam into sharp beaks") yet remains legible. Diction is elevated and consistent, fitting the fabulist register. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance is controlled. The prose modulates with pressure (short bursts at closure), but lacks the irreplaceable perceptual texture that would lift it above 7.0. Free indirect style is clean when used.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Density is high and most lines advance atmosphere or ritual, but several figurative constructions muddle clarity: "seeding his lungs with color," "vapor and glass…brew the cranes," "messages transform from tight creases into air, and then into change" (three-step abstraction). Template cadence appears in mid-section ("He polishes because…"; "He selects…fits…drinks"; "He tells…She instructs…So he steeps") with repetitive "He [verb]" stems across multiple sentences, triggering −0.5 in Q7. Paraphrase loop: "luminous torment wrapped in patient hands" echoed by "to fold grief into origami cranes" without added detail (−0.2). No scaffolding or outright loops touch the closure beat, preventing deeper penalty. Rhythm varies and read-aloud ear is generally strong, but the figurative density in middle beats slows momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Premise (shadowless craftsman reconciles grief through vapor origami in floating tea garden) synthesizes familiar elements (shadow loss, ritual healing) with specific alchemy (gem polishing enables dream recording, vapor cranes hold apologies). The paradox "descends while ascending" and the closure twist (shadow loosens rather than returns) offer non-obvious angles. Execution commits fully to its lyric-fabulist logic. Transformation test: plot and arc would lose coherence with generic substitutions (origami cranes → any ritual object), indicating moderate freshness. Risk-taking in sustained metaphor and spatial inversion elevates without obscuring clarity, warranting within-band bonus (+0.3). No derivative template detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setup: introduced paragraph one. Development: polishes stones (beat 2), selects lens (beat 3), steeps cranes (beat 4), releases lanterns (beat 5). Closure: carries warmed lanterns to altar, bows to shadow, accepts loosening, cleans lenses. Causal pressure: his choices (gem polishing → lantern preparation → crane creation → release) drive all major beats and shape the ending. Cost: visible (shadow does not return, he adjusts stance). Irreplaceability: his craft (polishing, vapor folding) is specific and non-generic. Early signal +0.6, four beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.4, specificity +0.6, cost +0.5 = ~6.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Setup: introduced paragraph three. Development: abbess meets him at threshold (beat 1), he climbs spiral (beat 2), works beneath canopy (beat 3), releases lanterns in nave (beat 5). Closure: altar of sky is named, lanterns set in triangle. Two-gate participation (setup, closure mention) but middle beats describe rather than use the basilica to constrain choice. It provides setting pressure (ribs scatter rainbows, hum like hive) but remains largely postcard. Lyric reprise (cathedral catches sky → altar of sky) reweights slightly. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure mention +0.4 (weak linkage), specificity +0.4, ornamental friction −0.6 = ~5.9.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Setup: "dream recording" named paragraph three. Development: attendants whisper into lanterns, practicing (beat 3); lens drinks steam and vision condenses (beat 4); cranes captured "by dream recording the way a needle holds thread" (beat 6). Closure: no direct mention, but the released cranes (products of recording) deliver messages. Causal role: the concept licenses the vapor-crane mechanism and enables the closure. Specificity: unique property (recording requires vapor not paper) matters. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal enable +0.8, specificity +0.5, closure indirect +0.3, swappability friction −0.4 (could substitute "memory capture") = ~5.4.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Setup: "descends while ascending" introduced paragraph two and enacted in stair climb. Development: the paradox is described ("higher he climbs, the deeper the air") and later he "descends while ascending to the nave" (beat 5). Closure: no direct mention or constraint. The trait provides atmospheric texture and signals the tea garden's inversion logic but does not constrain an on-page choice or tradeoff. Two mentions in middle beats but no visible cost. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, ornamental friction −0.8, swappability friction −0.5 (any spatial paradox could serve), no closure linkage −0.7 = ~4.8. Cap at 4.6 (missing closure participation); final 4.8 reflects strong setup offset by no payoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setup: "transform" appears in title/concept; first dramatized beat two ("begins to transform them"). Development: polishing transforms stones into facets (beat 2), lens transformation (beat 4), cranes transformed from steam (beat 6), messages transform "from tight creases into air, and then into change" (beat 7). Closure: transformation completes (ache transforms, shadow loosens). Causal pressure: each transformation step narrows method and drives the next beat. Cost: visible (shadow does not return, protagonist adjusts). Irreplaceability: the action's specificity (gem→lens→crane→message→change) is integral. Early signal +0.7, four beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.6, specificity +0.7, cost +0.5 = ~7.6.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setup: introduced paragraph two ("craft begins with gem polishing") and paragraph four ("first with powder, then with felt, then with spit and sleeve"). Development: polishing is the first step that enables lens creation (beat 2), and its mechanics (facets coaxed like confession, roughness scratches dreams) shape the lantern-making sequence. Closure: he "cleans his lenses with careful gem polishing" (final line), reprising the method. Causal role: polishing enables the lens, which enables dream recording. Specificity: the method's texture (powder/felt/spit) is detailed. Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, causal enable +1.0, closure reprise +1.2, specificity +0.6 = ~6.1.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setup: title and paragraph one ("floating island tea garden"). Development: tea garden provides the basilica (beat 1), spiral path (beat 2), workspace with prisms (beat 3), jasmine pour triggers vision (beat 4), tea shrubs move like lungs (beat 7), guests lift cups (beat 8). Closure: "In the tea garden, guests lift cups…lanterns drift overhead." The setting supplies ritual resources (jasmine steam, canopy, altar) that enable his method. Micro-setting (workspace, kettles, shrubs) constrains tactics. Early signal +0.8, four beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.5, postcard friction −0.3 = ~6.4.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Setup: title and paragraph one ("after the shadow detaches"). Development: the timeframe is referenced in flashback (beat 5: "the night of detachment") and sets the initial condition (shadowless state drives motive). Closure: no temporal constraint or mention. The timeframe establishes backstory but does not tighten present decisions or alter tactics on the page. One beat (flashback), no closure linkage, no live clock. Early signal +0.6, one beat +0.4, backstory friction −0.5, no closure linkage −0.7, no time pressure −0.8, cap at 4.6 (missing closure) = ~4.2.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph one ("one motive…to fold grief into origami cranes"). Development: motive drives every beat: he requests table (beat 3), transforms stones for lanterns (beat 4), tells abbess his motive plainly (beat 5), brews cranes (beat 6), releases them (beat 7). Closure: cranes deliver folded apologies, shadow loosens, protagonist cleans lenses whispering ribbon names—grief transformed into ritual acceptance. Friction between want (retrieve shadow) and cost (shadow does not return, only loosens) is felt. Early signal +0.8, five beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.6, cost +0.5, told-once friction −0.3 (motive stated explicitly to abbess) = ~7.1.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph one ("luminous torment wrapped in patient hands"). Development: tone sustained through lyric diction (ache, shadow faithful as thunder, hoarse laugh, tea smells of rain on hot stone), modulates with pressure (calm ritual → ruptured vision → quiet release). Closure: tone charges final image (guests' eyes soften, lanterns drift, he whispers ribbon names). Coherence across turns is strong; the oxymoron "luminous torment" frames the piece's mood. Early signal +0.7, coherence across beats +1.2, closure charge +1.4, modulation +0.6, specificity +0.4 = ~6.7.</comment>
