<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The gardener's motivation to "discover the shape of intentions" is told rather than dramatized through embodied contradictions. Interiority relies heavily on poetic abstraction ("velveteen gloom he cannot quite shake") instead of concrete sensory anchors that reveal character under pressure. The final choice to plant poppies and write the widow's name reads as gentle resolution but lacks visible internal cost or foreclosed alternatives. The widow exists only in backstory summary, preventing relationship pressure from testing the protagonist on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: "who" arrives by line 2, but "where" (cemetery silo interior) and "when" (nighttime post-clock-rundown) coalesce slowly across the opening third. The accumulative/textural lens holds—echoes, threads, and earth-tapping build density—but closure relies on exposition (letters reveal the widow's confession) rather than a final image that reweights prior material with cost. The cost of truth-telling (planting poppies, naming her) is asserted in the penultimate paragraph but not felt as a decision that forecloses another path. A Resonant Reconfiguration is present but muted by summary.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The cobalt silo, tapestry, and asters anchor the scene with tactile specificity. The needle "fed under the ground like a fishing line" and the burlap sack discovery use setting elements to constrain action. The final poppy-circle integrates place and closure, charging the empty patch. Spatial choreography (ladder climb, kneeling, moving to the poplar) remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—uncovering the widow's hidden truth—is signaled early and sustained. However, escalation is more accumulative than causal: the gardener moves from tapestry to earth to poplar without facing a live choice that narrows options or raises cost. The discovery of the faked burial and smuggled lover arrives through documents rather than a decision under pressure. The final act (planting poppies, writing her name) is generous but lacks a visible trade-off or felt price that alters the gardener's stance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—love's silhouette formed where duty and concealment overlap—emerges through the widow's threaded map and the gardener's respectful completion of her design. The tapestry's "grammar" and the asters' "vigil" avoid overt thesis statements. Yet the final image (poppy circle, name in loam) drifts toward symbolic convenience rather than a non-literal answer charged by prior tension. The "tenderly organized" motif recurs but does not constrain a thematic dilemma on the page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Single POV remains stable; the gardener's perceptual signature ("blithe as a breeze crossing hemlock," "listening metal") is distinctive. However, elevated diction ("monarchic sigh," "silhouette formed where deeds and love overlap") clashes with the POV of a cemetery gardener under pressure, drifting toward authorial poeticism. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance is consistent but syntactic parallelism ("he climbs," "he kneels," "he follows") flattens rhythm in the second half.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout ("velvet unwinding," "a choir that never finished learning the hymn it loves," "maze of funerary plots mapped in thread") without pattern-teaching or payoff, creating overwriting in non-peak beats. Paraphrase loops appear: "He listens, then taps… and the echoes answer" followed immediately by "He imagines the dead woman" without causal link. Template cadence runs dominate the middle third ("He climbs… He begins… He climbs down… He kneels"). Pronoun references remain clear, but information density is diluted by ornamental metaphor. These artifacts spread across the text, triggering cumulative deductions and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The widow-as-mapmaker premise offers a fresh synthesis of funerary care and encoded memory. The tapestry border as spatial cipher is specific and non-obvious. However, the gardener's unobstructed discovery—no false leads, no moral friction—follows a template solve-the-puzzle arc without transformation through cost or doubt. The ending's "tenderly organized" echo and poppy planting feel predetermined rather than earned by a risky choice.</comment>
