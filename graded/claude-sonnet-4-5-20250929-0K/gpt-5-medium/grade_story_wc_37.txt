<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The scattered memory keeper's interior voice is distinct and purposefully fragmented ("my pieces refuse any other"), with embodied choices in gathering lullabies, threading voices, and opening the loom to communities. The swaddling of grafts and the decision to weave dawn across both mirror-sides show agency under pressure. However, the protagonist's emotional arc lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene; moments like "my courage fluttered like burlap" label state rather than dramatize competing fears and desires colliding in real time, and the final gathering of "scattered selves" arrives as declaration rather than earned through a visible trade-off that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors who (memory keeper), where (greenhouse), and the mirror-world frame early. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the woven dawn negotiates new boundaries between light and dark, communities bring spoiled names to the loom, and the protagonist's selves nest in the rafters—options are crystallized and reweighted with felt cost (shared scars, bound release). One meaningful deepening occurs when the protagonist realizes the ledger omitted weaving across both mirror sides, tightening tactics. Cost is legible in "we, bound to the work, release our grip just enough for others to hold." The lens holds through closure without contradiction, though the middle's accumulation of lullabies, sighs, and chants could signal one causal tightening more sharply to push higher.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The mica window functions as micro-setting and loom, constraining the weaving process ("each flaw a hook, each stripe of mica a shuttle") and charging the final image when it "becomes a covenant, framing us all." The greenhouse's roots, trunks, pollen, and the pomegranate trees' hoarded lullabies ground choices in tactile detail. Sensory selection is purposeful: "taste of iron on memory," "wet with patient stars," "warm tea" light spilling. The mirror world's thinning light and the realm's embarrassment at its own dimming are filtered through the protagonist's perceptual bias. Spatial choreography is coherent across the orchard, nursery, and window-loom without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—rekindling a dying realm—is signaled early and tightens when mornings stop arriving and the protagonist must weave a dawn from community voices instead of intact mornings. The realization that the dawn must be woven across both mirror sides is a meaningful escalation that narrows tactics and forces a collaborative choice. The cost is felt: communities lay down names "stubborn, sharp with resentment," the protagonist shares scars with the twin, and the bound release requires relinquishing sole grip. Agency is clear in the swaddling, threading, and loom-opening decisions. However, no live option is explicitly foreclosed on the page—the communities drift to the greenhouse willingly, and the dawn's arrival does not visibly require sacrificing an alternative path, keeping the band below 7.5.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the woven-dawn premise: light and dark negotiate coexistence rather than one consuming the other, and communities are knit by exchanging debts for harmonies. The bound release motif recurs with escalating meaning—wrap holds/sap frees, light tied to dark—without overt statement. The mica window and swaddled grafts accumulate pressure and charge the ending when "the orchard drinks, the dawn drinks, and we drink, and the mirror answers." The final image of sharing scars and releasing grip offers a resonant answer to the question of how to rekindle a realm: let it "swaddle itself in what it feared to lose." However, the line "This is our bound release again" edges toward thematic echo, and "we rekindle a dying realm by letting it swaddle itself" nearly articulates the thesis rather than letting the image stand alone, preventing entry to the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinctive: "my courage fluttered like burlap," "a compromise I had learned to respect," "the realm shivered faintly, as if embarrassed," all filtered through the memory keeper's particular perceptual signature. POV distance is stable, with no head-hopping; the mirror twin is observed externally. Diction remains purposefully poetic and compressed ("seeds winked approval," "sticky waxy laughter"), consistent with the lyric mode. However, certain figurative constructions—"trees distilled regrets into fruit, and shadows braided their sap"—approach overwriting in the opening without clear pattern-teaching, and the rhythm occasionally plateaus into syntactic uniformity (multiple "I [verb]" stems in the middle third). Free indirect style is clean, and the psychic distance modulates appropriately with pressure, but the density of metaphor in non-peak beats nudges the score below 7.5.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high in many beats: "the window becomes a loom when coaxed, each flaw a hook, each stripe of mica a shuttle" does multiple jobs. Clarity is generally strong, with logical action order and no major pronoun tangles. However, paraphrase loops appear: "I gather what is dropped, lost, or sung under breath, and coax it into usefulness" is restated conceptually in "We would weave a dawn from their lives, not from clocks"; "bound release" is glossed three times with slight variation. Template cadence runs occur in the middle third: "I thread in… I splice… I stitch…" across adjacent lines. Figurative density is high without clear escalation: "patient stars," "skirts," "winked approval," "sticky laughter" cluster in non-peak beats, approaching overwriting (−0.4). These artifacts (paraphrase −0.2, template −0.5, density −0.4) accumulate to −1.1, capping this category below 7.5 and disallowing 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of alchemy, mirror-world duality, and community-weaving offers a fresh angle on realm-restoration tropes, and the specific detail of "woven dawns require threads from seventy-seven intact mornings" avoids generic fantasy. The choice to weave dawn from voices rather than clocks, and to braid it across both mirror sides, feels earned in hindsight. The bound-release motif transforms familiar light/dark dichotomies by insisting both breathe without consuming. However, the orchard-as-emotional-repository and the scattered-memory-keeper premise echo widely used templates (fragmented protagonist reintegrates through collaborative magic), and while the mirror twin and mica-loom mechanics add specificity, the emotional arc—gathering selves, community reconciliation—does not fully escape the median safety middle. The risk-taking in voice and structure elevates within band (+0.3), but derivative premise debt (−0.6) and the lack of a non-obvious moral calculus keep the score mid-7s.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The scattered memory keeper makes multiple on-page decisions: gathering lullabies from trees, swaddling grafts, threading voices into the loom, realizing the dawn must cross both mirror sides, and opening the loom to communities. These choices drive at least two beats (middle weaving and final community integration) and enable the closure when selves "gather like swallows, then nest along the new rafters." The trait "scattered" constrains the protagonist's confidence ("my courage fluttered") and the seams that "never fully held" pay off when pieces "no longer flee" at the end. Setup is clear by the first paragraph; development occurs throughout the weaving sequence; closure participation is explicit. However, the character's agency in the final third shifts toward facilitation rather than decisive personal choice, and the selves' gathering is asserted more than causally demonstrated through a specific forfeiture, keeping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The mica window appears in the first third ("Above the trellis hung a mica window"), functions as a boundary-keeper ("kept the dark out and the night in"), hums along with songs to turn vowels into threads, transforms into a loom ("each flaw a hook, each stripe of mica a shuttle"), and at closure "becomes a covenant, framing us all, reflecting us as we wish to be." It is handled across at least three beats (observation, loom transformation, covenant framing) and its evolving function—from passive barrier to active weaving tool to communal covenant—charges the final image. The unique property (mica = not quite glass, not quite stone) matters causally: the flaws and stripes enable the shuttling. Removing it would break the weaving mechanics and the mirror-world linkage, pushing it into the 7+ band. However, the window does not impose a visible cost tied specifically to its material nature (e.g., brittleness, opacity trade-off), capping it below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Woven dawns shape the dominant stake from the ledger entry ("threads from seventy-seven intact mornings"), force the tactical pivot when mornings stop arriving ("We would weave a dawn from their lives, not from clocks"), and define the central action: threading lullabies, sighs, chants, and grievances into the loom. The concept constrains choices—no intact mornings means no traditional solution—and the final image of woven dawns that "do not burn away night; they invite it to learn another posture" delivers the closure's conceptual repricing. The woven fabric spills as light, sinks to roots, rises through trunks, and reconfigures the realm's relationship to dawn. Setup is early, development drives the middle weaving sequence, and payoff is undeniable. The cost is felt (communities' spoiled names, shared scars, releasing grip) and tied directly to the weaving process. The concept is indispensable; swapping it for "rekindled flame" or "restored sun" would dismantle the story's logic and thematic coherence.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Knits communities together" is signaled early ("They called me one who knits communities together, though my own seams never fully held") and constrains the protagonist's approach: weaving dawn from community voices rather than solitary magic. The trait enables multiple on-page actions—gathering pomegranate lullabies, harvesting beekeepers' sighs, splicing boatwrights' chants, mending quarrels between fisherfolk and gardeners—and pays off when "each community leans in, knotted by need, and I feel myself finally tightening, fewer pieces falling." The cost is visible: the protagonist's seams tighten through the act of holding others, and the ending requires relinquishing sole control ("release our grip just enough for others to hold"). Setup, development across the weaving beats, and closure participation are present. However, the trait operates more as repeated method than as a single high-stakes choice with irreversible consequence, keeping it mid-6s rather than 7+.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Swaddling appears early ("I swaddle tender grafts with spider-silk and ash, keeping their trembling roots from remembering frost") and defines the story's method: protective binding that enables growth ("the wrap holds, the sap frees, and both are needed"). The action recurs conceptually when communities "swaddle" the realm in what it feared to lose at closure. The bound-release motif traces directly to swaddling, and the final image—"we, bound to the work, release our grip"—depends on this logic. Removing swaddling would break the thematic coherence and the tactical framework (why spider-silk and ash? why wrap at all?). However, swaddling as a physical action is concentrated in one early beat; later appearances are metaphorical extensions rather than distinct dramatized instances, and the cost tied specifically to the wrapping (e.g., grafts constrained, sap delayed) is implied rather than tested on the page, capping the score below 7.5.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Through forgotten songs" is signaled early ("I sing to the grafts through forgotten songs, not mine, but carried by the walls") and shapes the weaving method: the mica window catches vowels and turns them into threads, and the protagonist threads in lullabies, sighs, chants, and warnings. The method's mechanics matter—songs must be forgotten (communal, not owned) and voiced aloud to generate threads—and the middle sequence depends on gathering these sonic materials. The method participates in closure when "names… soften their syllables to thread" through the dawn's warmth. Setup is clear, development is sustained across the weaving beats, and closure linkage is present. However, "forgotten" as a qualifier does not impose a specific cost or constraint that alters a choice on the page (e.g., songs must be re-learned, memories risked, voices lost), and swapping "forgotten songs" for "lost melodies" or "unspoken words" would require only minor edits, keeping the score mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The alchemical orchard greenhouse shrouded in endless night frames the entire narrative, supplies the pomegranate trees' hoarded lullabies, houses the nursery where grafts are swaddled, and provides the mica window-loom. The setting constrains choices: night has stopped producing mornings, forcing the weaving solution; the greenhouse's roots, trunks, and pollen channels the woven dawn's effects. The spatial layout (orchard, trellis, nursery, window) guides action coherently. The setting charges the final image when "the greenhouse creaks, stretches, and the night thins without fleeing, as if negotiating new boundaries." Setup is immediate, development integrates the setting's resources (trees, grafts, window), and closure participation is explicit. The unique properties—alchemical processes, endless night, mirror-world framing—are indispensable; a generic fantasy forest would not support the alchemy or mirror-logic. However, the setting's pressure is environmental rather than directly forcing a high-stakes choice with personal cost (e.g., greenhouse collapse imminent, night consuming the protagonist), keeping it mid-7s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"In the mirror world" is established early (second paragraph) and frames the entire narrative: trees distill regrets, shadows braid sap, the protagonist's reflection carries different scars and swaddles grafts in parallel. The mirror structure enables the crucial realization—"we must weave the dawn across both sides"—and the twin's participation at closure ("my scarred twin does the same, her mouth shaping my mother's hush"). The timeframe does not function as a clock but as a spatial/conceptual duality that shapes the solution. Setup is clear, development occurs when the protagonist threads and the twin mirrors, and closure is collaborative across both mirror sides. However, "mirror world" operates more as setting layer than as timeframe pressure; no ticking deadline or temporal constraint narrows options, and the mirror logic could be replaced with "spirit realm" or "shadow plane" with moderate edits, limiting the score to mid-5s despite solid integration.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to rekindle a dying realm" is signaled in the first third ("I had come here to rekindle a dying realm") and shapes every major choice: consulting the ledger, pivoting from intact mornings to woven voices, weaving across mirror sides, opening the loom to communities. The desire is tested on the page when "mornings here arrived in pieces, late and halting, then stopped arriving," forcing a tactical shift. The cost is dramatized: communities' spoiled names, the protagonist's shared scars, and the relinquishment of sole control. Closure directly fulfills the motivation when light spills, the greenhouse stretches, and night thins without fleeing. The friction between the protagonist's scattered courage ("my courage fluttered like burlap") and the realm's need for cohesion drives the internal arc. Setup, development, and closure participation are all present, and the motivation is indispensable to the story's logic. The score reaches 7+ but not 8+ because the motivation is pursued steadily rather than through a high-stakes choice that forecloses a live alternative path (e.g., abandon the realm, sacrifice the mirror twin).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Bound release" is introduced early ("It is a bound release: the wrap holds, the sap frees, and both are needed") and recurs with escalating meaning: swaddling that enables growth, light tied to dark both permitted to breathe, and the final "we, bound to the work, release our grip just enough for others to hold." The tone is coherent—sustained tension between constraint and freedom—and modulates appropriately as pressure builds: early tenderness with grafts, urgency in the weaving sequence, and poised reciprocity at closure. The tone charges the final image when the mirror twin and protagonist "agree to share scars" and the woven dawn negotiates boundaries rather than obliterating night. The tone is indispensable; replacing it with triumph or loss would dismantle the thematic coherence. However, the tone operates primarily as thematic gloss rather than as a visceral shift that alters a choice in real time (e.g., restraint preventing destructive action, release enabling a risky leap), keeping it high-7s rather than 8+.</comment>
