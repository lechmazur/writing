<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The poet POV carries a consistent perceptual signature—filtering the energy beings and grotto through metaphor and pattern. Motivation (discovering time's texture) is clear and drives the descent, the rope-handling, and the engagement with the being. The final vow ("ethically playful, keep mercy quick") and the mirrored past confrontation show internal contradiction—heroic knots vs. present humility—but the turn from "seem heroic" to "braid it into present strength" feels more asserted than enacted with visible struggle on the page. Interiority leans abstract ("violet arithmetic," "time's grain") without enough embodied sensation to anchor stakes at peak beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story layers encounters—starlight arrival, lantern moment, energy being exchange, vision of clock-prison, mirror confrontation—building density toward the final vow and road re-entry. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the poet forgives the past and accepts the rope as present strength, foreclosing escape-fantasy with conceptual cost ("breathe only if I forgave"). Orientation anchors (grotto, poet, after beings arrive) land early. One deduction: the cost is more conceptual than felt; the mirror beat does not show a visible forfeiture or tactical narrowing, only reflection and consent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The grotto—terra-cotta walls, breathing pulse, dust floor as palimpsest, stalagmite anchor—constrains the poet's choices: looping the rope, kneeling, patterning footprints. Starlight replaces the lantern, charging perception. The grotto's "centuries of water and fingertips" recurs when the being shows canyon-river layers, tying setting to theme. Micro-setting (rope around waist, dust under footsteps) directly shapes the unveiling action and primes the mirror moment, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: discovering time's texture without "breaking anything that could feel." The poet's choices—darkening the lantern, looping the rope, asking the being to show "how time bruises"—escalate engagement and culminate in the mirror confrontation where past heroism is renounced. The tightening is present (each vision peels a layer, narrowing toward self-confrontation), but the final turn lacks a live trade-off or visible price paid on the page; the poet consents and the grotto "approves" without dramatized resistance or forfeiture that would raise the cost band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—ethics of change, pattern vs. alibi, past-as-resource—emerges through rope handling, silt transformations, and the mirror that demands forgiveness rather than heroic escape. The vow ("ethically playful, keep mercy quick, hold metaphors accountable") arises from layered images (clock-prison, river delta, dust loom) without overt moralizing. The final road-as-colleague image reweights the mile markers from "rhymes that refused to end" to "small constellations," offering a non-literal answer. One slip: "pattern of our alibis, the serial excuses we call progress" edges toward thesis statement in the grotto monologue.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single-POV interiority remains stable; perceptual signature (metaphor-dense, abstract nouns like "violet arithmetic," "passionate subtlety") is consistent and voice-motivated. The being's ripple "tasted like metal" and memory intrusion sustain psychic distance. Free indirect thought ("I told myself") and dialogue-like address ("I told it") clarify stance. Deductions: register occasionally drifts elevated ("palimpsest of seasons," "grammar, a reminder that connection is a sentence") in ways that feel more authorial than poet-in-crisis; no head-hopping, but the density of figurative language in high-pressure beats (mirror, canyon vision) obscures immediate sensation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout—most sentences carry metaphor or elevated diction—without clear pattern-teaching or payoff that charges closure. Examples: "violet arithmetic," "tasted like metal on my tongue," "looped around a stalagmite, then around my waist," "loom might weave a childhood" cluster without letting concrete action breathe. Paraphrase appears: "I came with a motive and a mischief" / "My motive was to discover…my mischief was to do it…" restates across adjacent lines. Template stems recur: "I [verb]" opens many sentences in the opening third. Syntax varies within paragraphs, but the cumulative ornamental load flattens momentum in the mirror and canyon beats where pressure should peak. Apply artifact penalty −0.8 for density + loops + stem repetition (Q7 only).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The combination—roadside poet, energy beings, rope from prison, grotto as time archive—offers specific detail (terra-cotta, frayed coil, violet filaments) and a fresh synthesis of encounter-story and interiority. The "impossible choice" premise (prison-of-clocks with two handles) and mirror-that-is-not-glass provide non-obvious turns. Deductions: the energy-being motif and "violet arithmetic" aesthetic lean toward widely used literary-SF patterns; the thematic vow and forgiveness-mirror beat follow a familiar arc (confront past, accept flaws, reintegrate) without a sharp conceptual swerve that would elevate ingenuity into the high band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Poet character present throughout; makes choices to follow markers, darken lantern, loop rope, ask being for visions, and speak the vow. The final mirror confrontation (forgiving the version "that ran first") and decision to braid past into present are on-page decisions that foreclose escape-fantasy and alter stance. Setup early, development (rope-looping, grotto interaction), and payoff (vow, road re-entry) all present. Modest lift for causal pressure (choices narrow toward self-confrontation) and closure linkage (vow and road images close the arc). Swappability remains low-moderate; another drifter archetype could perform similar moves with edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rope introduced early ("frayed coil…from a prison escape"), handled in at least three beats: carried across deserts, looped around stalagmite and waist, pressed against mirror, and semantically reprised ("braid it into present strength"). It constrains the poet's engagement (grammar/connection metaphor) and charges the mirror moment. Setup, development (looping, tactile anchor), and payoff (braiding metaphor at closure) all present. Causal pressure moderate (enables confrontation; does not single-handedly drive the turn). Specificity high (prison origin, rust/rain smell, fraying). Cost connection present (must accept rope's history to move forward). Closure linkage solid but not indispensable; the mirror choice could function without the physical rope.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Impossible choices embedded in the clock-prison vision (two handles: dissolving past vs. unnoticing future) and the mirror moment (cut past or braid it). The concept shapes the poet's stake and the being's lesson. Setup implicit (poet's motive to discover time), development (clock-prison vision mid-story), payoff (mirror choice at end). The vision narrows options conceptually but does not create a live on-page dilemma with trade-offs; the poet chooses integration without visible cost or alternative considered. Causal pressure moderate; swappability low (the exact framing matters). Closure linkage present but the final vow resolves the concept cleanly rather than sustaining ambiguity.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Ethically playful" declared early ("I came with a motive and a mischief, ethically playful in every choice") and restated in the vow ("I would be ethically playful, keep mercy quick"). Setup present; development weak—no on-page scene shows the trait constraining a choice with visible cost (the poet is cautious, not mischievous). The attribute remains label-only; no action embodies playfulness under pressure. Payoff (vow) recycles the phrase without dramatizing its friction. Swappability high; substitute "careful" or "mindful" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Pattern" action central: poet tries to pattern breathing to grotto pulse, patterns footprints through dust "like a loom might weave a childhood," and learns "the pattern of our alibis." Setup early (notes as whispers "that patterned the dust"), development (footprint/loom beat with being), payoff (final road markers "pattern into letters"). The action drives the unveiling method and connects to theme (serial excuses, time's texture). Causal pressure solid (patterning is the means of discovery). Specificity high (dust, footprints, constellations). Irreplaceability moderate; "trace" or "map" could substitute with edits, but "pattern" recurs enough to anchor the arc.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Uncovering layers" method signaled early ("By uncovering layers, I told myself, I might hear the secret…") and enacted through the being's visions: each tale lifts to reveal another, floor as palimpsest, silt that was mountain/lake/field. Setup present, development (layered visions mid-story), payoff (last layer where poet's past unspools). The method shapes attempts (asking the being, looping rope as listening tool) and delivers the mirror confrontation. Mechanics matter on the page. Causal pressure moderate to strong. Swappability low; the exact "layers" framing ties to the grotto's strata and closure logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Grotto present throughout: walls with centuries of marks, breathing pulse, chill floor, stalagmite for rope anchor, dust that holds footprints, and implicit chamber for the mirror. Setup immediate (first line), development (lantern/rope/footprint beats), payoff (mirror chamber, grotto "approves," final re-entry to road). The setting supplies resources (stalagmite, dust palimpsest) that enable the unveiling and charges the closure (approval, contrast with road). Spatial choreography clear. Causal pressure high (grotto's layered history is the discovery site). Irreplaceability high; no generic cave would carry the same charge.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Timeframe "after the energy beings arrive" anchors the story's present and explains the violet hush and the being's presence. Setup immediate, development (being at cave mouth, shared listening), payoff (being nods, shows visions). The timeframe enables the encounter but does not tighten decisions or create a live clock. The poet's exploration unfolds at their own pace; no urgency or deadline pressures choices. Swappability moderate (another liminal moment—storm, eclipse—could replace beings with edits). Functional but not essential.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Motivation "to discover the texture of time" stated early and drives the grotto visit, lantern test, breathing pattern attempt, and request to see "how time bruises." Setup clear, development (layered visions as discovery), payoff (poet learns "to know the texture of time is to notice the pattern of our alibis"). The motivation is more told than dramatized in friction; the poet pursues it without on-page competing want or fear that would create internal conflict. Cost connection present (must confront past) but the desire itself remains abstract rather than viscerally charged.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Tone "passionate subtlety" present in the elevated-yet-restrained diction ("violet arithmetic," "filaments like ivy," "passionate subtlety" itself), the being's ripple that conveys meaning without speech, and the quiet vow at closure. Setup immediate (opening lyricism), development (restrained interaction with being, no shouting or melodrama), payoff (modest match-voice vow, road as "old colleague"). Tone modulates slightly (opening wonder, mirror gravity, final calm) and charges the ending without breaking into overt sentiment. Coherence high; one purposeful tension when "passionate" risks contradiction with "subtlety," but the piece sustains the balance.</comment>
