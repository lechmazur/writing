<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is consistent—esoteric realist, building ephemeral signals—but remains largely observational rather than driven by contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Embodied emotion is present (kneeling, resin bead), yet the closing "waited for history to answer gently" reads passive rather than a choice with visible cost. The reflection on overlooked keepers is anchored to present gestures, but the final stance crystallization lacks an earned renunciation or decision that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—density builds through layered signals (reeds, pebbles, pollen, moth wing, fern stems) and the monarch's arrival. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the narrator promises to "stitch their names from moss and echo" and the monarch blesses the method, crystallizing the stance. Cost is felt (the vulnerability of temporary structures, the weight of witnessing extinction) but remains somewhat oblique; the final image of lying in stillness does not decisively reweight prior material with unmistakable pressure. One meaningful deepening is present.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The grotto is anchored early and vividly (verdant, cave-mouth water, moss, green light). Micro-setting elements—resin bead, pebbles, fern stems—are handled across beats and constrain the narrator's method of honoring. The recurring moth wing and its placement "where the wind would not tear it free" charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through the narrator's attentive stance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—honoring overlooked histories before they vanish—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure deepens through the monarch's arrival (last verb of a vanishing language) and the hawk shadow interruption. Agency is present in the act of building signals and the spoken promise, but the final lying-in-stillness reads more as receptive waiting than a choice that forecloses a path with on-page cost. One meaningful tightening (the cadence interrupted by danger, then resumed) narrows the narrator's options under the inferred Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme—witnessing and recording fragile histories through ephemeral gestures—emerges from particulars (larvae feeders, "municipal forgetfulness," temporary structures) without overt statement. The final image of lying open to "green light" and waiting for history to answer offers a resonant, non-literal conclusion that reweights the narrator's method: building signals that teach "to stand transiently rooted, to move without forsaking memory." Subtext operates in the moth wing as oracle and the monarch's blessing. Minor slip: "interrupted cadence can still resolve elsewhere" edges toward thematic articulation rather than pure implication.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and purposeful—lyric compression, philosophical register ("esoteric realist," "cadence of survival"), patterned syntax. POV distance is stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent (notices pollen, moss, semaphore). Non-standard compression ("blushing stillness," "burned syllable of orange") is taught early and legible. Minor density concern: some lines approach self-commentary ("I told myself the cadence of survival had been interrupted by us") rather than pure dramatization, though they remain anchored to present stimuli.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rhythm is controlled and varied; opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes. Information density is high in signal-building beats (triangle reeds, balanced pebbles, fern-stem heartbeat). However, paraphrase loops appear: "blushing stillness" recurs in paragraph 1 and 16 without added pressure; "transiently rooted" appears three times as a label rather than evolving constraint. Template cadence in exposition ("I thought of," "I told myself," "I promised aloud") across adjacent paragraphs triggers −0.4. Figurative density is high but mostly coherent; "burned syllable of orange" and "dullness turned oracle" work, though concentration in lyric mode risks overwriting in some readers' eyes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of ephemeral signal-building, extinction witness, and honoring hidden caretakers feels specific and non-obvious. The narrator's method—arranged signs the wind might carry—is grounded in concrete actions (knot of grasses, resin bead) rather than generic gestures. Risk-taking in lyric compression and philosophical voice heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Minor limitation: the core emotional arc (witnessing extinction through temporary structures) is not wholly fresh, though the esoteric-realist lens and the specific image of larvae feeders in basements add particularity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The esoteric realist narrator is present throughout, building signals and making micro-choices (kneeling, tying knot, placing wing, promising aloud). These actions shape beats and reflect the character's stance. However, the character's observational mode dominates; decisions do not create key turns or meaningfully alter tactics. The final choice to lie and wait is receptive rather than a turn that redefines options. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The moth wing appears in three distinct beats: lifted from pouch and knotted (paragraph 8–9), trembles as semaphore and is compared by the monarch (paragraphs 10, 15), flashes as oracle and is weighted with resin (paragraphs 20, 28). Its evolving use—from memory marker to oracle to fixed signal—constrains the narrator's method and charges the grotto's "patient intelligence." Present in the closure zone (weighted so wind won't tear it free) with visible cost (fragility, need for protection). Essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Interrupted cadence is signaled early (water taps "interrupted cadence," paragraph 5) and shapes stakes: "cadence of survival had been interrupted by us" (paragraph 17). The concept drives the middle beat when the hawk shadow halts the cadence, marking danger, then resumes "altered yet legible" (paragraph 26). This alteration constrains the narrator's understanding and tactics. Present in closure reasoning but not in the final image itself. Shapes two key beats with cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Transiently rooted" appears three times: as the narrator's purpose (paragraph 4), the structures' state (paragraph 13), and the lesson learned (paragraph 25). It frames the narrator's method but functions more as thematic label than visible constraint or enabler with cost. The trait shapes the narrator's stance but does not force a tradeoff or alter a specific action. Lyric reprise reweights meaning at closure, reaching the allowance threshold.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The knot action (tying grasses through the moth wing's stem, paragraph 9) is the hinge that marries memory to present air and enables the wing to function as semaphore and oracle. The knot is weighted with resin in paragraph 28 to prevent wind from tearing it free, showing cost and consequence. The action drives two beats (initial tying, later weighting) and is causally linked to the grotto's "reading" and the monarch's comparison. Essential to the narrator's method and present in closure preparation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Building temporary structures as signals is named in paragraph 6, demonstrated across multiple beats (reeds into triangles, balanced pebbles, pollen circles, fern stems in alternating lengths), and explicitly validated by the monarch (paragraph 24) and the narrator's final promise (paragraph 23). The method shapes the narrator's tactics and is causally tied to the theme of honoring through ephemeral witness. However, the method itself does not create a turn or face a test with visible friction; it succeeds as intended. Present in closure reasoning but not causally active in the final image.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The grotto is anchored early (verdant, quiet, cave-mouth, above the clouds) and provides the stage for all beats. Micro-setting elements—moss to lie on, walls for shadow translation, wind that might tear the wing, resin to weight—constrain the narrator's choices. The setting enables the narrator's method (grotto as "listening place") and is present in the closure image (lying on moss, eyes open to green light). Functional across beats and ending, though more enabling than pressuring.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The timeframe (migration of the last monarch butterfly) is signaled in paragraph 2 and materialized when the monarch arrives in paragraph 14 as "the last verb of a vanishing language." It tightens urgency (extinction context) and validates the narrator's purpose. However, the timeframe does not create a live clock that alters tactics beat-by-beat; it functions more as backdrop and thematic weight. Present in setup and payoff, but does not constrain middle choices.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Honoring overlooked histories is stated in paragraph 4, dramatized through building signals (paragraphs 6–18), and made explicit in the promise to "stitch their names from moss and echo" (paragraph 23). The motivation drives the narrator's actions and faces implicit friction (the vulnerability of temporary structures, the weight of witnessing alone). However, the desire is not contested by a countervailing want; it proceeds without visible internal conflict or tradeoff. Present across beats and in closure, but friction is atmospheric rather than acute.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Blushing stillness is named in paragraph 1, returns as "blushing stillness blossomed wider" in paragraph 16 after the monarch arrives, and the final image ("lay on the moss…waited for history to answer gently through stillness") resonates with it. Tone modulates subtly under pressure (hawk shadow, cadence interruption) but remains largely serene and contemplative. The reprise charges the closure image, but the tone does not undergo a decisive shift that reweights prior material. Lyric coherence across beats and ending.</comment>
