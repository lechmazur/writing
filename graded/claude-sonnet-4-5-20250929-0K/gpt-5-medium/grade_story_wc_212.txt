<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is established early and consistently pursued through micro-choices (naming Return, placing the acorn cap, singing the layouts). Interior access is lyric and specific—"hands are furiously tranquil," "taste the clean edge of purpose"—but several beats rely on abstract declaration rather than embodied contradiction ("wild serenity" as label). The grandmother's presence at the end reads as symbolic validation rather than earned friction. The renunciation implicit in "kept it without keeping it" carries felt weight, though the passage through seasons compresses agency into summary.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land within the opening lines. The piece accumulates pressure through ritual beats—egg hatching, naming, placement of the cap, journey through seasons—culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: the protagonist plants the cap and commits to teaching the next keeper). The cost is legible in the line "when it loosens, I will teach the next pair of hands the song," foreclosing permanent possession. One tightening occurs when Return "pours a draft of invisible pollen" and the protagonist sees the orchard unborn, reweighting the task from storage to transmission. Closure lands on the page with conceptual cost (release rather than hoarding) under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The icebound atrium is established early with vivid, purposeful detail: "breath hangs like frost-laced bells," "windows veined with ice that maps the sky in silver." Sensory selection reflects the ritual's urgency and the protagonist's attunement to the orchard (moss dreams, citrus blossom). The oak acorn cap functions as micro-setting, constraining the final choice—it becomes the wheel hub that steadies Return and is then planted, charging the closure image. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout: egg on marble, cap on shoulder, cap placed on vortex, cap planted in loam. The environment recedes causally as winter withdraws, supporting the thematic turn.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: restore the orchard by receiving and releasing the vortex of seasons. One meaningful deepening occurs when Return teaches the protagonist to "turn the key" by singing layouts and humming names—the tactic shifts from waiting to active transmission. The cost is legible: the protagonist steps into the seasons "to discover the texture of borrowed time, then pass through," forfeiting permanent control. No antagonist; pressure accumulates through the ritual's demands and the need to release rather than hoard. The line "you kept it without keeping it" articulates the trade-off. Agency is present but slightly diffused by the lyric mode's reliance on abstract imagery in the seasons passage.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly from events and images: inheritance as transmission rather than possession, entropy reduction through pattern and song. The oak acorn cap recurs with shifted meaning—from grandmother's lesson ("time is a lidded well") to wheel hub to planted seed—charging the closure without overt statement. The final image (rootlet solving the dark, atrium warming) offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext operates in gesture: the grandmother's nod, the protagonist's breath fogging the glass in a spiral. No moralizing; the piece trusts particulars (amaranth skulls, beans that remember summer handshakes) to carry weight. Minor slip: "decreasing entropy" is repeated as a phrase rather than fully dramatized through varied action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person, with a distinct lyric register—"furiously tranquil," "recalcitrant tide," "rootlets first arithmetic." Diction remains within the protagonist's plausible lexicon (seed saver, ritualist) though occasionally tips into elevated abstraction ("memory engine," "draft of invisible pollen"). Narrative certainty matches what the focalizer can know; the grandmother's appearance at the end reads as vision rather than physical presence, signaled by "made of evenings and recipes." Perceptual signature is consistent: attention flows through botanical and temporal metaphors. Free indirect style is clean. Minor register drift in peak beats ("veins braided with veins of frost") leans ornamental but does not obscure the POV's core texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Line-level clarity is high, rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is strong in most beats. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. Some figurative density in high-pressure beats borders on overwriting: "creature of seeds unfurls until it becomes a memory engine, its veins braided with veins of frost" stacks metaphors without clear causal linkage. Minor paraphrase loop: "I want not to own them but to feel their nap and grain, to discover the texture of borrowed time, then pass through" restates the motivation already clear from prior lines. No scaffold or template cadence; grammar and punctuation are clean. The seasons passage compresses transit efficiently, a positive. Textural specificity ("amaranth skulls," "beans that remember summer handshakes") elevates precision.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of seed-saving, vortex inheritance, and entropy reduction as ritual transmission feels specific and non-obvious. The oak acorn cap as heirloom object that becomes both lesson and tool avoids stock symbolism. The grandmother's tactile teaching ("tapped my wrist with this cap") and the protagonist's embodied learning (singing, humming, planting) ground the premise in concrete action. The turn from storage to song, hoarding to humming, is earned in hindsight. Lyric compression and the image of seasons as threaded beads show bold structural risk that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Minor proximity concern: "time is a lidded well" and "borrowed time" echo familiar metaphors but are transformed through the ritual's particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Present by line one, drives naming decision (Return), placement of the acorn cap on the vortex, singing/humming to turn the key, stepping into seasons, and planting the cap in loam—five distinct beats. Choices alter tactics and enable closure. Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong; the role is irreplaceable (inheritance passes through the keeper's song). Minimal friction: the character is present throughout and shapes all major turns.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Introduced early (paragraph 11), returns in five beats: grandmother's lesson, protagonist places it on Return's heart, it becomes wheel hub, protagonist plants it, rootlet begins. Each use reweights meaning—from lesson to tool to planted seed. Causal pressure: steadies the vortex and enables the closure (planting reopens birdsong). Closure linkage is direct. Specificity: unique properties (pocket warmth, varnished years) matter. Visible cost: planting forecloses keeping it as talisman. Irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Signaled early (paragraph 7), shapes the protagonist's waiting and frames the inheritance mechanism. Returns in closure: "we will seed the years by decreasing entropy...by remembering the whirl exactly." Constrains the protagonist's understanding and tactics (pattern remembered, not force). Causal pressure is moderate; the concept guides rather than directly enables. Swappability is low—removal would hollow the premise. Late in full articulation (final paragraph), but the waiting and receiving structure depend on it throughout.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Label appears once in paragraph 6 ("my hands are furiously tranquil, steady in their storm"). The trait is asserted but not dramatized through contradictory impulses acting in scene; cupping the vortex is described as steady, not tested by competing impulses. No visible tradeoff or on-page cost tied to this exact trait. Does not return or constrain a later choice. Functional but ornamental; could be swapped for another paradoxical descriptor without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Referenced once in paragraph 12 (seed vault at age eight). The attempt shaped the grandmother's lesson ("patient, little oak, time is a lidded well"), which primes the protagonist's waiting, but the action itself is backstory and does not drive an on-page turn. The current ritual (receiving Return, planting the cap) could proceed without that childhood attempt. Setup is present, but no middle beat or closure participation. Causal linkage is indirect. Replaceable with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Signaled in paragraph 19 ("open only by decreasing entropy...not by force but by pattern remembered"), returns in final paragraph as the method for seeding years. Shapes the protagonist's tactics: singing, humming, remembering the whirl. Constrains approach (no forcing) and guides closure commitment. Two beats: articulation and final pledge. Causal pressure is moderate; the phrase teaches the ritual's logic. Swappability is low—removal would flatten the mechanism. Late full articulation (60% mark) and summary-only in final use reduce score slightly.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Present from opening line, anchors the entire ritual. Icebound condition creates urgency (breath as frost-laced bells, windows veined with ice). Setting evolves causally: winter recedes, ferns awaken, atrium warms. Spatial choreography is clear (marble, benches, pots). The cold pressures the protagonist's task (preserving seeds, receiving the vortex) and the warming signals success. Closure participation: "atrium warms a fraction, enough to thaw a promise." Irreplaceable—the icebound state and its thaw are integral to the ritual's arc. Strong setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Present in title position (paragraph 3: "after the egg hatches, after the crack...after the hush"). Frames the scene's starting point and signals the protagonist's readiness. Returns obliquely in closure (rootlet begins, implying continuation). Does not tighten on-page decisions or create a live clock that alters moves; the hatching is complete before the scene's pressure begins. Functional framing but no middle-beat constraint. Causal pressure is minimal. Lyric reprise (beginning → rootlet's new beginning) reweights slightly but does not drive tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stated in paragraph 10 ("I am here to discover the texture of borrowed time, and to give it back wisely"), drives the protagonist's choice to step into seasons (paragraph 29: "to discover the texture of borrowed time, then pass through") and shapes closure (teaching the next keeper, planting the cap). Friction: the desire to feel the seasons conflicts with the need to release them, creating the trade-off dramatized in "kept it without keeping it." Three beats: naming Return, stepping into seasons, planting and teaching. Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong. Minor paraphrase loop in restatement reduces score slightly.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Signaled early (paragraph 6: "hands are furiously tranquil"; paragraph 15: "thrums with wild serenity"). Modulates with pressure: calm attentiveness during waiting, intensified focus during the vortex's unfurling, peaceful commitment at closure ("hold silence," "taste the clean edge of purpose"). Tone charges the final image (atrium warming, rootlet solving the dark). Coherent through turns but relies on labels ("wild serenity") rather than fully embodied shifts. Does not constrain a choice directly. Present in setup, middle, and closure; reweights the ritual's emotional arc. Swappability is moderate.</comment>
