<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The keeper (narrator) demonstrates coherent motivation and embodied presence through ink-work and ritual action. The half-masked line walker shows physical particularity (blackened feet, partial mask) and purposeful action, but his interior remains opaque—he functions more as atmospheric figure than agent with conflicting drives. The prophet is pure absence; his choice to retreat is told rather than dramatized. Micro-choices exist (opening pages, anchoring points, facing away from the path) but lack visible internal cost or contradiction that would elevate characterization into the high band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates ritual density and reaches a Resonant Reconfiguration—Earned Stasis in which the collective practice succeeds, the echo settles, and tomorrow's repetition is accepted with visible cost (the valley forgets quickly). The closure image ("feel the echo of wisdom settle against my ribs and stay") reweights the daily labor with conceptual cost made legible. Orientation anchors who (keeper), where (pavilion/valley), and the ritual stakes within the first quarter. One meaningful deepening occurs when the walker suggests widening the clearing through peripheral trust, which the narrator enacts, intensifying the ritual's success and charging the final acceptance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The murmuring pavilion, kinetic parapet, and drift soot create a vivid micro-setting that constrains ritual action throughout. The parapet "heaves to meet" the wind and must be steadied by recitation; the pavilion's "glass ribs" and "hushed consonants" guide the timing of moves. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through the keeper's craft-focused POV. The sand's underbody and the valley's memory-skittishness anchor world rules that directly shape the central task. The final image of tracks filling and the parapet "curling to sleep" charges closure with environmental embodiment, meeting the 9+ gate for setting constraint on closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: preserve legible echoes against the prophet's arrival and the valley's forgetfulness. The midday wind forces a tightening when the walker "strings a line across the gust like a stitch" and they "sew calm into the air," raising tactical pressure. The decision to widen the clearing by trusting peripheral awareness deepens risk and succeeds, proving the method. Cost is implied through repeated labor ("Tomorrow we will do it again") but not viscerally dramatized as loss or trade-off within the scene. One meaningful escalation under the Accumulative lens is present, but the cost reads conceptual rather than felt at the moment of choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—preservation through restraint, echo over blare, peripheral attention over direct gaze—emerges organically from ritual particulars and the valley's metaphysics. The line "Blare collapses, echo endures" and the cup-not-trumpet image ground the concept in sensory form without thesis-stating. The final image ("feel the echo of wisdom settle against my ribs and stay") offers a non-literal answer to the question of how wisdom survives: through daily ritual acceptance and bodily anchor. The piece resists overt moralizing. Minor slip: "Some think prophecy is a trumpet, but here it is a cup" edges toward direct statement rather than pure implication, though it remains grounded in the scene's logic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single-POV first-person plural ("we") maintains stable collective stance with no head-hopping; the keeper's individual perceptual signature emerges through ink-work and the final somatic anchor ("against my ribs"). Diction is purposeful and lyric: "drift soot and quiet intention," "strangely honest," "gliding along the glimmer that lives at the side of sight." Figurative language is dense but controlled, with recurring motifs (breath, murmur, echo) that cohere rather than clutter. Distance is consistent; no filter-verb stacks. One brief dialogue exchange ("I ask him how") serves function without naturalistic subtext, acceptable at this length. Perceptual filter is specific to the craft of preserving echoes, meeting the 9+ gate for distinct signature and rhythm under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines do two jobs (world-building, atmosphere, ritual action). Rhythm varies purposefully with longer contemplative sentences and short declarative beats ("We recite the litany"). Minor template-cadence issue: several adjacent paragraphs open with prepositional or temporal phrases ("In this place," "In the sand's underbody," "Into it we pour," "Inside that hush"), creating light scaffold. The metaphor "like a creek hiding under planks" is concrete and apt; "toeing out ridgelines" is specific to the walker's task. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Figurative density is high but mostly coherent; one mixed construction ("balance on weather itself" after "toeing out ridgelines") introduces slight vehicle drift. The artifacts do not touch closure, so penalty remains modest (−0.4 for template stems). High density and clean propulsion keep the score in strong territory.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of ritual labor, peripheral awareness as method, and kinetic landscape as active constraint feels specific and non-obvious. The valley's memory-skittishness and the parapet's breath-responsive movement transform the familiar "preservation of knowledge" premise into a grounded metaphysical system. Voice and setting cohere into a singular vision. Risk: the lyric register and first-person plural POV are unconventional for plot-driven short fiction and succeed in maintaining pressure. Minor limitation: the prophet remains an abstract catalyst rather than a fully realized element, and the core ritual follows a predictable success arc (preparation → wind challenge → widening → success). The ending reweights the daily labor with conceptual cost, but no turn or complication disrupts expectation. Solid originality without the bold reversal or moral calculus that would reach higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The half-masked line walker is present from dawn, his peripheral awareness method is explained and demonstrated, and he suggests widening the clearing—a key tactical turn that the narrator enacts. His decision to "remove one glove" and trace his mask while speaking is embodied. However, his choices are mostly enabling rather than conflicting; the narrator's agency dominates. He appears in setup, middle (reads the parapet, strings the line, suggests the method), and closure (bows and vanishes), meeting all three gates. Causal pressure is moderate: his method shapes the middle escalation and the widen-clearing choice, but the final success depends on collective ritual rather than his individual stake. Specificity is high (blackened feet, one glove, mask trace). Score: early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal enabling +0.8, closure presence +0.7, minus ornamental bow at end −0.3, minus swappability (another guide figure could serve) −0.4 = ~6.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The kinetic parapet is present in setup ("lies the kinetic parapet beneath the dunes"), middle (heaves to meet the wind, walker reads its pulse, litany steadies it), and closure (settles "like an animal curling to sleep"). It constrains action: the group must recite litany to firm the dune skin, and the walker reads its motion to find stable ridgelines. The parapet's responsiveness creates tactical pressure in the midday wind beat. Final image reweights it as animate and resting, charging the ending with embodied world-logic. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (enables/constrains) +1.2, closure linkage +1.3, specificity (kinetic, beneath, moving rampart) +0.6, minus slight summary ("the parapet heaves") −0.3 = ~7.8. Strong integration, one step shy of indispensable because the ritual could theoretically succeed with a different metaphysical anchor.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Conjured clearings are the central stake: the group must create and widen them to preserve echoes. Setup: "we practice our craft, conjured clearings within the hush where words can keep their form." Middle: "By the time sun strikes… the first of the conjured clearings holds"; later, "we can widen the clearing if we trust its margin." Closure: "The clearing widens… and in the space the echoes become almost voices." The concept defines the goal, shapes every tactical move (sanding breath, reciting litany, facing away), and success is measured by its on-page realization. Early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (drives all tactics) +1.6, closure linkage (clearing widens, echoes become voices) +1.8, specificity (not generic "space" but clearing with margin, oculus where words settle) +0.7 = ~8.1. Essential; removing it breaks story logic and stakes.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Strangely honest" is applied to the walker's eyes and later his fatigue. Setup: "his eyes are strangely honest, as if sincerity there obeys stricter gravity than ours." Closure: "strangely honest in his fatigue." The trait recurs and colors perception, but it does not constrain an on-page choice or create visible cost. It functions as atmospheric coloring rather than tactical pressure. Early signal +0.4, lyric reprise (first mention → closure) +0.5 for resonance, but no causal work −0.8, no cost −0.5, swappable with another trust-marker −0.6 = ~5.8. Purposeful but not essential; the story's logic would hold if the trait were "calm" or "focused."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Consecrate" appears in setup ("we must consecrate the day before it begins") and closure ("We consecrate the record by not speaking over it"). The action defines the ritual frame: planting the heel, opening pages, reciting litany, and the prophet's palm on the ink. The midday wind disrupts, but the consecration ritual enables recovery. Closure restates it as completed, charging the final acceptance of daily repetition. Early signal +0.7, two beats (frame and seal) +0.9, causal pressure (frames all moves) +1.0, closure linkage (sealing breath) +1.0, but the specific act "consecrate" is partly swappable with "sanctify" or "prepare" −0.5, and the midpoint escalation does not hinge on this word alone −0.5 = ~7.6. Strong integration; removing the ritual frame would weaken coherence, but the label itself is not wholly irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Peripheral awareness is introduced early ("he finds them through peripheral awareness"), demonstrated in the walker's action ("he attends it through peripheral awareness, where edges declare their loyalty"), taught as method ("We face away from the path, eyes soft, catching its shimmer only as it leaks toward us"), and credited at closure ("Through peripheral awareness the world yields its truest lines"). The narrator's enactment of this method is the key middle turn that widens the clearing. Early signal +0.7, three beats (intro, demo, enactment) +1.4, causal pressure (enables the widening choice) +1.4, closure linkage (final line credits the method) +1.4, specificity (not "intuition" but peripheral, catching shimmer at the side) +0.7, minus slight telling ("he answers with a gesture") −0.3 = ~8.3. Indispensable; the method is the story's mechanical and thematic hinge.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The murmuring pavilion is present throughout: "We keep the murmuring pavilion in whisperfield calm," "He plants the heel of his foot at the pavilion's lip," "The murmuring pavilion answers with hushed consonants," "the pavilion hushes," "the pavilion resumes its murmur." It provides the ritual anchor and responds to their work, constraining where they perform the ritual and reflecting success. The pavilion's "glass ribs" time the first clearing's hold. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (location constrains, its murmur must be managed) +1.0, closure presence (resumes murmur, "proud of restraint") +1.0, specificity (murmuring, glass ribs, hushed consonants) +0.6, minus slight ornamental closure mention −0.3 = ~7.4. Essential to atmosphere and ritual logic, though not the sole driver of plot turns.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"After the prophet arrives" establishes the temporal frame in the opening: "Once he crossed the ridge, memory in this valley became skittish." The prophet's presence is the inciting condition that makes the ritual necessary. He watches at midday and seals the cup at dusk, marking ritual progress. Closure: "He leaves without ceremony." The timeframe is stable and tightens implicitly (dawn → midday wind → dusk seal → night departure). Early signal +0.7, three beats (arrival reference, midday, dusk) +1.4, causal pressure (prophet's effect creates the need) +0.9, closure linkage (departure) +0.8, but the prophet himself is passive and the timeframe does not force a ticking-clock choice −0.6, and "after" is slightly generic −0.4 = ~6.4. Important framing condition but not a live pressure lever within the scene.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"To preserve the echo of wisdom" is stated early ("My task is to preserve the echo of wisdom, not the blare of it") and governs every beat: sanding breath, opening pages, anchoring points, sealing the record. The motivation is dramatized through tactile action (opening pages, guiding the walker, feeling the echo settle). Closure: "feel the echo of wisdom settle against my ribs and stay. Tomorrow we will do it again, because the valley forgets quickly, and we will not." The cost—endless repetition against forgetting—is made visible. Early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (drives all choices) +1.4, closure linkage (echo settles, commitment to repeat) +1.6, specificity (echo vs. blare, embodied in ribs) +0.7, minus slight abstraction in phrasing ("echo of wisdom" borders thematic label) −0.4 = ~7.9. Core driver with on-page friction and cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Whisperfield calm" is named in the opening line ("We keep the murmuring pavilion in whisperfield calm") and maintained throughout: "clasped whisper," "hushed consonants," "the pavilion hushes," "resumes its murmur." Tone modulates with pressure (wind wants to scatter vowels, they "sew calm into the air") but returns to restraint at closure. The tonal coherence charges the final image of settling and repetition. Early signal +0.8, sustained across all beats +1.2, modulates with escalation (wind disrupts, they restore) +0.9, closure linkage (murmur resumes, tracks fill quietly) +1.3, specificity (not "quiet" but whisperfield, murmur, hush as craft) +0.7, minus slight decorative naming −0.2 = ~7.7. The tone is the story's atmosphere and thematic anchor, integral to the ritual's success and the ending's resonance.</comment>
