<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The artisan's interiority is concrete and embodied through the water-bowl method, her wrist-taps, and her spatial listening. Her blindness constrains and enables choices throughout, with visible micro-adjustments under pressure (calling for more bowls, patching code midair). The final smile toward the harbor and the drone landing "warm with work" deliver an earned moment of rest after demonstrated competence and struggle. Minor: Mirel remains functional but flat, serving as hands without distinct interior friction or status tension.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the artisan completes the maiden voyage coupling through adaptive technique, the depot "exhales," and her smile mirrors the settled wheels—a legible before/after with felt cost (the fog crisis, the patch midair, the precision demanded). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density builds through sensory layering (mist, bowls, pips, anchor chain) until the fog thickens, forcing a tightening (more bowls, code patch), then resolution. Orientation anchors who/where/when early (artisan, depot, maiden voyage timing). One meaningful deepening (fog fold, hesitation, precision response) sufficient for this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The mist-coated depot, water bowls, and the rail environment constrain every choice: fog scrambles landmarks, bowls translate feedback, droplets under the eave provide new coordinates. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through the artisan's acoustic and tactile priorities (chain vowels, wheel-chatter, rain's drumhead). The hummingbird's arcs, the coupling cars' alignment, and the spatial choreography of porters/crew remain coherent across moves. The final image charges the setting: "the depot returns the smile in the language of settled wheels."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—guide the coupling without sight during fog—is signaled early and tightens when fog folds thicker and the second car slants. The artisan's agency (calling for more bowls, patching code midair, counting taps) drives the reversal from hesitation to success. The escalation is earned by her adaptive technique under accumulative pressure, and the cost is legible: precision demanded, ritual momentarily silent, then restored. Coincidence (fog, wind) complicates but does not resolve; protagonist action closes the gap.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—repair as vow, closing distance between signal and hands, collaboration as shared ritual—emerges through concrete particulars (copper braid patch, water-bowl coordinates, Mirel's mirroring). The final image of the drone landing "warm with work" and the depot smiling back reweights the opening's "heartfelt artisan" without stating a moral. Minor thematic echo: "patch is not just repair but vow" leans slightly overt but is anchored in action and does not summarize the ending. No forced motifs; the bowls and drone recur with evolving function.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Single-POV third limited holds stable with consistent psychic distance and perceptual signature: the artisan notices chain vowels, rail-color, beat-to-length geometry. Diction is controlled and often lyric ("metal vowels," "geometry of routes," "bright coin") but remains voice-motivated and legible. Minor register drift: "magnetic calm" and a few elevated constructions ("examining light refraction through water features") slightly exceed natural thought idiom under pressure, though they cohere with the depot's technical-poetic frame. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful (the method is taught early, used throughout).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high in peak beats (fog fold, code patch, final coupling). However, pervasive figurative layering and elevated diction create texture drag: "harbor bells stutter," "timbers groaning like a great throat," "metal vowels," "drumhead," "pebbles," "chalk crack," "bright coin"—nearly every sentence carries a metaphor or simile, and several mix vehicles (mist as gauze, sound as beads, then as vowels). Template cadence appears in the opening third (repeated "she" + verb stems). Apply −0.6 for density and coherence slip, −0.3 for template stems, totaling roughly −0.9 within the non-closure cap. Minor loops: "examining light refraction through water features" repeated verbatim. Closure beat itself remains clear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—blind artisan guiding rail coupling via water-bowl sound triangulation and drone feedback—is specific and non-obvious. The premise transforms "repair" and "guidance" through lived sensory detail (Morse taps, rain drumhead, pip echoes) and earned technique. Risk-taking in the lyric-technical register heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, though the figurative density occasionally slows momentum. The transformation test passes: plot and arc depend on this exact method and character constellation. Minor: the "heartfelt artisan" frame and depot-as-breathing-entity veer slightly toward stock personification but are redeemed by the working particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Present early (opening line), constrains all choices (blind oversight forces water-bowl method), and shapes closure (her smile, the drone landing on her wrist). She patches code midair, calls for more bowls under fog pressure, and counts taps—three distinct beats of causal agency. The "heartfelt" label is slightly ornamental but the artisan's decisions are irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Introduced early (bench, wings folded), used in three beats (wrist perch, leap/stitching mist, return landing), and charges the final image ("warm with work, as if flush with nectar"). Its speaker and pips enable the coupling; without the drone's feedback loop, the plot breaks. Specificity high; visible cost when it hesitates mid-task.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Signaled in opening line, supplies the setting and tools (circuits, brushes, bowls), and frames the stakes (repair work enabling depot function). The shop's open threshold and side door allow the water-bowl method. Present in closure image ("in the shop's doorway"). One clear turn: the artisan moves from bench work to threshold guidance. Functional across beats but the "repair shop" itself is somewhat generic; the water-bowl innovation does the heavier causal lifting.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Present early ("oversees while blind"), constrains every choice (water bowls, Morse taps, reliance on Mirel's sight), and drives the core method. Visible cost when fog muddies the water and numbers stumble. The attribute is indispensable; sighted oversight would erase the plot's mechanism and stakes.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Introduced early (copper braid patch), used again midair (code patch shortening buffer), and thematically resonant ("patch is not just repair but vow"). The second patch enables the fog reversal. However, the action is somewhat swappable with "adjust" or "recalibrate" without major structural loss. Causal pressure is present but not uniquely tied to "patch" as verb/concept.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Signaled early (bowls everywhere, examining refraction), mechanics matter throughout (mirrors funnel sunlight, ripples hum against fingertips, angles → direction → intent), and the method is stressed under fog (rain drumhead, new coordinates bloom). Shapes two middle beats and the reversal. Without this exact method, the plot's mechanism collapses. Specificity and cost both high.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Present in opening line, supplies fog that scrambles landmarks, and the depot's windows/floor/eave provide sensory inputs (droplets, hum). The mist pressures the coupling task and forces the water-bowl adaptation. Closure image ("depot returns the smile") reweights the setting as participant. Micro-setting (bowls, threshold, eave) alters tactics. Strong integration, though "depot" itself is somewhat generic compared to the method's specificity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Signaled early (anchor lifts, maiden voyage), creates urgency (coupling must happen now), and the anchor's rattle provides a temporal beat the artisan counts against. Present at closure (anchor lifts clean, voyage begins). However, the timeframe is more atmospheric than mechanically binding; no on-page countdown forces a visible tradeoff. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stated early ("drone has to decode feedback into direction"), dramatized through the artisan's taps and Mirel's coordinate translation, and tested under fog when feedback falters. The motivation drives two beats (initial coupling, fog reversal) and is present at closure (second car settles, voyage begins). Friction between signal loss and precision creates cost. Strong causal and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Signaled early ("breathes magnetic calm," "depot seems to breathe with her, old iron easing"), modulates under fog pressure (ritual goes silent, then precision not panic), and charges the final image (artisan's smile, depot's smile). Tone is coherent and voice-consistent but verges on ornamental; "magnetic calm" appears more as lyric descriptor than constraint. Lyric reprise functional but not indispensable.</comment>
