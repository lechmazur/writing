<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The archivist's motivation is concrete and embodied through sensory work (valve-turning, window-tapping), with interiority filtered through the archival lens ("reactively visionary"). The woman's desire to "leave traces that do not wash away" creates sufficient pressure. Minor slip: her backstory about exile feels asserted rather than dramatized through present micro-choices, and the archivist's internal contradiction (waiting vs. compiling) remains more thematic than behavioral. The ending choice to gift the valve is earned and forecloses the museum-object path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors by ~80 words (archivist, harbor, post-exile). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): "absences have shifted, no longer voids but channels navigated" reweights the premise with felt cost (the valve given away, practice instituted). The herald's trumpet valve seeds early, returns with altered meaning, and the final image of tide carrying "our small work" charges prior material. One meaningful deepening: from waiting-for to practicing-with. Cost is conceptual and relational but legible on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ivory harbor, kelp-and-iron catalog drawers, fogged window, and valve constrain micro-choices (tapping rhythm, tracing parade route, valve ports opening/closing). Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered ("beads with the last slow drops," "boots squeaking"). The window functions as micro-setting, enabling the tapping collaboration. Spatial choreography is clean. Does not quite reach 8.0: the harbor itself remains more lyric backdrop than active constraint on a pivotal choice, though the window and valve do press.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: giving the harbor a practice of return after exile's erasure. Escalation under Accumulative lens: woman's knock → valve revealed → rhythm taught → dockworker pauses → promise of return. One meaningful tightening when the archivist decides to gift the valve, foreclosing the archive path. Agency is clear (choosing practice over preservation). The cost is visible (valve wrapped and given away, "belongs with her steps"). Does not reach 8.5: the escalation is more additive than narrowing; no live option is dramatized as incompatible until the gift moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme (return as practice, not monument) emerges from valve-turning, window-tapping, and the final gift without direct statement. "Traces survive if we build them into practice, not monuments" is close to articulation but remains tied to the valve's concrete shift from relic to metronome. The ending image—tide carrying "our small work"—reweights prior material with quiet resonance. Subtext operates in the woman's weather-name substitution and the dockworker's unspoken salute. Nearly 9.0, held back by one thematic echo: "not-quite sounds, air deciding whether to commit" over-articulates the premise's uncertainty in a way that tilts didactic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Single-POV, stable distance, distinct perceptual signature: "reactively visionary," archival metaphors ("tone: none upon the ledger"), kelp-and-iron sensory filter. Diction is controlled and lyric without obscuring clarity. Dialogue (brief, two exchanges) carries subtext: the woman gives "the weather instead" of her name, and "hearten the harbor" compresses her desire without exposition. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the valve-turning collaboration. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks. Rhythm modulates under pressure (short bursts during the tapping, longer cadences in reflection). Reaches high band cleanly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "She traces it on the fogged pane, and every curve erases water, leaving the city revealing itself"). Rhythm varies purposefully. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Minor deductions: "staggered intervals" appears four times across the piece without taught pattern payoff, trending toward churn (−0.3). "Here the drummer lost a stick, here an embrace reversed direction, here she first felt returned" uses anaphora purposefully but borders repetitive stem without added pressure (−0.2). Figurative density is high but coherent and voice-motivated; no mixed metaphors. Clean grammar and pronoun clarity throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of archivist-as-collaborator and herald's trumpet valve-as-metronome is specific and non-obvious. The piece transforms the exile-return trope by centering practice over spectacle ("not performing; we are counting the intervals"). The woman's weather-name substitution and the dockworker's cap-lift are particular, earned details. Risk: lyric accumulation without traditional plot arc succeeds under the Accumulative lens. Slight hedge: "ocean-spray archivist" and "ivory harbor" read crafted-for-prompt rather than lived-in necessity, and the parade-route tracing feels slightly illustrative rather than discovered. Still, the valve's shift from relic to gift is inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Ocean-spray archivist: present by paragraph two (setup ✓), frames the ledger-work and listening stance (development ✓), decides to gift the valve and institute practice (payoff ✓). Drives two beats: accepting the valve, collaborating on the tapping rhythm. Causal pressure: the archival lens shapes micro-choices (noting "tone: none," wrapping the valve). Closure linkage: the archivist's choice to give the valve away anchors the ending. Specificity: "ocean-spray" is ornamental; "archivist" does the causal work. Cost: forfeits the valve as archive object. Strong integration but not indispensable; "harbor listener" could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Herald's trumpet valve: introduced paragraph ten (setup late but within first third ✓), handled in valve-turning and window-collaboration (development ✓), wrapped and gifted in the ending (payoff ✓). Appears in four distinct beats: revelation, turning with rhythm, resting as relic, wrapped as gift. Causal pressure: its ports and intervals enable the practice; without it, the collaboration has no anchor. Closure linkage: "metronome of remembering" reweights it from signal to scaffold. Irreplaceability: a generic relic would not carry the herald/parade memory or the interval mechanics. Visible cost: given away, foreclosing archive preservation. High integration, nearly indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Navigated absences: titled in paragraph six ("My ledgers are maps of currents and memories, but mostly of navigated absences"), revisited in the ending ("absences have shifted, no longer voids but channels navigated"). Setup ✓, payoff ✓. Development: the concept frames the archivist's stance and the woman's exile experience, but does not constrain a middle choice with visible cost. It operates more as thematic lens than tactical mechanic. The valve-turning and tapping are proxies for the concept, not direct enactments. Strong lyric resonance but mid-range causal pressure. Two-gate presence (setup, payoff) and thematic charge justify ~6.8.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Reactively visionary: introduced paragraph five, defines the archivist's waiting-then-charting method. Setup ✓. Development: shapes the listening stance and valve-turning collaboration (waits for the woman's rhythm before turning the ports). Payoff: implicit in the ending's practice rather than performance. One beat (collaboration) shows the trait enabling action. Causal pressure: modest; the trait flavors the approach but does not foreclose an alternative. Cost: waiting imposes delay, but no on-page price is dramatized. Swappable with "patient observer" or similar. Two gates, one beat, modest pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Hearten: introduced paragraph eighteen ("She wants me to hearten the harbor"), drives the valve-and-window collaboration (paragraphs twenty-three through thirty-two), and anchors the ending's practice promise. Setup ✓, development ✓, payoff ✓. Two beats: initiating the tapping, gifting the valve. Causal pressure: the desire to hearten structures the collaboration and the final choice. Closure linkage: "our small work" fulfills the heartenment. Cost: the archivist shifts from passive recording to active practice. Specificity: "hearten" is less replaceable than "help" or "restore" because it ties to the herald and collective affect. Strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Through staggered intervals: signaled paragraph thirteen ("careful cadence of missing steps"), enacted in the window-tapping (paragraph twenty-four: "beats come through staggered intervals, like walkers avoiding puddles"), and valve-turning (paragraph twenty-five: "turn the herald's trumpet valve along with her rhythm, letting silence open and close the ports"). Setup ✓, development ✓, payoff: implicit in the promise to return and teach timing. Two beats (tapping, valve-turning). Causal pressure: the intervals enable the practice; without them, the collaboration has no mechanics. Closure linkage: the method defines the practice the woman will continue. Irreplaceability: "staggered intervals" specifies the rhythm's incompleteness, tied to the post-exile dislocation. High integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Ivory harbor after rain: introduced paragraph two, revisited in the ending ("ivory harbor after rain carries our small work"). Setup ✓, payoff ✓. Development: the mist, wet glass, and dockworker's boots supply ambient detail but do not constrain a choice. The window is more active than the harbor itself. The harbor pressures thematically (exile's return, forgetting) but not tactically. Two gates, lyric reprise, but mid-range causal work. The setting enables the meeting and frames the mood; it does not alter the archivist's or woman's options in the middle beats. Modest specificity: "ivory" is atmospheric; "harbor" does structural work.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>After the exile ends: introduced paragraph one, frames the woman's return story (paragraphs sixteen–seventeen), implicit in the ending's promise to continue. Setup ✓, development ✓ (the woman's story of returning to a street that "did not remember her steps"), payoff: the practice will persist "tomorrow." Two touches. Causal pressure: the post-exile timing motivates the woman's arrival and the need for heartenment, but does not tighten a decision. The timeframe is past (exile ended) rather than live clock. Swappable with "after the war" or similar. Two gates, modest pressure, no on-page cost tied to the timeframe itself.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>To compile fragments into meaning: introduced paragraph four, enacted in the valve acceptance and ledger notation (paragraphs ten, twenty-eight: "I write tone: none upon the ledger"), and shifted in the ending to "practice" rather than compilation. Setup ✓, development ✓, payoff ✓. Two beats (ledger notation, choosing practice over preservation). Causal pressure: the compiling desire structures the archivist's initial stance and the pivot to collaborative practice. Closure linkage: the ending reweights compilation as ongoing practice rather than finished archive. Cost: giving away the valve forecloses the compile-and-preserve path. Strong integration, nearly essential.</comment>
