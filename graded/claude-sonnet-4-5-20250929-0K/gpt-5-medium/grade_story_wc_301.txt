<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is concrete and specific—"daringly methodical" drives the graffiti-as-cartography search, and the accordion bellows anchor embodied grief. Micro-choices accumulate: copying coordinates, lying down by the gate, stepping into the shallow and counting to twelve. The final act of marking the margin and reframing blame in the field book is earned by prior causality. Internal contradiction reads clean—certainty versus shame—but the therapy-adjacent phrasing "I stopped the pills to hear if my mind still had a river in it" skirts diagnostic label-speak without fully crossing the line.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the narrator steps into the shallow, counts to twelve, and rewrites the field-book entry ("the river was itself, and I would stop asking it to be me"), forecloses self-punishment with visible cost. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density builds through graffiti coordinates, accordion wheeze, sluice gate, and culvert, culminating in a cadence shift at the shallow. Orientation anchors quickly (station, ivy, accordion). One minor ambiguity: the graffiti's mechanics ("drunk surveyor") feel slightly pat, but the closure image lands with undeniable pressure and the lens holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The disused station, ivy-draped and moss-marked, constrains the journey—graffiti tiles as transect, embankment slit by foxes, sluice gate scarred by rust, culvert mouth—and the shallow itself is the micro-setting that charges the final image. The accordion bellows function as body-proximate setting: "pressed the patched bellows open and closed to hear the river breathe." Sensory selection is purposeful: "ivy shimmered like soundproofing," "low reedy wheeze," moss and rust texture the turning points. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly across the platform, embankment, and culvert.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: self-forgiveness for a wrongly mapped flood that killed the brother. The graffiti coordinates provide a tightening: each mark narrows the path toward the shallow. The culvert-mouth arrival and step into the water are protagonist-driven choices that foreclose retreat. Cost is visible: the narrator counts to twelve, releases the sum, and accepts the river's honest weight. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening suffices. The brother's drowning backstory compresses effectively, but the sluice-gate beat ("I had cut a corner to make a deadline sing") trends slightly summary-only rather than fully dramatized pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: "River does what it was asked to do" refracts from mirror-verdict to instruction, and the accordion bellows shift from relic to rhythmic tool. The final image—marking the margin, rewriting the field book—offers a non-literal answer to the forgiveness question without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the graffiti's "little blue mouth" and the methodical copying as ritual. The piece resists tidy resolution: the narrator stops asking the river to mirror him, but grief persists. No thematic echo in the final paragraph; the insight is earned through the shallow-step and the accordion-breath alignment.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single POV, stable distance. Perceptual signature is distinct: surveyor idiom ("isobars," "transect of voices sedimented," "map references") colors every observation. Diction remains within the focalizer's lexicon, blending technical precision and grief-charged lyricism. Purposeful compression ("cheer in a dead-end key," "river nuzzles its rail-bed grief") reads voice-motivated and legible. No head-hopping. Free indirect style is clean. One minor slip: "my heart, skittish but awake, began to trust the world again" edges toward abstract summary rather than embodied perception, but the line doesn't obscure the lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are distinct. Information density is high—most lines do two jobs. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Clarity remains strong through the graffiti-hunt and culvert journey. One deduction: figurative language clusters densely in several beats ("ivy whispering time," "coins clinked in a dented cup," "sly and fast," "muscle of earth") without pattern-teaching, trending toward overwriting in the middle third. The filter-verb phrase "seemed less like a ruin and more like a ledger" is acceptable, voice-motivated. No scaffold artifacts or syntax monotony. The final image ("footing") is clean and propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—cartographer grief mapped through bathroom graffiti—feels specific and non-obvious. The accordion bellows as embodied metronome, the graffiti coordinates as ritual path, and the shallow-step counting all grow from prior particulars. The frame avoids template grief-journey beats by rooting every turn in surveyor idiom and river-chronicler method. One friction: "daringly methodical" as a declared trait risks label-speak, but the trait is demonstrated through on-page action (copying coordinates, treating stall walls as transect). The ending's insight—river as itself, not mirror—is earned in hindsight and emotionally specific.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The truth-seeking river chronicler identity frames the opening, drives the graffiti-coordinate search ("I searched the tiles for map references"), and shapes the final field-book rewrite. The surveyor idiom colors perception throughout. Choices—copying coordinates, following arrows, stepping into the shallow—are key turns. Cost: the narrator stops asking the river to be a mirror. Present in setup, middle (graffiti hunt, sluice gate), and payoff (field book rewrite). Two beats minimum. Causal pressure: the identity enables and constrains the method. Specificity: the surveyor lens is irreplaceable. Closure linkage strong.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The accordion bellows appear in setup ("under my arm"), middle ("pressed the patched bellows open and closed"), and payoff ("set the accordion bellows...on my ribs, then breathed until our rhythms met"). Three distinct beats. The object is handled and its sound ("shy," "low reedy wheeze") reweights meaning at the sluice gate. Cost connection: the bellows mediate the narrator's grief and the brother's absence. Specificity: patched with tape, "battered metronome of breath." Not quite indispensable—the river-step could work without it—but it charges two beats and the sluice-gate moment.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Map references shape stakes from the opening ("my work is not to measure but to mend") and drive every middle beat: the bathroom tiles reveal coordinates, the platform arrows lead to the embankment, the mossed milestone matches smeared numbers, the culvert-mouth arrow points to the shallow. The final field-book entry rewrites the map logic ("the river was itself"). The concept is causally active in at least three beats and indispensable at closure. Specificity: the surveyor's professional idiom makes map references irreplaceable. Cost: the narrator's false certainty in the flood model.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Daringly methodical" is signaled early ("my method is daringly methodical") and demonstrated in two beats: the bathroom tile search and the sluice-gate accordion-breath ritual. The trait enables the graffiti-as-map approach and the lying-down breath-matching. Cost: the narrator's method is both his coping tool and a reminder of the precision that failed. However, the phrase itself trends label-only; the trait is shown more than it constrains. Present in setup and middle, but not directly in the final image. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Allude" appears twice: the bathroom ink "did allude to the old index" and the graffiti instructions "led" the narrator. The graffiti coordinates are allusions to surveyor references. This action shapes the middle journey—each arrow and number alludes to a location—and primes the shallow-step. Not fully indispensable (other verbs like "refer" or "point" could substitute), but it colors the surveyor idiom and drives the hunt. Present in setup (bathroom), middle (platform, embankment), and payoff (coordinates cumulate). Swappability lowers the score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Bathroom graffiti wisdom is signaled early (restroom door search), developed across multiple beats (cracked mirror ink, arrows, stall walls as transect), and shapes the middle journey. The method is specific: the narrator copies coordinates, measures ink pressure, treats graffiti as sedimented voices. The final beat credits the method explicitly: "bathroom graffiti wisdom...had made a method out of mercy." Present in setup, middle (multiple beats), and payoff. Causal pressure: the graffiti provides the path to the shallow. Specificity strong. One friction: the "drunk surveyor" explanation feels slightly convenient.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The disused railway station overgrown with ivy is present in setup, middle (waiting room as green chapel, platform, embankment), and payoff ("the station seemed less like a ruin and more like a ledger"). The ivy recurs: "ivy whispering time," "ivy shimmered like soundproofing," "each ivy vein an entry." The station's abandonment and the river's proximity constrain the journey. The setting is causally active: the graffiti is station-specific, the brother busked there, the culvert is station-adjacent. Specificity: the ivy and railway decay are irreplaceable. Closure linkage: the ledger image recharges the station.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "after stopping the medication" is signaled in the opening line and motivates the narrator's heightened perception ("to hear if my mind still had a river in it"). However, it does not tighten decisions or constrain tactics in the middle beats. The medication-stop is told rather than shown, and no on-page clock or consequence tracks the decision. The timeframe is functional setup but replaceable—other crisis triggers could substitute. No middle development or payoff participation. Late-arriving implicit cost (medication risk) is not dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The motivation to find a path to self-forgiveness frames the opening, drives every choice (graffiti search, sluice-gate lying-down, shallow-step), and is reweighted at closure ("I would stop asking it to be me"). The motivation is dramatized through conflicted choices: the narrator seeks forgiveness but must confront the flood error and the brother's death. Friction between want (absolution) and cost (admitting the mirror-mistake) is visible. Present in setup, middle (multiple beats), and payoff. Causal pressure strong. Specificity: the river-chronicler's professional failure makes the motivation irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Tone reads as raw solace throughout: grief-charged but not despairing, lyric but grounded in surveyor idiom. The tone modulates under pressure—early beats are tense and searching ("storm drunk with certainty"), middle beats soften ("shy" notes, "heart, skittish but awake"), and the ending balances sorrow with earned footing ("method out of mercy," "footing"). The tone charges the final image: "my daring did not feel like flight but like footing." Coherent across turns. One friction: "raw solace" is not a standard idiom; the tone executes the concept more than the label.</comment>
