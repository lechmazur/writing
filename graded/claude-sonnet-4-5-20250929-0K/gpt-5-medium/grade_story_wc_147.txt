<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is concrete and embodied throughout—"panic paddles my ribs," "fingers numb in the cold"—and the signature move of "overriding instinct" by becoming stillness anchors character under pressure. The micro-choices (unsnarling line, positioning transmitter, exhaling tones) reveal a hierarchy of values tied to rescue and memory. Internal contradiction appears in the tension between panic and stillness, though the move toward stillness is less contested than enacted. The final renunciation or endurance is legible but leans slightly toward performed competence without deeper cost to selfhood.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens inferred as Accumulative/Textural: the hush gathers, the signal "takes," and the final image reweights the premise (rescue coaxed from ephemera) with felt cost. Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly in the opening lines. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the temple fades "like a star at noon," options reconfigured with visible cost (the dive, the risk, the crew's survival still uncertain). One meaningful deepening occurs when the signal rides the hush outward and an answer thrums above, narrowing options and charging the final swim.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The underwater temple constrains the protagonist's choices—narrow corridors scrape the tank, silt swallows the lamp—and the acoustics ("gathered hush") charge the final image by enabling the signal. Sensory detail is vivid and selective: "anemones that blink like patient eyes," "bruise of brown," pressure as "a hand." Micro-setting (the frieze, the column, the vial as floating object) functions as purposeful constraint. The temple's spatial choreography remains coherent across the swim, and the final fadeout ("temple fading behind me like a star at noon") anchors closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rescue the submersible crew—is signaled early and tightens through one meaningful reversal: the corridor narrows, panic threatens, stillness allows progress, and the signal takes with "a subtle tug in the line." The protagonist's agency (unsnarling, positioning, exhaling tones, overriding instinct to achieve stillness) drives escalation under the Accumulative lens. Cost is legible on the page: the gauge needles inch toward warning, depth feels "like a hand," and the protagonist swims "proud and afraid" with survival still uncertain. No coincidental resolution; pressure coheres and the final swim forecloses a path with felt cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars without thesis: rescue coaxed from ephemera, the vial as "collected silence," the hush as shy animal trained to prayer. The perfume vial and its "soundless bouquet" charge the closure image—tying memory, signal, and the refusal to hold—without overt moralizing. The final line ("the temple fading behind me like a star at noon") offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question: whether the ephemeral can sing mathematics of need. The gathered hush and the vial's emptiness accumulate pressure and reweight prior material at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled: "the distress signal sender," "the gathered hush sidles close," "a hand testing walls." Psychic distance remains stable; diction stays within the protagonist's perceptual signature (nautical precision layered with lyric metaphor). Elision (the crew's drowsiness, the prior crisis) is purposeful and pays off in the urgency of the signal. No head-hopping. Purposeful compression ("the ocean subtract itself from the room") and patterned diction ("overriding instinct, becoming stillness") teach the voice and are paid off at closure when stillness again defeats panic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings avoid template cadence. Information density is high: most lines advance atmosphere, choice, or stakes. Minor pattern artifacts appear—"gathered hush" recurs frequently, "overriding instinct" is used twice in near-identical phrasing—but these function as motif rather than loop and do not obscure causality. One figurative reach ("touch memories, a breath of someone else's lilacs") verges on abstraction but remains anchored to the vial. No paraphrase loops; propulsion is clean through the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of distress signal, perfume vial, and underwater acoustics is non-obvious and feels inevitable in hindsight. The vial's "emptiness carries a peculiar gravity" and the hush as a space where "signals love to ride" transform familiar rescue-mission beats. Risk-taking (the lyric register under physical duress, the vial as acoustic tool) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The final image—"the temple fading behind me like a star at noon"—is specific and irreplaceable. No close echoes of famous lines; the piece commits fully to its premise and follows its implications.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Present from the opening ("They call me the distress signal sender"); drives three beats (swim to temple, unsnarl line and position transmitter, exhale tones and escape); choices (to enter the temple, to stop and achieve stillness, to exhale the signal) create the key turns; closure swim is causally tied to the sender's agency. Irreplaceable: the sender's knowledge of acoustics and the act of sending shapes the entire arc.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Introduced early ("crystal perfume vial glinting in my glove"); handled in three beats (examination while swimming, floating it before the mask, popping stopper and aiming transmitter into its mouth); reprise at closure ("I cork the vial and tie it to my chest"). The vial's emptiness and "soundless bouquet" enable the signal by touching memories and shaping the call; its return reweights meaning ("collected silence"). Specificity (chipped stopper, etched swans) matters. Could score higher if the vial's acoustic role were more mechanically explicit.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Present early ("acoustics fold on themselves, a gathered hush"); shapes tactics (protagonist seeks the nave where hush coalesces); reappears in three beats (corridor narrows and hush "sidles close," signal rides the hush outward, line sings along columns). The hush enables the signal and changes options by gathering the protagonist's call; closure image depends on the hush remembering. Irreplaceable: remove the concept and the signal cannot ride, breaking story logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Attribute "touches memories" is introduced early (vial "touches memories, a breath of someone else's lilacs"); enables one key beat (protagonist thinks of crew, sister, lilacs before exhaling tones, shaping the call "like a prayer taught backward"). The trait reweights the signal's emotional charge but does not visibly constrain or alter tactics; it enriches theme more than plot. Cost is conceptual (ephemeral harnessed) rather than a visible tradeoff. Lyric reprise at closure ("collected silence") lifts the score slightly.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Action appears twice: first, "I unsnarl the line and loop it against a column, feeling fragile relief as the drag on my torso eases"; second, implied when the line is hauled toward the sub at closure. The unsnarling enables the protagonist to nestle the transmitter and complete the signal; without it, the drag would prevent positioning. The action is causally central to escalation and closure. Specificity (loop against column, torso drag) makes it irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Method seeded early ("overriding instinct, the way a skater keeps from flailing on thin ice by becoming a single held note"); mechanics demonstrated when protagonist stops in the narrow corridor and "breath slows, the silt settles"; reappears at closure ("instinct screams to kick and claw, but I steady myself again by overriding instinct, becoming stillness"). The method shapes two key attempts and defines the protagonist's signature capability. Irreplaceable: remove the method and both the corridor beat and the surge beat collapse; no synonym could replace its specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting present from early framing ("forgotten underwater temple the charts insisted was myth"); pressures choices (toppled doors, narrow corridor scrapes tank, silt swallows lamp, surge swarms doorway); supplies resources (frieze for transmitter, column for line, acoustics that gather hush). The temple's curve enables the signal to ride and the temple's memory charges the closure. Closure swim abandons the temple with visible cost ("fading behind me like a star at noon"). Irreplaceable: remove the temple and the acoustics, signal mechanism, and final image all fail.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Timeframe signaled early ("crew drowsy on dwindling air"); tightens decision ("Time taps me on the shoulder; as time runs short, the gauge needles inch toward warning"); reappears at closure when protagonist swims "for the fissure" under implicit urgency. The clock alters tactics (protagonist must act quickly) but is not tracked beat-by-beat; its pressure is felt rather than mechanically plotted. Cost is legible (gauge warning, slow weight of depth) but the timeframe could be more precisely dramatized to reach higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Motivation stated early ("to harness the ephemeral and bend it toward rescue, to ask perfume to sing the mathematics of need"); dramatized in choices (bringing the vial, floating it, popping stopper, exhaling tones); friction evident in the tension between physical constraint (gauge, depth, surge) and the ephemeral means. The motivation drives escalation and shapes the closure image ("rescue was coaxed from what refuses to be held"). Irreplaceable: the protagonist's belief in harnessing ephemera is the story's conceptual engine.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Tone established in opening line ("lonesome splendor, a cathedral of pressure and blue"); modulates with pressure (panic narrows tone, stillness expands it); coherent through turns (hush as "shy animal," temple "yawning," signal as "subtle tug"); charges final image ("the temple fading behind me like a star at noon"). The tone integrates lyric elevation with physical duress without tonal rupture. Irreplaceable: the tone's balance of awe and isolation defines the narrative voice and makes the closure resonant.</comment>
