<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's voice is distinct and embodied—"poetically inclined even when starving"—with interior contradiction between revolutionary failure and scholarly persistence. Motivation intensifies coherently from personal salvage work through public performance to council vindication. The final moment ("sorrow shone, burnished") embodies cost without therapy-speak. Minor slip: Ledger remains functional opposition without internal contradiction of his own, capping the relational crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred and held: the shard's "breathing" accumulates meaning through ritual, public reading, council demonstration, then fractures. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid): "my revolution remained defunct...but the civilization we shared looked different in the light" + final crack embodies visible cost. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening lines; causality flows cleanly from discovery through method to adjudication. One meaningful deepening (shard song → council revision) with felt cost at closure satisfies the lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid setting constrains excavation method and supplies the storm-mechanic that enables the shard's song. Visible time and covered mirrors function as micro-setting elements that charge the council scene and final image. Sensory detail—"gilt dust," "rubric-lit colonnades," "minutes rained"—is filtered through the poetic revolutionary's lens and integrated into action. The shard as recurring object alters tactics across three beats and participates in closure, satisfying the 9+ gate's constraint test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reimagine the civilization's nature) is signaled early and coheres through escalation: private discovery → public readings → formal adjudication. One meaningful tightening occurs when the council vote forces institutional recognition, foreclosing the narrator's solitary interpretation with visible cost ("my revolution remained defunct"). Agency is clear—devising ritual, summoning crowds, presenting evidence—and the storm-admission at council crystallizes pressure. Ledger's opposition applies sustained counter-pressure without requiring multiple reversals.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme (ornament as archive, labor as communal ledger vs. tyranny's signatures) emerges from the shard's breathing and ritual rather than assertion. The final image—"sorrow shone, burnished"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer: beauty and loss coexist without resolution. Subtext operates in the mirror-covering ritual and the covered guards' boots. The narrator's defunct revolution remains unredeemed, embracing moral complexity without false equivalence. Recurrence (mirrors, shard vibration, "we made") accumulates pressure and charges closure without mechanical motif-listing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: "poetically inclined," syntactic elevation matched to character. Diction remains voice-consistent ("exorcism masquerading as method," "clockwork grapes"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully—compressed at the shard-translation moment, reflective at the council. No head-hopping; knowledge stays character-bound. Rhythmic control heightens pressure in the adjudication scene without obscuring clarity. The piece teaches its ornate register early and sustains it under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance character, world, or pressure. Sentence rhythm varies effectively ("We stood...and the minutes rained"). No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Minor overwriting in metaphor density ("lacquer touched by flame," "clockwork grapes," "sleeping swans") clusters in the first third but does not obscure causality or dull closure. Figurative language is coherent within the baroque register. The final beat ("sorrow shone, burnished") is concise and propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—archaeological dispute + time-visibility + ritual sound-reading—is specific and non-obvious. The mirror-covering method transforms a childhood superstition into scholarly procedure with purpose-driven logic. The shard-as-breath-archive and storm-activated song are original inflections on artifact study. Risk-taking (ornate lyricism, ceremonial method) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. One friction: the "defunct revolutionary turned guide" frame echoes familiar redemption-via-scholarship arcs, though execution particularizes it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Present throughout; drives discovery, ritual design, public readings, and council presentation. Agency creates all key turns. Final choice (accepting defunct status while revising the archive) forecloses redemption with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setup (found fused in iron), development (translates breathing during storms, summons crowds), payoff (council demonstration + final crack embodies cost). Handled in four distinct beats; unique properties (storm-activated song) drive method and closure. Irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Frames stakes early (Ledger vs. narrator), shapes all tactics (readings, treatise, council adjudication), and closure adjudicates it. The dispute is dramatized through competing methods rather than abstract debate. Essential across beats.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Enables translation and treatise-writing ("sequence of poems"). Constrains method (poetic ritual vs. Ledger's graphs) with visible professional cost (mockery). Present in closure reflection but not causally active in final image; modest cap.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setup (childhood memory), development (excavation shrouding, public readings), payoff (council performance structures climax). The ritual redefines archaeological method and enables all subsequent moves. Removing it breaks escalation and closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Signaled early (childhood), mechanics matter (blinds reflections so shard strengthens), applied in three beats (gallery, public, council). Method shapes attempts and charges closure by enabling the shard's voice. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Supplies storm mechanic, excavation context, and council venue. The asteroid's "cornices" and "ruptured salons" provide tactile resources. Setting constrains method (need for storms) and charges closure ("time kept shining around the cornices"). Strong integration across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setup (opening line), development (minutes stream, years drizzle), payoff (final line "time kept shining"). The visible-time mechanic enables storm-reading and charges imagery throughout. Not a strict countdown but a pervasive constraint that alters perception and method.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drives every choice from shard-translation through public performance to council argument. Friction between personal failure and civilizational reinterpretation creates cost ("my revolution remained defunct"). Desire is dramatized in ritual design and confrontation, not merely stated.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Coherent from opening ("gilt dust") through closure ("sorrow shone, burnished"). Modulates with pressure—elegiac in reflection, sharpened at confrontation—without breaking register. Tone charges the final crack image and integrates the "defunct...but different" resolution. Pervasive and essential.</comment>
