<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The exiled tutor's interiority is concrete and embodied throughout—"faith is another kind of counting," the basalt stone as thumb-worn anchor. Internal contradiction surfaces when he frames stalemate as mercy yet faces judgment again, and the final surrender-as-song choice feels earned by prior causality. Minor slip: the girl's silence is more device than character with her own contradictory impulses, capping the score below 8.5.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds cleanly: density builds through chess-as-lexicon, silence-as-language, the stone fitting its hollow. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—"surrender done on purpose might be a kind of song"—with visible cost (acceptance of judgment, forfeiture of control). Orientation anchors by line 6 (exile, field, twilight). The tightening occurs when the stone clicks into place and the nexus hum resolves, reweighting all prior pressure. One meaningful deepening sufficient for this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The magnetic nexus constrains on-page choices: compass trembling, hum modulating with moves, the hollow's centuries-worn gloss. The basalt stone (micro-object-as-setting) charges the final image when it settles and the field quiets. Sensory detail is selective and stakes-driven—"orange hush," "chords like rain on slate." Spatial choreography is coherent (monoliths, flat slab, central stone). The setting supplies resources (riverbed stones as pieces) and pressures (tourist drones breaking stillness) that shape tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: "learn how difficult beauty survives." Pressure tightens when the stone must fit before moonrise and the nexus needs a pattern. Agency is renunciation and endurance—offering the king, teaching "quiet is not absence"—with visible cost (accepting possible re-exile). The escalation under Accumulative lens reads as density increase and cadence shift when the hum resolves into chords. One meaningful tightening sufficient; the ending forecloses paths (staying or leaving both involve teaching, not escaping).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: silence as move held back, stalemate as mercy, the eclipsed covenant's "shadowed side" revealed through play. The final image offers a resonant answer—"surrender done on purpose might be a kind of song"—reweighting prior material without thesis. The recurring motif (chess, silence, the hollow) constrains choices and charges closure. Subtext operates in gesture (tapping twice, breath-counting) and the unspoken negotiation between tutor and girl. No thematic echo or moralizing in the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout: "eyes thoughtfully precise, like someone counting rain by its absences," "faith is another kind of counting." Distance is stable third-limited; no head-hopping. Diction remains within the tutor's lexicon (chess terms, exile's register) with purposeful compression—"rests and rests," "hopeful melancholy I could hold." The girl's silence functions as voice without dialogue. Minor rhythm uniformity in mid-section (repeated "I would" constructions) prevents 8.5+ but does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High information density: most lines advance multiple jobs (character, stakes, atmosphere). Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings shift. Zero paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Figurative language is controlled and voice-motivated—"field lines sang," "promises do the same," "bishops on color." Minor deduction for slight template cadence in the penultimate paragraph (three consecutive "I would" + infinitive constructions, −0.3) and one filter-verb cluster mid-story ("I could read," "I felt"), but these do not touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of exile-as-teacher, chess-as-silence-translation, magnetic nexus as covenant site is specific and non-obvious. The premise transforms the tutor-student trope through the eclipsed covenant's "shadowed side" and the revelation that stillness requires teaching rests, not erasure. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure and silence-as-primary-language heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The final turn—surrender as song—feels inevitable in hindsight and grows from prior particulars. Elevating within-band for bold, coherent risk (+0.3).</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Exiled chess tutor: setup (line 4), development (correlating silences, offering defenses, moving stones), payoff (offering his king, planning to teach judgment). Choices create key turns: translating silence into board positions, sliding the stone into the hollow, deciding to stay and teach. Causal pressure across three beats. Closure linkage strong. Specificity high (chess knowledge shapes tactics). Cost visible (accepts judgment, foregoes control). Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.4, cost +0.5, irreplaceability +0.6 = high 7s.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Polished basalt worry stone dent: setup (line 5, "thumb worn"), development (line 24, "matched it, a perfect cradle"), payoff (line 26, "slid the stone into place," and line 40, "left the stone where it fit"). Handled in three distinct beats. Enables the key causal action (resolving the hum). Charges the final image (the hollow no longer begs). Highly irreplaceable (exact shape matters). Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.6, irreplaceability +0.8, cost +0.4 = high 8s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Eclipsed covenant: setup (line 11, "elders had sworn"), development (line 28, "showed its shadowed side"), payoff (line 29, "restore the eclipsed covenant...teach it rests"). Shapes stakes (nexus quiet, memory sheltered) and changes options (not hush the world, but teach rests). Present in ending choice. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.4 = mid-6s. The mechanics of "eclipse" remain slightly abstract, limiting irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Thoughtfully precise: setup (line 8, girl's eyes described), development (line 14, "traced a knight path...I understood her at once"), payoff (implicit in her timing and tapping that guides the resolution). Trait constrains action (enables the silent communication method). Visible on-page twice with tradeoff (precision allows understanding but also distance). Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.9, closure linkage +0.6, specificity +0.5 = low 7s. Slight abstraction (the trait could be "perceptive" with minor edits) limits score.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Correlate: setup (line 19, "I began to correlate the lengths of those pauses"), development (line 20, "translating silence, I could read the field"), payoff (implicit in the resolution when correlation yields the pattern the nexus needs). The action enables the major turn (understanding the field's needs). Present across two beats. Drives ending. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.2, irreplaceability +0.7 = low-to-mid 8s. Minor swappability (could be "interpret" or "decode") prevents higher score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>By translating silence: setup (line 15, "chess is the art of what goes unsaid"), development (line 18, "Each silence...spelled a letter," line 20, "By translating silence, I could read the field"), payoff (line 34, "Her silence translated to patience," and line 44, "translating silence into openings"). Method signaled early, used in three beats, shapes attempts and tactics. Mechanics matter (silence durations map to meanings). Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.1, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.6 = mid-7s. The method is integral but mechanics remain slightly impressionistic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Magnetic nexus at twilight: setup (line 1, "field lines sang...at twilight"), development (line 10, "valley once made compasses tremble," line 19, "shifting hum around us"), payoff (line 31, "hum softened on the long diagonals"). Setting pressures choices (nexus needs a pattern, field responds to moves) and supplies resources (the resonance, the hollow stone). Present in three beats. Constrains tactics (must work before moonrise). Early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.2, irreplaceability +0.7 = low 8s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Before the next phase: setup (none explicit early), development (line 32, "Before the next phase of moonrise, the field needed a pattern"), payoff (line 46, "Twilight finished its slow turn"). Time mentioned once mid-story, implied at end. Tightens decision window but not tracked on-page across beats. Late first appearance (past midpoint) −0.4, one beat +0.4, causal pressure +0.5, closure linkage +0.3 = mid-6s. The timeframe is present but not leveraged as a live ticking constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>To discover beauty in the difficult: setup (line 13, "I had come...to learn how difficult beauty survives"), development (line 22, "We were both trying to discover beauty...not by escaping but by staying"), payoff (line 40, "surrender done on purpose might be a kind of song"). Desire dramatized in choices (staying, offering the king, teaching rather than fleeing). Friction between want (understanding) and cost (judgment, endurance). Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.4, cost +0.5, specificity +0.6 = high 7s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Hopeful melancholy: setup (line 1, "twilight," line 6, "orange hush"), sustained (line 33, "nexus listened, or I let myself believe," line 37, "mercy, a draw instead of blood"), payoff (line 47, "hopeful melancholy I could hold"). Tone coherent across beats, modulates with pressure (quiets when hum resolves), charges the final image. Present throughout, controls rhythm. Early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +0.9, closure linkage +1.7, irreplaceability +0.8 = mid-to-high 8s. The exact phrase appears in the final line, which could read as slight over-articulation, but the emotional texture has been built throughout.</comment>
