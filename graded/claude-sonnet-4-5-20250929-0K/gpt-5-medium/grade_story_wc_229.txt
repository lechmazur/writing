<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is vivid and voice-specific ("the ear he keeps behind his ribs"), with embodied moments like pressing the cork to the lips. However, the mentor's sudden shift from sleep to witness ("only closes his eyes") feels unmotivated—no prior beat earns his receptivity. The protagonist's philosophy-driven choices (whisper over shout) remain consistent but lack genuine internal contradiction or doubt that would force a costly trade-off.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with Situational pressure. Orientation anchors clearly (cobalt lighthouse, dawn, assistant keeper) by the opening lines. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the freighter captain's salute and the mentor's silent acknowledgment crystallize the narrator's stance, reweighting "screaming tenderness" with felt cost (vulnerability, the mentor's exhausted concession). One meaningful deepening occurs when the scent-beckoning succeeds and the mentor witnesses the hum. Cost is legible in the mentor's muttered concession and the narrator's sustained vulnerability.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lighthouse gallery (rails, lantern glass, dew) and the vial cork as micro-setting anchor sensory detail throughout. The cork's warmth, the scent walking into wind, and the freighter's proximity create spatial choreography that constrains the narrator's beckoning method. The "seam of calm" pointing like a finger charges the final image by making the whisper's effect visible. Salt, iron, gulls, and petals steeped in rainwater filter through the narrator's sensory priorities without catalog sprawl.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: prove whispers reach farther than shouts, tested when the freighter approaches. The narrator's choice to beckon by scent rather than horn tightens options and the freighter's muffled passage confirms success. Escalation deepens when the mentor stops mid-stair, witnessing the hum—his concession ("the right kind of listening is work") exacts a relational cost. One meaningful turn (the captain's salute) validates the narrator's method with visible consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme (tenderness as force, whisper as map) emerges through the vial cork ritual, the beekeeper's trumpet method, and the final hum without overt thesis. The ending image—mentor and narrator polishing the lantern, "small, patient, and possible"—offers a non-literal answer to whether whispers travel. "Screaming tenderness" operates as subtext throughout (the horn "muffled by humility," the mentor's closed eyes) and the perfume's quiet exit charges the theme with earned cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single-POV first-person is stable; perceptual signature is distinct (vibrations that "skitter," molecules that "lean"). Diction remains voice-specific ("rumor of storms," "prayer wheel for sailors") with strong rhythmic control. The cork-to-lips gesture and the hum's map-refusal ("a map I refuse to draw") anchor interiority without filter-verb stacks. Psychic distance tightens during the beckoning ("I open my throat and let forgiveness borrow my tongue") and the mentor's arrival without slipping into his interior.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high but mostly coherent ("the sea is a crowded city," "gratitude needs a crossing guard"). However, several lines paraphrase without advancing pressure: "Then I can tune my voice" after "my breath steadies" and "I will answer not with thunder, but with a gentle map of breath" echoes earlier phrasing. Template cadence appears in the repeated "I [verb]" stems across multiple paragraphs. Minor synonym churn ("whisper" vs. "hum" vs. "beckon") is functional, but cumulative loops dull momentum in the middle third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse-as-proving-ground for whisper-over-shout is fresh, and the scent-beckoning method (learned from a beekeeper's trumpet swarms) synthesizes particulars well. The vial cork as anchor and the "screaming tenderness" oxymoron elevate the frame. However, the mentor's sudden witness feels too smooth—his conversion lacks friction or a credible prior resistance beat that the story would need to dismantle. The freighter captain's salute hinges on a single unsent letter; more groundwork would sharpen inevitability.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Assistant lighthouse keeper: present from the opening, makes the key choice to beckon by scent (not horn), and receives confirmation via the freighter's salute and the mentor's concession. The role shapes tactics (lighthouse as vantage, authority to light the wick) and the ending turn (polishing the lantern together). Two beats: beckoning and witnessing.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Vial cork: introduced early ("tiny vial cork on a string inside my shirt"), handled in the breathing ritual, pinched between teeth during the hum, pressed to lips at the mentor's arrival, and tucked back at closure. Returns in the final image ("I tuck the vial cork back into my shirt and feel how it steadies my ribs"). Three beats with evolving use; charges the ending.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Vibrations of intent: named early ("vibrations of intent that skitter along cables and water") and operationalized when the narrator tunes voice and hums. Shapes the beckoning tactic but remains partly metaphorical—no visible constraint or test until the freighter responds. Present in two beats (teaching, beckoning) but does not drive a turn on its own.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Purifies intentions: stated early ("purifies intentions the way lighthouses purify corners of night") and linked to the breathing ritual. However, the purification is told, not dramatized—no on-page moment shows a messy intention being clarified or a cost paid for purity. Functional but swappable with "steadies" or "focuses."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Beckon: central action. The narrator beckons the freighter by scent and hum, the freighter responds by leaning to the seam, and the mentor witnesses. Drives two beats (beckoning, salute) and defines the ending turn. Specific means (scent, hum) make it less swappable than a generic "call" or "signal."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>By the scent of a garden at night: method introduced mid-story ("I will beckon by the scent of a garden at night"), sourced from the beekeeper, prepared on-page (petals steeped in rainwater), and deployed during the hum. Shapes the beckoning beat and charges the freighter's response. Present in setup and payoff; middle development is the steeping.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cobalt lighthouse at dawn: anchors orientation in the opening line, supplies the gallery rails and lantern as props, and returns in the final polishing image ("We polish the lantern together, and the world appears inside it"). The lighthouse's height enables the beckoning and the sill holds the vial. Three beats; spatial logic constrains action.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>After the heat wave breaks: mentioned in the opening and closing paragraphs ("after the heat wave breaks, days are like this"). Supplies atmospheric tone ("air feels rinsed") but does not tighten a choice or create urgency. The timeframe is static backdrop rather than pressure; easily swappable with "after the storm" or "at season's turn."</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>To prove that whispers travel farther than shouts: stated explicitly in the opening third ("I am here to prove that whispers travel farther than shouts") and tested throughout. The narrator's choices (breathing through cork, humming, scent-beckoning) all serve this motive, and the freighter's salute and mentor's concession provide on-page validation. Drives three beats; cost is vulnerability and the mentor's grudging acknowledgment.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Screaming tenderness: phrase appears late but the tone is present throughout (the narrator's "gentle map of breath," the freighter's "horn muffled by humility," the mentor stopping because "the whole room hums with screaming tenderness"). Modulates with pressure—quiet in the beckoning, audible when the mentor witnesses. Charges the final image (harbor bells in a water-key, dogs howling in checked harmonies).</comment>
