<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator and Mara exhibit interiority and embodied emotion through sensory processing and somatic signaling, but the emotional arc stays largely within a single register of gentle melancholy. Mara's journey from skepticism to softened acceptance shows genuine progression, yet the brotherly morphine fragment and the father's map feel more like narrative furniture than fully embodied stakes—the on-page micro-choices don't compellingly test conflicting impulses. The final embrace is earned by the accumulation of ritual, but the lack of one raw, contradictory moment under pressure keeps this from high-band territory.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure arrives as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the pair completes the ritual, leaves the sliver "gladly set aside," and embodies a method of return "not by force but by kindness." The cost is legible—relief rather than erasure, acceptance rather than reversal—and the drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (pattern layering toward a cadence shift). Orientation anchors early (studio, after shock, two figures) and the lens holds through the ending. Subtracting minor non-closure points: the middle beats loop certain images without adding decisive pressure, and the phrase "devised a way to return" in the final paragraph leans toward summary rather than a final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The studio, geode sliver, and fiber wand function as active constraints: the sliver seeds the camera exposure, the wand shapes the light paths, and the rig's static shock forces recalibration. Sensory detail is specific and filtered through the narrator's attentive perception ("minnows against glass," "mica flashed like layered pages"). Spatial choreography remains coherent, though the piece leans heavily on metaphorical texture ("willowglass hope," "fractally precise veins") that sometimes threatens to float free of concrete referents. The geode's final placement on the sill charges the closure image, elevating the category into the 7+ band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—using the pill regimen and light-painting apparatus to access painful memory without flinching—is signaled early and accumulates through taps, breath-counts, and the arcing static. The piece delivers one meaningful deepening: Mara moves from brittle resistance to the cobalt flash that lets her hold her brother's word "like a bird landing in a pocket." The method doesn't narrow options so much as it reweights the emotional cost of remembering, fitting an Accumulative lens. Agency is present but quiet—endurance and attention rather than dramatic confrontation—and the price (no longer burning) is felt rather than forfeited in a decisive trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly from particulars: memory as a topology with "switchbacks and stubborn cul-de-sacs," kindness as method, method as cure. The final image—printed exposure traced as topography "when it forgave a field"—answers the central question without moralizing. The geode, wand, and somatic grammar cohere into a non-literal system for placing lanterns near stairs. Minor deduction: the penultimate paragraph ("the trick is kindness…the method is the cure") edges toward explicit articulation, though it stays within the narrator's voice and doesn't collapse into prompt-speak.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>First-person singular POV remains stable, with a distinct perceptual signature (lyric compression, science-inflected metaphor, attentive sensory layering). Psychic distance is consistent, and the narrator's interior diction ("affectionate skeptic," "somatic markers," "willowglass hope") feels voice-motivated rather than generic. Two weaknesses lower the score: recurring sentence templates ("We X, and Y") across adjacent beats create rhythmic monotony, and the prose occasionally drifts into elevated register ("topology," "willowglass," "morphine") that feels slightly authorial rather than crisis-filtered. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not engaged.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Line-level craft shows strong figurative control ("minnows against glass," "color settled into cobalt," "bird landing in a pocket") and high information density in many beats. However, pervasive figurative language without pattern-teaching (nearly every sentence carries metaphor or elevated diction) triggers the overwriting density check (−0.5). Template cadence runs appear: "We X…," "Mara Y…," "The Z…" across consecutive lines, plus paraphrase loops ("the pill did not deliver messages; it tuned our awareness" adjacent to "somatic markers we made a grammar") (−0.6 cumulative). A few filter-verb stacks ("asked me to devise," "wanted her brother's last words") dull immediacy under pressure (−0.3). Total artifact debt: approximately −1.4, with some appearing in the final third, which disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of telepathy-pill ritual, light-painting apparatus, and grief-mapping via somatic grammar is non-obvious and feels earned in hindsight. The "willowglass hope" coinage, fractally precise segmentation, and geode-as-seed mechanics add specificity that lifts the piece above template territory. However, the risk remains moderate: the emotional arc (skeptic softens, memory stops burning) follows a familiar healing-ritual contour, and the final image, while resonant, doesn't subvert or reframe the premise in a bold way. Transformation is present but measured, warranting solid mid-7s.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara is signaled early as "affectionate skeptic," appears in multiple beats (sleeve brush, wand composition, forehead press), and her doubt-to-softening arc shapes the middle and ending. She raises the wand, asks for the sketch, and moves through the cobalt flash that lets her hold her brother's word. However, her choices remain cooperative rather than decisive: the narrator drives the conceptual framing, and Mara's agency reads as participation rather than a turn that redefines options. Present across setup, development, and payoff, with causal involvement in one key beat (the geode flash) but not indispensable to story logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The muscovite geode sliver is introduced early ("cupped…under the train trestle"), returns in the middle ("acted as a seed, reflecting scattered wavelengths"), and charges the closure ("moved the wand across the geode, its mica flashed," then "left…on the sill…work done"). It enables the camera to gather light into "patient shapes" and triggers Mara's cobalt memory-flash. Three distinct beats with causal pressure and closure linkage; swapping for a generic crystal would require rewriting the mica-flash and sill-image beats. Cost connection is implicit (work exhausted, gladly set aside). Strong integration, shy of indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The telepathy pill recall is named early, explained as tuning awareness to existing cues, and frames the somatic-marker method. It appears in three beats (initial mention, the "tuned our awareness" line, and the implicit backdrop to the taps and breath-counts). However, the pill itself never constrains a choice or imposes a visible cost—characters could perform the same ritual without it by simply calling it "focused attention." The concept shapes tone and idiom but not tactics, landing it in the lyric-resonance / two-gate band: setup and payoff present, middle development weak.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Fractally precise" appears twice: rain veins and evening segments. The segmentation claim ("each pass of the wand aligned with a breath and a count") suggests the attribute enables structured ritual, but no on-page moment shows a cost or tradeoff tied to fractal precision—characters could perform the same actions with "careful" or "methodical" segmentation. The trait reads as atmospheric descriptor rather than functional constraint. Introduced early, present in one middle beat, absent from closure participation. Caps at 4.6 for missing closure gate and swappability.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Devise" is the action requested by Mara ("asked me to devise a sketch of our signals") and fulfilled in the middle ("devised a way to return") and ending. The sketch structures the evening's passes, and the final "devised a way" frames the closure achievement. However, the devising itself is summarized rather than dramatized—no on-page moment shows the narrator drawing, testing, or revising the sketch under pressure. Present in setup (request), development (implicit execution), and payoff (summary), with moderate causal linkage but low specificity. Swappable with "create" or "design" without major edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Somatic markers are named, explained ("two taps for yes, a long exhale for sorrow, a hum for proceed"), and used across multiple beats: taps after the shock, breath-counts to steady, and the final "taps came steady" when Mara holds her brother's word. The method shapes attempts, structures the ritual, and participates in closure (the steady taps signal success). Three distinct beats with causal pressure and closure linkage. Specificity is high—the grammar is taught and used—though the method's cost (misread rhythm tightens chest) is noted but not dramatized with consequence.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The light painting studio is anchored early, houses the rig and camera, and supplies the fiber wand and geode workspace. The static shock from the floor rig forces recalibration, and the studio's "willowglass hope in its rafters" charges the final image. However, the studio doesn't meaningfully constrain tactics—the ritual could occur in any controlled space with similar props. Present in setup, one middle beat (the shock), and payoff (the rafters line), with mild causal pressure. Trades on atmosphere more than micro-setting constraint, landing mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"After the static shock" frames the entire narrative window and anchors the opening line. The shock is referenced again in the middle ("That was when the arcs leapt…After the static shock, we laughed thinly") as a reset moment. However, time is not tracked or tightened thereafter—no clock, duration, or deadline alters tactics. The timeframe provides a clear starting anchor but doesn't escalate or constrain choices. Setup gate satisfied, development weak, payoff absent. Lyric-resonance path not taken (no return to "after" in the ending). Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to illuminate hidden pathways" is stated early ("We were here to illuminate…") and unpacked into personal stakes: Mara's brother's words, the narrator's father's map. The final lines return to it ("devised a way to return to what matters"). However, the motivation is primarily told rather than shown in conflicting micro-choices—the ritual proceeds cooperatively without friction between desire and cost. Present in setup, implicit in middle (the paths "unspool"), and restated at payoff, but the lack of on-page want-versus-fear tension or visible sacrifice keeps it in the mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Willowglass hope" is introduced early (Mara's claim about the air), returns in the ending ("The studio kept a willowglass hope in its rafters"), and modulates subtly: from delicate possibility to "brittle brightness tempered by…restraint." The tone remains coherent through the static shock and memory-flash beats, bending without breaking. The final reprise reweights the opening claim with earned cost (restraint, work done). Lyric-resonance path with clear setup and payoff, though the tone doesn't shift dramatically under peak pressure—it stays in a single register of gentle, careful optimism. Strong two-gate performance.</comment>
