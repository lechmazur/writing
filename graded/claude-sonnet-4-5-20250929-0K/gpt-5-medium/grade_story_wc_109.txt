<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The oracle's interiority is embodied through concrete actions—touching stone, noting silences—and her motivation to map silence remains consistent. The courier's arc from fear to understanding is earned through witnessing her method, with his decision to preserve the scroll creating visible internal conflict. However, the oracle's mild obsession is asserted more than dramatized through contradictory impulses, and her bleeding fingers near the end feel more symbolic than psychologically necessary.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece anchors who/where/when by ~80 words (oracle, ridge fort, single star). Closure arrives as Charged Poise—the oracle stays to finish the map while the courier departs, crystallizing their divergent paths with felt cost (her isolation, his burden). The decision reweights prior material: the map becomes both instrument and testament. One meaningful deepening occurs when the courier admits his mission to burn records, raising stakes and narrowing options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The storm-tossed fort constrains choice—wind forces the courier to hold the lantern away, rain bruises the gold leaf, wet stone becomes canvas. Sensory detail is filtered through the oracle's attunement to pauses: surf mistrust, gull's non-breath, wind's mending. The booklet and bleeding fingers function as micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear across moves (ridge, battlement, merlons, path).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: the oracle's mission to map silence for travelers, braided with the courier's search for absolution. Pressure tightens when he reveals his order to burn records but kept one scroll—a reversal that narrows his options and forces the oracle to reframe his mission. The map's fragility (flaking gold, rain, potential star-death) creates cost. Agency appears in the oracle's decision to stay and the courier's choice to carry the booklet, each forecloses a path with on-page consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the oracle's cartography of absence—pauses, lacunae, distances—offering travelers "lines they can breathe along" rather than defeating night. The courier's shift from fear to understanding is earned through witnessing silence mapped. The final image of teaching the star her "cartography of pauses" resists moralizing and reweights the premise without stating a thesis. However, some phrasing ("reasons are sensations in costumes") edges toward abstract philosophizing that slightly dilutes earned resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable in tight third through the oracle's perceptual signature: she notices "the breath a gull does not take, the thought a blade spares." Diction is controlled and purposeful ("marbled hush pouring through the merlons"), with compression that serves the accumulative design. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven, the oracle's low voice contrasting with the courier's initial dismissiveness. Psychic distance modulates intentionally, tightening during the teaching moment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense and often purposeful ("gold leaf bruising under rain like ripened fruit," "sea graduates into a gentler noise"), but several adjacent sentences restate concepts without added pressure: "Night speaks in lacunae" followed immediately by oracle learning "to retell its migrations...with contours." Template cadence appears in runs: "the cliff's hush, the lantern's doubt, the rain's skipped heartbeats" lists accumulate without syntactic variation. Stock phrasing ("older than tides," "lighter than surrender") dulls two peak beats. Information density is high overall, but paraphrase loops in the middle third apply −0.6 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise—an oracle who maps silence rather than sound—offers a fresh angle on cartography and prophecy. The method of "summarizing silence" and noting gaps as coordinates transforms the oracle archetype through specific, embodied work. The courier's shift from destroyer to carrier feels earned in hindsight. However, the framework (mystic teacher enlightens doubting messenger) follows a recognizable template, and several images ("tired moons," "patient teacher") feel familiar without full transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The pebble-shore oracle's choices drive key turns: she opens the booklet, teaches the courier, scratches the map into stone, gives him the booklet, and chooses to stay. Her decisions alter tactics (writing on stone when gold flakes) and shape closure (staying to finish the map). She appears in every major beat and her final stance crystallizes the story's stakes.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The flaking gold leaf booklet appears in opening (pried open), middle (gold smearing/cracking/shining, drinking gaps), and closure (given to courier). Its fragility creates cost and urgency, driving the oracle to inscribe stone as backup. The booklet's state evolves under rain, its mechanics (gold bruising, spine as horizon) matter to the map's survival, and it becomes the courier's instrument.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Ambered hush" appears once early ("towers hum with an ambered hush as if bees slept inside stone") as atmosphere but does not recur or shape tactics. The broader concept of hush/silence drives the oracle's method and stakes, but the specific "ambered" quality remains decorative. It echoes theme without constraining choice or reappearing at closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Mildly obsessed with quiet that can be written" is stated in line two but never costs the oracle anything on the page. Her behavior (mapping silence, staying alone) aligns with obsession, but no moment shows her choosing this obsession over a competing need. The trait labels rather than constrains.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Retell" structures the oracle's core action: she retells silence, the world without noise, migrations of night. The courier will "retell" via the booklet, and the method ("retell the world without the world's noise") defines both her teaching and his mission. Major turns trace to this action—his understanding, her stone-carving, the map's transmission. Swapping for "record" or "transcribe" would lose the oral/mythic dimension.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"By summarizing silence" is signaled early ("works, by summarizing silence") and its mechanics matter: she notes gaps, lengths between crashes, the breath not taken. The method shapes her teaching moment and differentiates her cartography from conventional mapping. It appears in the middle when she "draws them until her hand becomes calm weather" and underpins closure, though the exact phrase does not return at the end.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The storm-tossed ridge fort supplies resources (wet stone for inscription, merlons as sounding chamber, broken battlement as shelter) and pressures choices (wind forces lantern repositioning, storm threatens the booklet). Its height and isolation charge the oracle's decision to stay. The fort "answers...in distances" and "grows taller by not falling," actively shaping the final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"When only one star remains" frames opening and closure, creating urgency ("may die before dawn") and a coordinate for measurement. The dimming sky tightens the oracle's timeline and the star's steadying marks a shift in pressure. However, elapsed time within the scene is vague, and the timeframe functions more as atmospheric anchor than live clock altering tactics beat-by-beat.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"To draw a map of an endless night" is stated near the end ("remembers why she climbed") but motivates all prior action: opening the booklet, teaching the courier, inscribing stone. Friction appears between the map's fragility and its purpose, between the night's endlessness and her mortal effort. Her choice to stay and finish despite the star's possible death dramatizes cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Marbled hush" appears once explicitly ("marbled hush pouring through the merlons") but the tone of layered, textured quiet pervades: ambered hush, distances, pauses, silence as substance. Tone modulates with pressure—opening storm urgency, teaching calm, closure's patient resolve—and charges the final image of the oracle teaching the star. Coherence holds across turns without flattening into uniform mood.</comment>
