<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The tide dancer protagonist has a clear professional identity and exile motivation, with embodied interiority ("my body remembered, even here, how a pivot on wet stone makes meaning"). However, the cartographer remains passive throughout—a vessel for the procedure rather than a character who makes choices under pressure. The protagonist's arc from exile to "vocation" is asserted rather than dramatized through a meaningful renunciation or trade-off with visible cost. Interiority leans heavily on metaphor-dense reflection without concrete micro-choices that test competing impulses in the peak tattooing beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes who/where/when within the opening lines and maintains spatial coherence in the garden scene. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the tattooing ritual densifies through poetic layering and the final image ("obsidian grace that could pass for ordinary until the next shoulder asked to sing") reconfigures the exile stake into a covert vocation with conceptual cost (living under surveillance, carrying contraband memory). The cost is felt but oblique—the price of continued exile and risk is implied rather than shown in a concrete forfeiture. One meaningful deepening occurs when the verse completes and the protagonist reframes exile as calling, satisfying the length requirement.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The twilight garden is anchored early with sensory specificity ("lantern gnats," "round basin," "leaf and star") and the basin's reflected moon becomes a charged recurring object. The moonstone dust speck functions as micro-setting, constraining the tattooing method and charging the final image when tucked away with "soft gravity." The garden's rules—"scent and shadow keep no registries"—directly enable the clandestine act and pressure the protagonist's choice to remain and operate covertly. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the single-location scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—to preserve memory through clandestine art under a nostalgia ban—is signaled in the opening and sustained. Pressure tightens when the verse completes and the protagonist decides to stay and continue the practice ("elective exile becomes a home when the craft teaches you where to stand"), a stance crystallization with conceptual cost (ongoing risk, self-imposed constraints). The cartographer's request ("Your departures, my returns, the distance that teaches our shores to speak") provides thematic deepening but not a dramatic reversal. The final image of walking the coast as "clandestine barometer" forecloses the option of safe anonymity, meeting the modest escalation requirement for this length under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the premise: memory as embodied resistance, art as covert transmission, and exile reframed as vocation. The moonstone and tattooing recur with shifting weight—tool, seed, finally a portable gravity. The ending resists moralizing: "a harbor of a shoulder, and a compass of a breath" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of how memory survives prohibition. The piece leans into quiet Conceptual Repricing—the final image of "obsidian grace that could pass for ordinary" reweights the exile premise without stating a thesis. Minor slip: "the garden is old and remembers only through new bodies" edges toward overt thematic statement but remains integrated in the ritual's logic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a consistent lyric register and perceptual signature rooted in dance and tidal rhythms ("pivot on wet stone makes meaning," "spontaneously anchored"). Distance remains controlled; no head-hopping. However, register drifts into elevated abstraction during the ritual ("the space grew eloquent enough to speak its connective desire") that strains the narrator's established idiom. Dialogue is minimal and functional, with the cartographer's single reply carrying thematic freight. The prose rhythm modulates appropriately—longer, image-dense sentences during the tattooing, shorter cadences at the resolve—but the density approaches overwriting in several beats without clear pattern-teaching.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The prose is rhythmically controlled with varied sentence structures and vivid sensory anchors ("pale as low tide sand, trembling like a string before a bow draws breath"). However, figurative language saturates most sentences in the tattooing sequence without respite, creating density that slows momentum: "obsidian grace," "the basin held a moon that chose not to rise," "the instrument an oath that would harmonize anyone who read it aloud." Several lines loop conceptually—paragraphs 19–20 restate the completion of the verse in slightly varied metaphor. The final third carries multiple template stems ("I would…") and the closing paragraph recycles "enough for" three times. Minor pronoun ambiguity when "their" could refer to either the cartographer or the city in context. These artifacts accumulate to −0.8 under the patterned-artifact pack, and the high figurative density in peak beats adds −0.4 for overwriting, totaling −1.2 within Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—tattooing as memory smuggling under an authoritarian nostalgia ban—offers a fresh synthesis of body art, political resistance, and lyric exile narrative. The tide-dancer-as-tattoo-artist combination feels specific and earned. However, the core emotional arc (exile finding purpose through covert craft) follows a familiar template, and the piece does not transform it through surprising moral calculus or a non-obvious turn. The cartographer's passivity and the lack of a dramatized complication limit narrative ingenuity. The lyric density and metaphoric texture provide stylistic distinction but risk self-similarity across beats. Within-band: the committed voice and the moonstone-as-nib detail prevent a lower score, but the arc's predictability and the cartographer's function as recipient rather than agent cap the upper range.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The tide dancer frames the opening, teaches the "by observing gaps" method mid-scene, performs the tattooing ritual, and makes the closure decision to stay and continue covert practice. Present in setup, development (observing gaps as tattooing logic), and payoff (final stance). However, key "choices" are procedural or reflective rather than dilemma-driven—no moment where the dancer faces a live trade-off with visible cost during the ritual. The character drives the arc but through execution of a pre-set plan rather than adaptive agency under new pressure. +0.3 early signal, +0.9 two beats (method demonstration, closure walk), +0.5 causal (enables ritual), +0.7 closure linkage, −0.5 limited in-scene choice friction. Band guidance suggests ~5.5–6.5; rounds to 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The moonstone cabochon dust speck is unwrapped and shown mid-scene ("no larger than a comma, yet heavy with lunar habits"), used as the tattooing instrument across the ritual ("each prick a star"), and tucked away at the end with "soft gravity" as a charged object the protagonist will carry forward. Present in setup (introduced paragraph 15), development (active use in tattooing), and payoff (tucked away with symbolic weight). Its "lunar habits" and "heavy with centuries" specificity make it less swappable than a generic tool. +0.3 early, +0.9 two beats (reveal and tattooing use), +0.8 causal (enables the verse inscription), +0.7 closure (carried forward), +0.5 specificity (moonstone properties matter to the metaphor), −0.3 no visible trade-off or cost tied uniquely to this object's limits. Band ~6.5–7.0; rounds to 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elective exile is named in the opening line, drives the protagonist's presence in the garden (choosing covert practice over sanctioned amnesia), and is reframed at closure as vocation when the dancer decides to stay and continue clandestine work. The concept shapes the dominant stake throughout—how to preserve memory while living under prohibition. Present in setup (opening), development (explains why the ritual is covert and risky), and payoff (exile-as-calling reconfiguration). The closure turn directly reprices exile from loss to chosen calling. +0.8 early, +1.4 three beats (opening frame, ritual stakes, closure repricing), +1.2 causal (narrows options to covert action), +1.4 closure (the final image hinges on this reframe), +0.6 cost (ongoing surveillance risk), −0.2 slightly abstract at moments. Band ~7.0–7.5; rounds to 7.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Spontaneously anchored" appears twice—once as metaphor for dance stance ("not to law or anchor chain, but to the brief permission between crest and crash") and again in the final third ("spin in the surf with spontaneously anchored feet"). The trait is labeled and thematically linked to the protagonist's method, but it does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with visible cost during the tattooing scene or closure. Present in setup (paragraph 13) and payoff (final paragraph echo), missing clear development beat. +0.3 early, +0.4 one beat (closure echo), −0.5 ornamental (no choice altered by this trait's presence or absence), −0.6 swappable (near-synonym "rooted in flux" would work). Band ~3.8–4.6; rounds to 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Fledge" is used twice: "we would fledge together tonight" (paragraph 9, framing the ritual as mutual transformation) and "letting fellow exiles fledge toward their own skies" (paragraph 27, describing future practice). The term sets a tonal stake and reappears at closure to generalize the mission, but the ritual itself is described as tattooing and verse-penning—"fledge" functions as metaphor rather than distinct action. Present in setup and payoff, absent as a discrete development beat. +0.3 early, +0.4 one beat (closure reprise), +0.5 closure linkage, −0.7 swappable (could substitute "transform" or "awaken" without altering beats), −0.4 metaphor-only, no mechanical specificity. Band ~4.8–5.8; rounds to 5.4.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"By observing gaps" is named in the teaching moment (paragraph 10: "to compose, I began by observing gaps, the spaces between lantern gnats, between leaf and star, between pulse and silence") and applied during the tattooing (paragraph 20: "Between those lights the line appeared… because the space grew eloquent"). The method shapes the protagonist's approach and is echoed at closure ("observing gaps along the waking shore"). Present in setup (paragraph 10), development (tattooing logic), and payoff (coast patrol). +0.8 early, +0.9 two beats (teaching, tattooing), +0.8 causal (determines how the verse is composed), +0.7 closure (future practice hinted), −0.5 the gaps themselves do not impose a visible constraint or cost; the method is poetic logic rather than tactical friction. Band ~6.0–6.5; rounds to 6.1.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The twilight garden is introduced in paragraph 4, anchors the entire ritual scene, and its rule—"scent and shadow keep no registries and petals hear vows without reporting them"—directly enables the covert act. The basin's reflected moon and the garden's "hush that felt like tide slack" charge the closure beat. Present in setup, development (provides safety and atmosphere), and payoff (the garden "accepted our offering"). The setting's no-registry property constrains the choice to work there rather than elsewhere. +0.8 early, +0.9 two beats (ritual frame, closure acceptance), +1.2 causal (enables covert action), +1.0 closure (the garden's listening charges the final lines), +0.5 specificity (garden rules matter), +0.3 cost (must work in secret, limited access). Band ~7.0–7.8; rounds to 7.3.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"After the nostalgia ban" frames the opening and explains the stakes (memory is contraband), but the timeframe does not tighten decisions within the garden scene—no live clock, no patrol approaching, no dawn deadline. The ban is a background condition rather than an active temporal pressure. Present in setup (opening) and implied at payoff (future risk), missing clear development beat where time narrows options. +0.8 early signal, +0.4 one beat (opening context), +0.5 causal (explains why covert), −0.6 no on-page time constraint altering tactics, −0.5 static rather than dynamic. Band ~5.5–6.3; rounds to 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The desire "to pen a cosmic verse on mortal skin" is stated in paragraph 6, drives the entire tattooing ritual, and is fulfilled at closure when the verse completes and the protagonist vows to continue the practice. The motivation is dramatized through preparation (unwrapping the moonstone, consulting the cartographer) and action (the tattooing beats). Friction appears when the protagonist acknowledges the risk and the need for discretion. Present in setup, development (the ritual), and payoff (ongoing commitment). +0.8 early, +1.4 three beats (stated goal, ritual execution, closure vow), +1.2 causal (drives all middle action), +1.2 closure (mission continues), +0.4 specificity (verse on skin, not generic art), +0.3 cost (ongoing surveillance risk), −0.3 no competing desire tested in scene. Band ~7.5–8.2; rounds to 7.8.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Obsidian grace" appears in paragraph 23 ("obsidian grace filled my arms") and the closing line ("bearing obsidian grace that could pass for ordinary"). The phrase establishes a tonal signature—dark elegance, hidden weight—and the final reprise charges the image of covert practice. Tone is lyric-dense and consistent across the piece, modulating slightly during the ritual's completion. Present in development (mid-ritual) and payoff (closure image), missing explicit setup. +0.4 one beat (closure), +0.9 closure linkage strong, +0.5 specificity (obsidian connotes opacity and gravity), −0.4 late first appearance (paragraph 23 is past midpoint), −0.3 tonal consistency is high but static—no modulation under pressure. Band ~6.3–7.0; rounds to 6.6.</comment>
