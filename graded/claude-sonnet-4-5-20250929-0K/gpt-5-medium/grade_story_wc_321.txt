<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The deckhand protagonist demonstrates clear motivation (yearning for permanence amid transience) and makes active choices in the grotto—aligning patterns with the broom, instructing the helmsman, choosing which threshold to cross. Internal contradiction appears when the voice says "you are tired of losing arrivals" and the protagonist whispers yes, embodying the want/need tension. However, the character's transformation relies heavily on symbolic action rather than dramatized emotional cost; the final state feels more asserted than earned through visible struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. The piece establishes a coherent pattern (vanishing ferry, fluid reality, recurring motifs) taught early and held through closure. Orientation anchors arrive within the first ~100 words (deckhand, ferry, dawn departures). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the ferry steadies, the pier becomes permanent, arrivals no longer vanish—with felt cost in the line "breath steadies after grief learns its rhythm." The cost is present but relies on metaphor; a more concrete forfeiture or visible price would strengthen the effect.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The spectral grotto functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: the ceiling drips letters, the mirrored stars enable the lattice-alignment method, and the cold seam triggers the hourglass flip. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful ("water lay still as varnish," "frost in the shape of timetables"), filtered through the deckhand's peculiar perception. The grotto directly charges the closure by housing the threshold choice. Spatial choreography remains clear despite the surreal elements.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (achieving reliable arrival) is signaled early and tightens when the radio voice offers the merge method. The protagonist's agency drives the key turn: tracing patterns with the broom, instructing the helmsman, choosing the tide-door over the no-tide option. The cost is legible—"promises mean little without their undertow"—but the escalation relies more on atmospheric accumulation than on a dramatic narrowing of options or visible trade-off. One meaningful deepening occurs; a second pressure point would lift this higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme (the necessity of impermanence within commitment, the value of undertow in promises) emerges through concrete images: the hourglass that counts nothing then fills with starlight, the frost-timetables, the choice of the tide-door. The final image—"sweeping dew where each footprint finally agreed to stay"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without stating a moral. The radio-voice wisdom ("permanent in its transience, or transient in its permanence") borders on overt articulation but is integrated into scene pressure rather than delivered as thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and lyric, with consistent perceptual signature ("clocks run sideways," "calendars renegotiating days"). POV distance remains stable; the piece teaches its patterned compression early and sustains it. Diction stays within the focalizer's idiosyncratic lexicon. Minor slips: "You want to merge parallel timelines" shifts briefly into second-person address without clear dramatized justification, and some metaphors stack densely in the grotto passage without clear propulsion. Overall, rhythmic control under pressure is strong.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. However, several passages show decorative layering without clear advancement: "Sound bent, and the radio broadcast silence shaped like doors" is vivid but borders on ornamental; "ash colored like dawn before the alarm" stacks metaphor without tightening pressure. Minor paraphrase loop: "We emerged... into morning that still looked nocturnal, which felt honest" restates mood rather than adding information. Information density is generally high, but peak beats (the grotto sequence) could be leaner. No major clarity breaks, but texture occasionally substitutes for propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of unreliable-ferry premise with spectral-grotto negotiation and the lattice-pattern method feels specific and non-obvious. The voice and world logic cohere into a singular vision. Risk-taking (lyric compression, surreal causality) heightens stakes without obscuring the core choice. However, the radio-as-oracle and the hourglass-that-fills-with-magic trend toward familiar symbolic convenience; the piece elevates them through specificity but does not fully transform the tropes. The ending's quiet resonance is earned, not derivative.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setup: present from the opening. Development: makes key choices (aligning patterns, instructing helmsman, choosing the tide-door). Payoff: present in the final image sweeping where footprints stay. The deckhand's decisions drive two major beats and the closure. However, the trait "ardent" and "resiliently positive" appear as labels more than embodied contradiction under pressure; the character's optimism never visibly costs them or constrains a choice. Causal pressure is moderate; the element is functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setup: introduced early ("empty hourglass the harbormaster had thrown away"). Development: in the grotto it fills with starlight dust and the protagonist flips it, causing dust to tumble "not down but across, sliding from future to present." Payoff: "stood upright on the capstan, shining inside with ash colored like dawn before the alarm." The object is handled in three distinct beats, its changing state alters later action (the flip triggers the threshold), and it contributes meaningfully to closure. Highly integrated but not quite indispensable—another time-marker could serve similar function with edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setup: framed in the opening lines ("vanishing commuter ferry... arrived only sometimes"). Development: the ferry's unreliability creates the dominant stake and the radio voice's offer directly addresses it ("you are tired of losing arrivals"). Payoff: the closure hinges on stabilizing the ferry—"ferry steady under me," "pier... not a rumor," "arrivals did not vanish." The concept shapes tactics (aligning lattice, choosing the tide-door) and the final image. Removing this exact element would collapse the story's logic and stakes.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Setup: mentioned twice in the opening paragraphs ("resiliently positive," "ardent ferry deckhand"). Development: no on-page moment where optimism constrains or enables a choice with visible cost; it remains a tonal label. Payoff: the phrase reappears in the final line but does not reweight prior material or charge the closure. The attribute is ornamental rather than causal; swappable with "determined" or "hopeful" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setup: introduced early ("radio began to catch voices we had never carried"). Development: the radio delivers the merge method, the protagonist begs for "a minute more," and the voice's explanation drives the middle turn. Payoff: "radio broadcast silence shaped like doors" at the threshold moment; the radio is causally active in the closure sequence. The action is present in three distinct beats, narrows options, and the story's escalation and resolution depend on it. Near-indispensable; no easy substitute.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Setup: seeded early ("lattice on the current, a net of promises and absences"). Development: the method is explained by the radio voice and executed on the page—protagonist traces loops with the broom, aligns them with star patterns, the lattice "clicked like teeth." Payoff: "through them threaded our wake, knot by knot" at the closure threshold. The method is signaled, its mechanics matter, and it shapes the protagonist's attempts. Functional across beats but the mechanics remain somewhat abstract; a clearer constraint or cost tied to the method itself would lift it higher.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Setup: announced early ("approaching the spectral grotto under starlight"). Development: the grotto's ceiling drips letters, its mirrored stars provide the alignment mechanism, and its cold seam triggers the hourglass flip. Payoff: "emerged from the spectral grotto under starlight into morning" marks the crossing. The setting constrains choice (the protagonist must drift to where the ceiling drips), supplies the pattern-resource, and houses the threshold moment. Removing the grotto would break the closure sequence; highly integrated and nearly indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Setup: established in the opening line ("hour when clocks run sideways"). Development: time remains fluid and surreal but does not tighten decisions or create a live clock that alters tactics. Payoff: "morning that still looked nocturnal" echoes the motif but does not reweight it with new cost. The timeframe contributes to tone and atmosphere but remains more thematic than causal; it does not constrain a choice on the page. Present and consistent, but replaceable with a similar surreal-time concept without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Setup: implicit early (the ferry's vanishing problem), made explicit by the radio voice in the grotto ("you want to merge parallel timelines"). Development: the protagonist whispers "yes," and the desire drives the alignment action and threshold choice. Payoff: the merger is achieved—"arrivals did not vanish; they simply moved through me and kept going." The motivation is dramatized through choice (choosing the tide-door, accepting undertow) with visible cost in the protagonist's acknowledgment of grief's rhythm. Present across three beats, causal, and integral to closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Setup: framed early ("permanent transient already, living aboard and never truly ashore"). Development: the radio voice offers the choice "permanent in its transience, or transient in its permanence," and the protagonist selects the tide option to preserve the undertow. Payoff: the final line returns to "ardent ferry deckhand, resiliently positive" and the dew-sweeping image, echoing the opening but now "where each footprint finally agreed to stay." Tone is coherent through turns and charges the final image with earned paradox. Strong lyric resonance but the tonal shift is subtle rather than dramatic; the ending modulates pressure more than it transforms it.</comment>
