<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Ivo's interior is specific and embodied—tracing animals on the zodiac coin to remember cycles, tasting metallic weather, listening to boot conversations—with a perceptual signature grounded in his labyrinth maintenance expertise. His motivation to prove whispers travel farther than shouts drives the rescue method without over-articulation. The courier and Rade remain functional but thin; Rade's acceptance of the challenge feels slightly convenient, though his final acknowledgment carries cost (surrendering authority). Minor slip: Ivo's competence borders on flawless; genuine struggle is present but muted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening beat (night, geomagnetic storm, port labyrinth, Ivo's rounds). The causal lens holds: Ivo accepts Rade's challenge, applies his brass-key whisper method, the courier responds, and the gate opens through the zodiac coin's vibration-sensing use—each step narrows options and raises the wager's cost. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Rade's surrender and question crystallize the lesson without resolving the larger storm or port chaos, and the cost is relational (authority ceded). One meaningful tightening (challenge accepted → whisper deployed → courier found) is sufficient for this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The towering shipping-container labyrinth is vivid and functional: corrugated walls sing under the brass key, steel canyons swallow voices, frozen cranes turn paths into hypotheses, and a drainage slot accepts the key to persuade the gate open. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (metallic weather, citrus-crate air, zodiac coin vibration at the hinge). The micro-setting of corrugations, seams, and resonance panels constrains Ivo's method and charges the final gate-opening image. Environment directly enables the whisper tactic and the closure beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: prove whispers outrun shouts and retrieve the courier faster than Rade's men. The challenge initiates pressure, Ivo's method narrows the search (folding the map, tapping the brass key, reading boot scrapes), and the jammed gate forces a final tactical choice (zodiac coin to hinge, key to drainage slot). One meaningful tightening occurs when the whisper finds the courier and Ivo must navigate around the shouting searchers. Cost is relational and reputational (Rade's authority versus Ivo's quiet expertise), legible in Rade's final surrender. Agency is consistent; coincidence (the storm) complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—the superiority of attuned listening over brute force, cycles and secrets within rigid systems—emerges through concrete particulars: the brass key's song, the zodiac coin's reminder to pause, the maze loving secrets, steel carrying murmurs like rivers. Ivo's final line ("Because steel carries murmurs like rivers, if you listen for the bend") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The folded maps as "origami logic" and the storm silencing radios layer thematic texture. No overt thesis statements; the courier's hiccupped walk and Ivo's whisper method embody the concept without explaining it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Ivo with a distinct perceptual signature: he identifies walks like a bird reads thermals, traces zodiac animals, tastes metallic weather, hears boot conversations on steel. Diction is precise and voice-motivated ("origami logic," "secrets," "conspiratorial ease"). Dialogue is sparse but purposeful: Ivo's challenge to Rade is economical and goal-driven, Rade's bark fits his character, and the final exchange carries subtext (authority conceding to method). Psychic distance modulates appropriately (closer during the brass-key tapping, wider during spatial choreography). No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks, no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and propulsion is strong in high-pressure beats (the whisper threading toward the quay, the gate persuasion). Information density is high: most lines do double duty (e.g., "the maze gave him back a map of tongues" conveys method and result). However, several sentences in the opening third employ ornate metaphor that slows momentum ("maps were origami logic, capable of being refolded into new corridors whenever a crane operator sneezed differently" reads decorative). The phrase "a key with no apparent lock" repeats twice without adding pressure. Minor template cadence in the middle (multiple "He [verb]" constructions). No loops or major artifacts, but figurative density in non-peak beats nudges the score down from high 7s.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of labyrinth maintenance expertise, whisper-over-shout proof, and geomagnetic-storm complication is specific and non-obvious. The brass key that "sang a thin note" and the zodiac coin used for vibration-sensing rather than divination transform stock objects into functional tools with unique mechanics. The "whispers travel farther than shouts" premise risks platitude but is grounded in the corrugated walls' physics and Ivo's embodied skill (boot-scrape reading, map-folding). Risk-taking in the lyric compression and the quiet ending elevates; the final image (Rade's grin, Ivo's nod, the geometry humming) feels earned in hindsight. Minor swappability: the courier rescue could be another trapped worker, though the hiccupped walk ties it to Ivo's talent.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ivo (labyrinth maintenance worker) is present throughout, his expertise (identifying walks, tracing seams, using the brass key) drives the rescue tactic, and his decision to accept the challenge initiates escalation. His micro-choices (scraping a knuckle, folding the map twice, whispering along the brass, pressing the coin to the hinge) alter tactics in at least three beats. Closure participation is strong: his method succeeds and Rade's question crystallizes the lesson. Cost is legible (relational authority shift, wager won). Setup early, development across middle, payoff at end. Specific to his role; irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The zodiac coin appears in three beats: Ivo traces the twelve animals to remember cycles (first third), lays it on the map with Pisces pointing to a seam (middle), and presses it to the jammed gate's hinge to feel for vibration (closure beat). However, its causal role is mixed: the Pisces-pointing moment reads more like ornament (a pause cue) than a decision constraint, and the final hinge use ("feeling for vibration") is brief and could be swapped for any vibration-sensitive tool. The text notes "people thought the coin made his decisions; in truth it reminded him to pause," which undercuts its mechanical necessity. Setup early, development present but weak, payoff functional but not irreplaceable. Scores mid-6s for spaced use and closure participation, capped by swappability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Folded maps are established early ("each crease a memory of last week's rearrangement"), actively used in the middle ("He folded his map twice, turning a wall into a hinge, realigning passages with the crane's frozen positions"), and the final image references "the geometry of his planning still humming." The concept shapes tactics on the page: Ivo's ability to mentally reconfigure the maze enables the whisper route and the bypass around Rade's searchers. The "origami logic" phrasing charges the concept with texture. Cost is implicit (Ivo's cognitive labor, wager stakes). Setup, development, and closure participation all present; causal pressure is strong. Specific to Ivo's method; high irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Ivo's ability to identify walks appears in two beats: he hears "three separate boot conversations on the steel, each with different weight, impatience, and fear," and later identifies "the hasty scrape of a courier who once favored his left knee during rainy days." The trait enables the search tactic (finding the courier by gait) and is presented as unique expertise. However, the cost or tradeoff is not visible on the page; the trait functions flawlessly without constraint. Setup early, development in middle (courier identification), but no closure payoff or reweighted use. Functional but not indispensable; scores mid-6s for enabling one key beat without cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The challenge ("If I bring your courier out faster than your men shouting, you will stop screaming and let me do it my way") establishes the wager and stakes at the start of the second third, drives Ivo's tactical choices (whisper method, map-folding, brass-key use), and resolves at closure when Rade raises his hands in surrender and asks how the whisper outran his shout. Removing the challenge would collapse the causal chain: Ivo's method gains urgency only under the wager's time pressure. Setup slightly late (~20% mark), but development and payoff are strong; causal pressure and closure linkage are undeniable. Cost is relational (authority shift). Irreplaceable; swapping for a generic rescue would lose the whisper-vs-shout proof.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The brass key is introduced early ("a key with no apparent lock, a long brass shaft worn smooth by decades of hands"), used actively in the middle (dragged along corrugated walls to sing a thin note, tapped in rhythm, whispered along to conduct the courier closer), and deployed at closure (slipped into a drainage slot to persuade the jammed gate open). Its mechanics matter: the key's resonance with the corrugations enables the whisper tactic, and its specificity (no lock, worn smooth, sings when dragged) makes it irreplaceable. Setup, development across multiple beats, and closure participation all present. Cost is tactical (Ivo's skill required to use it). High causal pressure and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The towering shipping-container labyrinth is present throughout, constrains tactics (frozen cranes, corrugated walls that carry whispers, steel canyons that swallow shouts, jammed gate), and charges the closure image (gate clattering open, courtyard holding silence). The maze's properties enable Ivo's method (whispers travel via corrugations) and disable Rade's (shouts bounce back confused). The storm compounds the maze's challenge by freezing equipment and lying compasses. Setup immediate, development across all beats, payoff at closure. Irreplaceable; the whisper-vs-shout proof depends on this exact environment. Visible cost (navigational difficulty, time pressure).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The geomagnetic storm is anchored early ("the night the sky rippled green," "compasses lied, radios hissed, and cranes froze mid-swing") and tightens the challenge by disabling instruments and forcing reliance on Ivo's embodied skill. However, the storm's time pressure is not tracked on the page; we see the storm's effects (frozen cranes, radio hiss) but no escalating urgency or countdown. The final image references "the storm glow" but does not pay off the timeframe with a clock or deadline met. Setup strong, development functional (maze difficulty), but closure participation is weak. Scores mid-6s for complicating pressure without a live ticking clock.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The motivation ("to prove that whispers travel farther than shouts") is dramatized through Ivo's challenge to Rade, tested on the page via the whisper method, and confirmed at closure when Rade asks how the whisper outran his shout. Friction is present: Ivo's quiet confidence versus Rade's loud authority, and the wager's relational cost (Rade must stop screaming if Ivo wins). However, Ivo's internal conflict is minimal; he never doubts the method or faces a moment where shouting would be easier. Setup in the challenge, development through the rescue, payoff at Rade's surrender. Cost is relational and reputational. Scores low-7s for clear dramatization with limited internal friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Tone balances meticulous expertise (Ivo tracing seams, folding maps, tapping rhythms) with improvised fluidity ("a plan dressed as a whim," "as if spontaneity had been enough, though he could feel the geometry of his planning still humming"). The diction supports this duality: precise technical detail ("corrugated walls," "drainage slot") coexists with lyric phrasing ("the maze loves secrets," "steel carries murmurs like rivers"). Tone modulates appropriately under pressure (tighter syntax during the gate-opening beat). The final image crystallizes the duality: Ivo's nod suggests ease, but the "geometry... still humming" reveals the hidden calculation. Coherent through turns; charges the closure. Scores low-7s for strong execution with minor ornamental drift in early beats.</comment>
