<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The restorer's interiority is vivid and embodied ("ribs," "sleeves," "hands doubted"), with methodical playfulness shown in concrete micro-choices (tapping, rolling the coin, timing breath). Motivation to "exchange certainty for curiosity" drives the questioning pattern and opens vulnerability at the crack. The progression from professional task to personal admission ("fear that a perfect restoration erases the hands that kept living") is earned through the garden's reciprocal pressure. Minor slip: emotional calibration is smooth and articulate throughout; no degradation under discovery stress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early (nested awakenings, layered images) and held through closure. The story deepens through three distinct image-layers (mason's daughter, dancing pair, patron's feast), each triggered by the protagonist's questions and choices. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final paragraph's "keeps asking, so that I keep waking, and the map keeps unfolding" crystallizes the exchange of certainty for ongoing curiosity with felt cost (lighter step, loosened certainty). Cost is legible in the protagonist's admission and the mural's open-ended state. Orientation anchors who/where/when by line ~60 words cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The sound-wave garden's parabolic dishes are not merely backdrop—they structure every beat via echo mechanics that shape the restoration technique. The hobo nickel functions as micro-setting (bell, oracle, straightedge) and charges the final image ("tiny star to ring," "mapping the air"). Sensory detail is purposeful: "sun warmed," "cricketing rhythm," temperature shift, texture on sleeves. The curved wall itself is both canvas and interlocutor, constraining method and enabling nested discoveries. The setting is indispensable to closure: without the acoustics, the questioning-reply structure and the mural's awakening collapse.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore without erasing living hands—is signaled early and tested when the wall asks "what my own face hid." The protagonist's agency is dialogic choice: each question narrows certainty and opens a layer, culminating in the admission of fear. The wall's "amused" granting of whisper-retention is a tightening that forecloses perfect restoration yet achieves depth. Cost is visible: the mural "keeps asking," obligating ongoing wakefulness rather than finished certainty. Pressure accumulates through the reciprocal questioning pattern, and the final cost (lighter burden, unfolding map) is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—certainty versus curiosity as burden and gift—emerges organically from the restoration mechanics and the garden's acoustics, never stated as thesis. The nested-awakenings motif accrues meaning across three literal image-layers and one figurative (protagonist's self), charging the closure without moralizing. The final image ("map keeps unfolding") reweights the premise: restoration is recursive rather than terminal, with the mural, mason's daughter, and restorer mutually awakening. The "pause between question and reply" recurs as a charged syntactic refrain that constraints perception and choice, avoiding token repetition. No thematic echo or label-speak in the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Single POV, first-person, with stable psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature (sound as tactile, images as breath, metaphors drawn from cartography and craft). Diction is elevated but consistent ("bewitch the binder," "stroked my cheek," "nested awakenings") and voice-motivated by the restorer's methodical playfulness. The recurring syntactic pattern "In the pause between question and reply" is purposeful, taught early, and paid off structurally. Filter verbs ("felt," "watched") are sparse and voice-appropriate. Minor deduction: some figurative density ("tilting inside my ribs," "mapping the air") borders overwriting in a few beats, though it remains legible and thematically coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance image, character, or pressure. Sentence rhythm modulates well (short declaratives at key beats, longer lyric swells during discovery). The recurring "pause between question and reply" is pattern-taught and non-looping. Minor artifact cluster: "nested awakenings" appears three times within ~200 words mid-story, risking synonym loop; "methodically playful" is invoked twice as label. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; one mixed vehicle ("echoes…climbed…fell back" then "folded like birds") muddies the sensory anchor slightly. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Closure beats are clean and propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of acoustic restoration, reciprocal questioning, and nested image-layers is specific and non-obvious. The hobo nickel's star as both tool and inheritance avoids sentimentality through concrete function (bell, straightedge, oracle). The "pause between question and reply" as both literal acoustic phenomenon and epistemic stance is fresh. The piece commits fully to its lyric-technical register without hedging. Minor limitation: the restoration-as-self-discovery arc follows a recognizable template, though the acoustics and layered awakenings transform it into something more particular. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure and charged syntactic refrain elevates the score within band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Restorer is present throughout, makes key choices (tap, ask, roll coin, admit fear), and her decisions trigger each nested layer and the final reconfiguration. Drives setup, middle beats, and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Hobo nickel appears in setup (coping, carved star), is used as bell/oracle/straightedge in middle beats (tap, roll, rhythm), and returns charged in closure ("listened for the tiny star to ring," "mapping the air"). Irreplaceable: its grooves and star are causally active across three beats and the ending image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Nested awakenings structures the entire plot: three literal image-layers (sketch, charcoal pair, feast) plus protagonist's self-layer. Each awakening is triggered by sound-bewitching and questioning. Shapes tactics (layered solvent technique) and closure (mural "keeps asking," protagonist "keeps waking"). Conceptually indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Methodically playful" is shown in early beats (rolled coin, timed breath, oracle use) and subtly constrains approach (precision + curiosity). Invoked twice as label, limiting score. Tradeoff is implicit: playfulness enables discovery but delays certainty. Shapes tactics moderately; less decisive at closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Bewitch" is the core mechanic: sound bewitches binder (loosens dirt, steadies lines), persuades varnish. Introduced early, used across middle beats (tap, echo, solvent interaction), and implicit in closure (mural awakens via prior bewitching). Essential to the restoration's success; swapping it would break the acoustic logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Reflected sound is signaled in setup (parabolas, echoes), mechanics matter throughout (tap-count, echo-climb, temperature change, vine-greening), and shapes closure (visitors' words return "carrying hints of laughter"). The method is indispensable: without acoustics, nested awakenings and reciprocal questioning collapse. Drives three beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sound wave garden with parabolic dishes is not backdrop—it structures every causal beat (echo-returns, question-reply mechanic, bewitching via sound). Setting enables the restoration method, constrains protagonist choices (must use acoustics), and charges closure (visitors lean into dishes, protagonist listens). Remove the garden's acoustics and the entire plot fails. Indispensable across setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>"In the pause between question and reply" recurs as syntactic and temporal marker in four beats (colors wake, vine greens, protagonist admits fear, final layer wakes). It is both acoustic phenomenon (echo delay) and epistemic threshold. Tightens decisions by framing each revelation moment. The phrase charges the final image ("pause…another thin layer of me woke smiling"). Essential to rhythm and closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation to exchange certainty for curiosity is stated early, dramatized through questioning pattern (asks who painted, who loved, what own face hides), and tested when protagonist admits fear of erasure. The wall's response (retain whisper while gleaming) fulfills the exchange. Cost is visible: lighter step, unfolding map, obligation to keep waking. Drives setup, middle friction, and closure reconfiguration.</comment>
