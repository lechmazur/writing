<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The map maker's interiority is concrete and filtered through their sensory practice ("I count them like syllables," "I understand that the leaf is not decoration but contract"). Micro-choices under pressure are visible: pressing the fossil, waiting without moving, clipping it during the surge, relocating it deeper. The final promise carries weight and forecloses a path of ownership. Internal contradiction between the desire to speak and the discipline of restraint operates throughout, embodied in gesture and timing.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its pattern early—sensory mapping, negotiation through objects, layered memories—and accumulates pressure through the storm surge and the protagonist's repeated micro-negotiations with the cave. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): "the contract holds," "partnered, and my voice learns restraint." The fossil's relocation and the protagonist's logged promise constitute a visible cost (relinquishing ownership, accepting partnership terms). Orientation anchors are present by the second paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when the storm forces the fossil's permanent placement, reweighting the relationship from carried token to resident contract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The cave network constrains the protagonist's choices throughout: "I slip through the dripping strands," "wedge myself into the throat tunnel," "place the leaf in a deeper niche." Micro-setting (the black pool, mineral hair curtain, ledge, niche) directly alters tactics during the storm surge. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "Drops ring the pool with tiny collisions," "wall warms under the fossil and releases a flow of faint vapor." The cave's "emotional temperature" functions as both atmosphere and active constraint, charging the final image when "the heat map remains warm."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: "to become the voice of the unknown, without presuming to own it." One meaningful tightening occurs when the storm surge forces immediate action—grabbing the fossil, wedging into the tunnel—and the protagonist must choose whether to remove or relocate the token. The fossil's relocation to "a deeper niche" forecloses the path of portable ownership, establishing partnership terms with visible cost. Agency is enacted through renunciation (not carrying the leaf out) and the logged promise, which binds future action. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens: each negotiation step (floating, pressing, waiting, relocating) deepens the relationship with the cave.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the fossil-as-contract motif and the protagonist's disciplined restraint: "To become the voice of the unknown is to hold space for its pauses and accents." The elm leaf shifts meaning across beats—memory token, pledge, contract, resident signature—without overt statement. The final lines offer a resonant answer to the central question: partnership requires relinquishing ownership, and the protagonist's voice "learns restraint." Subtext operates in the protagonist's careful word-testing ("testing the fit of each word with the glow") and the cave's thermal responses. No moralizing; the thematic weight rests in the image of the fossil left behind and the "clean sheet of notation."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single POV, first-person. Perceptual signature is distinct and sustained: the protagonist notices in units of breath, syllables, color-grammar, and contractual weight. Diction remains consistent and voice-motivated: "factually mystical work," "a voice before words," "promises are materials here." Psychic distance is stable; the narrator's knowledge stays within plausible bounds (sensory instruments, heat map readings). Compression is purposeful and taught early: "Flood, pause, seed, branch, shelter, inhale, exhale, we remember you as you remember us" reads as a tested grammar, not authorial gloss. No head-hopping. Under peak stress (storm surge), syntax tightens without losing internal texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Information density is high: most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual and tonal modulation. Minor template cadence in the middle third ("I set," "I speak," "I understand," "I grab," "I swim") nudges toward −0.3, but the closure beats are clean and propulsive. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Figurative language is controlled and serves the lens: "a warm plateau that my map labels welcoming," "water smashes past and tries to erase the plateau, but the warmth persists like a held vowel." Clarity and momentum are maintained throughout; no artifacts touch the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of sensory mapping, transitional objects, and cave-as-partner feels specific and non-obvious. The protagonist's role—"factually mystical work, measured and inexplicable at once"—transforms the familiar trope of the lone explorer into a negotiator bound by contract and grammar. The storm-surge beat and the fossil's relocation create fresh pressure within the frame. Emotional specificity (counting syllables, testing word-fit with thermal glow) avoids generic templates. Risk-taking is evident in the accumulative structure and the lack of external antagonist; the protagonist's restraint and the cave's "breathing" drive all escalation. The final image—"the contract holds," "my voice learns restraint"—is earned and inevitable in hindsight, with no retreat from the premise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The sensory map maker is present throughout and drives all key choices: pressing the fossil to the wall, waiting without moving, relocating the fossil during the surge, logging the promise. Setup by the first paragraph, development in the middle (fossil placement, word-testing), payoff in the ending (relocating the fossil, contract confirmation). The protagonist's decisions alter tactics and stakes under the accumulative lens. Causal pressure is strong; the final image would fail without this exact character's disciplined negotiation stance.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The elm leaf fossil is signaled in paragraph five, handled in at least four beats (pressing to wall, setting on ledge, clipping to cord during surge, placing in deeper niche), and charged at closure ("the contract holds"). Its meaning reweights across the story: memory token → pledge → contract → resident signature. Specificity is high ("thin as a held breath," "an older signature than mine"). Removing it would collapse the negotiation structure and the protagonist's final renunciation of ownership. Strong closure linkage and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Transitional objects shape the protagonist's entire approach: "The caves accept agreements better than commands, and I carry transitional objects to negotiate." The concept drives tactics (fossil as token, pledge, contract) and is tested on the page when the protagonist must decide whether to carry or leave the leaf. Setup by paragraph four, development through repeated handling, payoff when the fossil becomes "resident not carried." The protagonist's promise is itself framed as material with "weight and buoyancy." Removing this concept would break the story's central logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Factually mystical work, measured and inexplicable at once" is signaled early and constrains the protagonist's method: using instruments to translate exhalations and microcurrents into thermal grammar. The attribute enables the heat-mapping beats and the protagonist's careful word-testing. It appears in setup, is active in the middle (color-grammar, warm plateau), and implicit at closure when "the heat map remains warm." One point of swappability: "scientifically spiritual" could substitute with minor edits. Visible tradeoff is present in the protagonist's dual discipline (measurement + listening), but the cost tied specifically to this attribute is less direct than for the fossil or map-making role.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Floating appears once in paragraph seven: "At slack tide I float in a black pool and open my instruments." This action enables the instrument setup and signals the protagonist's embodied entry into the cave's rhythm. However, it does not recur and could be replaced with "wade" or "settle" with modest edits. Present in setup and development (it enables the mapping beats), but absent from closure. Functional but replaceable; no major turn traces uniquely to floating rather than to the fossil or mapping practice.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Heat-mapping emotions is signaled by paragraph eight and mechanically active: "They attach to stone, to salt film, to my skin, and begin heat-mapping emotions." The method enables the color-grammar beats ("green vein," "warm plateau," "steady amber") and constrains the protagonist's negotiation: the protagonist tests words against the glow and logs coordinates based on thermal response. Present in setup, development (multiple mapping beats), and payoff (the map "remains warm" at closure). Removing this method would break the protagonist's means of reading and recording the cave's response. Strong causal role across beats.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The coastal cave network is signaled in the opening line and pressures every choice: the protagonist must navigate shelves, slip through mineral hair, wedge into the throat tunnel, and choose niche depth for the fossil. The storm surge—"pushing the tide hard, and the pool climbs the walls quickly"—creates the story's peak pressure. Micro-setting (pool, ledge, niche, curtain, throat tunnel) directly alters tactics and enables the protagonist's final renunciation. Present in setup, development, and closure; the cave's "breathing" and the protagonist's departure "toward the tunnels that lead outward" frame the ending. Indispensable; story logic would collapse without this exact setting.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "after humans hibernate" is signaled early ("Above ground the cities are sealed and sleeping") and provides context for the protagonist's solitary work. It shapes the protagonist's motivation (speaking for the sleepers who will wake) and the stakes (carrying the story back to them). However, it does not directly constrain choices on the page; the cave negotiation would function identically in a non-hibernation setting. Present in setup and implicit at closure ("When the sleepers wake, they will ask"), but the timeframe does not tighten decisions during the storm or fossil-placement beats. Functional accent rather than indispensable driver.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to become the voice of the unknown, without presuming to own it" is signaled in paragraph three and dramatized through every micro-choice: waiting without moving, testing word-fit with the glow, relocating the fossil to relinquish ownership, logging the promise. Friction between the desire to speak and the discipline of restraint operates throughout. Setup, development (word-testing, fossil relocation), and payoff (the protagonist's voice "learns restraint," the story is "not mine alone"). The motivation drives the protagonist's final renunciation and frames the closure image. Removing it would erase the story's thematic and tactical spine.</comment>
