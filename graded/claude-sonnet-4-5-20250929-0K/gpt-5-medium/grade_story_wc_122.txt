<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara's interior state is embodied through physical sensation ("felt the backwardness enthrall her scars like a tide unwinding") and her fear of numbness is concrete. The journey from emotional frost to thaw is earned through the cavern work. Minor slip: "She had come afraid her students would soon stop feeling, yet she had already stopped without noticing" articulates the realization too cleanly, edging toward diagnostic self-awareness. The final choice to carry the needle and teach differently shows visible cost in her altered stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Mara's discovery that listening backward enables moving forward reweights her teaching practice with visible cost—she must now lead students through vulnerability rather than technique. The accumulative lens holds: pressure builds through sensory density and the backwards-song ritual until the final image of footsteps writing softly crystallizes the shift. Orientation is clean by the opening paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when the reversed drumbeat "rubbed frost from the bones of the drum, and from the caves inside her chest."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The cavern constrains action: basalt that "swallowed sound into velvet" creates the necessary acoustic environment for the backward-song experiment. The broken phonograph needle, drum, and hides function as micro-setting that shapes the ritual. Sensory hierarchy reflects Mara's tactile focus: she reads palms, feels prickles, closes eyes to feel rather than hear. The cavern "bowed back with a breath she felt" charges the final departure image with reciprocal acknowledgment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (defeating emotional numbness) is signaled in paragraph six. One meaningful tightening occurs when the absurd surgery of needle-to-drumhead forces Mara to trust the backward method despite its fragility. The escalation is accumulative rather than causal—density increases until "the drum became a heart remembering forward" reweights her capacity. Cost is visible: she must abandon her prior teaching stance and lead through shared vulnerability. Agency is clear in her choice to thread the filament and carry the repaired needle home.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme (reversing to proceed, listening to frozen silence to thaw) emerges through the drumhead ritual and filament-threading without direct statement. The closing image—"numbness loosened, like frost admitting it was water"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the opening question of emotional numbness. The needle's repair and Mara's posture shift ("one hand on the cavern's echo, one on tomorrow's drum") avoid overt moralizing. Subtext operates in Oko's grin "teeth pale as shells turned fossil" and the cave's reciprocal bow.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Mara; perceptual signature is tactile and synesthetic ("felt a prickle, as if a filament of hush had sparked"). Diction is lyric and controlled: "breath between notes, footsteps of vanished players." Minor density concern: elevated register ("enthrall her scars like a tide unwinding") occasionally risks aesthetic decoration over immediacy, but the voice remains coherent under pressure. Oko's silent communication through gesture and drums is clean; no dialogue means naturalism tests don't apply.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout: "lighthouse at fog's edge," "moons," "riverbeds," "tide that had consulted the moon," "vinyl." In peak beats (the ritual, the threading), metaphor stacks without always advancing causality—"filament of hush" recurs but shifts meaning only slightly across uses. Paraphrase loop: "She believed backward recorded songs might coax lost feelings to surface" is restated by the next paragraph's ritual enactment. Template cadence: several "She [verb]" openers in the final third. Clarity remains high, but density occasionally slows momentum. Information load per sentence is strong in the cavern setup but thins in the closing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The backward-song ritual as method for emotional recovery is a fresh synthesis; the specific use of a broken phonograph needle threaded to a drumhead feels non-obvious. The deaf music teacher who teaches "rhythm through skin, bones, and the remembering of feet" particularizes the premise beyond archetype. Risk-taking in lyric accumulation and the "filament of hush" conceit heightens stakes. MinorTemplated element: "turning seasons" and "lighthouse at fog's edge" are familiar images, though they're integrated into the voice rather than dropped in.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mara drives two key beats: choosing to rig the needle to the drumhead (middle) and threading the filament through the needle to repair it (closure). Her decision to teach differently tomorrow flows from the ritual. Setup clear, development causal, payoff present. Swappability is low—her deafness and tactile pedagogy are load-bearing. Cost is visible in her altered teaching stance.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The needle appears in three beats: discovery on the workbench (setup), rigging to the drumhead (development), threading with the filament and carrying it home (payoff). Its broken state and repair arc drive the ritual's stakes. Specificity is high—its thorn-like fineness and "failed promise" make it irreplaceable. Cost connection: mending it costs Mara the safety of her old method.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The filament of hush is imagined by Mara, then "seen" as bright at the cavern's center, then threaded through the needle. It constrains the final action (threading) and charges the closure image. Setup mid-story (~40% mark), payoff strong. Swappability moderate—"thread of silence" could substitute with minor edits. Causal pressure is present but the concept reads partly as lyric symbol rather than physical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Audibly muted" describes Oko's voice and the final night. It does not constrain an on-page choice or enable tactics. Label-only mention. No visible cost tied to the attribute itself.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Enthrall" recurs: the backwardness enthralls Mara's scars, and she plans to let students' bones enthrall them into tenderness. The action shapes the middle ritual beat and the planned teaching. Setup and payoff present; middle development indirect. Swappability moderate—"captivate" or "entrance" could replace with minor tonal shift. Cost connection: being enthralled requires vulnerability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Backward recorded songs are signaled early (Mara carries the reversing machine, believes they coax lost feelings), enacted in the ritual (reversed beats rub frost from drum and chest), and shape the closure (she will teach listening backward to move forward). Setup, development, payoff all present. Mechanics matter: the reversal produces "seams of music, breath between notes." Irreplaceability high—the backward method is the story's engine.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cavern is present from the title and opening. It supplies the acoustic ("basalt swallowed sound into velvet"), the tools (drums, hides, workbench), and the spatial pressure (a chamber that multiplies inward). The cavern "taught the season to turn kindly" and bows back, charging the departure. Setup immediate, development throughout, payoff in the reciprocal bow. Constraint and resource both.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Faint rustle of turning seasons" opens and closes the piece, framing the threshold moment. It does not tighten decisions on the page—no clock pressure or seasonal deadline alters Mara's tactics. Lyric resonance present (early seed, final reprise) but no causal grip. Swappable with "twilight" or "dusk" in function.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Defeating emotional numbness is named in paragraph six, drives Mara's cavern visit, shapes the ritual (rubbing frost from bones), and reappears in the closure ("numbness loosened"). The motivation is dramatized through her fear, the backward-song attempt, and the choice to thread the filament despite trembling fingers. Friction between safety (old teaching) and vulnerability (new teaching) is visible. Setup, development, payoff all clear.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Mirrored hush" appears explicitly: "silence had learned to mirror her, and she mirrored it, teacher to student." The tone (quiet, reflective, tactile) is coherent through the ritual and modulates slightly as the drumbeat becomes "lucid" rather than loud. The final image ("hush she carried was no absence, only a way for presence to travel") charges the closure. Purposeful, but tone remains relatively static—no sharp turn in emotional weather. Swappability moderate with "reciprocal silence."</comment>
