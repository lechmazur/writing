<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The crystal gazer's interiority is richly textured through spatial metaphor and embodied perception, particularly the warehouse visualization. Internal contradiction appears when she realizes "her own, the life she had shelved," creating a moment of self-recognition with cost. However, the final action—writing "stay, because what I mean is do not leave"—feels abruptly unmotivated; the prior causality builds toward understanding unused love but doesn't prepare the reader for this specific renunciation or its target. The embodied details (palm against metal gate, paper edge grazing skin) ground the psychometry effectively, but the peak choice lacks clear stakes that would make the cost of staying versus leaving legible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with successful pattern-teaching through recurring warehouse imagery and the film/letter interweaving. Orientation is clean: who (crystal gazer), where (projection booth), and when (storm night) anchor by the second paragraph. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Charged Poise—the final image of her writing a new goodbye that says "stay" crystallizes the warehouse metaphor and reconfigures "unused love" from stored-away to threshold-waiting with felt emotional cost. One meaningful deepening occurs when she discovers her own name on the shelves, shifting from professional distance to personal stakes. The cost is conceptually clear (abandoning expertise-as-armor) though the tactical consequence of "stay" remains slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The projection booth functions as micro-setting that constrains and charges action: the projector's "modest growl," the spattered table, the metal gate all become tactile anchors for the psychometry ritual. Sensory detail is purposefully filtered through the protagonist's spatial-imaginative POV (fog-rising shelves, doors ajar like vowels, rain on velvet). The booth's physical elements—film strip threaded through the projector, letters pressed to skin—directly enable the method and the final moment when "the booth glowed with faded faces." The recurring thunder motif modulates from "softened" to "spoke aloud" in the final line, tracking emotional progression through environmental detail.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding where unused love is stored—is signaled immediately and tightens when she discovers her own name on the warehouse shelves, forcing a personal reckoning. This reversal narrows options from professional observer to participant with cost: "expertise and longing had to keep distance." The final action (writing the new goodbye) represents a stance crystallization with visible price—abandoning her safe curatorial role. However, the escalation would be stronger if the piece dramatized what specific conversation or threshold she's been avoiding; the key ring "for a conversation that had aged into shyness" tells rather than shows the concrete choice she now faces.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the controlling metaphor of unused love as "overqualified, waiting in the wings" rather than void, building through concrete particulars: letters with stamps "licked then peeled away," film strip as blocking for "unperformed scenes." The final image offers a resonant answer without moralizing: unused love stores in "the breath before yes," located not in endings but thresholds nobody crossed. The warehouse conceit remains specific and evolves meaningfully—from mislabeled aisles to boxes stamped with her own name to the final shelf-marking for "the next wanderer." The apology and counter-goodbye reweight the opening quest without stating a thesis, and the piece resists false equivalence by acknowledging the asymmetry between observation and participation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV control is stable throughout with a distinct perceptual signature: spatial/architectural framing of emotion ("rooms, stairs, and dead ends"), synesthetic imagery ("words rose, first as smells, then as streetlights"), and consistent metaphoric vocabulary around projection and performance. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close during the warehouse visualization, pulling back for conceptual observation ("Unused love is not empty"), then intimate again at self-discovery. The prose carries character-specific diction ("incubate a tender heat," "nib of frost," "vowels") that remains coherent under pressure. One minor slip: "what I mean is do not leave" in the penultimate paragraph uses a clarity of articulation that feels slightly more authorial than character-voice given the metaphoric density elsewhere, though it's arguably intentional for the closure beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies effectively with figurative density serving accumulative design: "doors ajar like vowels," "costume pressed, listening for the cue that never comes." Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "The booth filled with a kind of breath, a hush that was thunder" advances atmosphere, method, and thematic echo simultaneously). Two minor issues: "hushed thunder" appears three times (opening, middle, end) with only slight variation, creating a quasi-loop rather than charged reprise; and the phrase "because that was when objects sighed the loudest" in paragraph 10 introduces a slightly precious register that doesn't recur or pay off. The final paragraph's cascade of images propels cleanly without scaffold. No major filter-verb stacks or template cadence; clarity remains high despite metaphoric load.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of psychometry, film projection, and emotional archiving feels fresh and motivated by character logic rather than prompt assembly. The warehouse-of-unused-love premise transforms familiar "what-if" territory through specific spatial imagination: "ladders with their rungs swaying," motives as shelf labels ("promises postponed, touches untaken"). The turn—discovering her own name—is earned by prior setup and reframes professional detachment as its own form of unused love. Risk-taking in the extended metaphor and elision of explicit backstory heightens thematic stakes without obscuring cause. The piece commits fully to its lyric-accumulative mode. One friction: the "forgotten lyrics search for tune" timeframe, while evocative, remains more decorative than structurally integrated, slightly undercutting full conceptual necessity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The crystal gazer is present throughout and makes two key choices: threading the film and pressing her palm (setup/method), then writing the new goodbye (closure participation). The middle warehouse walk is rich but largely observational until she finds her own name, which shifts her from reader to subject. The final choice to "mark the shelf, so the next wanderer could locate the aisle" shows agency with cost (abandoning pure expertise), though the decision's target and consequences remain slightly abstract. Early signal is strong; causal pressure moderate; closure linkage clear but would be stronger if the goodbye's recipient and stakes were dramatized rather than implied.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The film strip appears in three distinct beats: initial removal from the tin, threading through the projector to "give it muscle memory," and the final moment when "the booth glowed with faded faces" as she slides letters into its path. Each use advances the method and metaphor—from relic to conduit to illumination device. The object constrains her ritual (must be wound to activate the reading) and charges the closure image (projection as threshold-crossing). Strong integration across setup, development, and payoff. Could score higher if the film strip's specific imagery or content (blocking, angles, footprints in ash) directly altered a tactical choice rather than serving primarily as atmospheric anchor.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Goodbye letters shape stakes from the opening (the quest to understand them) and drive the middle revelation (they are "scripts for unperformed scenes"). They enable the psychometry method (paper edge grazing skin), constrain the warehouse visualization (each letter becomes a door), and anchor the closure action (writing a new goodbye that redefines their function from abandonment to threshold-marking). The concept reweights meaningfully: from unsent farewells to "do not leave." Present in all three gates with strong causal pressure and closure participation. The letters' physical properties (concave paper, crossed-out names, invented addresses) supply concrete handles that the protagonist manipulates, and their transformation is undeniable on the page.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Spatially imaginative" is signaled early ("not just in maps and buildings, but in feelings, which she pictured as rooms, stairs, and dead ends") and enables the warehouse visualization that dominates the middle. However, the trait remains largely perceptual rather than constraining action with visible cost—she doesn't, for example, navigate a physical maze where spatial skill matters, or fail at a task that requires linear thinking. The method relies on this trait, but it functions more as narrative voice (the metaphoric vocabulary) than as a capability with tradeoffs. Functional and integrated into characterization; not irreplaceable for plot causality. Lyric allowance applies: the trait charges the final image's resonance without mid-scene tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Incubate" is signaled early ("she would incubate a tender heat in the reels and letters") and motivates the threading/palm-pressing ritual. The metaphor recurs implicitly in the warming of the booth and the "glowed with faded faces" moment. However, the action itself is completed in one beat (threading the projector, touching the gate) and doesn't undergo development or face obstacles—she simply performs it and the vision follows. No meaningful complication or cost attached to the incubation itself; it's method-as-described rather than method-under-pressure. Present in setup and payoff with moderate causal role, but easily swappable for another ritual term (e.g., "activate," "awaken") without structural loss. Mid-band for reliable presence and thematic fit; lacks irreplaceability or escalation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Psychometry reading is described early ("a psychometry reading performed while forgotten lyrics search for tune") and executed in the middle (palm on metal gate, letter edge to skin, sensory/spatial vision). The method's mechanics matter: contact with objects, synesthetic progression (smells → streetlights → door), and the projector's responsive "growl." It constrains her approach (must touch, must wait for objects to "sigh") and enables the warehouse vision that drives the discovery. Present in all three gates with clear causal role. However, the method feels somewhat interchangeable with generic clairvoyance or meditation—no unique cost or failure mode distinguishes psychometry specifically from other intuitive practices. Solid integration; lacks the specificity or complication that would make this exact method irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The vintage movie palace projection booth supplies the film strip, projector, and spatial containment that enable the entire ritual. The setting is richly detailed (iron ladder, spattered table, cooled drum, metal gate, rafters) and each element is used: table holds materials, projector receives film and responds with sound/movement, gate receives her palm, booth "trembles" and "glows" at key beats. The setting constrains choice (she must climb to reach it, must use the projector's mechanism) and charges the final image (booth as threshold between reel-time and real-time, projection as metaphor for unused possibilities). Present continuously; irreplaceable—no other setting offers these specific tools and metaphoric resonance. Strong causal pressure and closure integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"While forgotten lyrics search for tune" is invoked twice: in the method description ("performed while forgotten lyrics search for tune, because that was when objects sighed the loudest") and near the end ("In the faint static she heard the forgotten lyrics search for tune"). The timeframe is poetic and atmospheric but remains abstract—no live clock pressure, no sense that the reading must complete before the lyrics find their tune or the storm ends. It doesn't tighten decisions or alter tactics. The phrase enriches tone and reinforces the theme of incompletion seeking form, but functions as metaphoric overlay rather than structural constraint. Present in setup and late reprise; ornamental rather than causal. Lyric allowance mitigates slightly, but even as mood anchor it's replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The motivation "to find where unused love is stored" is stated in the second sentence and drives every beat: climbing to the booth, performing the reading, walking the warehouse, discovering her own name, writing the new goodbye. The quest is dramatized through concrete actions (threading film, touching letters, opening boxes) and faces meaningful friction when she realizes "expertise and longing had to keep distance." The final action directly answers the opening question with visible cost: she marks the shelf and writes a counter-goodbye, shifting from finder to participant. Strong presence across all gates, clear causal pressure, and closure participation. The desire could show slightly more internal conflict earlier (she seems confident in her method until the self-discovery), but the revelation and response are earned.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Hushed thunder" appears in the opening line ("storm outside softened into hushed thunder"), recurs mid-story ("a hush that was thunder if you pressed your ear to it"), and resolves in the final line ("thunder outside finally spoke aloud, risings and fallings like hands learning to hold"). The tone—quiet intensity, muted power—remains coherent through the accumulative design and modulates appropriately: suppressed at the start, internalized during the vision, released at closure. It charges the final image by shifting from held-back to articulated, mirroring the protagonist's arc from containment to expression. Strong lyric integration and closure linkage. Could score higher if the tone shaped a tactical choice (e.g., hurrying before the storm breaks) rather than functioning solely as atmospheric correlative.</comment>
