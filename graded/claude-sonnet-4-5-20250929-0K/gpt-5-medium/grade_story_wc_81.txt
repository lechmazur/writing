<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ossa's interiority is concrete and character-particular ("soft bruise of its weight, the way a promise leans"), with clear motivation rooted in intellectual integrity. The arc from patient observation to active testing of doctrine is earned through embodied perception (stamp's weight, violet ink, cracked pearwood). Minor limitation: the protagonist operates largely alone, so relational pressure and contradictory impulses remain muted; the choice to hide the stamp feels like preservation rather than a trade-off that forecloses a live path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The blackout creates a clear before/after in sonic environment, allowing evidence to "stand out from rumor like ink separating from water." Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Ossa hides the stamp "not to hoard it, but to keep it near the words that understood its weight"—a refusal that forecloses broadcast and accepts the cost of patience. The cost is conceptual (truth remains local, not proclaimed) but legible in the final image. Escalation operates through density increase and pattern break (each stamped document tightens the alternative hypothesis). One meaningful deepening: the registrar's margin note pivots the flood from accident to complicity, reweighting all prior material.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The submerged library is rendered through selective, pressure-driven detail: barnacled arches, crabs in ducts, salt-weeping books, swollen map drawer. The setting constrains choice (blackout silences generators, enabling proof to emerge; drawer "bone-dry from neglect despite its swollen lips" supplies the stamp). The stamp's materiality (pearwood cracks, violet ghost ink, "soft bruise" weight) charges the final act of concealment. Spatial choreography is clean (stacks, ducts, drawer, margins, hiding place). The body and tool (stamp, wick, pressure of light through sailcloth) function as micro-setting that alters tactics at each turn.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: "trace honest origins in a city that has forgotten how to sign its name." The blackout is not mere backdrop—it removes ambient hum, allowing "proof [to] stand out from rumor." Pressure tightens through a chain of discoveries: news bill predates official timeline → council minutes show imports not weather → registrar's margin proposes "we were lowered, not lost." Each stamped document narrows interpretive options and raises conceptual cost. Agency is sustained through micro-choices (pull drawer, press stamp, test citations backward). The ending forecloses broadcast in favor of proximity ("keep it near the words"), a renunciation with felt cost. One clean escalation loop under the Accumulative lens, no coincidence rescue.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: the tension between rehearsed narrative and honest origins, between ownership and attribution, between convenience and complicity. The stamp becomes the engine of "gentle suspicion" and "alternative hypothesis," reweighting the flood from accident to decision ("we were lowered, not lost"). The final image—hiding the stamp behind the registrar's journals—offers a non-literal answer to the central question: truth is preserved through proximity and patience, not proclamation. No thematic echo or stated moral; the ending trusts resonance. Subtext operates through ink, silence, weight, and concealment without meta-commentary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "tranquilly perceptive," filtering detail through archival sensibility ("method of gentle suspicion," "pages dry like leaves in a careful wind"). Diction is controlled and voice-particular ("candid hands," "a promise leans," "dappled resolve lacquered onto every spine"). POV modesty is consistent—no omniscience, only inference anchored in documents. Psychic distance is stable; free indirect style clean. Compression and rhythm modulate with pressure (short declaratives during discovery, longer syntax during reflection). No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks, no dialogue to test. Figurative density is high but coherent and voice-motivated throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "bone-dry from neglect despite its swollen lips" conveys state, history, contradiction). Rhythm varies purposefully, sentence openings shift, no paraphrase loops detected. Figurative language is thick ("stone lung schooling itself to breathe less," "towers rolled on hidden bearings") but coherent within the submerged-archive idiom. Minor concern: density approaches ornamental in a few beats (e.g., "dappled resolve lacquered onto every spine") where metaphor stacks without advancing pressure—this flirts with overwriting but remains legible and voice-consistent. No scaffold, loops, or template cadence. Propulsion is steady.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The sunken-library premise is familiar, but the synthesis—stillness as epistemological tool, the blackout as revelation device, archival indexing as resistance—feels specific and non-obvious. The alternative-hypothesis method and the registrar's margin note ("we were lowered, not lost") transform the flood from natural disaster into conspiracy, reframing all prior material. Emotional specificity (the stamp's "soft bruise," ink as "held breath") avoids template responses. The piece commits fully to its premise and follows implications without retreat. Risk: lyric density and reflection-heavy mode; payoff: the closure effect is legible and earned under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character "logical page indexer" is present by the opening line and drives two major beats: waiting for the blackout to enable clear perception, and systematically testing stories with the stamp. The final choice—to hide the stamp "near the words that understood its weight"—is a renunciation that forecloses broadcast and accepts the cost of patience. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, causal pressure +0.8. The title/role constrains tactics (indexing method, gentle suspicion) and charges the ending.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Object "antique ink stamp" appears in the map drawer (setup), is pressed across multiple documents in distinct beats (news bill, council minutes, registrar margin), and is hidden behind journals in the final image—reweighted from tool to artifact of honest origins. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.2, causal pressure +1.0, specificity (pearwood, violet ink, cracked handle) +0.6. The stamp's materiality and evolving use (mark, trace, conceal) are indispensable to the plot and theme.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Concept "reclaimed stillness" frames the blackout's function: when generators hush, "proof stands out from rumor like ink separating from water." It shapes stakes (Ossa waited for this quiet) and reappears in the ending ("the stillness we had reclaimed still clung"). Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.8, causal pressure +0.7. The concept enables the investigative method but operates somewhat obliquely—more atmospheric than decisively tactical. Solid lyric integration but not fully irreplaceable to plot mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Attribute "tranquilly perceptive" is declared in paragraph three and colors narration throughout ("patient teacher," "method of gentle suspicion"). It constrains approach (no brash conclusions) and enables the layered reading of documents. Early signal +0.4, pervasive tonal presence but modest beat-level cost. The trait is voice-consistent but not tested by a trade-off with visible price; it remains largely label-affirmed rather than dramatized under stress. Lyric allowance applies; still, trait does not force a single pivotal choice with clear opportunity cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Action "readjust" appears once in paragraph seven: "I lit a wick and readjust the straps of my pack, the habit of readiness older than me." The gesture signals preparation but does not create a turn or constrain later choices; removing it would not alter plot or stakes. Ornamental use −0.8, late single mention −0.4, no beat involvement beyond atmosphere. The action reads as atmospheric detail rather than causal lever. Swappable with "shift," "tighten," or similar without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Method "alternative hypothesis" is signaled in paragraph thirteen ("my inheritance, a method of gentle suspicion, a way to advance by alternative hypothesis where arrogance had once marched") and enacted across multiple beats: questioning whether the storm began with a decision, testing ledgers and minutes, following the registrar's margin note ("propose an alternative hypothesis: that we were lowered, not lost"). Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.0, causal pressure +1.2. The method is indispensable to escalation and thematic resonance; the protagonist's investigative stance depends on it.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setting "forgotten library inside a sunken city" is anchored in the opening lines and recurs through barnacled arches, ducts, stacks, map drawer, sailcloth-patched minutes. The environment constrains choice (blackout enables quiet investigation, swollen drawer hides the stamp, pressure of light through sailcloth reveals redacted text). Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.1, closure linkage +0.5 (stacks sigh, stillness clings). The setting is irreplaceable: the flood's cause is the investigation's subject, and the library's decay supplies tactical resources.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Timeframe "during the blackout" is signaled in the opening ("When the generators failed and the blackout tumbled") and bookends the narrative: "I worked until the wick guttered… until the blackout lifted." The blackout creates urgency (limited wick time) and enables the method (silence allows proof to emerge). Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.8, causal pressure +0.9. The time constraint is functional but not tightly tracked beat-by-beat; still, it shapes the window of opportunity and charges the ending ("the stillness we had reclaimed still clung").</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation "to trace honest origins" is declared in paragraph nine ("I needed it not to mark ownership, but to trace honest origins in a city that has forgotten how to sign its name") and drives every subsequent beat: stamping documents, following citations backward, testing official narratives. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.9, causal pressure +1.0. The desire is dramatized through sustained action and micro-choices; friction arises between wanting clarity and accepting the cost of patience (hiding the stamp rather than broadcasting findings). Solid integration with visible trade-off at the end.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Tone "dappled resolve" is established through controlled syntax, selective sensory detail, and steady investigative rhythm. The phrase itself appears late ("a dappled resolve lacquered onto every spine") but the tone modulates with pressure: calmer in reflection, tighter during discovery, resolute at closure. Coherence across beats +1.0, closure linkage +0.9, modulation under pressure +0.6. The tone is consistent and charges the final image ("stillness we had reclaimed still clung"). Minor cap for the phrase appearing only once and late; still, the tonal signature pervades and supports the Accumulative lens throughout.</comment>
