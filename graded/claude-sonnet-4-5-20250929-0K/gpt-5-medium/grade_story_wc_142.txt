<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Nessa's dual allegiance creates consistent internal tension through embodied micro-choices: pressing the chip into wet paint, meeting muralists under tarps, offering the trade with visible risk. The brother subplot adds genuine relational pressure that complicates her choices without becoming a second protagonist. Interiority remains concrete ("hope does not erase desperation, but it teaches it to sing on key") and the final ceasefire gesture carries earned cost. Minor deduction for some therapeutic phrasing ("hopeful desperation made me brave, or foolish") that slightly softens peak moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The piece operates under a Causal lens: Nessa's trade with the liaison follows from her encoding work, the chip-press into wet paint enables the raft realignment, which then produces the spending numbers that buy the season. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. The closure—steering "through paint and motion, toward a future that would not sell the past without buying our consent"—lands as Charged Poise with felt cost (one season bought, grammar teachable but not controllable). One persistent constraint (the foundation stone chip as authentication token) shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The raft city's carnival environment constrains multiple choices: VIP fences redirect foot traffic, the ballast-hold console reads the chip's "bite," murals whisper corrections "you could only hear with your feet," and the drum barge provides the confrontation setting. Sensory selection is purpose-driven (cobalt streaks, copper dots, salt and oil grime on the chip) and filtered through Nessa's professional lens as culture shock absorber. The carnival's physical properties—tents breathing like lungs, rafts realigning like ribs—ground the final act and charge the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—prove self-regulation to delay privatization—is signaled early and escalates through Nessa's agency: from passive mapping to active encoding, then to the liaison confrontation and finally the raft realignment that forces VIP/market fusion. The chip-press trade is a genuine tightening that narrows options with visible cost (one season's reprieve, not victory). The brother's torn allegiance adds secondary pressure without diluting focus. The final image acknowledges the cost ("seasons are how rafts survive, one patched plank at a time") and the ongoing nature of the struggle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete acts: the chip as authentication of memory, graffiti as encoded resistance, the realigned rafts as metabolic survival rather than confrontation. "Prosperity without memory was just a new accounting of hunger" earns its weight through prior scene work. The ending offers a resonant non-literal answer—steering by harmony rather than erasing desperation—without stating a moral. The foundation stone chip motif accrues meaning across beats (childhood dare, authentication, console interface, ceasefire touch) and reweights at closure without being forced.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The first-person narration maintains stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature: "I think in loops and ledgers, orderly intuitive enough to plan for chaos." Metaphoric density is high but mostly voice-consistent ("bright ribbon knotted over dark water," "harmony you can steer by"). The liaison's dialogue carries subtext and goal pursuit. Deduction for occasional over-figuration in non-peak beats ("gulls argued with kites") and one phrase that edges toward label-speak ("hopeful desperation") though it ties to the required tone element.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance situation or character ("By dawn the carnival had learned new ways to breathe, and the fences began to look lost"). Rhythm varies purposefully with scene pressure. Deductions for minor figurative muddle in the opening ("sea kept its own counsel in patient syllables" mixes vehicles) and a few template stems in the middle third ("We sent instructions… A streak of cobalt meant… copper dots meant"). The closure beat is clean and propulsive. No paraphrase loops detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—gentrification resistance through metabolic reorganization rather than barricades, authenticated by a physical token from the city's foundation—is specific and non-obvious. The color-grammar encoding and raft realignment as survival choreography transform familiar resistance tropes through embodied detail. Risk-taking in the metabolic metaphor and quiet ending heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The piece avoids both the safety middle and revolutionary cliché by committing fully to its premise of navigation rather than victory.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Nessa as culture shock absorber drives three key beats: encoding the graffiti, confronting the liaison with the trade, and realigning the rafts. Her professional skill set (planning for chaos, dual allegiance navigation) directly enables the story's tactics and constrains her options with visible cost at closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The foundation stone chip appears in four distinct beats: childhood origin story, authentication mark in graffiti, console interface that realigns the rafts, and brother's ceasefire touch. Its physical properties (grime, shape, ballast-console recognition) are irreplaceable; no generic token could substitute without breaking the causal chain to the raft realignment and the ending's charge.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dual allegiance shapes tactics throughout: Nessa's whispered arguments with her brother, her professional positioning between guilds and planners, the liaison trade that risks both sides, and the final ceasefire image. The concept generates visible costs (family tension, professional risk) and alters on-page options rather than remaining thematic decoration.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Orderly intuitive" is signaled in the opening ("I think in loops and ledgers, orderly intuitive enough to plan for chaos") and enables the graffiti encoding system and raft realignment, but the trait's specific constraint or tradeoff is not dramatized with visible cost in a single beat. It functions as a consistent skill set rather than a double-edged attribute.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Reorganize" defines the story's method and climax: reorganizing currents rather than fighting, the muralists redesigning alleys, and the ballast-hold realignment that bends pathways to fuse VIP and market zones. The action is causally irreplaceable; substituting "resist" or "disrupt" would require structural rewrites. The final image—steering through paint and motion—directly invokes the reorganization tactic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Messages encoded in graffiti art are signaled early ("cobalt meant cut through the kite hall, copper dots meant stall"), their mechanics matter (color grammar only locals can read, fossil spiral as Nessa's signature), and they enable the middle tactics before the raft realignment escalates the method. The liaison's recognition of the spiral as key drives the confrontation beat and trade.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The raft city carnival setting pressures every major choice: fences disrupt flow, kite halls and fish markets provide tactical terrain, the drum barge stages the confrontation, the ballast hold supplies the climactic tool, and the carnival's metabolic needs drive the self-regulation argument. Setting is not postcard but resource and constraint woven through causality and closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Before privatization" frames the dominant stake and creates urgency (the consortium's timeline, the need to delay the sale). The timeframe tightens the liaison's demand for guarantees and Nessa's "one season" reprieve acknowledgment at closure. It does not function as a live countdown clock within the scene but establishes the temporal pressure that drives all tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Navigating gentrification is dramatized through conflicted choices with visible costs: teaching the carnival "our steps" versus stopping time, offering the self-regulation trade with personal risk, the raft realignment gamble, and the final acknowledgment of one season's reprieve. The motivation generates friction between preservation and adaptation that shapes every tactic and charges the closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Hopeful desperation modulates coherently across beats: "hopeful desperation made me brave, or foolish" at the trade, the ballast console groan as breath, and the final image—"hope does not erase desperation, but it teaches it to sing on key." The tone charges the closure by making the one-season survival both victory and ongoing struggle, neither collapsing into optimism nor pessimism.</comment>
