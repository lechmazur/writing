<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's intuitively descriptive trait is embodied through concrete choices—catalog by smell, farewell by color—and drives the leaf-as-compass attempt. Harbor's character is richly particularized (ears like folded flags, nose knows grief) with embodied presence across beats. Motivation to translate distance into closeness operates clearly through micro-choices: trading copper teeth, lighting the wax, walking to the relay. Minor weakness: the radio tech's backstory arrives late and resolves a problem mostly through off-stage preparation rather than on-page struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the relay conversation and sister's message reweight distance with felt relational cost and the final walk back delivers Harbor's nodding acknowledgment that scars speak in colors. The accumulative/textural lens is inferred early (poetic density, sensory layering) and holds through the lyric ending. Escalation reads as density increase and cadence shift: market riddle unlocks cylinder method, dusk ritual charges the relay, and the exchange reconfigures the dominant stake. Orientation anchors cleanly by line 3 (Sluice, scrapyard, narrator-I-Harbor). One micro turn (vendor's riddle) sets up closure without introducing a second decisive change.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The waxed leaf constrains multiple choices: it becomes compass, signal device, and light filter that activates the relay. The scarecrow relay (rebar, twine, copper crow) charges the final image when the beak throws voice north. Sensory hierarchy is purposeful: rust, solder smell, honey-and-smoke glow all filter through the narrator's descriptive lens. Spatial choreography remains clear across market, home, and wasteland walk. The micro-setting (phonograph, crate, wax-heated leaf) drives tactics in the dusk sequence and shapes closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translate distance into closeness—is signaled in paragraph 9 and tightens through the riddle, cylinder decoding, and relay walk. One meaningful deepening: the vendor's riddle reweights the leaf into actionable signal, and the dusk ritual narrows options to this exact method. The relay conversation at closure delivers felt cost (the sister's conditional promise "if the salt flats did not rise" forecloses certainty) and reconfigures the narrator's stance. Agency is clear: the narrator chooses to trade, decode, and walk to the relay. Accumulative lens allows coincidence (cylinders exist, relay waits) to complicate without resolving; the resolution arises from the narrator's enacted choices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: scars as text, distance as lens not wall, closeness built from scrap and patience. The waxed leaf returns with reweighted meaning—first as memory, then compass, finally as light-key—without stated moral. The sister's line "distance is not a wall but a lens, and we can adjust the focus together" risks thematic echo but is character-voiced and tied to the relay's literal optics, so it reads earned rather than sermonizing. Final image (Harbor nodding, scars speak in colors) offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. No unearned epiphanies; insights arise from the cylinder decoding and relay experience.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout: "I can catalog a cloud by smell and a farewell by color," "the hush here was wild, quick as grassfires." Distance is stable first-person; no head-hopping. Diction is lyrically compressed yet legible: "gust sounded like a door learning to breathe," "copper crow...threw a thin voice toward the north." Purposeful compression (patterned poetic syntax) is taught early and pays off in the closure image. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—closer in the relay moment, pulling back for the walk home. Rhythm tightens under pressure (short clauses in the relay sequence) without obscuring clarity. Filter verbs minimal; interior thought is sensorially anchored.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High information density with vivid, purposeful detail: "bloodhound retired from finding bodies," "copper teeth for a phonograph," "scarecrow of rebar and twine with a copper crow for a head." Sentence rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence. Zero paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Minor figurative density in early paragraphs (homes welded from rib cages, gust like a door learning to breathe) borders on overwriting but remains coherent and voice-motivated, so no penalty. One small opacity: "letters rose like minnows where the wax cast its thin river onto the grooves" requires a second parse but clarifies within context. Propulsion is steady; no scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Core premise—secret texts etched in phonograph grooves, read by wax-filtered light—is fresh and tightly integrated with the post-war scrapyard world. The combination of descriptive cataloging, wax-preserved leaf, and relay disguised as scarecrow feels organic rather than checklist. Tropes (post-apocalyptic settlement, reunion longing) are transformed through specific lived detail (copper teeth currency, radio tech's paperclip repair, caravan salt-flat conditional). Emotional truth anchors the novelty; the sister's laughter "not music and not light but both" avoids sentimentality. Risk-taking in lyric compression and unconventional phonograph-signal method heightens stakes without gimmickry. One beat—vendor riddle—feels slightly convenient but is paid off causally in the decoding sequence.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Harbor is present across setup (finding resolve, watching leaf), middle (nosing crate to reveal tech's cylinder), and ending (lying down, ears shaping air, nodding). She enables one key choice (dragging out the initialed cylinder) and charges the final image with her nod. Causal involvement is moderate; her presence deepens atmosphere and theme but does not drive major turns. Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.7, minus swappability (another animal could serve similar function) −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The waxed leaf appears in setup (paragraph 7), drives middle beats (compass attempt, wax-heated to cast light on grooves), and charges closure (lifted at dusk to signal relay, staining air with honey and smoke). Three distinct beats, causal pressure (its wax properties enable the signal method), closure centrality, and high irreplaceability (the exact autumn-colored, wax-preserved leaf is mechanically necessary for the relay's seasonal trigger). Early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.6, closure linkage +1.8, specificity +0.8, cost connection (held until sun snapped shut) +0.5, minus no friction. Rounds to 9.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Tinted revelations shapes the middle beat: wax casts colored shadows (amber, violet) that reveal secret texts in cylinder grooves. It enables the decoding tactic and reappears at closure when the leaf's glow "stains the air with honey and smoke" during the relay conversation. The concept constrains method (colored light is required) and charges the final image. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.5, specificity +0.6. No major frictions.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Intuitively descriptive is signaled in paragraph 6 and demonstrated (catalog cloud by smell, farewell by color). It enables the narrator's choice to read the cylinder grooves and interpret the vendor's riddle, but the trait itself does not impose visible cost or narrow options under pressure. One beat (decoding), present in closure reasoning (reading scars in colors) but not causally active there. Early signal +0.6, one beat +0.4, causal involvement (modest) +0.6, closure echo (not causal) +0.3, minus label-only risk −0.1. Mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The vendor's riddle ("What wheel speaks when it cannot turn, and what voice comes from its scars?") unlocks the phonograph method in the middle beat and is answered again at closure ("every scar, if listened to, speaks in colors"). It redefines options (the narrator realizes cylinders are wheels with scarred grooves) and charges the thematic resolution. Present by paragraph 13, drives one major turn, and reappears conceptually at the end. Setup +0.7, one beat +0.4, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.4, specificity +0.7, minus late first appearance (past 40% mark) −0.3. Rounds to 8.1.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The method is signaled in paragraph 14 (vendor's riddle hints at grooves as scars), demonstrated in paragraph 16 (wax-heated leaf reveals texts in grooves), and executed at closure (leaf raised at dusk signals relay). It constrains two beats (decoding, relay activation) and is mechanically indispensable; no near-synonym would preserve the wax-light-cylinder chain. Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.5, closure participation +1.6, irreplaceability +0.8, minus slight late clarity (method fully described only in paragraph 16) −0.1. Rounds to 8.4.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The Sluice scrapyard supplies resources (phonograph crate, copper teeth currency, refrigerator skins, bus rib-cage homes) that enable trades and constrain choices. The cracked wasteland is the stage for the relay walk and provides the scarecrow setting. Environment shapes two beats (market trade, dusk ritual at relay site) and charges closure (desert's ribs, sand cooling Harbor's chest). Early signal +0.8, two beats +0.9, causal involvement (supplies tools, imposes travel cost) +1.1, closure linkage +0.9, minus partial swappability (a different wasteland could serve similar function) −0.4. Rounds to 7.3.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Post-resource-war timeframe is signaled in the opening and establishes scarcity (copper teeth, scrapyard homes, drowned museum) that motivates trades and the caravan's conditional return. It pressures the narrator's choice (drought lines, salt flats) but does not impose a live ticking clock on the dusk ritual. Present across setup, middle context, and closure (sister's conditional promise). Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, modest causal pressure (scarcity context) +0.7, closure echo +0.4, minus no urgent temporal constraint −0.3. Mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The desire to translate distance into closeness is signaled in paragraph 9, drives the leaf-as-compass attempt, market trade, cylinder decoding, and relay walk, and is reweighted at closure by the sister's lens metaphor and the achieved conversation. Visible costs: trading copper teeth, walking into wasteland, holding leaf until sun snaps shut. Friction between want (reunion certainty) and reality (conditional caravan return, salt-flat threat) persists. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.6, closure centrality +1.8, cost connection +0.6, specificity +0.6. Rounds to 8.7.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Wild hush is signaled in paragraph 3 ("taught us to listen with skin, rust, and memory") and modulates across beats: market whisper, cylinder shadows, relay hum, sister's laughter, "vast, breathing quiet" at the end. Tone coheres through turns without flattening and charges the final image (long land's breathing quiet, Harbor nodding). Early signal +0.8, three beats (opening, relay, ending) +1.4, coherence under pressure +1.1, closure charge +1.6, specificity (wild + hush paradox sustained) +0.7. No frictions. Rounds to 8.3.</comment>
