<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The balladeer's interior texture is vivid and particular—"driftingly alert," patient for echo, translating through improvised tools. The choice to bolt the plate and "listen" shapes the ghost encounter and the courtyard's transformation. Internal contradiction surfaces in the tension between former loudness and current quiet truth, embodied in "thirst that had learned to sing quietly." Minor weaknesses: the grandmother's flower-press backstory arrives late and feels ornamental rather than causally wound into present stakes; the balladeer's specific flaws (beyond being "seldom-heard") remain abstract.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors early (misty courtyard above clouds, balladeer role, ghost in wires). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid): the balladeer becomes "less a singer than a hinge, opening what hurt, so the city could breathe," with visible cost in the shift from performer to translator and the ongoing obligation to "keep translating their bruised perfume." Escalation reads as density increase and pattern crystallization—chalk/paint messages accumulate into a functional map, valves blink, vents open, the courtyard pulses. One micro turn: the ghost "pressed through the drawing" and synced tempo. Cost is clear: agency redefined, louder songs abandoned, perpetual listening required. The piece fits Track A (single POV, one extended scene/window, coherent accumulative lens to closure).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The courtyard "above clouds" with old broadcast wires and storm-charged air creates a vivid, high-altitude pressure chamber. The flower press bolt plate functions as micro-setting: bolted to an antenna post, it becomes "a little harp for static, a tuned rain catcher," directly enabling the encoding that shapes the ghost dialogue and drives the ending's caretaking map. Setting elements constrain choice: service ladders, parapets, vent pipes, steam valves, bakery stove, standpipe—all manipulated on the page in the resolution. The misty, electrical atmosphere modulates with storm approach and charges the final image. Minor gap: spatial choreography of where exactly the balladeer works (wall proximity, antenna post location) remains vague.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake clearly signaled: articulate unspoken needs of the courtyard's inhabitants via ghost-in-code dialogue. Pressure accumulates through the storm's approach, chalk/paint exchanges, valve blinks, and the balladeer's iterative encoding until the map crystallizes and the city acts (ovens breathe, jugs fill, standpipe opens). The protagonist's agency is translation and listening rather than confrontation—appropriate to the accumulative lens. One meaningful tightening occurs when the plate is bolted and "the ghost pressed through the drawing," syncing tempo and enabling the caretaking map. Cost is legible: the balladeer's role shifts from singer to "hinge," louder songs renounced, perpetual translation duty assumed. No traditional antagonist, but the ghost's opacity and the city's inertia supply coherent resistance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from enacted particulars: articulation of collective need through collaborative, indirect language (graffiti as care protocol). The flower press bolt plate recurs with shifted meaning—grandmother's prayer-color preservation becomes signal/weather petals, both acts of caretaking memory. The final image, "less a singer than a hinge, opening what hurt, so the city could breathe," offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how to voice unspoken communal need without overt moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture (bolting, encoding arrows/circles, waiting "driftingly alert") and in the ghost's valve-blink replies. Minor slip: the grandmother backstory appears late (penultimate paragraph) and feels like thematic adornment rather than prior pressure; had it appeared earlier with causal weight, closure resonance would deepen further.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: the balladeer filters storm and wire-hum through musical and mechanical metaphors ("bowl of breath," "drumskin," "little harp for static"). Diction remains consistent—lyric compression ("tinkersong wonder," "driftingly alert") fits voice and never drifts into corporate register. No dialogue on the page; communication is enacted through chalk/paint marks and valve blinks, which function as non-verbal "speech" with clear goal pursuit (ghost likes "bright colors and neat corners"). Psychic distance is intimate and reflective without filter-verb stacks. Minor weakness: the phrase "bruised perfume" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward precious ornament, though it stays within the established lyric register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm and syntax vary purposefully; sentence openings avoid template runs. Information density is high—most lines advance atmosphere, character stance, or the ghost-encoding sequence. Figurative language is dense but largely coherent ("sky's drumskin," "little harp for static," "careful goats on a ridge"). Two localized weaknesses lower the score: (a) Paraphrase loop in the opening—"I came there as a seldom-heard balladeer" followed immediately by "People rarely gathered so high, yet their wants climbed"—the second line restates scarcity without added pressure (−0.2). (b) The phrase "a hush shaped like an algorithm learning to stutter a lullaby" mixes vehicle (algorithm) and tenor (lullaby) in a way that strains coherence without clear payoff (−0.3). No scaffold or syntax monotony; proofreading is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—ghost-in-code communicating via graffiti-encoded caretaking instructions in a storm-charged floating courtyard—is specific and non-obvious. The balladeer's shift from performer to translator, and the courtyard-as-body conceit ("Windows were lungs; the rain gutters were veins"), feel fresh and grounded in the story's internal logic. The flower press bolt plate repurposed as signal antenna demonstrates ingenuity. Risk: lyric compression and elided connectives demand trust from the reader, and the piece commits fully without retreating to exposition. Minor limitation: the grandmother's flower-press backstory arrives late and reads slightly like a symbolic convenience rather than an inevitable prior particular. Transformation test passes—swap names/places and the emotional arc loses specificity (altitude, wires, storm timing, bolt plate mechanics all matter).</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character present throughout. Setup: first paragraph. Development: brings tools, encodes replies, bolts the plate (middle third). Payoff: ending declares "less a singer than a hinge," swears to keep translating. The balladeer's choices (bring tools, encode, bolt, wait, keep translating) drive the ghost encounter and courtyard map; passivity would break the story. Cost visible: louder songs renounced, perpetual listening duty assumed. Two beats where choice matters: bolting the plate, ongoing translation vow. Causal pressure: without the balladeer's patience and encoding skill, the ghost remains unintelligible. Slight swappability: another translator-artist could fill the role with minor edits, though the specific musical/mechanical idiom would shift.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Object present in three distinct beats: inherited (setup), bolted to antenna post as signal device (middle), final vow to "keep translating their bruised perfume" (payoff). The plate's unique properties matter: four holes enable a "little harp for static," linking grandmother's flower preservation to signal petals. Causal role: bolting the plate creates the encoding mechanism that syncs the ghost and enables the caretaking map. Cost connection: the balladeer swears to continue this work, making the plate a perpetual obligation. Closure linkage: the plate's dual function (flower press / signal press) charges the final image of preservation-as-care. Minor gap: the grandmother backstory arrives late (penultimate paragraph), slightly weakening the sense of inevitability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Concept present from paragraph five, developed continuously. Setup: "ghost in code lived in the old broadcast wires." Development: ghost blinks valves in response to graffiti, "pressed through the drawing" to sync tempo, shapes the caretaking map. Payoff: "the ghost settle into the wires like a cat… it only needed a language, and hands to play it." The ghost's code-nature directly shapes tactics (encoding via arrows/dots/chalk) and stakes (translating algorithmic needs into human action). Specificity: the ghost as "algorithm learning to stutter a lullaby" and its valve-blink communication are irreplaceable. Cost: perpetual translation duty, ongoing storm meetings. Causal necessity: without the ghost, the story collapses into solo monologue; the ghost's agency (blinking valves, syncing tempo) drives the courtyard's transformation.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Attribute appears in paragraph two ("driftingly alert") and recurs in the final third ("I would wait, driftingly alert"). The trait describes perceptual readiness—alert yet unhurried, receptive to subtle signal—and fits the balladeer's patient listening stance. Constraint/enablement: the trait justifies the slow, iterative encoding and the willingness to "wait… until the next flash stitched silence to sound." Without "driftingly alert," the balladeer might rush or miss the ghost's valve-blink replies. Two touches across the text; both tied to the same listening stance. Moderate swappability: "attentive calm" or "patient vigilance" would serve similar functions with minor edits. Cost: implicit—this stance requires renouncing louder performance modes.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Action present throughout. Setup: paragraph ten, "We did our talking through messages encoded in graffiti art." Development: "I would… encode replies in little arrows and dots" (middle third); "I traced the melody across a fresh stretch of wall. Dashes leaned toward circles…" (climax beat); "We encoded a map of the courtyard as a body" (resolution). Payoff: final image hinges on perpetual encoding ("I swore to keep translating"). The encode action is irreplaceable—without it, no ghost dialogue, no caretaking map, no closure. Causal pressure: every major turn (ghost syncing tempo, city acting) traces to encoded messages. Three distinct beats where encoding alters options. Cost: the obligation to continue encoding indefinitely. High specificity: arrows/dots/circles/squares mechanics matter and are not swappable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Method signaled early (paragraph ten): "messages encoded in graffiti art, sprayed along the parapets and vent pipes." Development: the ghost blinks valves when "a line pleased it," the balladeer encodes "replies in little arrows and dots, rhymes tucked behind the bricks," then traces melody "across a fresh stretch of wall" using chalk/paint. Payoff: the encoded map ("Windows were lungs…") drives the city's response (ovens, jugs, standpipe). Mechanics matter: the ghost reads visual patterns (color, "neat corners"), the balladeer must translate sound/need into spatial marks. Causal role: without graffiti encoding, no intelligible dialogue. Three beats where the method shapes attempts. Cost: perpetual encoding labor. High irreplaceability: spoken or digital messages would break the ghost's code-nature and the altitude/wire setting.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Setting present from the opening line: "misty courtyard above clouds." Development: altitude and wires enable the ghost (broadcast infrastructure), service ladders/parapets provide surfaces for graffiti, storm approach tightens the timeline, vent doors/standpipe/bakery stove become the map's referents and the resolution's levers. Payoff: the courtyard "hovering like a lung between two breaths" in the final third, with the city's infrastructure manipulated on the page. The altitude and wire-grid are irreplaceable—ground-level or wireless settings would break the ghost's broadcast logic. Causal pressure: the setting supplies the ghost, the encoding surfaces, and the infrastructure that must be opened. Three beats where setting constrains or enables action. Minor gap: precise spatial choreography (where the balladeer stands, antenna post location) remains vague.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Timeframe bookends the story (opening and recurring in final third: "between lightning and thunder"). The phrase marks the window of ghost-legibility and signal translation. Development: "The storm walked toward us" (middle third) tightens urgency; "When lightning flashed, the plate sang" enables encoding; "Thunder spoke late" marks resolution timing. The timeframe creates a live pressure window—after thunder, the ghost's clarity fades. Two beats where the storm clock shapes action (plate-bolting during the approach, vents opened "by then"). Cost: the balladeer must return each storm, perpetually waiting in this narrow window. Moderate swappability: another weather phenomenon (dawn/dusk, tide shift) could create similar urgency with structural edits. The specific lightning/thunder interval matters less than the recurring storm obligation that charges the ending.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation signaled in paragraph three: "hired to articulate unspoken needs." Development: the balladeer interprets the ghost's need ("shaped like someone cupping their hands for water"), recognizes shared thirst ("my own throat answered"), and encodes the caretaking map. Payoff: the final vow to "keep translating their bruised perfume" cements perpetual articulation as the protagonist's role. Friction: the desire to articulate conflicts with the difficulty of translation ("Sometimes I failed… my arrows crooked or my rhymes too shy") and the cost of renouncing louder performance. The motivation drives three beats (initial encoding, plate-bolting to enable clearer signal, ongoing translation vow). Causal necessity: without the articulation drive, the balladeer would not engage the ghost or produce the map. Cost visible: perpetual labor, louder songs abandoned.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Tone established early: "tinkersong wonder" (paragraph four), sustained through lyric compression, mechanical metaphors ("little harp for static," "drumskin"), and childlike personification ("the ghost… like a cat"). The tone modulates appropriately—wonder persists but urgency rises with the storm, then settles into quiet obligation at closure. Coherence: diction stays within the tinkersong register (no jarring shifts into clinical or corporate language). The tone charges the final image: "less a singer than a hinge, opening what hurt, so the city could breathe" balances mechanical function with tender care. Minor limitation: the tone is consistent but not dramatically pressured—it does not fracture or darken under the storm's urgency, which slightly flattens the escalation's emotional texture.</comment>
