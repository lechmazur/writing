<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The copyist protagonist shows consistent interior life through embodied devotion to their craft, moving from numbering rests to teaching dust its grammar. The motivation to restore story after famine is sustained through micro-choices: tuning the radio, tapping pencil to establish common time, scattering ash over pages. Internal contradiction appears in the tension between trained precision and the improvisational demands of the pirate broadcast. The final choice to sleep "keeping time, because stories deserve a conductor who listens first" earns the stance with visible devotion-cost, though the character remains more observer than agent in key reversals.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first paragraph. The closure operates as Resonant Reconfiguration—the dust becomes fluent, the broadcast fades, and the protagonist commits to perpetual listening with the cadence marker "within my ribs." Cost is felt in the ongoing devotion and the cloaked, hidden nature of the work. One meaningful deepening occurs when Cinder asks for a listener "measure for measure" and the protagonist answers, shifting from solitary copying to collaborative testimony. The lens holds consistently through patterned accumulation of musical metaphor and dust-as-language.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The ember alcove functions as micro-setting that constrains action: the shortwave radio's glow must be cloaked to preserve darkness for listening, and the burned-brick surroundings provide the ash/dust raw material for the protagonist's work. Sensory hierarchy reflects the copyist's trained attention: "barlines as narrow as spider threads," "needle-snow fell from the rafters," temperature as narrative information. The setting charges the final image—mist leaning against brick, ember light for sleeping—and the floor itself becomes an active surface where stories curl from burns into letters. Spatial choreography (sill, shelf, floor, walls) remains stable and purposeful throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—teaching dust to tell stories—is signaled in paragraph five and sustained to closure. One meaningful tightening occurs when the broadcast asks for "payment in kind": a promise to carry tempo forward, which the protagonist grants, narrowing future action to perpetual curatorship. Agency reads as attention and endurance rather than confrontation; the protagonist's tapping pencil and careful notation enable Cinder's voice to take form. The resolution enacts Earned Stasis with visible cost: sleeping by ember light while keeping time, stories continuing without the protagonist claiming autonomy over them. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens through density increase and cadence shifts in the final third.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of careful witness and the grammar of loss emerges organically from copyist devotion, the calibrated relationship between silence and telling, and the recurring motif that "dust respects diligence and rewards exact measures." The final image—sleeping while keeping time, pages turning themselves—offers a resonant answer to the central question of how story survives famine: through listening first, perpetual care, and refusal of solo ownership. Subtext operates in the cloaked glow, the secret luminosity, the promise that "those who entered with thistled calm would feel the floor warming." The piece resists moralizing; insights like "breath is our hinge" arise from the broadcast's lyric address rather than authorial summary. Motifs (ash/dust, musical notation, ember warmth) constrain choice and charge closure rather than ornamenting.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single-POV distance remains stable; perceptual signature is character-specific (copyist precision: "barlines as narrow as spider threads," "measures too, but it needed phrasing"). Diction sustains musical idiom without slipping into generic lyricism: "I answered by tapping pencil on the shelf, establishing common time in smolder." No head-hopping; the broadcast voice arrives as external stimulus filtered through the protagonist's trained ear. Purposeful compression ("lines fell like sawdust") and non-standard phrasing ("secretly luminous," "thistled calm") are pattern-taught early and remain legible. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the exchange with Cinder and loosens in reflective beats without destabilizing the frame. Rhythm modulates with scene pressure: short declaratives during the tuning sequence, longer accumulative lines during the broadcast itself.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, stakes, or the dust-to-language transformation. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent: "voice arrived sideways, as if translated by a wary hallway," "refrain named a silence." Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes with scene needs. Minor template cadence appears in the mid-section ("They wrote the day... They wrote the night... They wrote the absence") but serves anaphoric emphasis rather than artifactual drift. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn detected. One brief register drift: "choreography for grit" reads slightly elevated against the otherwise grounded idiom, but does not obscure causality. The opening and closing lines anchor voice and recharge motifs effectively. Grammar and tense remain stable throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of musical notation, post-catastrophe setting, and pirate broadcast as grammar-teacher offers a non-obvious angle. The copyist applying orchestral discipline to ash-storytelling transforms familiar "voice from the radio" tropes through specificity of craft and the reciprocal relationship (protagonist teaches dust, broadcast teaches protagonist). The "story famine" frame and the figure of Cinder avoid stock apocalypse beats; the stakes remain intimate and linguistic rather than survival-action. Emotional truth in the devotion to invisible, cloaked work without recognition feels earned. The risk of sustained metaphorical density pays off in coherence and thematic charge. Transformation test: plot and arc would lose integrity if the protagonist were not a copyist or the medium not musical notation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character present from the opening; shapes two beats (establishing common time via pencil-tap, scattering ash and blowing to form letters) and the closure commitment to perpetual timekeeping. Causal pressure: the copyist's trained precision enables the dust grammar. Closure linkage: the final image depends on the character keeping time while sleeping. Specificity: the occupation is irreplaceable; a generic listener would not bring measure and notation discipline. Cost: ongoing devotion with no external recognition. Early signal, middle involvement, closure presence all met; role is enabling rather than driving reversals, which limits the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Object present in three distinct beats: initial description as "small lunar theater" on the sill, protagonist cloaking the glow to preserve darkness, and the broadcast's gift of a coda that "cloaked the shortwave radio dial glow under a paleness like breath on glass." The glow must be hidden to allow listening, creating tactical constraint. Closure participation: the radio "slept, its secretly luminous eye shuttered" frames the ending. Specificity: the visual glow (not mere audio) matters for concealment and the moth annotations. Early signal, middle use, closure presence; cost tied to secrecy. Causal pressure solid but the object enables rather than drives the central turn, capping below 8.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Core concept signaled by paragraph twelve; shapes the entire middle section (stagehands' rumor, tuning sequence, Cinder's voice teaching ash grammar). The broadcast's request for "payment in kind" drives the key turn: the protagonist's promise to leave scores and listen later. Closure linkage: the cadence marker left "within my ribs" and the fading broadcast frame the resolution. Causal pressure: without the pirate transmission, no dust grammar, no collaborative testimony. Specificity: "pirate" implies clandestine risk and regulation-dodging, charging the cloaking motif. Cost: perpetual obligation and hidden practice. All three gates met; essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Attribute appears in two forms: the radio's "secretly luminous" dial glow and the alcove that "brightened without heat, secretly luminous" after the broadcast begins. The secrecy constrains action (must be cloaked) and charges the ending when the broadcast cloaks itself "under a paleness like breath on glass." Present by paragraph eight, involved in the concealment tactic, and paid off at closure when "nobody outside the alcove would see my instrument." Cost: isolation and hidden labor. The luminosity is more atmospheric marker than irreplaceable enabler; swappable with "hidden glow" or similar without major structural loss, which limits the score.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Action appears in paragraph fifteen: "I drew my shawl close to cloak the glow, preserving darkness for listening." Functions tactically (enables the listening that follows) and thematically (secrecy, devotion). The cloaking recurs when the broadcast itself cloaks the glow at closure, creating a purposeful reprise. Setup by first third, middle tactical use, closure echo. However, the action is brief and could be replaced with another concealment gesture (closing shutters, dimming the dial) without breaking story logic. Lyric resonance lifts the score into mid-5s, but replaceability and single-beat focus cap it below 6.5.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Method signaled in paragraph thirteen: "The pirate broadcast stitched itself together via elusive song lyrics, teasing cadence from dust motes." The lyrics function mechanically: they teach "how to rake cinders into vowels, how to sift consonants from soot," the protagonist copies the cadence onto onionskin, and the lyrics "threaded a coda" that cloaks the glow at closure. Present by second third (acceptable given Lyric allowance), drives two beats (tuning/learning, payment/promise), shapes ending. Specificity: "song lyrics" (not prose, not direct instruction) matters for the musical-notation frame. Causal pressure: the method enables the dust transformation. Cost: the elusiveness requires patience and interpretive skill. Late first appearance (−0.3) and summary-heavy introduction (−0.2) lower from high-7s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setting present from the opening: "ember alcove in mist." The alcove's burned-brick warmth provides the ash/dust medium; the mist frames the pirate broadcast's "scored fog." The space constrains: "rooms surrounding my alcove had burned to brick bones," limiting movement and providing the soot. Closure linkage: "mist leaned against the brick" and "I slept by ember light" bookend the piece. The floor becomes an active surface where stories write themselves. Early signal, middle involvement (physical warmth and ash supply), closure charge. Specificity: "ember" (not cold ruin) and "mist" (not clear air) are load-bearing for atmosphere and broadcast mechanics. Irreplaceability solid; cost implicit in isolation and confinement.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Timeframe established in the opening: "After the story famine." Functions as premise and motivation driver (the protagonist wants to restore what was lost). The past famine explains the burned alcove, the absent audiences ("scores nobody played anymore"), and the stakes of teaching dust. Present throughout as context but does not tighten decisions or create tactical pressure; the "after" is static rather than a live clock. Setup clear, thematic resonance at closure (stories returning), but no middle escalation tied to time scarcity. The famine is causal backdrop rather than active constraint. Swappable with "after the fire" or "after the war" without major structural loss. Early presence and closure relevance earn mid-5s; lack of tactical pressure and replaceability cap below 6.0.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Motivation stated explicitly in paragraph five: "It wanted dust to tell stories again, and I wanted to teach it." Dramatized through the tuning sequence, ash-scattering experiment, pencil-tapping answer to Cinder, and the promise to "leave a score wherever ash settled." Friction: the protagonist's precision training conflicts with the improvisational demands of the broadcast. Cost: perpetual listening obligation, hidden labor, sleeping while keeping time. Closure linkage: "stories deserve a conductor who listens first" articulates the earned stance. Early signal, middle choices driven by desire, ending commitment. The motivation could be generalized to "restore art" without breaking logic, limiting irreplaceability slightly. Strong causal and closure work lift into mid-7s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Tone established in paragraph seven: "Night fell with thistled calm, soft but barbed, as if warning against easy dreams." Coherent through turns: the careful, devotional pacing in the tuning sequence, the "wary hallway" voice arrival, the "gentle" modulation before payment. Modulates appropriately when the broadcast fades ("thinned, as if the fog itself ran out of harmonics") and settles into the quiet ending ("unworried morning," sleeping by ember light). The "soft but barbed" paradox charges the protagonist's hidden, perpetual care and the final image of keeping time even while sleeping. Present early, sustained through pressure beats, and integral to closure effect. Specificity: "thistled calm" (not merely "quiet" or "tense") is irreplaceable for the exact emotional texture.</comment>
