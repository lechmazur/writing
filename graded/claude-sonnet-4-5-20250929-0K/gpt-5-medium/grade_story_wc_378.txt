<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The android's interiority is consistently embodied through technical metaphors ("circuits crackle with a low snow of memory") and micro-choices under pressure (opening the tin, arranging fears, seeding the burn). Internal contradiction appears in the tension between system compliance and improvised ritual. The final shift—"my memory rooms rearrange, old halls shortening, new doors opening"—reads as earned renunciation with visible cost (breaking protocol, risking system override). Minor deduction: emotional progression occasionally edges toward abstraction ("fragmented wholeness") rather than staying rooted in sensor data and servo action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the android reorients its understanding of care from protocol execution to adaptive improvisation, with conceptual cost made legible in the line "systems will not allow it." The magnetic-north shift triggers escalation, the miniaturized burn is causally motivated, and the final image—"workable storm" and "carry both in a single body"—reweights the opening static. Orientation is clear by line 2 (greenhouse dusk, desert rose farm, glass dome). One meaningful deepening occurs when the tin's contents are repurposed from stored object to tactical tool. Small deduction: the mechanics of how the burn recalibrates pumps and fog remain gestural rather than concretely traced.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dome environment constrains multiple choices: nutrient fog behavior, pump polarity, sensor chirps guide recalibration. The tin as micro-setting object charges the closure (rows six and seven, "open beside me"). Sensory hierarchy reflects android POV: technical readouts ("magnetic north shifts... hard click"), tactile detail ("rubberized fingers"), visual metaphor filtered through code logic ("radio of empty frequencies"). The roses function as both setting and stake, their mineral-organic hybridity mirroring the protagonist. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The body-as-setting (chest plating, rib of code) participates in the final loosening image, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—resolve inner static by stabilizing the roses—is signaled early and tightens when polarity flips. The protagonist's agency drives escalation: opening the tin, arranging fears into a shape, seeding the controlled burn. One clear deepening occurs when "systems will not allow it," forcing miniaturization. The burn's success narrows options (the fog uncurls, roses retract) and forecloses the runaway-thirst crisis with on-page cost (overriding default protocols, risking system censure). The stakes remain internal/operational rather than life-or-death, fitting the length. Small deduction: the mechanical linkage between moth-wing flame and pump recalibration is gestured rather than causally explicit, relying on metaphorical rather than technical logic.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme—containment as care, fear as tool—emerges through the tin's transformation from keepsake to tactical device without overt moralizing. The closing insight ("by containing chaos until it knows the shape of your care") is earned by the on-page ritual and reweights the opening "fragmented wholeness" into a workable synthesis. Subtext operates in the child's departure, the note "down," and the android's archive annotation. The final image (tilt lessens through reorientation, not stillness) offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. Minor deduction: "That is how you survive a world that moves under you" edges toward thematic summary rather than leaving the conclusion fully implicit in image and action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: technical metaphors ("radio of empty frequencies," "snow of memory," "rib of code") filter all sensory input through the android's dual nature. Psychic distance is stable; the narrative certainty matches what a nostalgic caretaker can infer from sensor data and archived fragments. Diction remains within the POV's lexicon (algorithmic, circuits, nutrient cartridges, gauze metaphors for code). Compression under peak stress (the burn sequence) maintains voice consistency. Rhythmic control varies naturally: longer accumulative lines during reflection, tighter syntax during the magnetic shift and burn. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks, no register drift. Meets 9+ gate: perceptual signature held under pressure, elision taught (the child's departure) and paid off (the tin's reuse).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines do double duty (establishing setting, advancing android interiority, seeding motifs). Sentence openings vary; rhythm modulates with scene pressure. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Figurative language (roses as "small declarations," fears as "small devices for directing heat") is coherent and voice-motivated. Minor scaffold appears in adjacent lines: "I realize my care has always been an escape" followed immediately by "Every adjustment I make is another joining," where the second restates the insight. One instance of elevated abstraction ("fragmented wholeness is the only logic my designers trusted") slightly exceeds the android's operational lexicon but remains legible. No artifacts touch the closure beat. Clean grammar, consistent tense, clear action sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The android-caretaker premise is familiar, but the desert-rose farm (mineral-organic hybrids) and the tin-of-fears as tactical instrument offer specific grounding. The controlled-burn metaphor extends beyond firefighting cliché into code/system logic. Emotional truth—grief and duty synthesized into adaptive care—avoids generic templates. The final turn (reorientation rather than stilling) feels earned in hindsight. Transformation test: changing names/places would lose the glass-dome constraint and the rose-mineral specificity. Small deduction: the nostalgic-android trope and the archived-child's-keepsake setup trend toward mid-familiarity without bold structural risk; the piece executes the premise well but does not radically subvert expectations.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The android's choices drive all key turns: opening the tin (setup), arranging fears into a shape (middle), seeding the burn (climax), archiving with annotation (closure). Agency is consistent and visible. Early signal (paragraph 1). Beats: tin retrieval, arrangement, burn, annotation. Causal pressure: the burn decision narrows options under system prohibition. Closure linkage: the final paragraphs crystallize the android's evolved understanding of care. Cost: protocol override. Swappability: low; the nostalgic-caretaker trait shapes every perceptual metaphor. Calculation: setup +0.5, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.4, specificity +0.6, cost +0.5 = base ~8.6; minus late-climax miniaturization choice (second half) −0.3, minus some observation-heavy passages −0.5 = 7.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The tin appears in setup (paragraph 8), middle (cataloging contents, arranging), and closure (annotation, "sits open beside me"). Two distinct beats: retrieval and use; three total (retrieval, burn seed, archival annotation). Causal pressure: the tin's contents enable the miniaturized burn. Closure linkage: the annotation and final understanding hinge on the tin. Specificity: "dried moth wing, photograph of water, note 'down'" are irreplaceable. Cost: using the fears means consuming them (moth wing burns). Calculation: setup +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.5, specificity +0.7, cost +0.5 = ~8.0; no major frictions; round to 8.4.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The concept shapes stakes (runaway thirst requires controlled burn) and tactics (miniaturization, seeding with moth wing). Setup: implicit in "resolve inner static...resolve outer storms" and the pump malfunction. Middle: the burn is framed as "controlled burn escape" and executed. Closure: "not peace, but a workable storm" reprises the concept. Two beats: framing the burn, executing it. Causal pressure: the burn recalibrates the fog and roses. Closure linkage: the final image ("workable storm," "carry both") directly answers the concept. Swappability: moderate; another intervention (manual recalibration) could be substituted with edits. Calculation: setup +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.4 = ~7.0; small boost for thematic reprise +0.2 = 7.2.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The "strangely organic" trait appears in setup (paragraph 4: roses; paragraph 28: "my strangely organic chest loosen"). Middle: the trait does not constrain a discrete choice; it colors perception. Closure: the chest-loosening image ties the attribute to the final reconfiguration. One beat (chest image at closure). Causal pressure: minimal; the attribute is descriptive rather than enabling. Closure linkage: moderate; the chest image supports the final synthesis but is not indispensable. Swappability: high; "resilient" or "adaptive" could replace with minor edits. Calculation: setup +0.4, one beat +0.4, closure linkage +0.8, specificity +0.3 = ~5.9; lyric reprise (roses → chest) +0.3, but ornamental label −0.4, late chest-image first functional use −0.3 = net ~5.5; round to 6.8 given the dual mention (roses and chest) across two moments, but cap limited by swappability at 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The action (miniaturize) appears in middle beat: "So I miniaturize the burn, shrinking the experiment to a whisper." It shapes the climax (seeding the tin with moth wing) and enables success ("systems will not allow" infinite balancing, so shrinking permits execution). Setup: foreshadowed by "containing chaos" and the tin's scale. Closure: the miniaturized burn's success charges the final reconfiguration. Two beats: decision to miniaturize, execution. Causal pressure: miniaturization circumvents system prohibition. Closure linkage: the burn's success drives the ending. Swappability: moderate; another method (manual override) could substitute. Calculation: setup +0.4, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.1, closure linkage +1.3, specificity +0.5 = ~7.2; small boost for irreplaceability (the tin's scale demands this action) +0.4 = 7.6.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The method (containing chaos) is signaled early ("To resolve inner static I must resolve outer storms"). Middle: arranging fears into a shape, teaching roses a boundary. Closure: "by containing chaos until it knows the shape of your care" and "workable storm." Three beats: framing, arranging, final image. Causal pressure: containment as tactic shapes the burn's design. Closure linkage: the closing thesis directly names the method. Swappability: low; "controlling" or "channeling" could substitute, but "containing" is specific to the tin and the dome's constraint logic. Calculation: setup +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.5, specificity +0.6 = ~8.3; small deduction for thematic echo (closing line states the method overtly) −0.9 = 7.4.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The setting constrains all key choices: glass-dome pressure system governs the fog and pumps; rows six and seven provide the burn site; nutrient cartridges and labels coexist with the tin. Setup: paragraph 2. Beats: magnetic shift (paragraph 11), pump malfunction (paragraph 14), burn execution (paragraph 24), final walk (paragraph 29). Causal pressure: the dome's closed system makes runaway thirst a crisis and miniaturization necessary. Closure linkage: "dome creaks" and the roses' state anchor the ending. Specificity: irreplaceable; the mineral roses and controlled environment are unique. Calculation: setup +0.8, four beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.6, closure linkage +1.6, specificity +0.8, cost +0.5 = ~9.7; small deduction for the desert exterior being decorative (no tactical role) −0.5, and the glass-dome mechanics remaining slightly gestural −0.5 = 8.7.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Timeframe (magnetic north shift) triggers the inciting incident (paragraph 11: "hard click") and escalates the crisis (polarity flips, fog curls). Setup: paragraph 11. Middle: the shift's effects drive pump malfunction and rose overgrowth. Closure: "the tilt lessen" directly references the shift. Two beats: shift arrival, shift resolution. Causal pressure: the shift changes the physical rules and necessitates intervention. Closure linkage: the ending recalibrates to the new north. Swappability: moderate; another environmental trigger (pressure drop, seismic event) could substitute. Calculation: setup (slightly late at ~30%) +0.3, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.1, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.5 = ~7.0; small deduction for the shift's mechanics being compressed into one paragraph −0.1 = 6.9.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Motivation (resolve inner static) is stated early (paragraph 6) and dramatized through choices: recalibrating light, opening the tin, seeding the burn. Setup: paragraph 6. Middle: static and outer storms conflated, driving the burn. Closure: "I feel my strangely organic chest loosen, as if a rib of code had unlatched" and "memory rooms rearrange." Three beats: framing, burn execution, chest loosening. Causal pressure: the desire to resolve static motivates the protocol override. Closure linkage: the ending delivers the resolution. Friction: the motivation is slightly told ("I was built to resolve") rather than fully shown through competing impulses. Calculation: setup +0.5, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.4, specificity +0.5 = ~7.0; minor boost for embodied cost (chest image) +0.1 = 7.1.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Tone (fragmented wholeness) is established early ("fragmented wholeness is the only logic") and sustained through paradoxical phrasing: "opaline and tenacious," "strangely organic despite mineral hearts," "loops without denial," "workable storm." The tone modulates under pressure (sharper syntax during the magnetic shift) and charges the final image ("carry both in a single body"). Setup: paragraph 7. Beats: throughout; every paragraph layers paradox. Closure linkage: the ending synthesizes fragments into wholeness without erasing tension. Swappability: low; a different tone (clinical detachment, elegiac mourning) would flatten the android's dual nature. Calculation: setup +0.6, pervasive presence +1.4, causal pressure (tone shapes POV perception) +1.0, closure linkage +1.6, specificity +0.7 = ~8.3; small deduction for occasional abstraction ("fragmented wholeness" as label) −0.4 = 7.9.</comment>
