<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The archivist's methodology ("gently thorough") is stated but the narrator's interiority remains at a distance—more oracle than person under pressure. The woman's emotion is embodied (breath tremors, locket clicks), yet her arc from grief to tentative reunion lacks visible internal contradiction or struggle; the footsteps arrive as convenience rather than as a choice she precipitates. The final shared departure carries symbolic weight but no on-page micro-choice by either party that forecloses a path with felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered images (locket, thermos, jetty bloom) and the archivist's ritual compresses memory into present anchors. The reunion arrives as situational coincidence (footsteps at dusk) rather than causally earned by the woman's or archivist's prior moves, weakening the closure's felt cost. Orientation is clear by ~80 words (jetty, archivist role, woman with locket). The ending delivers Resonant Reconfiguration (couple's ladder rebuilt through proximate causes) with thematic cost legible in the archivist's sealing act, though the coincidental timing prevents full 8+ entry.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The jetty setting is vivid and purposeful: sea thrift, glasswort, warm boards, barnacle alphabets, and the exact rail from the locket photo all constrain the archivist's method and charge the woman's recognition. Sensory detail (tide hum, walnut ink steep, gull in white parenthesis) is filtered through the archivist's perceptual idiom. The setting directly enables the tactical choice to walk the boards and supplies the contextual trigger (matching rail) that shifts the photo's meaning, meeting the 9+ gate for environment constraining choice and charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: the woman seeks covenant repair; secondary: the archivist's archival mission. Pressure accumulates through the ritual (ink prep, proximate-cause questioning, jetty walk) but escalation is gradual rather than sharp. The footsteps introduce a reversal, yet the coincidence undercuts protagonist agency—the reunion is situational luck rather than a choice the woman or archivist forces. The couple's subsequent ladder-building ("bus, thermos, pink scar") is told rather than dramatized, reducing visible cost at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as tactile reconstruction, covenant as accumulated proximities rather than grand vow. The archivist's method ("Lines are causes if you walk them") and the couple's shift from forgiveness to small anchors resist overt moralizing. The final image—locket as lantern, entry sealed with salt—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to whether records can repair what vows could not. Haunted euphoria threads the piece without therapeutic label-speak, and the ending reweights the premise (archive as catalyst, not fixer) with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is lyric and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature (walnut ink, proximate causes, "haunted euphoria bright as salt"). Distance is stable; no head-hopping. The archivist's diction is elevated ("regenerated covenant," "habitable shape") and occasionally borders academic register ("proximate causes" recurs six times, risking template cadence). Dialogue is minimal (woman's silent name-saying, couple's recounted conversation) and functional. Rhythmic control is strong in image-dense passages ("swallows stitched dusk to the sea"), though some lines risk opacity ("the archive had found the right depth").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout ("walnut-ink archivist," "sea thrift," "barnacles wrote their blunt alphabets," "wave a hush and a cheer") and occasionally stacks without pattern-teaching, risking overwriting in peak beats. "Proximate causes" appears in six lines, creating mild template echo. Information density is strong; most lines do multiple jobs. A paraphrase loop near mid-story ("context changes, photographs become timepieces" / "when context changes...meaning takes on habitable shape") slightly dulls momentum. No scaffold or clarity-breaking artifacts touch the closure beat, keeping the final image clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The premise—archive as memory ritual rather than document storage—offers a fresh angle. The archivist's walnut-ink method and proximate-cause framework transform familiar reunion tropes through specific tactile detail (locket photo matched to jetty rail, thermos/scar anchors). The lyric voice and micro-setting (jetty as archive stage) feel particular. Risk: the coincidental footsteps arrival undercuts earned causality and slightly reduces ingenuity at closure. The synthesis is coherent and the ending image (locket as lantern, entry sealed with salt) is non-obvious, but the convenience plotting prevents full high-band entry.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The walnut-ink archivist frames the story, performs the ink ritual, guides the jetty walk, and withdraws to let the couple talk—three distinct beats. The role shapes the woman's choices (to recount small moments, to walk the boards) and the ending image (sealing with salt). Setup clear by paragraph two; development via questioning and walking; payoff in the withdrawal and sealing. Causal pressure is present but attenuated by the archivist's oracular distance—observations guide more than decisions under personal cost constrain.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The locket photo appears in four beats: initial presentation (clicked with breath tremor), re-examination mid-story (background silver now specific to jetty rail), silent name-saying moment (locket clicks "like a heart learning"), and final departure (carried "as if it were a lantern"). Setup immediate; development via contextual shift (rail recognition); payoff in the lantern image that reweights covenant as portable anchor. The object's evolving use (from grief token to recognition trigger to shared light) is essential across beats and charges the ending, though the archivist's work rather than the woman's choice drives the reweighting.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The regenerated covenant is named twice ("regenerated covenant could be inked," "regenerated covenant take breath") and shapes the woman's request and the couple's final ladder-building. It appears in setup (woman's question), development (archivist's ritual as covenant reconstruction), and payoff (couple's proximate-cause climb "remade" the covenant). The concept alters the woman's tactics (from seeking repair to preserving proximities) and supplies the thematic frame. However, the covenant itself is more thematic echo than on-page choice constraint—the woman does not visibly trade one path for another; the footsteps arrive as luck.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Gently thorough" is stated twice and demonstrated in the archivist's patient questioning, ink preparation, and jetty walk. The trait enables the method (slow reconstruction) and contrasts with rushed or forceful approaches. Setup clear; development via ritual actions; payoff in the archival sealing. However, the trait does not constrain a choice with visible cost—it describes manner rather than forcing a trade-off. The label is repeated without friction or tactical consequence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Steep" governs three beats: the walnut ink steeping ("nib steep in the brown, slow as a moon"), the afternoons "steeping in the wood," and the final "covenant would steep and hold." Setup immediate; development via the jetty walk ("where old afternoons might still be steeping"); payoff in the sealing line. The action shapes the archivist's method (patience, accumulation) and the covenant's form (slow absorption rather than instant repair). Removing "steep" would require rewriting the temporal logic of memory-as-infusion, making it essential to the piece's central metaphor and closure image.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Through proximate causes" is named five times and drives the archivist's method: questioning small anchors (thermos, scar, joke), walking the jetty to map touch-to-trust, and the couple's ladder-building via proximities. Setup by paragraph six; development via the questioning and walking beats; payoff when the couple talks "not of forgiveness first, but of proximate causes." The method shapes the woman's choices (to recount small moments) and supplies the couple's reunion tactic. However, the high repetition risks label saturation, and the method is demonstrated more than tested under friction.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The blooming jetty at twilight supplies the matching rail (closure trigger for the locket photo), the warm boards where the woman walks, the thrift and glasswort framing the figure's arrival, and the tide rhythm threading the ritual. Setup immediate (paragraph one); development via the walk ("warmest boards," "barnacle alphabets"); payoff in the final bloom and sea ledger. The setting constrains the archivist's method (must be the exact location from the photo) and charges the woman's recognition. Removing the jetty would break the contextual match that reweights the locket and the closure image of the covenant "steeping" in the place.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"When context changes" is named twice and governs the photo's shift from generic to specific (matching rail recognized mid-story) and the entries' time-stamps ("dates belong to the hour when context changes"). Setup by paragraph eight; payoff in the final archival minute ("the color of the thrift, the exact slant of his shoulder"). The timeframe tightens the woman's recognition and the archivist's sealing act. However, the piece does not impose a live clock or urgent deadline—twilight remains static, and the footsteps arrive without time pressure altering tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The motivation "to preserve the weight of small moments" is stated three times and drives the archivist's presence, the questioning of proximities, and the final sealing. Setup by paragraph three; development via the ritual and entry-writing; payoff in the last line ("to preserve...until even absence agrees to be seen"). The motive is enacted on the page through ink preparation, questioning, and walking, and it shapes the woman's shift from seeking repair to preserving anchors. However, the archivist's personal stake or friction (cost of this work) remains implicit—no visible trade-off dramatizes the motive under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Haunted euphoria" is named three times and textures the archivist's perception throughout: "bright as salt," rising because "loss makes the world ring clearer," and the "buoyant ache" at closure. Setup by paragraph two; development via the archivist's observations under pressure; payoff when the entry is sealed and the tone confirms the covenant will hold. The tone is coherent, modulates with the woman's breath and the couple's arrival, and charges the final image (archive finding "the right depth"). The oxymoron is sustained without collapsing into single mood, meeting the high-integration standard for tone that shapes perception and the ending's felt cost.</comment>
