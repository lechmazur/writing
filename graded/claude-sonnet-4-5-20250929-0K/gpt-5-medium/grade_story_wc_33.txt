<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The mailman's interior voice is distinct and poetic, with contradictory impulses visible in "respectfully rebellious" and the tension between regulations and street needs. Embodied choices appear in staying with Mina despite risk, and the final delivery to the boy shows values hierarchy with cost. Minor slip: the transformation feels more cumulative than decisively earned by a single on-page crisis that forces irreversible change. Interiority occasionally drifts toward lyric abstraction ("promises break because we wrap them around the wrong emptiness") rather than urgent embodied thought.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Orientation anchors (mailman, disputed territory, sunrise checkpoint) land within the opening lines. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final delivery and walk through the cobalt arcade crystallize the stance with felt cost in "heart ungoverned" and the boy's postural change. Cost is present but oblique—the emotional and social price is implied through atmosphere rather than a sharp on-page forfeit. One meaningful deepening occurs when Mina's mirror reveals the boy, reweighting the route from abstract rebellion to specific care.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cobalt arcade, checkpoint fence, creek with spent batteries, and Mina's coal-lit doorway provide vivid spatial anchors. Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered: "water tastes faintly of pennies," "room darkens like a pupil closing." The jar (micro-setting object) constrains the narrator's caution and charges the final image when its rain contrasts the smuggling drones. Spatial choreography across alleys, market, creek, and arcade remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: foster fragile ties the border frays, signaled early. One meaningful tightening when the mirror reveals the boy waiting, narrowing the mailman's choice to deliver the misrouted letter. Agency is present in staying with Mina and delivering without proof, but escalation is gentle—pressure accumulates through atmosphere and moral calculus rather than sharp reversals. Cost is legible in the boy's postural change and the mailman's "heart ungoverned," though the price feels more emotional than tactical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—linking absences to heal broken promises—emerges through concrete route-finding, Mina's wire birds, and the mirror's cataloging. The ending offers a resonant non-literal answer: the cobalt arcade becomes a threshold the mailman "gets to keep," reweighting the brittle hush with small, embodied care. No overt moralizing. The jar and mirror function thematically without symbolic shouting, and the final image avoids stating the moral while making the emotional cost undeniable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout: "maps hold their breath," "promises whisper loudest...like coins rolling after closing," "rules are encoded in absences." Free indirect style is clean, psychic distance stable. Diction remains character-particular—poetic but tethered to the mailman's attentive, cautious stance. Mina's brief dialogue carries subtext and feels distinct from the narrator's interior voice. Rhythmic control under pressure: sentences compress during the jar-opening, then breathe in the final walk.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines serve multiple functions (voice, world, pressure). Sentence openings vary, rhythm modulates with scene need. Minor loop: "brittle hush" repeats verbatim in opening and closing, and "respectfully rebellious" appears twice without reweighting. One paraphrase slip: "I navigate by linking absences" followed by "A gap opens a map, and a missing reply forms a road" restates the same method without added pressure. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "weather drums" and "pupil closing around a light" work, though cumulative metaphor load in Mina's scene risks slight overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of mail-carrier specificity, disputed-territory liminality, and "linking absences" as method feels fresh and internally coherent. The jar as weather charm and Mina's mirror cataloging absence avoid stock plot moves. Risk-taking in lyric compression and situational pacing heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Transformation test passes: swapping names and places would gut the specificity of drones, checkpoints, and the mailman's navigational logic. One slight hedge: the "broken promises heal" frame borders on abstraction before Mina's concrete wire birds and the boy's waiting anchor it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mailman's choices create key turns: staying with Mina (mid), delivering the letter to the boy without proof (ending). Setup early, drives two beats, shapes closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Jar appears in three beats: carried with rising arm hairs, opened in Mina's room (darkens space, scent, mirror fog), sealed before exit. Reweighted at closure when its "gentler rain" contrasts the smuggling drones, charging the final walk. Causal: Mina's reading the jar enables the boy's identification.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Smuggling drones frame the setting (northern roofs, spent batteries at creek) and provide atmospheric pressure ("everyone pretends not to notice"). Drones return in the final paragraph to contrast the mailman's gentler work. Middle development is atmospheric rather than a direct tactical constraint; closure participation is thematic echo, not causal action.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Respectfully rebellious" appears as label in opening and demonstrated when the mailman stays with Mina ("the rebellion I can afford without endangering others") and delivers without proof. Constrains choice with visible cost—balancing risk and care. Two beats, closure-relevant posture.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Foster" is the verb framing the mailman's mission from the opening ("foster the fragile ties the border frays") through Mina's recognition ("you foster futures, boy") to the final successful delivery. Shapes all major turns; removing it breaks the logic of the route and the thematic closure. Three beats, causal pressure, closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Linking absences" is signaled early ("navigate by linking absences, plotting which windows never light"), demonstrated in the route method, echoed by Mina ("we should be linking the holes"), and confirmed by the mailman in dialogue. Shapes middle choice, participates in closure realization. Two beats, causal relevance.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Cobalt arcade bookends the story (twilight goal in opening, "threshold I get to keep" at closure). Provides atmospheric pressure and a visual anchor for the ending's emotional charge. Does not constrain a mid-scene tactical choice; functions as lyric reprise and tonal destination rather than active resource.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Day's lone mail drop" anchors the starting time and sets the twilight goal. Time progresses (sunrise checkpoints → dusk drones → twilight arcade) but does not tighten decisions tactically—the mailman's pacing is contemplative, not racing a deadline. Present in setup and closure frame, but clock pressure is low.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Find where broken promises heal" is the sender's plea, restated by Mina and pursued by the mailman through the route and delivery. Shapes the middle encounter with Mina and the final act of delivering the letter. Desire is dramatized with friction (risk, ambiguity of "healing") and cost (the boy's waiting, the mailman's ungoverned heart). Three beats, causal and thematic closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Brittle hush" appears in opening, middle (market shuttering, Mina's room darkening), and closing walk. Tone modulates: opening is cautious anticipation, middle deepens with the jar's scent and mirror fog, closing shifts to earned quiet ("lighter for knowing where to go"). Coherent under pressure, charges the final image.</comment>
