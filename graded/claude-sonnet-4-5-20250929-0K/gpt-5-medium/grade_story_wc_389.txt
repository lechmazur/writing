<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator exhibits consistent voice and motive ("lonely visionary," debt to storms), with embodied choices (brewing tea, tuning radio, meeting Brin). Internal contradiction appears when the narrator acknowledges "sin" yet proceeds, and Brin's "honest traitor" hunger creates interpersonal pressure. However, interiority occasionally drifts toward abstract ("biography of weather") without micro-choices showing cost in the moment. The closure choice—scattering seeds into lightning—feels earned by prior radio instructions and Brin's arrival, but the final turn lacks visible forfeiture that would anchor the decision's weight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors quickly (observatory, storm, tea, radio). The piece accumulates pressure through fragmented radio messages, Brin's arrival, town representatives, and the seeds/lightning climax. One meaningful tightening occurs when the "prophet" shifts from abstract pattern to municipal action (Knoll offers soil, priest blesses antennae). Closure lands as Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing: "allegiance unfolded like a kite's spine, locking ribs against the old wind" reweights the variant-allegiance premise with communal cost implied. However, the cost remains oblique—no visible forfeiture on the page, only atmospheric consequence—which keeps the closure shy of 8+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cobalt glass portico, storm, antennae, and radio constrain choices throughout: the narrator waits inside thunder, tunes frequencies, and the portico "creaks, then opened" at the climax. Spatial choreography is clean (mountain, rise, town below). Sensory hierarchy reflects the narrator's priorities (radio static, tea, brass rail rhythm). The observatory-as-setting charges the final image when "wind wrote on our cheeks" and seeds scatter into lightning. Gritty whimsy operates via "crooked spoons," "suitcase of seeds," and "work boots" grounding prophetic abstraction.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: "shape a new dawn using ancient shadows" is signaled early and pursued via radio instructions, Brin's collaboration, and town negotiation. Pressure tightens when the town arrives with skepticism and Knoll's variant allegiance, then deepens when the "prophet" becomes a hunger-pattern pointing cityward. The seeds-into-lightning act narrows options (public commitment, municipal soil offered). However, agency at closure is split between radio instruction and Brin's gesture, diluting protagonist drive. The visible cost—public miracle, town embarrassment—is present but soft; no irrevocable forfeiture or trade-off that we see pay out on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of variant allegiance emerges through particulars: town owes dam/cannery/cathedral, narrator owes storms, Brin's hunger, Knoll's shifting promises. The cobalt portico and antennae serve as recurring motifs that shift meaning (from isolation to communal aperture). The final image—"allegiance unfolded like a kite's spine, locking ribs against the old wind"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. No thematic echo in prompt language. Minor deduction: "biography of weather" and "revolution could be planted" edge toward abstract philosophizing, though rooted in scene action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "lonely visionary making tea inside thunder's throat," "lyrically prophetic," "suitcase of failed prayers and seeds." Diction is consistent, poetic, and controlled ("creek tasting winter," "rope-laugh," "petrels pecking the gale"). No head-hopping; single-POV with stable focalization. Purposeful compression and patterned metaphor (antennae as biography, allegiance as kite) are taught early and paid off at closure. Dialogue is brief but purposeful ("low as thunder," "not otherwise," Brin's warning). Minor slip: "Their absurdity sounded gritty, but their whimsy worked" momentarily explains rather than shows the tonal effect, but recovers quickly with "circuits blinked blessing."</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>High information density and rhythmic control: "observatory rode the storm like a ship," "gossiping bones," "stormlit observatory above clouds." Sentence openings vary; no loops. Minor overwriting in figurative clusters: "prophecy as pattern," "biography of weather," "stowaway instructions," "birds that refuse wings" stack metaphor without always advancing pressure. One paraphrase near the middle: "We were not building machines only; we were building the biography of weather" restates the project's scope abstractly after concrete action. No scaffolding or template cadence. Clarity remains high; no artifact touches closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: weatherwork as revolution, radio prophet as barometric pattern, variant allegiance reified through antennae and seeds. Gritty whimsy (work boots, crooked spoons, failed prayers) grounds surreal premise. The turn—prophet as hunger-direction rather than child—feels earned and non-obvious. Transformation test passes: swapping names/places would lose the storm-bound observatory logic and the nautical-portico anchoring. Risk-taking in metaphor density and lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring causality. No template echoes detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Lonely visionary present from line one ("lonely visionary making tea"), drives middle choices (tuning radio, meeting Brin halfway, answering Mayor Knoll, tuning bolts/lullabies), and participates in closure (antennae blessed, municipal soil offered). Causal pressure: the narrator's isolation and storm-debt shape all tactics. Cost: public exposure, town's embarrassment, shift from solitary to communal work. Strong setup, development, and payoff; essential across beats.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Cobalt glass portico appears in opening ("cobalt glass portico glowed"), middle (narrator steps beneath it with umbrella), and closure ("cobalt glass portico creaked, then opened like a tide"). Reweighted meaning: from shelter to threshold/aperture enabling communal action. Two distinct beats plus closure participation. However, no constraint on choice—it does not narrow options or enable a tactic under stress, only frames spatial transitions. Lyric reprise reweights but does not drive.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Variant allegiance established early ("allegiances were variant as windvanes"), shapes middle stakes (Brin's warning, Knoll's promise to "let us starve or feast, depending"), and anchors closure image ("Allegiance unfolded like a kite's spine, locking ribs"). The concept alters tactics: Knoll's shifting stance forces the narrator to offer public proof, and Brin's hunger becomes compass. Cost visible: town must revise loyalty, priest confesses enjoyment. Causal pressure across all three gates; indispensable to the ending's charge.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Lyrically prophetic present in setup ("lyrically prophetic it shivered the shutters"), constrains middle action (narrator tunes ether to parse the voice, builds vane/boils ink per instructions), and the radio's final naming ("lyrically prophetic, naming a child") reweights the prophet's form. However, the trait functions more as atmosphere than constraint with visible cost—no moment where lyric diction vs. clarity forces a trade-off on the page. Two beats but mid-range causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Unfold present in setup ("maps began to unfold us"), development ("pattern asked for doors," "allegiance unfolded"), and closure ("Allegiance unfolded like a kite's spine"). The action drives the turn from private instruction to public opening (portico opens, seeds scatter). Reweighted: from cartographic unfolding to communal/structural unfolding. Two distinct beats plus closure linkage; causal pressure moderate (maps demand sacrifice/dare, allegiance locks into new form). Not easily swappable—removal would collapse the closure metaphor.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fragmented radio frequencies present in setup ("fragmented radio frequencies, slurred by hail"), development (instructions arrive "through fragmented radio frequencies stealing warmth," baptism offered "through fragmented radio frequencies"), and closure (radio sang harvest, clouds flashed archives). Mechanics matter: slurring requires interpretation (crooked spoons, boiled ink), shaping all middle tactics. Cost: ambiguity forces trust in absurdity. Essential—without radio fragmentation, the weatherwork lacks its prophetic engine. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stormlit observatory above clouds present from line one, constrains all choices (isolation forces radio reliance, altitude above town creates power/distance dynamic, storm provides material for weatherwork), and charges closure (antennae on the mountain, wind writes on cheeks, seeds into lightning). The setting is indispensable: remove it and communal/revolutionary stakes dissolve. Three-plus beats, high causal pressure, strong closure linkage, irreplaceable specificity. The observatory-as-ship metaphor and cobalt portico anchor every turn.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Timeframe "across the rise of a prophet" present in setup and closure framing but not developed as live constraint. Time passes (overnight, morning) but does not tighten decisions—no countdown or escalating urgency that alters tactics. The phrase reappears late ("our prophet began to crawl across calendars") but remains metaphoric rather than mechanical. Two gates (setup, closure mention) but no middle development where time pressure forces a choice. Ornamental rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation "to shape a new dawn using ancient shadows" stated early to Mayor Knoll, drives all middle action (building antennae, interpreting radio, planting seeds), and the closure delivers municipal soil and harvest song as the new dawn. Desire is dramatized through project work and public declaration. Friction visible: town skepticism, priest's wink, Brin's hunger. Cost: public exposure, shift from isolation to civic entanglement. Three gates, causal pressure high, closure linkage strong. Minor dock: the phrase "ancient shadows" remains abstract—what specific memory or constraint anchors it is implied but not shown.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Gritty whimsy present throughout: "tea inside thunder's throat," "crooked spoons," "suitcase of failed prayers," "work boots," "rope-laugh," "circuits blinked blessing." Tone modulates with pressure (absurdity → working circuits → town gasps at miracle) and charges the final image ("miracles are embarrassing when they wear work boots"). Coherent across turns; no jarring register breaks. The tone is indispensable—remove whimsy and the piece becomes portentous; remove grit and it loses material cost. Strong setup, development, and closure participation.</comment>
