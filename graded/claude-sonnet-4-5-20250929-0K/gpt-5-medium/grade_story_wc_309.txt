<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal arc is well-grounded: underachieving mage fleeing automation, testing the spire's light, then returning to street-level practice. Micro-choices accumulate (testing mist walking, placing keystone, tugging to flex platform, removing it to refuse ownership) and reveal contradictory impulses—seeking validation yet refusing to harvest the moment. Embodied emotion appears in "cold rang like a tiny bell in my teeth," though some beats lean on stock phrases ("hands burning in the wind"). The final shift to "patient caretaker of questions" is earned by the sequence of refusals and small attentions, and the recurring climbs signal endurance with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening lines; the climb-and-descent frame is legible. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: pressure accrues through sensory density and recursive imagery (light as patient teacher, keystone as question, hush on hands) until the street practice reweights the dominant stake. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the protagonist climbs once more to unstrap the keystone, refusing ownership—a renunciation that forecloses commodification with visible cost (the ongoing climb, the street table work). The felt cost is clear in "apprentice forever" and the sky closing "with a satisfied, flickering smile." One minor loop near the middle recounts the light's nature twice without advancing pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The icebound spire, the fog-braided risers, and the notch in masonry constrain choices: mist walking skips broken steps, the keystone clicks into absence, the platform flexes "like a sail." Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—cold as bell-tone, colors as condolences, moths from exhaled doubts. The street kiosk contrast charges the ending return. Body and tool (boots, keystone) anchor micro-setting. Missing occupational depth (mage training systems) is appropriate at this length; the spire's physics and the city's automation remain coherent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding the sacred amid automation—is signaled early and tightens through the climb, keystone test, and descent. One meaningful deepening occurs when the protagonist realizes "the keystone is not a key but a question," reweighting the object from tool to inquiry and foreclosing ownership as a path. The street table practice demonstrates visible cost: offering "nothing but blank paper and a chair" with no profit motive. Agency is decision and renunciation (removing the stone nightly, refusing harvest). Under the Accumulative lens, pressure coheres through recurring images (light, hush, fog) until the final climb crystallizes the stance with felt cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: keystone as joke in gravity, light that refuses names, "underachieving" as "a lid someone else screwed on." The central question—what could you build if failure nourished attention—is answered non-literally by the street practice and nightly climb. No overt moralizing; the bowl "carved from cloud" with "room for rain, salt, and unreasonable laughter" offers resonance without stating a thesis. Subtext operates in silence (the notch "breathes if you stare long enough") and the hush scattering "like seed into their pauses." The final image reweights prior material: the sky closing "around its question mark" reprices the spire from destination to recursive gift.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: "brilliant dimness," "colors arise not as beams but as condolences," moths "cannot find the flame because the flame is listening." Diction stays within the narrator's lexicon—poetic yet concrete. Some filter verbs cluster in mid-beats ("I think of the word," "I realize") without voice motivation, dulling immediacy. Rhythm modulates well under pressure: short bursts during the keystone placement, longer breaths in reflection. No dialogue to judge. Psychic distance shifts intentionally from close sensation to reflective stance, serving the accumulative design.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere and stance. Rhythm varies naturally, though a few adjacent sentences echo structure: "I think of the word… I think of the word…" without pattern payoff. One paraphrase loop: the light's accommodating nature is restated across two beats mid-story. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("bowl carved from cloud," "hush stays on my hands"); "brilliant dimness" as oxymoron recurs purposefully. No major grammar slips. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line recharges the question-mark motif with closure weight. A tighter edit would cut the doubled "I think" stems and compress the mid-climb reflection.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—mage apprentice fleeing automation + garden folly keystone as cosmic joke + street practice as anti-commodification—feels specific and non-obvious. The keystone reframed as question rather than key is a fresh inflection earned by prior particulars. Emotional specificity avoids templates: "light does not fix me, but shows me a bowl… with room for rain, salt, and unreasonable laughter." Risk-taking in structure (accumulative lyric with recursive climbs) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The proximity check passes; no close echoes of famous lines. Transformation test: plot and arc would not work unchanged with different elements; the keystone's absurdist origin and the spire's patient light are indispensable to the thematic calculus.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The underachieving mage frames the opening ("I was an underachieving mage who had failed every glamour exam"), drives the climb decision, tests mist walking, places and removes the keystone, and shifts stance to "patient caretaker of questions." The identity reweights at closure: "apprentice forever" with visible cost. Present in setup, middle choices, and ending; drives three beats (climb, keystone test, street practice). Causal pressure clear; specificity high.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The keystone is stolen in setup, carried up, placed into the notch (clicks "like a tongue finding a missing tooth"), tugged to test the platform flex, removed at night to refuse ownership, and its joke-origin is repriced as question. Handled in four beats; evolving use from tool to question to recurring gift. Causally active in middle and closure; irreplaceable—the folly origin charges the absurdist logic. High specificity and cost connection.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Lingering luminance" is the spire's core property, described early as "afterglow of intentions never finished," tested when light spills after keystone placement, becomes "hush on my hands," and reappears as "low glow" in the street practice. Shapes stakes (seeking light that resists templates) and alters tactics (the protagonist uses the hush to seed pauses). Present in setup, middle, and ending; drives two beats. Causal pressure moderate; some mentions are atmospheric rather than action-linked.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Accommodates impossibilities" is stated twice ("the spire accommodates impossibilities"; "the street does too") and demonstrated when the keystone (never meant to bear weight) clicks into the notch and flexes the platform. Frames one key choice (placing the stone) with visible consequence. Present in setup and middle; mentioned at end but not causally active in closure beat. Functional but partly ornamental; label appears without always constraining action.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Unstrap" appears in setup ("I unstrap the keystone from my pack"), closure ("I climb once more to unstrap the keystone"), and drives the protagonist's refusal of ownership. The act of unstrapping frames the recurring renunciation; removing the stone nightly forecloses profit-taking with felt cost. Two beats; causal pressure high; irreplaceable verb choice that charges the ending. Could not swap without losing the deliberate stripping/refusal motif.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mist walking is introduced at the climb ("I tried mist walking for the first time. It worked badly"), practiced on descent ("I practice mist walking not to skip steps but to feel them"), and reprised at closure ("mist walking without steps"). Shapes two beats (ascent and descent tactics) with visible learning cost. Present in setup, middle, and ending; mechanics matter (skipping broken steps vs. feeling them). Functional; could be replaced by another movement spell with moderate edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The icebound spire anchors all action: the climb, the fog-braided risers, the notch in masonry, the platform flex, and the recurring ascents. Supplies resources (the notch, the cold, the fog) and pressures choices (broken steps, wind). Present throughout; drives climb, keystone test, and closure renunciation. Irreplaceable; the spire's patient accommodating logic is essential to stakes. High causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"The season when creativity gets automated" is stated in setup ("my city had begun automating imagination") and recurs at descent ("the season of automated arts has begun to hiss from every kiosk"). Frames the protagonist's flight and return but does not tighten specific beat-level decisions; time pressure is thematic rather than tactical. Present in setup and ending; shapes one choice (the climb) but remains ambient in middle beats. Functional; cost connection moderate.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"To find the sacred in the simple" is stated early ("I wanted to find the sacred in the simple, a spark not optimized"), tested through keystone placement and light encounter, and fulfilled in the street practice ("offering nothing but blank paper and a chair"). Drives climb, spire test, and street work—three beats. Conflicted in action: the protagonist seeks transformation but refuses to commodify it, paying the cost of "apprentice forever." High causal pressure and closure linkage; irreplaceable to the thematic arc.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>"Brilliant dimness" appears as mood descriptor ("The brilliant dimness began as a mood"), recurs in the street practice ("a low glow returns, a brilliant dimness that is not mine"), and charges the final image. Coherent through turns; modulates from initial encounter (thoughtful light) to street practice (scattered seed) to closure (sky's satisfied smile). Present in setup, middle, and ending; reweights the dominant stake. Oxymoron charges the lyric texture; tone shapes atmosphere and final resonance without didacticism.</comment>
