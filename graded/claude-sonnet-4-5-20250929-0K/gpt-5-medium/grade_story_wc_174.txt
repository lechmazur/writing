<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Sorin's arc from scripting satirical puppet shows to implementing ethical reform is present but relies heavily on reflective declaration rather than contradictory impulses in scene. The shift feels sermonic—"we were pickpockets of grief"—rather than embodied through micro-choices under pressure. The woman's entrance and stick-passing provide a credible turn, but her acceptance arrives without visible internal cost or hesitation. Interiority leans toward abstraction ("half-lit epiphanies rose like smoke") instead of character-particular perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the dome's hush and the story stick accumulate pressure toward the woman's arrival and her reweighting of the puppet show's ethics. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—the narrator learns to follow rather than lead—but the cost is asserted ("uncommonly serene…because I had finally learned") rather than made visceral on the page. Orientation is clean (who/where/when anchored early). The tightening from argument to invitation to opening night reads as deepening, satisfying the lens, but the final image lacks a sharp felt price that would elevate the closure effect.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The decommissioned radar dome constrains the action: its amplifying hush and curved shell shape the promise and the participatory performance structure. Sensory details—"meteor hush," "ribs of the scaffolding," vellum "like a puddle of moon"—are vivid but occasionally drift into metaphor that obscures spatial choreography (e.g., "strings crisscrossed the dome like constellations" is atmosphere, not blocking). The dome's architecture directly enables the final design where "the audience became the cast by degrees," charging the closure image. Micro-setting (vellum, coil of rope, campfire stick) integrates well.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—exploring ethical storytelling—is signaled early and sustained. The tightening occurs when the woman enters and her notes transform the show's structure, foreclosing the old method. However, the escalation is recounted in summary ("We built from her notes…their sentences curved like fish") rather than dramatized beat-by-beat, and the opening night is compressed into mood rather than a live choice under pressure. The story delivers one meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens, but the cost at closure remains atmospheric rather than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—ethical storytelling, power, and reversal—emerges organically through the dome's hush, the stick as prosthetic conscience, and the puppet-audience swap. The piece avoids moralizing until the final line, which edges close ("I had finally learned how to follow") but stops short of a sermon. Subtext operates in the woman's "caution yet carrying a kind of courage," and the stick passing functions as image rather than lecture. The ending offers a resonant answer (listening over applause) that reweights prior material. Minor theme echo in "reversing the gravity of the strings" reads as intentional metaphor rather than prompt bleed, and the conceptual cost (abandoning satirical theft) is legible.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a lyric, elevated register ("meteor hush," "half-lit epiphanies rose like smoke that forgot its fire"). The diction is consistent but edges into self-conscious poeticism that distances the reader from urgency: "urbane calligrapher" and "prosthetic conscience" feel rehearsed rather than felt. The woman's direct speech ("told us to keep the joke, but to turn the punchline so it landed where power had first been hiding") contrasts with the narrator's ornate interiority, creating voice distinction. However, the register does not modulate under pressure; peak beats (the woman's entrance, opening night) maintain the same elevated cadence, flattening momentum. Free indirect style is absent; all thought is filtered through declarative reflection.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Figurative density is high and coherent within its lyric mode, but several metaphors stack without payoff: "half-lit epiphanies rose like smoke that forgot its fire" is evocative yet obscure, and "meteor hush purling" mixes registers (astronomical + textile verb). Paraphrase loop: "Letters came easily…yet the letters I needed tonight were not for display but for removing my fingerprints" restates the ethical turn without adding pressure. Template cadence: "We would invite…to hold the stick, to decide…to cut scenes…and to tie new ones" runs parallel stems across four clauses. Sentence openings vary, but information density drops in the middle third where reflection dominates without micro-choices to anchor it. Line-level clarity is maintained, but momentum sags under decorative phrasing in high-pressure beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The core synthesis—decommissioned radar dome as participatory theater space, campfire story stick as ethical constraint—is specific and non-obvious. The reversal of puppet-audience roles transforms a familiar trope (satirical street theater) through the dome's acoustic architecture and the woman's agency. However, the piece leans on abstraction ("half-lit epiphanies," "reversing the gravity of the strings") where a more grounded image would sharpen originality. The final move—meteor hush made of listening—is quiet and earned, but the path to it feels more expository than inevitable. Risk-taking in structure (extended reflection, lyric compression) is present but does not heighten stakes; it slows them.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Sorin is named and present throughout. His choices—setting the stick down, drafting the new scene, offering the stick to the woman—shape two key beats (vellum scene, woman's entrance) and the ending (opening night as follower). The character is essential to the arc but functions more as vessel for the theme than as a source of contradictory impulses. Present in setup, middle, and closure; drives two beats; causal pressure moderate; closure linkage strong; specificity moderate (urbane detail is label-only). Band: 6.0–7.0 range. Caps: none. Positives: +0.8 setup, +0.9 two beats, +0.8 causal pressure, +1.0 closure linkage. Frictions: −0.5 ornamental "urbane" trait, −0.4 swappability (could be "remorseful playwright" with minor edits). Net ~6.7.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The campfire story stick appears in four distinct beats: Sorin cradles it at opening, sets it on rope, lifts it again to think of circle ethics, and offers it to the woman who uses it to steady others at opening night. It drives the ethical rule (holder must self-reveal) and constrains the finale (stick moves to faltering speakers). Setup early; two+ beats; strong causal pressure (creates the participation rule); closure participation (stick steadies audience); specificity high (physical object with rule-set); cost connection present (requires vulnerability). Positives: +0.8 setup, +1.4 three beats, +1.2 causal pressure, +1.2 closure linkage, +0.6 specificity, +0.4 cost. Frictions: none major. Net ~7.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Half-lit epiphanies" is named once early, repeated as atmospheric phrase ("half-lit epiphanies rose like smoke," "drawn by half-lit epiphanies"), but does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic. It functions as lyric theme-label rather than shaping on-page stakes. Setup present; no beat involvement beyond description; no causal pressure; no closure participation; high swappability ("tentative insights" would fit). Positives: +0.3 setup. Frictions: −1.0 ornamental, −0.6 swappability, −0.8 summary-only. Net ~4.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Uncommonly serene" is applied to Sorin at opening and repeated at closure ("I felt uncommonly serene…because I had finally learned how to follow"). The trait is label-only; it does not constrain an action or enable a tactic with visible cost. Setup early; closure reprise; no beat involvement; no causal pressure; swappability high ("unusually calm"). Positives: +0.5 setup, +0.4 closure reprise (lyric). Frictions: −0.8 label-only, −0.6 swappability, −0.5 ornamental. Net ~3.2.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Reverse" structures the entire arc: reverse the gravity of strings, puppeteers swap places with audience, reverse the current, turn the punchline. It drives the ethical redesign (middle beat) and the opening night structure (closure). The action is thematically central and causally active across two beats. Setup implicit; two beats; strong causal pressure (defines new show mechanics); closure linkage strong; specificity moderate (verb choice is apt but could be "invert" with minor edit). Positives: +0.5 setup, +0.9 two beats, +1.2 causal pressure, +1.2 closure linkage, +0.4 specificity. Frictions: −0.3 moderate swappability. Net ~7.3.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Subversive puppet shows in seedy bars" anchors the backstory argument and shapes the new performance (opening night inside dome with puppet-audience swap retains puppet method but shifts ethics). The method appears in setup (argument recap), middle (redesign), and closure (opening night). It drives the ethical conflict and provides the tool-set for reversal. Setup early; two beats (backstory, finale); moderate causal pressure (provides form to transform); closure linkage present; specificity moderate (genre is stock, bars are seedy). Positives: +0.8 setup, +0.9 two beats, +0.8 causal pressure, +0.8 closure linkage. Frictions: −0.4 swappability (could be "guerrilla theater" with minor edit). Net ~6.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The decommissioned radar dome enables the entire arc: its hush amplifies promises, its curved shell creates the participatory design, and its "ribs of the scaffolding" structure the woman's walk and the opening night. It constrains the redesign (dome acoustics require listening) and charges the final image (meteor hush made of listening). Setup immediate; three beats (promise, woman's walk, opening night); strong causal pressure (architecture shapes tactics); closure linkage strong; high specificity. Positives: +0.8 setup, +1.4 three beats, +1.4 causal pressure, +1.4 closure linkage, +0.7 specificity. Frictions: none major. Net ~7.6.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"In the hush left behind by a heated argument" anchors the opening and creates the reflective pressure (cooled air, aftermath mode). The timeframe is present in setup and implied at closure (opening night is later), but elapsed time is vague and does not tighten decisions. The hush pressures tone more than tactics. Setup early; one beat (aftermath reflection); weak causal pressure (sets mood, not urgency); closure participation weak (opening night time unspecified). Positives: +0.7 setup, +0.4 one beat. Frictions: −0.6 ornamental (time does not constrain), −0.4 swappability ("after the fight" fits). Net ~5.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"To explore ethical storytelling" is the explicit dominant stake, declared early ("if we meant to explore ethical storytelling") and dramatized through vellum scene, woman's arrival, and opening night redesign. The motivation drives two beats and shapes closure. Friction between old method (satirical theft) and new cost (vulnerability) is present. Setup early; two beats; strong causal pressure; closure linkage strong; cost connection present. Positives: +0.8 setup, +0.9 two beats, +1.2 causal pressure, +1.2 closure linkage, +0.5 cost. Frictions: −0.5 told-only in places ("we promised to carry the weight"). Net ~7.1.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Meteor hush" is named twice (opening, midpoint "the dome amplified tiny sounds, the meteor hush purling") and returned at closure ("that meteor hush made of listening"). Tone is coherent, lyric, and modulates slightly (argument aftermath → woman's entry → opening night stillness). It charges the final image by making silence a participatory act rather than void. Setup early; closure participation strong; moderate causal pressure (shapes atmosphere, not choice); specificity moderate (metaphor is vivid but abstract). Positives: +0.8 setup, +1.0 closure linkage, +0.4 one beat. Frictions: −0.4 ornamental (does not constrain action), −0.3 swappability ("cathedral silence" near-synonym). Net ~6.4.</comment>
