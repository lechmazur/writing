<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The cartomancer's interiority is richly embodied through concrete ritual actions—tracing cracks, naming gestures, pressing palms—that reflect contradictory impulses between guilt and the desire to reclaim time. Internal conflict operates simultaneously: she confesses failures while simultaneously seeking redemption through esoteric ritual. The final choice to "unfasten every future knot" is earned by the chamber descent and embodied confessions, forecloses simple solutions, and carries visible cost. Minor deduction: "willingly perplexed" risks label-speak but is redeemed by concrete puzzlement enacted on-page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: the glade pilgrimage, chamber descent, and confession sequence build pressure through layered imagery and ritual acts that narrow emotional options. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final tracing of hands "new lines crossing the old ones" reweights prior material with felt cost—acknowledgment that failures will recur but stance toward them has shifted. Orientation anchors quickly (cartomancer, midnight glade, post-birth). One meaningful deepening occurs when stalled seconds are named and released, transforming abstract guilt into embodied atonement with on-page consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The glade constrains and charges: frost-petaled grasses, lantern insects marking seconds, cloudstair descent to the chamber—all pressure the ritual and enable the confession sequence. The saucer crack as micro-setting object recurs with reweighted function (prophecy → map → ritual instrument). Sensory selection is urgent and particular: "wind stacked the clouds into staircases," "tick-motes suspended like dust within a bell jar." The final image—clouds "dazzling like scales on a sleeping leviathan"—charges closure by reconfiguring the sky into a living witness.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaim lost maternal time) is signaled early and braided with guilt. Escalation is accumulative: pilgrimage → chamber discovery → ritual confession sequence, each narrowing emotional options. Agency is enacted through deliberate ritual acts with visible cost: "For the night my daughter coughed and I only listened, I pressed my palm into the cloth and spoke water." The final vow—"I would unfasten every future knot with both hands"—is protagonist-driven renunciation that forecloses easy forgiveness. One tightening at the chamber where "I could not seize it, only atone" redefines the quest with felt limitation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from ritual particulars: lost time accumulates "in the unused halves of gestures, the hand not taken, the sentence left unbuttoned." The saucer crack, birthday tablecloth, and stalled seconds function as concrete motifs that constrain choice and accumulate pressure without tokenism. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—"I would unfasten every future knot with both hands, even if the world kept tying more"—that reweights prior material without moralizing. Complexity is earned: atonement does not erase future failure but reconfigures the narrator's stance toward inevitable imperfection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "onyx-ink cartomancer" filters setting through ritual and metaphor ("moon lay like a pale throat," "clouds dazzling like scales"). Diction remains controlled and voice-particular across tonal modulations. Psychic distance shifts purposefully from ritual detachment to embodied confession. Minor slip: "choking beauty I welcomed" risks slight abstraction, but is redeemed by immediate concrete anchoring in frost and lantern insects. POV stays single and stable; no head-hopping. Purposeful compression in the chamber sequence ("tick-motes suspended") teaches its pattern and pays off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs. Rhythm varies naturally with pressure: shorter declaratives at peak confession ("I pressed my palm into the cloth and spoke water"), longer lyric sentences in framing. Minor deductions: "choking beauty" recurs without added pressure (−0.2); "willingly perplexed" is restated conceptually rather than dramatized in one beat (−0.2). Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "clouds like curtains" followed by "clouds...like scales" risks minor vehicle drift but remains legible. No paraphrase loops; propulsion is clean. Strong opening and closing images anchor voice and stakes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of cartomancy, maternal guilt, and temporal ritual is specific and non-obvious; the concept of time accumulating in "unused halves of gestures" feels fresh. The saucer crack as prophetic map and the birthday tablecloth archive transform domestic objects into ritual instruments with earned particularity. Risk-taking in structure (pilgrimage → descent → ritual confession → return) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Minor deduction: the "lost time" quest echoes familiar maternal-regret templates, but transformation through onyx-ink ritual and cloudbound setting elevates it beyond stock execution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The cartomancer's choices drive all major turns: pilgrimage decision, saucer placement over handprints, confession sequence, final tracing of new lines. Setup early (first line). Development constrains ritual method. Payoff: final vow and hand-tracing shapes closure image. Two beats (saucer ritual, confession sequence) plus closure participation. Causal pressure: ritual choices narrow options and impose cost. Irreplaceability high: occupation-specific logic matters.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The saucer crack appears in three distinct beats: daughter's sugar-cube fracture, tracing onto cards, rotation over handprints to match lifeline. Setup early (sixth line). Development enables middle ritual (cards laid into traced channel). Payoff: closure whisper "into the crack that had warned me" reweights its function from prophecy to witness. Specificity high: hairline geography matters. Visible cost: the crack's warning imposes pilgrimage and atonement. Strong causal and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Cloudbound repentance shapes stakes from the opening and structures the entire narrative arc: ascent, chamber confession, return. Setup immediate (title phrase in second paragraph, cards "demanded pilgrimage, a cloudbound repentance"). Development constrains ritual method (confession to stalled seconds). Payoff: narrator carries "cloudbound repentance home like milk" in penultimate line. The concept narrows options (must ascend, cannot seize time) and charges closure. Three beats; causal pressure evident.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Willingly perplexed" is signaled early (third line) and shapes stance: "Some puzzles should stand upright like stones in wind, else their meaning blows away." Development: acceptance of unresolvable complexity enables ritual attempt. Payoff: "I did not ask the cards when I would fail again, only where to kneel when the next minute frays." Trait constrains choice (narrator does not demand total clarity) with conceptual cost. Two-gate coverage (setup, closure). Mid-band: label-heavy in setup but enacted at closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Unfasten" recurs in three causal beats: unfasten crib mobile (pilgrimage preparation), confessional acts that unfasten stalled seconds ("shivered the suspended seconds loose"), final vow to "unfasten every future knot with both hands." Setup early (eleventh line). Development drives ritual method. Payoff shapes closure vow. Specificity: the verb's mechanics (releasing, loosening) matter to ritual logic and temporal metaphor. Strong causal and thematic charge. Irreplaceability high.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The birthday tablecloth custom is introduced at midpoint (eighteenth line), functions in two beats: memory anchor and ritual instrument (saucer rotation over handprints). Development enables peak ritual. Payoff: final tracing of "new lines crossing the old ones" in glade. The method constrains ritual choices (must match lifeline to crack) and charges closure with layered history. Late setup (−0.3) but strong causal and closure work. Specificity: hand-tracing mechanics matter to ritual success.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The midnight glade above clouds pressures choices across four beats: journey decision, arrival description, ritual site (saucer placement), final re-tracing. Setup early (first line). Development: frost grasses, lantern insects, cloudstair descent supply ritual resources and constrain access (pilgrimage required). Payoff: glade as witness to final vow and tracing. Micro-setting elements (insects marking seconds, cloth on grass) alter ritual tactics. Irreplaceability moderate: "above clouds" isolation matters but specifics (frost, insects) could vary slightly.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"After the birth" frames motivation (maternal guilt, time scarcity) and appears in two structural beats: opening anchor and eighth-line reprise ("After the birth, time ran like milk"). Development: the timeframe tightens urgency (infant at home, recent rupture). Payoff: implicit in closure vow to future attentiveness. Cost: the fresh wound of new motherhood charges confessions. Two-gate coverage (setup, development). Mid-band: timeframe pressures but does not track visibly across beats; more frame than clock.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The desire to "find where lost time accumulates" is stated early (fifth line), dramatized through chamber discovery ("stalled seconds, tick-motes suspended"), and tested when narrator realizes "I could not seize it, only atone." Setup immediate. Development drives pilgrimage and confession sequence. Payoff implicit: closure vow shifts from retrieval to present vigilance. Friction between want (reclaim time) and cost (atonement, not recovery) is embodied on-page. Three beats; strong causal and thematic pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Choking beauty" is introduced early (second line: "air had a choking beauty I welcomed"), recurs at descent ("throat closed again around that peculiar beauty"), and charges multiple sensory beats (frost grasses, dazzling cloud-scales). Tone modulates with pressure: lyric elevation during ascent, compression during confession, expansive wonder at closure. The oxymoron (beauty that constricts) threads guilt and awe consistently. Strong closure linkage: final image's "dazzling" beauty reweights prior constriction as acceptance. Coherence high; charges ending.</comment>
