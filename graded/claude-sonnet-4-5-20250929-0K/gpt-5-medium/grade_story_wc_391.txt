<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is lyric-specific ("unyoke another yapping urgency," "ears tuned to the slow thunder under the ice") with embodied contradictions between vigilance and patience. The girl's arrival and the village men provide on-page pressure, but their interior lives remain flat; the girl "smiled like someone untying a knot" reads as label rather than dramatized contradiction. The final teaching moment shows micro-choices (laying maps, gathering the village) that alter present options, though the cost—what the narrator forfeits by committing to this role—remains oblique. Motivation is consistently present but the transformation from solitary mapper to teacher feels asserted rather than earned through visible internal conflict.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of charged imagery (frozen lake, viaduct hum, moon paths) by the first third and reweights them at closure when "our patient revolution stood" in the warm basalt sanctuary with the village gathered. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the third paragraph. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the narrator shifts from solitary observation to collective teaching, crystallizing the revolution as "not a storm but a school," with the conceptual cost legible in the phrase "how to be news" and the gathering that forecloses the narrator's prior isolation. One meaningful deepening occurs when the girl's question ("Who will teach us to wait without surrendering") tilts the narrator's stance from passive mapping to active instruction, narrowing options and raising the social cost of visibility.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, and magnetic viaduct form a coherent micro-setting that constrains choices: the narrator waits at the viaduct "after rain" when the magnets "pull our soles to steadiness," the sanctuary's retained heat signals shelter, and the ice's "private music" marks seasonal pressure. Sensory detail is purposeful and POV-filtered ("wind combed the reeds," "swallows rode its currents as if ordained"). Spatial choreography is clear across all moves (lake → viaduct → sanctuary → return). The viaduct's铁stone hum and the sanctuary's warm basalt charge the final image when the village gathers "beside the coals" and "our patient revolution stood," making environment indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: teach patience as革命 method without surrendering agency. The girl's question ("Who will teach us to wait without surrendering, to turn rage into shape?") and the village men's ropes/worry introduce immediate pressure. One meaningful tightening occurs when the narrator moves from passive observation to active instruction ("I sent them to carry salt… Do these things softly purposeful"), narrowing tactics and raising the social cost of visibility. The cost is partly visible—the narrator forgoes solitary vigilance to become a public figure—but the final image lacks a moment where the narrator visibly pays a price or forecloses a concrete path, keeping escalation legible but muted.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—patient革命 as embodied practice rather than spectacle—emerges from concrete particulars: unyoking urgencies, tracking moon paths, the viaduct's hum, carrying stillness "as if it were bread." The girl's knot-untying smile and the narrator's phrase "not a storm but a school, not a blade but a shaping" avoid moralizing by grounding insight in prior actions (salt-carrying, spring-cleaning). The final image ("how to carry stillness… how to hold a door open") offers a resonant answer without stating a thesis. Minor slip: "patient革命" as a repeated phrase risks thematic echo, though it remains anchored in action rather than assertion, and the ending's "our patient revolution stood" reconfigures the phrase with the village's embodied presence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Single-POV first-person with stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature: the narrator notices horizons, moon paths, fence posts, and subtle shifts in ice and iron, filtering all through a vigilant-yet-patient lens. Diction is lyric-specific ("gaunt blue," "yapping urgency," "faint sulk of cattle") and rhythmically controlled, modulating from solitary observation to collective instruction without register drift. Dialogue is minimal but functional: the girl's question and the narrator's reply carry subtext and advance plot. One brief filter-verb cluster ("I felt the world admit us") in a peak beat slightly dulls immediacy but does not obscure the closure effect. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "Each season I unyoke another yapping urgency" establishes character, stakes, and metaphor simultaneously). Rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating in the viaduct sequence and breathing in the teaching scene. Minor scaffold: "I told" appears three times in quick succession mid-story, creating a template cadence that slightly flattens momentum. One paraphrase loop: "the horizon is closer than before" after "the world admit us" restates the same idea without added pressure. Zero major loops or figurative muddle in peak beats; the final image is dense and propulsive. Sentence openings vary; paragraph structure supports scene rhythm.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of革命-as-patience, magnetic viaduct, and moon-path mapping feels specific and non-obvious, avoiding template plots. The narrator's occupation (horizon mapper) and the basalt sanctuary's embodied warmth create a memorable frame. The turn from solitary vigilance to collective teaching is earned in hindsight through the girl's arrival and the elders' prior directive. Minor derivative note: the patient-革命 frame echoes familiar activist tropes (slow change, collective action), and the piece does not fully transform it through unique lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus, keeping originality solid but not exceptional. The lyric register and symbolic precision (viaduct hum, iron dust, moon paths) elevate the execution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Present by paragraph 4 ("vigilant horizon mapper"). Shapes two beats: (1) observation at the viaduct informs the narrator's stance, (2) the decision to teach the girl and village men turns vigilance into pedagogy. Causal role is moderate; the mapper role enables instruction but could be replaced with another watchful occupation without breaking story logic. Appears in the closure context ("how to be news") but does not decisively charge the final image. Early signal, two beats, and closure linkage push toward mid-6s, but swappability and modest causal pressure limit the ceiling.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Introduced in paragraph 9 ("magnetic viaduct after rain"). Used in two distinct beats: (1) the narrator listens alone and notes the hum and pebble-stick, (2) the narrator and girl walk it together after rain, letting the magnets "pull our soles to steadiness." The viaduct's magnetism and hum constrain the teaching method (embodied steadiness via environment) and charge the final line when "the horizon is closer" after the viaduct walk. Specific properties (iron, rain, magnets) matter and are not easily swapped. Early signal, two beats, causal pressure on tactics, and closure linkage earn high-7s; lacks a third beat or visible cost tied specifically to the viaduct to reach 8.5+.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Signaled early ("patient revolution" in paragraph 12) and shapes stakes throughout: the elders ask for it, the girl's question invokes it ("wait without surrendering"), and the narrator's instruction ("not a storm but a school") dramatizes it. The concept narrows tactics (salt-carrying, spring-cleaning, softly purposeful work) and reweights options by the ending when "our patient revolution stood" with the village gathered. The phrase itself risks becoming a thematic label, but the story grounds it in concrete actions and embodied pedagogy, making the concept causally active rather than merely thematic. Early signal, mid-beat involvement, and closure participation earn low-7s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The attribute "softly purposeful" appears explicitly in paragraph 29 when the narrator instructs the men ("Do these things softly purposeful") and again in paragraph 42 ("softly purposeful through the village talk"). It constrains the village men's tactics (gentle work rather than urgent action) and charges the teaching scene's tone. One on-page trade-off: the men set down ropes (visible renunciation of force) to adopt the narrator's method. The trait is specific and not easily swapped, but it lacks a second beat where the narrator's own choices are visibly constrained by this attribute. Early framing, one clear beat with cost, and closure tone linkage place it in mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Unyoke" appears twice: paragraph 6 as reflective practice ("Each season I unyoke another yapping urgency") and paragraph 27 as instruction ("To unyoke fear from motion"). The action frames the narrator's method and directly informs the teaching moment, shaping the village men's turn from worry to purposeful work. It enables the key turn (men abandon ropes, adopt new tasks) but does not itself create a pivot; the girl's question and the narrator's decision to teach are the stronger causal levers. Early signal, one strong beat, and thematic resonance earn mid-to-high 6s, but swappability with "release" or "let go" and lack of closure-scene presence limit the score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Introduced in paragraph 8 ("by tracking moon paths across the ice") and paragraph 21 ("if we listened by tracking moon paths"). The method is signaled early and named as the teaching technique. However, the mechanics never constrain an attempt or shape tactics on the page; the narrator observes moon paths but does not demonstrate failure, adjustment, or visible cost tied to this specific method. The method is present at the ending context (maps of "horizon and moonlight" laid on the stone) but does not charge the final image or alter the closure. Early signal and closure nod earn low-to-mid 5s; lack of middle beat involvement and causal pressure on tactics cap it below 6.5.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Introduced in paragraph 3 ("basalt sanctuary by a frozen lake") and returns in paragraphs 15, 24, and 40. The sanctuary's retained heat ("held its heat like a sleeping animal," "warm basalt," "beside the coals") provides shelter that enables the teaching scene and charges the final image when the village gathers there and "the basalt warmed" as "our patient revolution stood." The setting supplies a resource (warmth, stability) that alters tactics (teaching indoors rather than exposed) and anchors the closure. Early signal, multiple beats, and closure linkage earn low-to-mid 7s; lacks a moment where the sanctuary's specific properties (basalt, heat retention) constrain a choice under pressure to reach 8+.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Signaled in paragraph 2 ("after the lake freezes over, when breath plumes like banners") and re-anchored in paragraphs 1, 8, 15, 24, 33. The frozen state frames the work calendar and sets the season for all action, tightening the stakes (winter endurance, limited mobility). The timeframe shapes one key decision: the narrator waits through snow-crust for the messenger's arrival, and the teaching begins only after the freeze. The ending nod ("winter walked my dreams") and the lake's breathing in paragraph 34 reweight the frame. Early signal, one beat involvement, and closure resonance earn mid-6s; lack of a live countdown or second constraint moment caps it below 7.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stated explicitly in paragraph 7 ("sculpt patience from impatience, chipping at the block") and dramatized through the narrator's practice (unyoking urgencies, waiting at the viaduct, refusing spectacle). The motivation drives the teaching choice (the girl asks how to wait, the narrator responds with embodied method) and charges the final image when the narrator instructs the village in carrying stillness. One visible friction: the narrator must balance "restrained wildness" (keeping the pencil honest) with patient observation, a tension felt in the phrase "not for news, but for how to be news." Early signal, one strong beat, and closure linkage earn high-6s; the internal conflict is more told than shown in contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, limiting the score below 7.5.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Tone is established early ("restrained wildness kept the pencil honest," "eyes wider than comfort") and sustained through charged imagery: the viaduct's hum, the ice's private music, the girl's flint voice, the men's grumbling "like ice shifting." The tone modulates with pressure—solitary vigilance in the opening, quiet urgency when the girl arrives, collective steadiness at the end—without breaking coherence. The final image ("our patient revolution stood") fuses restraint (patience, stillness) and wildness (revolution, the sanctuary's untamed heat) in a Charged Poise moment. The tone charges the closure and shapes every beat, earning mid-7s; lacks one additional modulation under peak stress to reach 8+.</comment>
