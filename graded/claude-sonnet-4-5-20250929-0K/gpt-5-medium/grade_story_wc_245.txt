<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The blind mapmaker's interiority is vivid and specific—absorbing languages through skin, dowsing for emotional currents—but motivation remains largely asserted rather than tested through contradictory impulses. The arc from selling "certainties in blue ink" to learning grief's "native coast" is told in reflection without on-page micro-choices that reveal competing wants. The final acceptance ("not escape but axis") arrives through exposition rather than a dramatized renunciation with visible cost. Embodied details (ring cooling, fern writing on wrist) are strong, but the protagonist observes more than she decides under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers sensory metaphors and reflective loops toward a thematic reconfiguration at the stillpoint. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly within the first third. However, the closure unit—"The stillpoint is not escape but axis"—is stated rather than dramatized, and cost remains conceptual without a specific forfeited path or altered tactic on the page. The piece teaches its lyric pattern early, but the final image ("night steps with me") reiterates theme without reweighting prior material through a concrete choice or visible price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ultrasonic forest is vivid and purposeful: leaves "speak above hearing," lichens leak vowels, the platinum ring cools or warms to pitch "like braille for ears." Sensory hierarchy reflects the protagonist's blindness and her skin-absorption ability. The clearing that opens "weaponed with silence" and the ring's sudden cooling constrain the dowsing action and charge the discovery beat. Micro-setting (ring, fern, grass) functions as tactile anchors that guide choice, meeting the 9+ gate requirement for environment shaping tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—learning grief's coast rather than erasing it—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful deepening occurs when the protagonist kneels to dowse and the hidden stillpoint is revealed, but this moment is observational rather than a choice that narrows options. The resolution (tracing sorrow's lines, accepting the stillpoint as axis) is recounted in summary without a visible trade-off or forfeited path. Agency appears as attention and endurance, but cost is asserted ("ache," "losses") rather than demonstrated through a specific on-page price that alters later tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme—grief as navigable terrain rather than erasure—emerges through recurring motifs: the platinum ring, trail of notes, mother's rhythms, harbor where the lover departed. The stillpoint realization ("not escape but axis") and the mapmaker's shift from "certainties in blue ink" to "marrow" offer a resonant answer to the central question. However, the final paragraph edges into thematic summary ("teach others to dowse for bearings within it") rather than trusting the image alone. The piece resists tidy morals and embraces complexity, but late articulation of the thesis ("consent to pivot without erasing the radius") leans declarative.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and lyric: "weapons with silence," "moth wing idioms," "sky-clock teeth hesitate." POV distance is stable first-person with purposeful compression ("I walk across the pause") that teaches its pattern early. Perceptual signature is blind-specific and tactile throughout. However, peak-beat diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("treaties of root and rainfall," "consensus reality") that feels writerly rather than character-emergent. Reflection dominates but remains anchored to present stimuli (ring cooling, fern writing). No head-hopping; free indirect style is clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative density is high but coherent: "quiet blaze banks," "glass strings humming," "planet the size of an ache." However, the piece shows paraphrase loops in the final third—lines 28–32 restate the stillpoint insight across five sentences with synonym churn ("not escape but axis," "consent to pivot," "map grows round"). Template cadence appears in the backstory block ("There is the harbor… There is the isthmus… There is the trench") without pattern payoff. These artifacts dull momentum in the closure sequence, triggering −0.6 in Q7 and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact cap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of blindness, tactile language-absorption, emotional cartography, and ultrasonic forest is specific and non-obvious. The transformation of grief-as-map from "blue ink" certainties to "marrow" atlas offers fresh inflection on familiar mourning narratives. Risk-taking in lyric compression and sensory layering heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. However, the "hidden stillpoint" premise echoes widely used spiritual-quest templates, and the final articulation ("teach others to dowse") resolves into a familiar guide-role that dilutes the protagonist's particular cost. Transformation is present but incomplete, warranting mid-7s within Q8.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The blind mapmaker is present throughout and frames the journey, but choices remain observational: she follows notes, kneels to dowse, traces lines. The decision to "walk home along the same notes" and "teach others" is recounted in summary rather than dramatized as a turn. Setup is early, closure participation is present, but middle development lacks a choice that narrows options with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The platinum compass ring is signaled early ("hums against my finger"), used in multiple beats (dowsing for currents, cooling at ultrasound, stopping its hum at the stillpoint), and present at closure ("The ring stops humming"). It enables the dowsing action and charges key moments with temperature shifts. However, its mechanics remain asserted rather than tested under pressure; removing it would not fundamentally break the logic, as the protagonist could navigate by other tactile cues.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The hidden stillpoint is the story's destination and shapes the quest stakes. It is mentioned early ("a rumor reached me"), discovered at the clearing, and reweighted at closure ("not escape but axis"). However, its discovery is observational rather than a choice under competing pressures, and the concept is explained rather than demonstrated through a visible trade-off. Setup, development, and payoff are present, but causal pressure is mid-range.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Absorbing languages through skin is stated early and illustrated with bark syllables, moth wing idioms, fern writing. It colors perception throughout but never constrains a choice with visible cost. The trait enables observation without forcing a trade-off (e.g., pain, overload, misreading). Functional but replaceable; the story could substitute another sensory mode with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Dowsing is signaled early ("dowse for currents not of water but of feeling"), used in the clearing when the protagonist kneels and sweeps the ring, and participates in the stillpoint discovery. However, the mechanics are asserted rather than tested under pressure, and the action is primarily observational. One major beat involvement and closure linkage place it in the 5–6 range, but it does not drive a turn that narrows options.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The trail of musical notes is introduced early ("forest offers a trail of musical notes"), followed in the middle ("notes descend through me," "intervals that tilt my spine"), and resolves at closure ("trail resolving into the hidden melody"). It shapes the route and charges the final image. However, the method is descriptive rather than mechanically tested; the protagonist never faces a false note or wrong turn. Setup, development, and payoff are present, earning mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ultrasonic forest is present early, pressures perception throughout (leaves speaking above hearing, lichens leaking vowels), and supplies the clearing where the stillpoint is found. The environment constrains the protagonist's navigation method (tactile and auditory cues replace sight) and charges the closure beat. The forest's sensory density shapes tactics across multiple beats and is indispensable to the dowsing logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "pause of shifting constellations" is mentioned early and reprised at closure ("constellations resume their slow drift"), creating a lyric bracket. However, it does not tighten decisions or alter tactics; the protagonist never races a closing window or adjusts her approach as time passes. The element is ornamental, serving atmosphere rather than pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The motivation to "navigate uncharted emotional depths" is stated early, braided with the grief backstory (harbor where lover departed, dock with no apology), and shapes the stillpoint quest. It drives the journey and is reweighted at closure ("not to guide them away from sorrow, but to teach others to dowse"). However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants; the protagonist never hesitates or pays a visible price for pursuing this goal. Setup, development, and payoff are present, but friction between wants and costs is asserted.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The "quiet blaze" is introduced early ("banks inside my chest"), modulates with discovery ("I feel the quiet blaze brighten"), and participates in the final image ("patient fire meeting patient stone"). Tone is coherent and lyric throughout, supporting the grief-as-navigation theme. However, the tone remains static rather than shifting under pressure; the protagonist's calm persistence does not deepen or crack. The element charges the closure image but does not modulate with escalation, placing it in mid-6s.</comment>
