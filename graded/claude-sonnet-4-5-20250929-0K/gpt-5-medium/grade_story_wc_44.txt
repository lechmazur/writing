<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is concrete and purposeful: "quietly deliberate" is demonstrated through careful mirror-arrangement and the nine-fold key turn. Motivation coheres around the central question (where shadows go at noon) and culminates in an earned insight tied to decision-making. The embodied cost—exhaling as the shutters open, the gold line slipping under skin—grounds the change. Minor deduction: the caretaker remains ornamental, applying no pressure beyond handing over the key.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the first paragraph; the observatory setting and scholar role are clear. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered metaphor (spoons, automaton key, mirrors, noon-under-night) toward a Conceptual Repricing in the final third where shadows are revealed to "wait inside decisions." Cost is legible in the gold line beneath skin and the refusal to tell the caretaker, signaling an enduring obligation. One tightening suffices at this length, and the lens holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The floating isle, nocturnal observatory, mirrors, and clockwork key are richly specific and constraining: mirrors must be arranged "like a throat," the shutters opened to a "thin seam," the key turned nine times to complete "the forgotten motion of a noon bell." The environment directly shapes the protagonist's tactics and charges the closure image (shutters opening "a fraction," noon arriving without a sun). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered. No orientation debt penalty applied; the pattern is taught early.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding where shadows go at noon—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through the mirror-ring arrangement, the rune for return, and the nine-fold key turn; each step narrows options under the Accumulative lens. The cost is felt in the gold-line signature and the ongoing obligation ("the answer needed to continue"). One meaningful deepening is present, sufficient for this length. Minor deduction: the caretaker's nod at the end is passive confirmation rather than active complication.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images and action: "sealed awakenings," loops closed to be kept, shadows attending decisions until "some quietly deliberate hand returns to the start." The final insight—shadows wait inside decisions—reweights the entire journey without moralizing. Noon as an "agreement" and every loop requiring closure to be kept creates resonance. The spoons bending "nothing now except the path homeward" offers a non-literal, earned answer. No label-speak or thematic echo in the final beat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistent: lyric compression ("fork-born thunder," "paper hears secrets first," "choice wears teeth when watched too carefully") is purposeful and legible throughout. POV modesty holds—narrative certainty matches what the scholar can know, and inference reads as inference ("as if the sky itself insisted on relearning"). Diction remains within the scholar's plausible lexicon; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is stable: sky as receipts, mirrors as a throat, noon as an agreement. Free indirect distance is clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "They said utensils remembered old tremors" establishes world rules and primes the scholar's question). Rhythm varies purposefully: short declaratives accelerate ("I traced a line," "I exhaled") while longer constructions breathe during reflection. Minor loop detected: "quietly deliberate" appears three times with near-identical phrasing. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; one minor muddle: "moon a slow-breathing clerk tallying silences by hand" slightly overwrites. No paraphrase loops or template cadence in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of clockwork mechanics, rune scholarship, and the paradox of noon-on-a-night-island feels specific and non-obvious. The notion that shadows "wait inside decisions" and that "we unlock the future by closing loops" transforms familiar metaphor into lived stakes. Risk is present in the lyric compression and the refusal to provide a tidy resolution; the scholar's ongoing obligation charges the ending. The piece commits fully to its premise without retreat. Minor deduction: the kitchen-spoons motif is ornamental at the frame, not causally integrated.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The budding rune scholar is present from the opening and drives three key beats: arranging mirrors, whispering the rune for return, and signing with the rune for witness. Each choice narrows options and shapes the closure. The scholar's training in margins and "quietly deliberate" method enables the tactics. Cost is visible in the gold-line signature. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage; no late arrival or swappability issues.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The clockwork automaton key appears in four distinct beats: caretaker hands it over, protagonist winds it to stir the dome, places it at the center of mirrors, and turns it nine times in the floor socket to complete the noon bell. Each use advances pressure and the final turn directly enables closure. Specificity is high: the "long tooth etched with...eclipsed moons" and the nine-fold turn matter. Strong causal pressure, beat involvement, and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Sealed awakenings" is signaled early ("scripted to open only when habitual time had circled back") and shapes the protagonist's understanding: shadows are "sealed awakenings waiting for an accurate finger." The unsealing in the mirror-scene is a causal turn. The concept charges the closure: "They attend the sealed awakenings until some quietly deliberate hand returns to the start." Solid setup, development, and payoff; cost is conceptual but legible.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Quietly deliberate" is signaled early ("My teachers called me quietly deliberate") and enables on-page choices: the careful mirror arrangement, the nine-fold key turn, and the refusal to rush the process. The trait constrains action—the scholar does not force the shutters open prematurely. Cost is implicit in the sustained effort and the patience required. The attribute appears in the closure beat ("some quietly deliberate hand"). Solid setup and closure linkage; middle beat involvement is less distinct.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Relearn" is signaled early ("I wanted to know," "Before the kitchens taught metal to flex, I had believed lessons only moved forward; now I knew to relearn") and drives the key turn: "I relearned the noon by closing loops, pressing the line until it returned to its beginning with a shiver." The action is irreplaceable—removing it would break the logic of loops and return. The closure explicitly invokes relearning: "refuses to be impatient." Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"By closing loops" is signaled in the first third ("We unlock the future by closing loops") and enacted on the page: "I relearned the noon by closing loops, pressing the line until it returned to its beginning." The method shapes the mirror arrangement (a ring), the rune for return, and the nine-fold key turn. The closure beat reinforces it: "every loop must be closed to be kept." The method is mechanically specific and irreplaceable. Strong setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The nocturnal observatory on a floating isle is signaled immediately and constrains choices throughout: "night was the only calendar," the isle never knows noon, and the protagonist must engineer a seam of light. The environment supplies the collimators, dome, mirrors, and floor socket that enable tactics. The setting charges the closure: "the island breathed noon without a sun to certify it." Strong causal pressure, irreplaceability, and closure linkage. The floating-isle detail is vivid and specific.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"After spoons bend reality" is mentioned in the opening but does not constrain choices or tighten decisions on the page. The timeframe is ornamental: the kitchens are backstory color, and no clock or deadline pressures the protagonist's actions. The spoons return at the end ("bending nothing now except the path homeward") as a thematic echo but do not shape tactics. Setup present, development and payoff weak. Cap at 4.6 for missing middle development.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The motivation—to find where shadows go at noon—is dramatized in the opening ("because the question refused to stop breathing") and drives every beat: mirror arrangement, the rune for return, tracing nodes, and the nine-fold key turn. The answer arrives on the page with cost: "they wait inside decisions for us to finish deciding." Friction is present in the effort required and the ongoing obligation. Strong setup, causal pressure, and closure linkage. The motivation is irreplaceable.</comment>
