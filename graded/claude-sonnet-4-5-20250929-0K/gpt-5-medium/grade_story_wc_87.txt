<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is richly embodied—the compass "against my ribs," the nickname that "stung," the contradictory impulses to keep ghosts "behind me, or ahead" are concrete and character-specific. The choice to help the boy is earned through the accumulating pressure of remembered navigation skill and the "small galaxies of mud," which ground agency in sensory detail. Minor slips: "merrily melancholic" is asserted early as a label without immediate on-page embodiment, and the backstory of the lost friend, while anchored, occupies substantial space without always tilting present choices. The final micro-choice—pressing the compass to sternum—reads as earned stasis with visible cost (the sorrow carried "open and used").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The lens is Accumulative/Textural: the kayak journey layers regret, the humming poles, the boy's need, and culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) where the narrator steadies—"not fixed but steadied"—with visible cost in the final image of carrying sorrow like a chart. Orientation is anchored by ~100 words (coastal launch, fog, kayak, poles). The closure lands on the page with felt cost: the narrator steps out "carrying sorrow the way a captain carries a chart, open and used," foreclosing the retreat that ruled the first half. One meaningful deepening occurs when the boy's need interrupts the penance loop, reweighting the dominant stake from self-imposed exile to tentative re-engagement.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The coastal setting is specific and purposeful: fog, pilings, utility poles, eelgrass, and the boy's ruined pier all constrain navigation choices and charge the final image. The poles function as micro-setting, guiding tactics ("I followed the utility poles where they came closest to the dunes") and appearing in the closure beat ("The utility poles kept time"). Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through nautical POV—"salt and old rope," "gulls sang like somebody practicing forgiveness off-key"—and the kayak deck with "small galaxies of mud" grounds the boy's presence. The environment's hum and the shallows' depth constrain the rescue attempt, elevating setting beyond postcard.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—align heart and action—is signaled early ("I wanted to align heart and action, that I was tired of steering one way while pulsing in another") and tightens when the boy's need forces the narrator to choose between retreat and re-engagement. The escalation is Accumulative: the poles' hum, the boy's question ("if I was a real navigator"), and the father's shame converge to narrow options. The cost is legible on the page: "I pressed the astronomical compass to my sternum like a seal unbroken at last," foreclosing the penance loop with visible emotional price. Agency is clear: the narrator "could have said ask the Coast Guard" but instead invites the boy aboard, a micro-choice with immediate consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the accumulating particulars—compass, poles, mud galaxies, the father's "wrists shining with sweat"—rather than assertion. The final image answers the thematic question ("how to tell the sea I was listening without promising more than I could keep") without moralizing, offering Charged Poise where sorrow is carried "open and used." The boy's merciful nod ("when your story does not match your face") and the father's eye-salute charge the ending with earned resonance. Minor slip: "backlash of regrets" and "align heart and action" veer toward prompt-language in the first third, though subsequent particulars (poles, compass pressed to sternum) redeem the abstraction by the close.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is consistent and richly textured: "the sea hammering the pilings like a judge with a softened gavel," "his shoes left small galaxies of mud," "the tide was sliding away from them with greedy elegance." POV distance is stable, filtering all perception through the navigator's nautical and regret-laden lens. The boy's dialogue ("if I knew where the channel hid") carries regional idiom and goal-driven subtext. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—tight interiority during the compass beats, wider framing for the poles' hum. No head-hopping; no filter-verb stacks. The perceptual signature (reading alders, whispering depths) is character-specific and sustained under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, with longer reflective lines contracting to short, urgent beats during the rescue ("We found his father aground in the eelgrass, engine lifted, wrists shining with sweat"). Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs. However, paraphrase loops appear: "I carried the astronomical compass because it once steadied me" is echoed by "Now its brass face only reflected a jittery mouth," restating doubt without added pressure. Template cadence runs cluster in the opening third ("I stood," "I laughed," "I launched," "I had," "I did"). Figurative density is high throughout ("expectations collapse... like planks easing from a dock," "faith flickering in the pupils like a harbor light") but remains coherent and voice-motivated. The loops and template stems warrant deduction but do not obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of navigator-as-guide, utility poles as improvised stars, and the boy's rescue reframes the broken-navigator premise through specific, earned choices rather than template redemption. The "small galaxies of mud" and "greedy elegance" of the tide offer fresh inflections. However, the core arc—broken expert redeems self through helping stranger—is widely used; transformation comes primarily through the poles' hum and the compass-to-sternum image, which are specific but not fully non-obvious. Risk-taking in voice and metaphor density heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, earning mid-high placement. The emotional honesty (sorrow carried "open and used") avoids sentimentality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The broken navigator is established in the first paragraph and drives every major beat: the choice to launch (agency under self-imposed penance), the decision to help the boy (foreclosing retreat), and the final act of pressing the compass to sternum while guiding the boat free. The protagonist's knowledge of poles and depths enables the rescue, and the father's relief crystallizes the narrator's Earned Stasis. The character's brokenness and tentative re-engagement constrain all tactics and charge the closure image. All three gates present; two beats plus closure participation; visible cost on the page.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The astronomical compass appears in paragraph two ("I carried the astronomical compass because it once steadied me"), is referenced mid-journey ("I kept the compass against my ribs"), and returns at closure ("I pressed the astronomical compass to my sternum like a seal unbroken at last"). The final reprise reweights the object from failed tool to embodied acceptance. However, the compass does not constrain middle tactics—the poles do the navigation work—so its causal role is limited to thematic bookend. Two touches (opening reflection, closing action) plus lyric reprise earn mid-band, but lack of middle development caps higher placement.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Backlash of regrets" is named early ("now the backlash of regrets ruled my weather") and shapes the dominant stake throughout: the narrator's penance loop, the refusal to go to open ocean, the need to align heart and action. The concept narrows options (he curves along the edge, talks to the absent friend) and is paid off when the boy's need forces a choice that breaks the loop. The final beat ("the backlash of regrets had finally met an equal, living countercurrent") names the cost explicitly, a slight over-articulation, but the prior particulars (poles, compass, mud) have already dramatized it. Present in setup, middle constraint, and closure articulation; score reflects strong integration with minor thematic echo at the end.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Merrily melancholic" is asserted once in paragraph five ("I laughed in my merrily melancholic way") but is not dramatized through simultaneous impulses in that beat or elsewhere. The narrator's contradictory state is shown richly through other means (talking to the absent friend, pressing the compass), but this specific label does not constrain an action with visible cost. Label-only mention without beat involvement; present in setup but no middle or closure use. Cap at 4.6 for missing development gate; ornamental use and swappability lower further.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Gravitate" appears once in a negation ("I did not gravitate toward the open ocean anymore") and describes a refusal rather than an action that drives a turn. The refusal to go seaward constrains the route (he curves along the edge), which shapes one tactical choice, but the verb itself is not revisited or charged at closure. The action of not-gravitating is functionally a stance rather than a repeated move; the poles and the choice to help the boy do the causal work. One beat involvement (route constraint) but no closure participation; lyric setup but replaceable mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Navigating by utility poles is introduced early ("the old method of navigating by utility poles that paralleled the shore"), used in the middle beat to find the father ("We followed the utility poles where they came closest to the dunes, skipping the false cuts"), and returns in the closure paragraph ("The utility poles kept time, the kayak kept true"). The method enables the rescue and charges the final image as the improvised stars that replace the broken astronomical compass. Specificity (the hum, the proximity to dunes) makes the method irreplaceable. All three gates; two beats plus closure; causal pressure and cost connection present.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The coastal kayak launch anchors the opening and closing paragraphs, providing spatial orientation and a symbolic return point. The launch itself does not constrain middle choices—the journey happens on the water, guided by poles and the cove—but the final return ("As the fog lifted, the launch returned, ordinary and merciful") reweights the opening's "worry that refused to loosen its grip." The setting supplies the context but not immediate tactical pressure; the poles, eelgrass, and ruined pier do more work. Setup and closure present; middle development absent. Lyric reprise with thematic charge earns mid-band but lacks middle constraint for higher placement.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"When expectations collapse" is introduced in paragraph six ("This was the timeframe when expectations collapse, not all at once, but like planks easing from a dock") and implicitly governs the narrator's stance throughout: the year since the squall, the ongoing penance, the moment when new expectations form ("here were new ones forming, simple as rope"). The timeframe does not create an urgent clock but shapes the psychological window in which the narrator can accept help-giving. The collapse is described metaphorically rather than tracked as a tightening deadline. Setup and thematic presence earn mid-band; no on-page countdown or middle tactical constraint caps higher.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The motivation "to align heart and action" is articulated mid-journey ("I told him I wanted to align heart and action, that I was tired of steering one way while pulsing in another") and drives the key choice to help the boy despite self-doubt. The final beat crystallizes the alignment: "I let my heart and my actions share a shoreline, imperfect but finally drawing the same map." The desire is in friction throughout (the narrator could retreat but chooses engagement), and the cost—carrying sorrow openly—is visible on the page. Setup, middle choice, and closure participation; causal pressure and visible tradeoff present. Slight over-articulation of the alignment theme in the final paragraph prevents top band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The tone of flickering faith is established early ("faith flickering in the pupils like a harbor light running low") and modulates coherently: dim and self-doubting in the opening, tested when the boy asks "if I was a real navigator," brightening tentatively during the rescue, and stabilizing in the closure ("I remembered how to tell the sea I was listening... feeling my faith flicker toward steadier fuel, neither blaze nor ash, something stubborn as tide"). The tone charges the final image, where faith has not ignited fully but has steadied. Coherent through all turns, present in closure, tone-as-variable integrates tightly with the Earned Stasis closure form.</comment>
