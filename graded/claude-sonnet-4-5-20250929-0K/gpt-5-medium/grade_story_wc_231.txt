<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The keeper's interiority is concrete and particular—"I investigate by the only method that has ever yielded light without scaring it away, by observing gaps"—and his choice to answer the stranger's final gesture with light carries visible cost (committing to a witness role he cannot abandon). The "softly persistent" trait shapes his investigative method throughout. Minor slip: the borrowed memory of the girl arrives fully formed without the micro-hesitation or friction one might expect when reconstructing fifteen-year-old events, slightly diluting the embodied struggle at that pivot.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred: pressure builds through layered observation (notch, chevrons, borrowed memory) and deepens when the keeper decodes the inversion ("the signal runs both ways"). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—he sweeps the notch, writes the name, holds the promise "that can be borrowed but not owned"—with felt cost in the permanent witness duty. The orientation is clear by the opening beat (keeper, dock, twilight), and the final lantern-swing and ledger act reweight all prior material without resort to summary.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The opal dock's notch in the third piling functions as micro-setting that constrains the keeper's search and charges the closure: he sweeps it to hide the shrine, and the act of concealment becomes the witness gesture. Nautical twilight, mist, and the gulls' silence all modulate pressure. The dried Edelweiss stems fit "like a key fitting a tired lock," anchoring the pivot turn. One small gap: the iron steps to the lighthouse are mentioned only in passing and do not constrain a choice as tightly as the notch does.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode the stranger's gesture and answer with light—is signaled at the inciting incident and tightens when the keeper aligns flower to notch, triggering the borrowed memory. The inversion (chest tap, then flower) narrows options: he must reply in the girl's code. Agency is clear in the lantern-swing choice and the deliberate sweeping of the notch. Cost is legible: he assumes permanent ledger-keeper duty for "the sea and its stubborn dead." No wasted escalation; each beat adds pressure under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—witness as fidelity against erasure—emerges from the notch, the girl's waiting, and the keeper's decision to hold "the flower and the light like a promise that can be borrowed but not owned." The final image (sweeping the notch, folding the name with salt) offers a resonant, non-literal answer: what is rescued needs no shrine, only a witness. "Witnessed isolation has a weight… a careful temperature that does not burn but never quite warms" avoids platitude through specificity. No explicit moralizing mars the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct and sustained: "I investigate… by observing gaps. Gaps in stories, gaps in timetables, and the particular gap where a final breath wants to be a letter and fails." Diction remains within the keeper's idiom (lantern "tucked low," "little chevrons," "hunger of the sea"). Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. Minor deduction: "witnessed isolation has a weight to it, a careful temperature that does not burn but never quite warms" momentarily elevates into essayistic register during a high-pressure beat, though it recovers quickly and the line serves thematic closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully ("She pressed the boutonniere into the notch the night he did not return, and the dock took that pain into its timber to keep it from drowning"), and information density is high throughout. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. One friction: the phrase "little chevrons where some sailor without ink had practiced sending himself home" and later "little knocks with a nail" both deploy "little" as a softening modifier in adjacent descriptive beats, creating mild textural convergence. Figurative language (opal dock, mist as ribbons) is spaced and purposeful, not stacked in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The inversion of the girl's signal—stranger taps chest then flower, reversing her sequence—is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that grows from prior particulars and feels inevitable in hindsight. The keeper's method (observing gaps, decoding notches) transforms the stock "lighthouse keeper" frame. The borrowed-memory conceit is handled with restraint and tied to the dock's "kin" relationship with the keeper's hands, avoiding generic psychic tropes. Risk: the lyric compression and quiet ending could alienate plot-first readers, but the closure remains legible and the stance is singular.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The keeper's choices—crouch and peer along the grain, align the flower to the notch, swing the lantern in the girl's code, sweep the dock—create all major turns. His decision to answer with light and write the name into the ledger drives closure. Early signal (first paragraph), beats throughout (investigation, lantern-swing, sweeping), and closure linkage (holds flower and light as promise) all present. Cost: he assumes permanent witness duty. Slight deduction: the "eccentric" label is asserted more than dramatized through idiosyncratic micro-choices early.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The dried Edelweiss appears at inciting incident (pressed into palm), reappears when aligned to the notch (key/lock pivot), is set into the notch before the lantern-swing, and returns in the final image ("I hold the flower and the light like a promise"). Each use reweights meaning: clue → key → shrine marker → borrowed promise. Setup, development (notch alignment triggers memory), and payoff (closure image) all satisfied. High irreplaceability: the flower's specific stems fit the wear, and its mountain/sea incongruity charges the thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Borrowed memories are dramatized once: the keeper remembers the girl's vigil and her pressing the boutonniere into the notch. This memory changes his understanding (the stranger copied her gestures inverted) and enables the lantern-code reply. Setup is delayed until mid-story; development is present (memory unlocks the inversion); payoff is oblique (the final promise evokes shared witness across time). The memory's mechanics—"this dock knows my hands like kin and gives back what I have touched"—suggest a rule that could constrain future choices but does not do so on the page here, limiting causal pressure to one beat.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Softly persistent" is embodied in the keeper's method (observing gaps, patient notch-search, deliberate lantern-code) and his decision to sweep the notch rather than leave a shrine—restraint with cost. The trait enables the investigation and constrains the ending (he does not dramatize or publicize, only witnesses). Early signal ("I am a softly persistent man"), middle use (methodical search), and payoff (sweeping the dock) satisfy all gates. Visible tradeoff: his eccentricity isolates him ("if my manners look odd against the beige of the village, then so be it").</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Investigation drives every beat: searching the dock seams, finding the notch, decoding the chevrons, aligning the flower, triggering the borrowed memory, and replying with the lantern code. The keeper's method (observing gaps) is irreplaceable; swapping "investigate" for "search" or "explore" would lose the conceptual specificity. Setup (paragraph four, "I investigate by the only method…"), development (notch discovery, memory retrieval), and payoff (lantern answer, ledger entry, sweeping) all present. The action redefines options at closure: he becomes permanent ledger-keeper.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"By observing gaps" is signaled early ("gaps in stories, gaps in timetables, and the particular gap where a final breath wants to be a letter and fails"), structures the investigation (searching seams between planks, reading chevrons as "letters without letters"), and charges the closure (the swept notch becomes "any other aging flaw," a gap that hides witness). The method's mechanics matter: he does not interrogate villagers or search archives, only reads absences. Setup, development (gap-reading unlocks the notch and memory), and payoff (sweeping creates a new gap) all satisfied.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The opal dock supplies the notch (third piling) that constrains the search and the planks' seams that guide it. The mist's behavior (pulling into ribbons after the lantern-swing) registers the keeper's signal and the reply from the harbor bar. The dock "took that pain into its timber," making it an active repository that enables borrowed memories. Setup (opening image), development (notch as key, dock as memory vessel), and payoff (sweeping the dock, mist responds) all present. The setting is irreplaceable: a jetty or beach would lack the notch and the kin relationship with the keeper's hands.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Nautical twilight frames the opening and establishes the liminal hour when the keeper can swing the lantern and expect a reply. "Tonight I had only one name to lean toward" signals urgency within this specific window. The timeframe does not tighten tactics as the investigation proceeds—no clock pressures the keeper to finish before full dark—but it does enable the final act (lantern-swinging requires low light). Setup and payoff present; middle pressure absent. Lyric reprise: "at nautical twilight and later" in the final paragraph reweights the duration as open-ended witness rather than a single-night task.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The desire to decode the stranger's final gesture is dramatized immediately (pressed flower, chest tap, pointing) and drives every choice: search, notch discovery, memory retrieval, lantern reply, ledger entry. Friction between want and cost is visible: the keeper accepts permanent ledger-keeper duty and isolation ("if my manners look odd… then so be it") to honor the signal. Setup (inciting incident), development (decoding the inversion), and payoff (answering with light, writing the name, sweeping the shrine) all present. The motivation is irreplaceable; swapping it for curiosity or duty would lose the fidelity-to-witness stakes.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Witnessed isolation is coherent from the opening ("I stood there with the lantern tucked low, listening for the sea") through the borrowed memory ("She waited here, nights when the ice chimed") to the closure ("an eccentric lighthouse keeper doing his best work by observing gaps"). Tone modulates: quiet attentiveness during the search, elegiac weight when the memory rises, restrained triumph when the mist answers. The final image—"I hold the flower and the light like a promise that can be borrowed but not owned"—charges isolation as chosen duty rather than loneliness. Tone is indispensable to the stakes; removing it would flatten the witness theme into mere plot.</comment>
