<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Jae is consistently characterized through concrete action—tuning gantries, pulling levers, whispering to the station—and his obsession with sideways time manifests in specific micro-choices (fashioning the probe, inverting fields). His internal contradiction between the obliging mechanic role and the boundary-pushing theorist creates productive tension. The ending choice to "just touch the history" and accept "proof arrived as an affection" shows earned renunciation with visible cost (he withholds his doubled self-sighting), though the cost could land more sharply on the page. Minor: some interiority leans slightly abstract ("temporal" rather than showing confused clock behavior), keeping this out of the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered images (frost, compasses ticking, vault singing) and the closure reconfigures the premise—sideways time proven not by data but by affection and the glimpsed doubled self. Orientation anchors cleanly by line 2 (plateau rim, station, frost). One meaningful deepening occurs when Jae inverts the fields and the mantas return, then a second reconfiguration at the ending when he sees his own temporal double and chooses silence, foreclosing the public proof path with felt cost. The RR (Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise) lands on the page: "liked that the proof arrived as an affection, not a test, and felt forgiven" crystallizes his stance shift. Closure cost is legible but slightly oblique—he gains proof yet withholds it, a renunciation that charges the final image without a sharp visible sacrifice scene.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The station-as-harp metaphor, ravine compass behavior, vault smelling of ozone, and the lever "smeared with a century of anxious hands" create a tactile, strange micro-world. Spatial choreography is clean (plateau rim, corridors, vault, gantry rail, ravine). The lever and vault environment directly enable Jae's key choice—pulling it opens the temporal lattice—and the recurring "hush of beating wings at rest" returns in the closure beat to charge his whispered command. The mantas' physical return (shadows crossing "twice for every once") makes the abstract concrete. Gate met: environment constrains the middle choice (he must lean into the vault, risk surge) and charges the final image (vault singing faintly, delayed selves gliding past).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: prove sideways time and recover the mantas. Pressure coheres through the Accumulative lens: magnetic nexus traps the herd, Jae builds the probe, pulls the lever (one tightening that narrows his option to retreat), inverts fields (second tightening), mantas return. Agency is clear—his choices drive each beat. Cost is visible: he risks surge, succeeds, but then withholds the full proof (his own temporal echo) to preserve the affection over the test, foreclosing the public-validation path. The escalation is modest but sufficient for this length; no second reversal complicates the inversion, so the turn feels slightly linear, keeping this below 8.5.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—time as lateral drift, proof as gift rather than conquest—emerges through concrete images (oil-on-water wake, parade passing sideways, delayed selves) without thesis statements. The mantas function as both biological mystery and metaphor for orthogonal existence. The ending's "proof arrived as an affection, not a test, and felt forgiven" reweights Jae's scientist goal into a relational stance, a non-literal answer to the premise that resonates without moralizing. The vault's "choir of delayed selves" and his choice to touch but not pull again layer past/present/affection into a single charged image. Subtext operates cleanly in gesture (touching the lever, not pulling; laughing small) and in the biologists' unknowing gratitude.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Jae; perceptual signature is consistent (mechanical detail, poetic compression: "wind combed," "lights bowed"). Voice modulates under pressure: the lever-pull sequence tightens syntax ("He pulled, and the coils woke"), while calmer beats expand into lyric rhythm. Diction stays within a mechanic-poet register without jarring shifts. No dialogue on the page; interior voice is distinct and purposeful. Minor: a few phrases lean slightly elevated for a mechanic under stress ("orthogonal now," "parade passed sideways"), though they read as his theoretical vocabulary rather than author intrusion, so the effect is acceptable and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; no template runs. Information density is high—most lines do double work (e.g., "lever...smeared with a century of anxious hands" = history + tactile dread). No paraphrase loops detected. A few figurative choices stack without muddle: "harp for the wind," "corridor of possibility," "city mid-yawn" all land clearly. Minor friction: "icy warmth" recurs four times, twice as pure descriptor without added pressure, nudging toward motif-for-motif's-sake; the phrase does charge the ending laugh, so net effect is positive but the repetition slightly dulls mid-story momentum. One scaffold phrase: "somewhere sideways from the weather" reads as poetic filler. Propulsion remains strong through peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Premise—migratory sky-mantas trapped in orthogonal time, rescued by a mechanic who sees time as lateral—is specific and non-obvious. The synthesis of xenobiology, geomagnetic anomaly, and holographic field-mapping feels fresh and internally coherent. Risk-taking in structure (accumulative/lyric without set-piece confrontation) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The mantas' double-shadow detail and Jae's glimpsed temporal echo are both surprising and earned in hindsight. Transformation test passes: the emotional arc (obligation → theory → proof-as-gift) is inseparable from this exact setting and these mantas. The "sideways time" concept avoids derivative time-loop or parallel-world templates by anchoring in magnetic topology and the specific image of lateral drift. Bonus +0.3 for bold structural choice that maintains coherence.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Jae (obliging sky mechanic) drives all key turns: fashioning the probe, pulling the lever, inverting fields, and the final renunciation (withholding his doubled sighting). Present in setup (tuning gantries), middle (vault/lever), and closure (touching lever, not pulling again; seeing his echo). His role as obliging mechanic creates the tension—biologists humor him, he keeps things warm—that motivates his quiet proof strategy. Causal pressure is strong across three beats. Cost is tied to him: he gains proof but must keep it private to preserve its nature as affection. Irreplaceable: his mechanic skills enable the solution and his theoretical obsession frames the stakes.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Magnetic nexus at twilight: introduced early ("compasses ticked," "Data suggested"), used in middle (Jae maps it with the probe, "a knot where direction went blind"), and causally active at closure (the lattice steadies, corridor trapped there is inverted). Appears in three distinct beats: diagnosis, mapping with probe, inversion to release mantas. Shapes tactics—Jae must map it before he can invert it—and the nexus's trapping function is the story's central obstacle. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage. Not quite indispensable (a different anomaly type could serve), so capped below 8.5, but very well integrated.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Subdued awakenings: biologists whisper about it early, framing the mystery (mantas stopped arriving, "lulled...into a wider dream"). It sets the stakes but does not return or constrain choices after the opening third. Jae's solution (lateral time) reinterprets the subdued state, so the concept receives thematic payoff, but the phrase itself does not recur or shape middle tactics. Functional setup, weak development, lyric closure link via reinterpretation. Two gates (setup, implicit payoff) allow ~6.0–6.3 range; lands at 6.2 for the thematic reprise.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mechanically warm: appears twice—"hands roughened by cold, and a voice that carried an icy warmth" (setup) and "warmth only reached him through the instruments, a mechanically warm promise" (middle vault scene). The second use is metaphorical warmth-via-data, not a trait that enables or constrains action with visible cost. It colors tone and reinforces his role but does not drive a turn. Two-beat presence (setup, middle) but no closure participation and no cost tied to it. Mid-band: shapes mood, not stakes.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lever: introduced with history and dread ("smeared with a century of anxious hands"), pulled at the story's major turn ("He pulled, and the coils woke"), and returned to at closure ("sometimes at dusk he returned to the lever, not to pull it, just to touch the history"). Drives the key escalation (waking the coils opens the lattice) and the final renunciation (touching, not pulling = acceptance of proof-as-gift). Three-gate full integration. Causal pressure is high—without pulling, no mantas return. Cost is legible: risking surge, then later choosing restraint. Very strong integration; not quite 9+ because the lever itself could be another activation device with minor edits, though its specific history-laden description makes it nearly irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Through holographic principles: signaled early ("fashioned a probe to map it through holographic principles, layering fields upon ghosted fields"), used again in the climax ("Through holographic principles again, he inverted the fields"). Shapes the method—holography allows him to layer and then invert the temporal corridor—so it constrains his approach and enables the solution. Two distinct beats (probe construction, field inversion) and tied to closure success. Missing stronger closure reprise (the principle is not charged in the final image), and the mechanics remain abstract (what does "layering fields" require?), so it reads somewhat swappable with another technical method. Solid integration, but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Xenobiology research station: anchors setting throughout (plateau rim, glide-gantries, tracking gantry, vault). Provides the tools (gantries, coils, probe infrastructure) that enable Jae's solution and the social pressure (biologists' whispers, their gratitude). Present in setup, middle (vault access), and closure (station trembles when mantas leave). The station's resources matter causally, and the "harp for the wind" image returns subtly in the final paragraph's trembling. Three gates met. Not quite essential—story could occur at a different facility type—but strongly integrated across beats and closure. Lands mid-7s for solid causal and atmospheric work.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Within the hush of beating wings at rest: used as a metaphorical timeframe descriptor twice—"every corridor held the hush" (setup) and Jae's whispered command "Stay...within the hush of beating wings at rest" (climax). Functions as tone/image rather than a ticking clock. No tracked duration or deadline that alters tactics. The phrase recurs with purpose (Jae invokes it to calm the station during the field inversion), so it has mid-story and closure presence, but it does not constrain decisions via time pressure. Two-beat lyric reprise without causal clock function: eligible for ~4.8–5.2; lands at 4.8 because the "timeframe" is poetic rather than durational.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>To prove that time moves sideways: stated early ("He was trying to prove"), drives all middle action (fashioning probe, pulling lever, setting holographic markers), and transforms at closure into proof-as-affection rather than test. Motivation is dramatized through his choices and the final renunciation (withholding his own echo sighting to preserve the gift nature of the proof). Three gates fully met. Causal pressure is strong—his desire to prove it structures every beat. Cost is visible: he succeeds but must keep the most striking evidence private. High integration; not quite 9+ because the motivation statement itself is slightly told ("trying to prove") rather than shown first through failed attempts, though the later beats more than compensate.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Icy warmth: introduced in the first paragraph ("voice that carried an icy warmth"), recurs in description ("mechanically warm"), and charges the ending ("small sound tucked into the icy warmth of the returning herd"). Tone is coherent—formal yet tender, cold environment met with emotional care—and modulates under pressure (vault scene tightens, ending softens). Present in setup, middle, and closure, and the oxymoron itself reweights at the end (warmth = herd's return + Jae's private forgiveness). Strong tonal control. Not quite 8.5+ because the tone is consistent rather than transformed by a visible turn; it colors rather than drives the final image's charge.</comment>
