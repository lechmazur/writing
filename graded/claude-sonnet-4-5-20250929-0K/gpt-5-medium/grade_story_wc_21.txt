<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The archivist's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions (arranging debris, feeding punches into diary), but interiority leans heavily on poetic abstraction ("breath a metronome, my motive simple and ruinous") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The grandmother and clerk materialize as purposeful pressure points, yet their agency feels more symbolic than dramatized—they deliver rather than resist. The final choice to file and carry forward reads as stance crystallization with visible cost (remaining "half-retrocognitively trapped"), meeting the length's demand, but the peak beats favor lyric declaration over embodied struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural with Situational pressure. The piece teaches its mosaic pattern early (zeppelin → shore → lagoon → reverie → return) and maintains legible transitions. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the archivist remains partially trapped yet walks forward, the city learning to read itself—a reconfiguration with felt cost made visible in "half-retrocognitively trapped" and the ongoing embodiment of courage. Orientation anchors (archivist, zeppelin, coast) arrive within the first 120 words. One meaningful deepening occurs when the clerk descends with stenograph punches, unlocking suppressed testimony and narrowing options toward public record. The cost is conceptual and relational (officials face signatures, the archivist carries permanent split presence), legible in the final images.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: it "drinks starlight," mirrors the mosaic, and triggers the retrocognitive trap, directly shaping the archivist's tactics (arranging debris, signaling witnesses). The floating library and beach debris are handled across multiple beats, with kelp, shells, and punches serving as tools that alter later options. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful ("salt-stiff crate," "smoke damp," "moonlight prints us"), filtered through the archivist's archival lens. The final image of the lagoon as "obsidian vow" charges closure. Spatial choreography remains clear across zeppelin, shore, and reverie layers.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncovering suppressed civil-rights records—is signaled early and coheres under Accumulative/Textural pressure. One meaningful tightening occurs when the clerk empties stenograph punches into the archivist's hands, unlocking erased testimony and forcing the choice to publish. The retrocognitive trap raises visceral cost (scalding reverie, inability to breathe), and the resolution pays a visible price: the archivist remains partially trapped while the city speaks. Agency is clear (arranging patterns, calling for parley, filing evidence), though much pressure is delivered through mystical mechanics rather than antagonist resistance, which slightly softens the felt stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—testimony as bridge, record as resistance to erasure—emerges organically from particulars: the diary that refuses ink, the lagoon that reflects absence, officials vanishing their own memos. The final image offers a resonant answer without stated moral: "a city learning to read itself aloud, each breath a restored margin" reweights the premise with conceptual cost (perpetual half-presence in the past). Subtext operates in the circularity of giving/receiving letters, the parley as anti-prayer, and the grandmother's water-signature. The piece resists tidy resolution; the archivist's partial entrapment acknowledges lasting price. No thematic echo contaminates the closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV with consistent psychic distance and vivid perceptual signature: "memory drags me like undertow," "her eyes an archive no court could compel." Diction remains elevated and poetic throughout, voice-appropriate for a solemn archivist processing historical trauma. Compression and ellipsis are purposeful, taught early ("time is a circular affidavit"), and remain legible at closure. One minor slip: "I am back where the bridge was chained" momentarily flattens into catalog rather than lived perception. The grandmother and clerk lack distinct speech (no dialogue appears), but their gestures carry subtext. Filter verbs are sparse; narrator reliability is stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, alternating longer lyric lines with crisp declaratives ("I kneel"; "She is a retired clerk"). Information density is high; nearly every sentence advances image, stake, or mystical mechanics. Minor loop detected: "the diary I already carry, because here time is a circular affidavit" restates circularity without added pressure. Figurative language is dense ("hush swells like a gavel lifted above sea," "pens hover like gulls starving") but mostly coherent; one mixed vehicle: "kelp coil like a ribbon pinned to courage" awkwardly conflates physical and abstract. No template cadence or scaffold. Pronoun references stay clear across mystical layers. Elevated diction fits the archival voice but risks distancing at peak visceral moments ("scalds" could be more embodied).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Premise—retrocognitive archive work via mystical lagoon parley—offers a fresh synthesis of civil-rights testimony and speculative mechanics. The zeppelin library, stenograph punches as missing syllables, and beach-debris semiotics are specific and non-obvious. Emotional truth anchors the fantastical: the archivist's drive to uncover is rooted in grandmother witness and civic wound, not surface novelty. The circular affidavit structure and half-trapped ending commit fully to the premise's implications. Risk-taking (lyric compression, mosaic timeline, no antagonist dialogue) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Transformation test passes: swapping names/setting would collapse the civil-rights archive specificity. One proximity note: "water beading on her protest sash" and "eyes an archive" lean toward stock movement imagery but are redeemed by integration.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Present throughout; drives key turns: arranging debris mosaic, calling for parley, feeding punches into diary, filing evidence. Choices alter tactics and unlock closure (testimony publication). Causal pressure is clear.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Handled across multiple beats: drinks starlight, mirrors mosaic, triggers retrocognitive trap, clears to black glass, charges final vow image. Essential to closure and mystical mechanics; irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Shapes stakes from the opening; glows when touched, refuses ink, warms as pattern ripens, unlocks suppressed testimony via punches. Drives at least two beats and directly enables closure (filing testimony).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Present early ("retrocognitively trapped"); enables reverie scenes and constrains closure (archivist remains "half-retrocognitively trapped"). Cost is visible (permanent split presence). Could be slightly more irreplaceable (swap for "visionary" would require minor edits).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Occurs mid-story ("I call for parley, not prayer"); summons officials and clerk, unlocking stenograph punches. Shapes one major turn and contributes to closure theme (testimony as negotiation). Slightly swappable (could be "summon" or "convene") without full structural collapse.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Signaled early; mechanics detailed ("Lines and spirals map march routes, names of petitioners"); repeated in kelp signal and final surf reading. Shapes multiple attempts and charges closure ("surf reads them aloud with difficult tenderness"). Essential.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Present in opening and closing frame; supplies archive resources and mobility ("sail inland"). Constrains access (must leave to reach lagoon) but does not pressure peak choices. Functional across two beats; mostly atmospheric.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Marks inciting incident; establishes retrospective frame. Does not tighten decisions or track elapsed time. Functional setup but easily swappable ("after the discovery," "following the find").</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stated explicitly ("my motive simple and ruinous: to uncover truth in tension"); dramatized through refusal of monument/forgiveness, arranging absences, demanding ledger. Friction visible in scalding cost and partial entrapment. Drives closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Coherent throughout; modulates from solemn catalog to visceral scalding ("I cannot breathe there, or here") to charged resolve ("morning glints off the lagoon"). Charges final image ("each breath a restored margin") without flattening. Distinct and purposeful.</comment>
