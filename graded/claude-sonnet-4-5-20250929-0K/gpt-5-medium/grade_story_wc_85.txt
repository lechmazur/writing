<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's guilt and self-deception are embodied through concrete choices—manufacturing false memories, withholding the watch hand, bartering truth for cowardice. Internal conflict surfaces in the double awareness ("I told myself I am recording the heart, but the ledger aches with forgery") and drives the shore scene where prior lies are physically confronted. The final renunciation (keeping one page, burning the rest) emerges from accumulated pressure with visible cost. Minor dip: some interiority leans toward diagnostic phrasing ("padded silence with needles still inside"), though it remains grounded in action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors within the opening beat: cobalt terrace at dusk, guilt-ridden genealogist, Mara arriving. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the shore excavation densifies meaning through layered driftwood discoveries until the watch hand reappears and Mara names the withheld truth, delivering Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis + partial repricing). The final decision—burn the lies, keep one page—forecloses the old practice with felt cost. One micro weakness: the transition to Parliament of Wood could anchor spatial distance more concretely, but closure integrity remains intact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The cobalt terrace and Parliament of Wood shore are filtered through the narrator's guilt-soaked perception (sea "breathing like a tired archivist," tide leaves "minutes...curled into driftwood like letters addressed to no one"). The driftwood carvings constrain the search and the watch hand's placement charges the final revelation. Sensory detail is purposeful but not overwhelming. Minor gap: the transition between terrace and shore elides travel and intermediate spatial markers, creating a brief floating sensation mid-piece.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to confess the forgery and face the withheld truth—tightens through Mara's arrival, her demand to "return to origins," and the shore excavation that narrows options with each plank discovered. The watch hand's reappearance and Mara's revelation ("he saved the boy...that boy was you") force the narrator's confession with visible cost: the archive burns, one page kept as penance. Agency is clear and the price (professional identity dissolved, public memory rewritten) forecloses the old path. One escalation beat feels slightly telescoped when the fourth plank is discovered, but pressure coheres.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: the watch hand as hinge between lies and truth, driftwood as both public record and forgeable text, the genealogist's cowardice wrapped in "protection." The final lines—"Belief, like time, can lose a hand and still point to what remains"—offer a resonant non-literal answer without sermonizing. The piece resists tidy moral closure ("tempered regret, the same climate that lives in old photographs") and the plan to "seed the city with memory that does not bruise" reconfigures inheritance without stating a thesis. No overt thematic echo; cost is felt rather than declared.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice is lyric and dense, with a consistent perceptual signature ("the sea breathing like a tired archivist," "gulls stitched small commas," "sieved hush"). Dialogue is sparse but purposeful, carrying subtext ("You invented me" / "I can unmake what I made"). POV remains stable first-person with no head-hopping. Slight dip: some metaphoric clustering ("padded silence with needles still inside," "salt lines and a childlike sun") occasionally slows momentum in the middle third, and a few filter constructions ("I heard a hush learn to speak") soften immediacy under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high ("I had been deep in the story all along, the absent witness"). Opening and closing lines are resonant. However, paraphrase loops appear: "I told her how I forged the planks" / "I told her I had spent years trying to quell attention" restates confession across adjacent beats. Template cadence emerges in the final third with repeated "we will" constructions and a cluster of abstract nouns ("tempered regret," "climate," "inheritance") that dilute concreteness. No major clarity break, but momentum sags slightly before recovery at the final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The black-market genealogist premise is fresh, and the driftwood public-record system offers a tangible, non-obvious world detail that drives plot. The withheld-truth reversal (the narrator was the boy saved, not the villain) grows organically from prior clues. Lyric compression and the tempered-regret tone avoid melodrama. Minor limitation: the emotional arc (guilt → confession → ritual cleansing) follows a recognizable template, though specificity of execution (watch hand, driftwood language, sieved hush) lifts it above generic. Risk-taking in structure and voice is present but not bold enough to fully escape the gravitational pull of the confession-and-forgiveness arc.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The guilt-ridden genealogist drives all major choices: waiting on the terrace, confessing at the shore, burning the archive. The trait constrains tactics (years of "quelling attention") and enables the final renunciation with visible cost (professional identity dissolved). Present in opening, middle excavation, and closure ritual. Irreplaceable: the forgery skill and guilt are causally inseparable from the withheld-truth revelation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The watch hand appears in three beats: kept honest early, pointed to by the fifth carving, lifted by Mara who names it Abel's at closure. Its return reweights prior lies and charges the final ritual. Specific properties (salt-stained, thin, snapped from lighthouse watch) matter. Strong causal and closure linkage; slightly below indispensable because the story could substitute another artifact with minor edits, but integration is deep.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Sieved hush" recurs as atmospheric texture ("A sieved hush sifted from the alleys," "in that sieving I heard a hush learn to speak," "a sieved hush returned between us") and the shore search is described as "sieving." It colors tone and loosely mirrors the genealogist's sorting of truth from lies, but does not constrain a specific on-page choice or narrow options. Lyric reprise at closure is present but functions more as motif than pressure lever. Functional but not essential.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Manufacturing false memories is signaled early, drives the central conflict (Mara was told her father abandoned her), and the shore excavation dramatizes the method (faked driftwood carvings). The confession ("I had manufactured the false memory that saved my name") and the archive-burning ritual both hinge on this trait. Visible cost: professional dissolution and Mara's grief. Strong integration across setup, middle, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Quell" appears twice: "I had come under the weight of unspoken words" links to quelling scandal years ago, and later "I had spent years trying to quell attention rather than earn forgiveness." It frames the narrator's strategy and motivates the confession, but the shore excavation and burning ritual could proceed without this exact verb. Functional reprise but not indispensable; shapes backstory more than present tactics.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sifting through driftwood carvings is signaled early (the city's birth/death system), executed on-page across multiple beats ("We searched for hours," planks read sequentially), and delivers the key revelation (fourth plank names both surnames, fifth points to watch hand). The method's mechanics—tide-carved language, replicas vs. true planks—constrain the search and enable closure. Irreplaceable: the story's logic collapses without this exact means.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The cobalt terrace frames the opening and closing, providing spatial anchor and charged atmosphere ("the terrace went cobalt again as if night could be restarted"). It does not constrain choices but charges the bookend structure and the final "silence like a lantern with shutters." The shore (Parliament of Wood) is where decisions occur, so the terrace functions as emotional frame rather than active pressure. Solid reprise but not tactically essential.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Under the weight of unspoken words" appears in the opening and recurs conceptually ("withheld truth weighed there"). It names the emotional pressure but does not function as a ticking clock or live temporal constraint that alters tactics on the page. The timeframe is more thematic than mechanical. Lyric presence without concrete escalation leverage; functional reprise but mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Discovering the weight of a withheld truth drives both Mara ("she wanted to discover") and the narrator. The shore excavation dramatizes the pursuit with friction (forgery vs. true carvings, narrator's confession cost). The final ritual (burning lies, keeping one page) enacts the discovery with visible price. Desire is embodied in action and trade-offs across setup, middle, and closure. Strong integration; slightly shy of indispensable because the phrasing is somewhat abstract.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Tempered regret saturates voice and imagery from the opening ("the sea breathing like a tired archivist," "ledger aches with forgery") through the shore scene ("tempered regret, the same climate that lives in old photographs") to the final lines ("each of us holding silence like a lantern with shutters"). Tone modulates under pressure (confession sharpens diction) but never breaks into melodrama or sentimentality. Coherent, purposeful, and integral to the final image's resonance.</comment>
