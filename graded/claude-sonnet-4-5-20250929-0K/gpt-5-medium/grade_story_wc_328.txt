<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's mission ("turn bitterness into a cosmic joke") operates as a stated motive but remains abstract until the descent; the decision to plant the arrowhead and descend arrives late without sufficient prior tension between competing impulses. Interiority leans heavily on poetic register ("ache that arrives when something nearby wants to metamorphose") that sounds crafted rather than character-particular. The herbalist's "patience that tasted like iron" and the protagonist's choice to stay ("keeper who would laugh with them while being remade") show embodied contradiction, but the final acceptance feels inevitable rather than earned by a visible internal struggle with cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece coheres through density increase and pattern layering (garden breathing, missing returns, the arrowhead's transformations) that converge at the descent and metamorphosis. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid): the protagonist accepts keeper status, the garden "metamorphose[s] our bitterness," and "morning had been taught to return without changing what it loved"—a visible reweighting with conceptual cost (remaining "kept"). Orientation anchors who/where/mission by the third paragraph. One persistent concern: the causal link between planting the arrowhead and the staircase opening reads more associative than because/therefore, which fits the Accumulative lens but leaves the protagonist's agency feeling passive at the hinge.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The underground garden functions as micro-setting that constrains movement (doors jam, drain opens) and charges the final image (bulbs as "gravitationally playful attendants," the staircase of vertebrae). Sensory selection is vivid and filtered through the POV's cryptid-researcher attention: "roots climbed the masonry like fingers learning Braille, whispering of old weather and older mouths." The arrowhead, phone, and seedlings recur with specificity that narrows options at key beats. Spatial choreography remains clear across the descent and return.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is the protagonist's undercover mission to catalog anomalies and confront the unnamed "thing," which shifts to accepting keeper status and allowing metamorphosis. The piece offers one meaningful tightening when the arrowhead is planted and the drain opens, forcing the descent. Escalation under the Accumulative lens proceeds through density increase (missing returns, seedlings moving, floor breathing) rather than reversals. Cost is conceptual and relational: the protagonist becomes "kept by the work" and must "let the garden metamorphose our bitterness." The herbalist's warning ("keepers sometimes must be kept") signals the price, but the protagonist's acceptance arrives without visible friction or a trade-off that forecloses another path on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the interplay of bitterness, metamorphosis, and the "cosmic joke"—not cruel, but one that "lighten[s] soil, and heavy enough to hold us." The arrowhead's transformation (tooth → seed → root "that contained handwriting") and the recurring "frostbitten hope that never thaws" charge the ending without overt moralizing. The final image ("morning had been taught to return without changing what it loved") offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of whether the researcher can witness and be remade without cruelty. One slip: "to turn bitterness into a cosmic joke" is stated as mission in plain thematic terms mid-story, bordering on Echo (−0.3 guidance).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a consistent lyric-cryptid register; psychic distance modulates purposefully ("I logged each anomaly... Real notes rode in my bones"). The voice carries a distinct perceptual signature: "harmony untamed," "gravitationally playful," "frostbitten hope"—compressed, metaphor-dense diction that reads as the narrator's idiom rather than neutral description. The herbalist's single line of dialogue ("the garden needed a keeper, not a hero") contrasts with the narrator's interior texture. One persistent issue: the density of figurative language is near-uniform across high- and low-pressure beats, which flattens rhythmic modulation and risks ornamental accumulation (proximity to −0.3 in Q7 for density without clear payoff in some passages).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative language is vivid but pervasive: "garden breathed like a sleeping whale," "seedlings... like compass needles drunk on auroras," "staircase of vertebrae descending into black peppermint." In high-pressure beats (the descent, the arrowhead cracking), the metaphor density continues unabated, which dilutes urgency rather than heightening it (−0.4 for density without modulation). Sentence openings vary and rhythm supports the lyric mode. Two minor loops: "I told..." appears in adjacent beats near the end without added pressure; "the voice said/told me" recurs in template cadence (−0.2 paraphrase-loop, −0.2 template stem). Grammar and clarity are clean; no pronoun confusion or spatial muddle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of cryptid research, underground garden metamorphosis, and "bitterness into cosmic joke" is specific and non-obvious; the arrowhead-as-tooth, phone confessions, and vertebral staircase offer fresh inflections. The emotional truth—accepting being "kept" to witness transformation—feels earned in hindsight. Risk-taking in the lyric compression and the Accumulative lens heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. One limitation: the "undercover researcher" frame and "missing return changed" gesture toward urban-fantasy templates without fully transforming them through lived occupational detail or a non-obvious moral calculus at the hinge choice.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The cryptid researcher is present throughout and makes two key choices: planting the arrowhead and descending. These choices shape the middle and ending beats, but much of the first half is observation ("I logged each anomaly," "I waited for the thing no one would name") without on-page decision pressure. The role constraints tactics (janitor cover, pocket notebook) and informs the voice, pushing the score into the mid-5s for shaping one major turn and the ending.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The arrowhead appears early (herbalist's shelf), recurs in the middle when the protagonist presses it to their ear ("heard gravel weep backward into mountains"), and drives the climactic beat when planted in the soil, cracking and sprouting. It is present across setup, development, and payoff, and its transformation directly enables the staircase opening and the metamorphosis. The causal pressure and closure linkage are strong, though the protagonist's agency in choosing to plant it could be sharper.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"A harmony untamed" is mentioned twice: once as the phone voice's confession ("hiding under the mint beds, a chord too wide for our lungs") and again at the climax ("a windless choir throbbed... the body of a harmony untamed"). It enriches atmosphere and theme but does not constrain a choice or alter tactics on the page. Setup and payoff are present; middle development is absent. The concept remains ornamental rather than causal, capping the score below 5.0.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Gravitationally playful" is introduced early to describe the bulbs' rhythm, recurs when the bulbs "slowed their swing, then found a new arc" after the arrowhead is planted, and reappears at the descent ("gravitationally playful attendants"). The attribute signals a world-rule and charges the ending image, but it does not directly constrain a choice or impose a visible cost. Setup and payoff are clear; modest development presence lifts it into the mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Metamorphose" is the story's governing action: people "altered in posture," the ache "when something nearby wants to metamorphose," and the climax where "we let the garden metamorphose our bitterness." It drives the dominant stake and shapes the ending. Setup, development, and payoff are all present with strong thematic resonance. One limitation: the action is primarily conceptual and internal rather than a discrete physical choice that redefines options beat-by-beat, which keeps it from reaching the high 7s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The cordless phone is introduced early as the sole informant, appears in multiple beats (ringing "every midnight," delivering confessions about the harmony and the arrowhead-as-tooth), and recurs near the climax when the protagonist "dialed the phone without ringing" to receive final instructions ("sing the hiss between stations"). Setup, development, and payoff are present. The phone provides critical information that alters tactics (plant the arrowhead, sing), pushing it into the 6+ range for shaping two beats and the approach to closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The herbalist's underground garden is the sole setting and provides continuous pressure: doors jam, the floor breathes, the drain opens to reveal the staircase. It supplies the mint beds, arrowhead, seedlings, and bulbs that drive beats and constrain the protagonist's movements. Setup, development, and payoff are strongly present. The garden's metamorphic properties shape tactics and charge the final image ("we let the garden metamorphose our bitterness"), earning a solid mid-7 score for causal essentiality.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"After the missing return changed" anchors the timeframe early, signaling a shift that sets the garden's behavior in motion. The phone's "every midnight" and the protagonist's "after hours" janitorial cover add temporal texture. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions beat-by-beat or impose a visible clock that alters tactics. Setup is present; development and payoff are weak. The score remains in the low-4s for functional presence without pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To turn bitterness into a cosmic joke" is stated mid-story as the protagonist's mission and shapes the ending where "the joke grew, not cruel, but cosmic enough to lighten soil." The motivation is dramatized in the choice to plant the arrowhead and accept keeper status, with conceptual cost (being "kept"). Setup, development, and payoff are present. One friction: the motivation is articulated in thematic language ("Not a cruel joke, but one that makes the night snort") rather than through a conflicted want-versus-fear choice on the page, which keeps it from reaching the 7+ band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>"Frostbitten hope" is introduced early via the phone voice ("frostbitten hope, like a thaw rehearsing"), recurs when the protagonist describes the harmony as pressure, and closes the story ("frostbitten hope that never thaws"). The tone is coherent, modulates with the descent and acceptance, and charges the final image. Setup, development, and payoff are all present with strong tonal consistency, earning a solid 7.0 for indispensability to the ending's emotional texture.</comment>
