<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The clock scribe's interiority is richly particular—"glacial hush turn from marble to water under his ribs"—and embodied throughout. Internal contradiction appears in the tension between flight and return, shame and tenderness, but the protagonist's agency remains entirely reflective; no on-page micro-choice under pressure alters tactics or forecloses a live option. The final stance ("keep meeting it, without demand") is articulated rather than dramatized through a concrete act with visible cost. Motivation is consistent but the change reads as contemplative realization, not a decision that narrows paths.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accrues resonance through recurring images (bells, keys, clocks, crystal forecourt) and a cadence shift at closure reweights the abandoned dream from shame to companionship. Orientation anchors who/where/when by line 2. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration—the protagonist shifts from "make peace" to "keep meeting…until both of you are home"—but the cost remains conceptual and oblique; no on-page forfeiture or visible price is legible in the final beat. One meaningful deepening is present, sufficient for this length under an accumulative lens, but the felt cost at closure is thin.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The soundless sanctuary and crystal forecourt are rendered with vivid, purposeful sensory detail—"coolness write careful letters on his soles," "micro echoes traveled through them like news carried by ants." Spatial choreography is clean across all moves. The forecourt functions as micro-setting: the protagonist's barefoot contact and the finch's arrival on the balustrade charge the final reconfiguration. Environment constrains the protagonist's listening practice and shapes the ending image, meeting the 9+ gate criterion for Q3.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reconciling the abandoned dream of a city of bells—is signaled early and coheres throughout. Pressure operates via accumulative density rather than causal escalation; the protagonist's internal negotiation deepens but does not narrow live options through on-page choices. The finch moment and the ledger-closing gesture are micro turns, not reversals that foreclose paths. No visible price or trade-off is legible; the protagonist grants himself permission without cost. Under the accumulative lens one meaningful deepening is present, but lack of a felt sacrifice keeps this mid-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly from recurring images—clocks, bells, keys, the forecourt—without overt statement. The piece resists simple resolution: "he would not rebuild the city of bells, and he would not renounce it" sustains complexity. The final image, "keep meeting it, without demand, until both of you are home," reweights the opening question without moralizing. However, the apology and permission-granting risk banality ("both weathers would count as music") and the theme is enacted mostly through reflection rather than a concrete choice with consequence, limiting resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Single-POV, stable third-close with a distinct perceptual signature: "letters he would copy later into time," "origami thunder." Diction is elevated and poetic throughout—consistent with the lyric mode—but register remains uniform across emotional beats without modulation under pressure. Some constructions verge on ornamental: "excruciatingly gentle" appears twice as a phrase-stamp, and "glacial hush" recurs without fresh inflection. No head-hopping; focalization is clean. The prose texture is memorable but the lack of rhythmic variation under pressure and repeated phrase-stamps prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high and often striking—"origami thunder," "tide before surge"—but some metaphors blur sense: "floors that remembered every footfall" and "crystal whispering forecourt after rain" are poetic but the mechanics remain vague. Paraphrase loops: "he had promised himself…In that vow he heard" restates intent across adjacent lines. Template cadence: "He carried…He stepped…He sat…He wrote…He thought…He had needed…He looked up…He whispered…He would not…He gathered…He did not…" runs through much of the piece without taught pattern. Clarity is never fully lost, but the density and loops dull momentum in the middle third. Apply −0.8 for template cadence + paraphrase loops; no artifact touches closure directly but spread is pervasive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise—introverted scribe befriending an abandoned dream in a sanctuary of silent clocks—is specific and commits fully to its lyric mode. Emotional specificity in "the righteousness was only a mask for shame, and the shame a mask for tenderness" avoids generic templates. However, the core emotional arc (flight from calling → reconciliation through contemplation) follows a familiar structure, and the resolution via reflective permission-granting lacks a non-obvious turn. The prose voice is memorable but the narrative synthesis remains derivative of lyric-reflective reconciliation templates.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The introverted clock scribe is present throughout and frames all perception. He makes one mid-scene choice—closing the ledger and standing—but it is a gesture, not a decision that alters tactics or forecloses a path. No key turn hinges on his agency; observation and reflection dominate. Present in setup, middle, and ending, but causal role is minimal. Functional but replaceable with "introverted sanctuary keeper" or similar. Two-gate participation (setup + ending presence) + passive middle + no causal pressure: 3.0 base + early signal +0.3 + closure cameo (not causal) +0.2 − swappability −0.4 − summary-only key choice −0.5 + one weak beat (ledger close) +0.3 − late first action (past 40%) −0.3 = 3.6, round to 4.2 acknowledging full-story presence.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The crystal whispering forecourt after rain appears in beats 9–12 and again at closure (beat 26): protagonist steps barefoot, writes notations, watches the finch land, whispers apology carried "in clean syllables along the crystal seams." Two distinct beats + closure linkage. The forecourt enables the protagonist's listening practice and carries his apology, but the physical properties (crystal, rain, echo) remain decorative; removing "crystal whispering" would not break story logic. Three-gate + two beats + closure link: 3.0 base + early signal (beat 9, ~40%) +0.4 + two beats +0.9 + closure linkage +0.9 + specificity (crystal seams carry apology) +0.4 − ornamental physics (whisper mechanism vague) −0.6 − swappability (courtyard after rain) −0.5 = 4.5. Lyric reprise reweights the stake at closure; add +0.8 for resonance work = 5.3. Closure participation is present but not causal (the apology could occur anywhere). Cap at 6.3 per lyric-resonance allowance, score 6.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Glacial hush appears in beat 4 ("teaching him a glacial hush no book had ever held") and beat 27 ("feeling the glacial hush turn from marble to water under his ribs"). The concept frames the protagonist's practice and the final internal shift is metaphorized through it, but it does not constrain an on-page choice or alter tactics. Primarily thematic; the hush is a quality, not a mechanism. Two touches (early + ending) + thematic charge at closure: 3.0 base + early signal +0.5 + closure linkage (image shift) +0.9 + one beat (reprise) +0.4 − label-only in middle (not actionable) −0.4 − swappability (profound silence) −0.5 = 3.9. Lyric reprise reweights meaning at closure; add +0.9 for resonance = 4.8. The final image "turn from marble to water" makes the concept embodied and essential to closure; +1.0 for irreplaceability at closure = 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Excruciatingly gentle appears three times: beat 3 ("excruciatingly gentle with the locks"), beat 17 ("felt excruciatingly gentle, this work of cupping absence"), and implicitly throughout the protagonist's handling of clocks and ledger. The trait colors action (gentle with locks, ledger-closing, cheek to glass) but does not constrain a choice with visible cost; all actions succeed without friction. Label-only in beat 17. Three touches + pervasive coloring: 3.0 base + early signal +0.6 + two distinct beats +0.9 + ending presence (cheek to glass, gentle gathering) +0.5 − no cost/tradeoff (gentleness never costs him an option) −0.8 − label-only (beat 17) −0.3 − swappability (careful, tender) −0.5 = 3.4. Attribute pervades final acts (gathering key/book, resting cheek); add +0.6 for closure texture = 4.0. Round generously for thematic coherence to 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Bear (witness) is explicit in beat 21 ("teaching him to bear witness to time without asking it to perform") and implicit in the protagonist's sustained listening practice across beats 9–27. The action shapes the entire narrative spine: the protagonist's refusal to wind clocks, his ledger of afternoons, his barefoot listening, and his final understanding all enact bearing witness. However, no single turn hinges on a discrete act of bearing; the action is continuous and atmospheric rather than a pivot. Setup + pervasive + closure: 3.0 base + early signal (beat 4 implicit, beat 21 explicit) +0.7 + three beats (listening, writing, final cheek-to-glass) +1.4 + causal pressure (defines the practice that frames closure) +1.2 + closure linkage (final understanding "to keep meeting it") +1.1 + irreplaceability (story is about this act) +0.7 − summary articulation in beat 21 (told) −0.5 − continuous rather than choice-point (no turn) −0.6 = 7.0. Subtract −0.3 for diffusion (not a discrete act); score 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>N/A</grade><comment>Required element is "None."</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The soundless sanctuary frames the entire story (beats 1–2, 28–31) and the crystal forecourt is the site of the protagonist's key listening and apology (beats 9–12, 26). The sanctuary supplies the sleeping clocks, the ledger, the key, the forecourt, and the final glass-paned case—each a resource or constraint. The protagonist's choices (barefoot stepping, ledger work, cheek-to-glass) are shaped by the sanctuary's affordances. Three-gate + pervasive: 3.0 base + early signal (beat 1) +0.8 + three beats (arrival, forecourt, case) +1.4 + causal pressure (clocks and forecourt enable listening practice) +1.3 + closure linkage (final case beat) +1.0 + micro-setting (body/forecourt) +0.5 + specificity (sleeping clocks, crystal seams) +0.6 − slight ornamental description (corridors, atrium) −0.3 = 8.0. The sanctuary is indispensable to closure; however, "soundless" is more theme than constraint. Score 7.3.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The timeframe "in the hush of a hidden sunrise" appears in beat 1 and beat 32 (frame). Dawn light and the first finch anchor the middle passage (beats 11, 22). Time does not tighten decisions—the protagonist has no deadline—but the liminal quality of sunrise charges the reflective mood and the "hidden" quality matches the sanctuary's secrecy. Frame + thematic charge: 3.0 base + early signal (beat 1) +0.7 + closure reprise (beat 32 returns the phrase) +0.9 + one beat (finch at dawn, beat 22) +0.4 + tone support (liminal quality fits reconciliation) +0.6 − no tactical constraint (time does not pressure choice) −0.8 − static (dawn throughout, no clock) −0.4 = 4.4. Lyric frame reweights opening image at closure; add +1.0 for resonance = 5.4.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The motivation "to make peace with an abandoned dream" is stated in beat 5 and enacted across every subsequent beat: listening, writing blank measures, apology, final understanding. Friction is present—"fear his hunger would eat the music," shame masked as righteousness—and the protagonist's internal negotiation accumulates toward the final permission-granting. However, the peace-making is contemplative; no on-page choice dramatizes a cost or trade-off between competing desires. Three-gate + pervasive: 3.0 base + early signal (beat 5) +0.7 + three beats (reflection beats 18–19, apology beat 25, closure beat 32) +1.4 + causal pressure (motivation drives all reflection) +1.1 + closure linkage (final understanding is the peace) +1.3 + friction (hunger vs. shame vs. tenderness) +0.8 − told more than dramatized (no choice scene) −0.7 − swappability (reconcile, forgive) −0.5 = 7.1. The final line makes the motivation indispensable; score 6.9 acknowledging the reflective rather than active mode.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Petrichor nostalgia is named in beat 2 and sustained through damp corridors, rain-jeweled forecourt, and the protagonist's backward-looking stance toward the abandoned dream. Tone is coherent and melancholy throughout, modulating only slightly at closure (from ache to companionship). The nostalgia charges the final image by making the dream "patient now, no longer burning." Setup + pervasive + closure: 3.0 base + early signal (beat 2) +0.7 + pervasive (every beat carries wistful backward gaze) +1.2 + closure charge (dream becomes patient companion) +1.1 + specificity (petrichor = rain-on-stone, tied to forecourt) +0.5 − static affect (melancholy does not shift meaningfully under pressure) −0.6 − label reliance (named rather than enacted in some beats) −0.3 = 5.6. The tone reweights the dream's status at closure (burning → patient); add +0.7 for thematic integration = 6.3.</comment>
