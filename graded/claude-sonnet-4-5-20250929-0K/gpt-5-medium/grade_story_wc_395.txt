<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator's arc from compliant archivist to voice-restorer shows clear progression, driven by the "flashlight still burning" framing. Interior work is concrete ("the silence was shaped like a missing person sitting beside me"), but the final choice feels slightly telescoped—the risk of surfacing files and "giving her voice back" is declared more than dramatically embodied in conflicting impulses on the page. Micro-choices accumulate well, yet the climactic decision to post lacks visible hesitation or trade-off that would charge the cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure arrives on the page: the narrator posts the Driftwood link, and Aida's signal returns ("Still here, still counting"), delivering a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under an Accumulative/Textural lens—the recurring numbers and callbacks crystallize meaning. The tightening is legible (lie → vault access → breadcrumb trail → Sink → posting), and the reweighting of "sensed absence" into presence is felt. Cost is implied in "risking my job and the hush," but the consequence remains slightly diffuse; a sharper on-page forfeiture (e.g., a lockout notification, a colleague's reaction) would anchor the price more firmly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The archive hum, the cold vault air "smelling like old servers," and the Sink's lyric-challenge door create a tactile micro-setting that constrains the narrator's path and charges the final act of posting to the memorial group. Spatial choreography across the "archive labyrinth" is coherent, and the digital environment is filtered through the narrator's attentive idiom. Occupational verisimilitude (metadata, node IDs, content graph) reads plausible and purpose-driven, grounding the conceptual stakes in a lived workspace.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding where deleted files go and recovering Aida's voice—is signaled early and tightens through the lie, vault descent, and Sink access. One meaningful pressure point (the choice to post publicly despite job risk) narrows options under the Accumulative lens. The escalation is clean, though the final turn would benefit from a visible complication or trade-off dramatized in the moment (e.g., a colleague's warning, a system alert) to elevate the felt cost and test the narrator's resolve more concretely.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the recurring numbers, the crash-mission patch, and the image of "deleted files" as erasure of grief and voice. The final act—posting the breadcrumb with the embedded verse—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question (where deleted files go: into memory and witness) without moralizing. The talisman line ("I began rerouting the stream across forgotten songs toward memory") reweights the narrator's role, charging the ending with quiet necessity and earned insight rooted in the vault descent and pattern-following.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and confident: lyric compression ("the flashlight everyone forgets is still burning," "the silence was shaped like a missing person") and purposeful diction ("phantom clustering," "Sink," "Driftwood") anchor the narrator's perceptual signature. POV control is stable, with no head-hopping. The prose modulates well under pressure (vault descent tightens rhythm), though a few lines in the expository middle slip toward neutrality ("Her notes whispered a different obsession") where more idiosyncratic syntax would sustain the established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance discovery or charge the motifs (numbers, patch, playlists). Rhythm varies purposefully, and the opening/closing anchors are strong. Minor scaffold appears in the middle third: "a quiet constellation of Aida, her messages, her drafts, her flagged spam, the album no one heard" reads as a list without pressure, and "the sensed absence turn solid, like holding a coat still warm" is vivid but slightly generic. No paraphrase loops or template cadence across adjacent lines; clarity and propulsion hold through the vault sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of digital-archive procedural, grief memorial, and breadcrumb mystery feels fresh and specific. The mission-patch-as-constellation map and the lyric-challenge Sink are non-obvious inventions that grow from the premise. The emotional particulars (stitched denim tributes, playlists ending abruptly) avoid template grief. Risk-taking in the lyric compression and accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, earning a within-band lift of +0.3 for bold integration of conceptual and personal stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The corporate memory keeper frames every beat: the lie enables vault access (setup and development), the vault descent and Sink navigation enact the role's obsession, and the final posting to the memorial group is the keeper's decisive choice to shift from tending archives to restoring voice (closure participation). Specific costs (job risk, policy breach) are tied to the role. Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong; irreplaceability is high.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The patch appears early (Aida's post), is examined twice (initial description and overlay with node IDs revealing the Flight 7421 constellation map), and directly shapes the vault investigation's logic. It returns in the ending image ("one new account posted a photo of that same mission patch") with reweighted meaning (Aida's signal). The patch enables a key turn (mapping the breadcrumb trail) and charges closure, demonstrating high integration and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The missing persons cold case (7421) is the inciting frame, shapes every tactic (access-bot lie, vault search, breadcrumb-following), and the resolution hinges on solving the case by surfacing Aida's hidden files. Stakes and methods derive directly from the case structure. Closure participation is explicit (cold case resolved when Aida signals return). Causal pressure, beat involvement, and closure linkage are all exemplary; the concept is indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Brightly attentive" is established early ("the flashlight everyone forgets is still burning") and enables the pattern-recognition that drives the investigation (seeing 7421 clusters the team dismisses). It constrains one on-page action (lying to the access bot with confidence born of attentiveness). The trait charges the opening and middle but is less visible in the closure beat, where posting feels more like resolve than hyper-awareness. Two gates met; lyric reprise present but faint.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lie to the access bot is the structural hinge: without it, no vault entry, no Driftwood file, no breadcrumb trail, no closure. It defines the narrator's moral calculus (choosing voice over policy) and redefines options by breaching the system. The lie is dramatized ("claiming a court order that did not exist, and the gate blinked green") with visible risk and is causally indispensable to every subsequent beat and the ending.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Recurring numbers (7s, 21s, 7421) are signaled early, dismissed by the team (setup), drive the vault search and Driftwood overlay (development), unlock the Sink via lyric-challenge prompt (causal pressure), and return in the ending caption ("Still here, still counting") to confirm Aida's breadcrumb success (closure). The method is mechanically specific (node IDs, timestamps, waveform watermarks) and irreplaceable; removing it would collapse the investigation's logic and the thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The social network archive is the frame and resource for every beat: the hum and "durable quiet" open the story, the vault's cold air and "old servers" constrain the narrator's descent, and the Sink's ritual sign-in pressures the climax. The memorial group (posting ground) is the closure site. The setting supplies the tools (access bot, content graph, metadata) and shapes tactics (following node paths, navigating policy cliffs). Integration is strong across setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Across the echo of forgotten songs" is poetic but vague as a timeframe. It appears in the opening (Aida's feed "stretched across"), primes the breadcrumb motif (playlists that end abruptly), and recurs at closure ("rerouting the stream across forgotten songs toward memory"). The phrase charges the lyric texture and ties to theme, but it does not tighten decisions or track elapsed time in a way that alters tactics. Lyric-resonance allowance applies; score in mid-band for thematic reprise without temporal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The motivation (finding where deleted files go) is Aida's obsession and the narrator's adopted quest. It drives the lie, the vault descent, and the choice to post despite policy. Friction is visible: the narrator risks job security and breaches the "hush" to honor the drive. The motivation is dramatized in choices (not told-only) and forecloses the compliant-archivist path with felt cost. Setup, development, and payoff are all clear; causal pressure and closure linkage are strong.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Tone of "sensed absence" is coherent from the opening ("beneath the hum there is a sensed absence, a durable quiet") through the vault ("the silence was shaped like a missing person sitting beside me") to the ending, where absence becomes presence ("Still here, still counting"). The tone modulates with pressure (cold vault air, the Sink's exhale) and charges the final image of memory restoration. Consistency and closure participation are both strong, earning high-band placement.</comment>
