<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator's particularized way of noticing ("creeping normality noticer," observation through displaced objects) creates a distinct perceptual signature. Interiority remains concrete through embodied observation (orris shard warming, hands trembling), though some moments veer toward diagnostic self-awareness ("I called that seam a shard of hush"). The motivation to understand aliveness in houses drives choices across three encounters, but the final realization feels slightly over-articulated rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure. The costs remain conceptual rather than viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: three house visits build density through increasing intimacy (observation → interaction → understanding). The final image achieves Conceptual Repricing—houses live "on the inadvertent ritual of attention"—reweighting all prior encounters with undeniable conceptual cost (the narrator's role as witness is redefined). Orientation anchors clearly by the opening paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when the third house "wanted me to know," narrowing from external observation to reciprocal relationship, though the cost could be more viscerally legible on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The orris root shard functions as micro-setting, constraining method and charging all three encounters (placed between spoon/cup, on threshold, pressed to banister). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: "damp rope and dill," "salt lane," tide slurring pebbles. The bay's golden hour and the body's tactile engagement (pressing, wrapping in gauze) shape each investigative choice. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly through discrete house interiors, and the recurring shard evolves from tool to relationship-maker, directly enabling the closure insight.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding house aliveness—is signaled immediately and tightens through three escalating encounters: alive-for-story, mimicking-life, alive-through-patience. The third house provides meaningful deepening when displaced objects "gathered to speak" and the narrator finds the beetle tin, a micro-turn that reweights method from observation to participation. Agency is attention and return (replacing the tin "exactly where the grain fit it"), an act of renunciation that forecloses detached study. The cost is conceptual (the narrator must now participate, not merely catalog), legible but not viscerally felt on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: displaced objects as confessions, the orris shard's "seam of hush," houses breathing differently when witnessed. The final image—"some houses feel alive because we give them our pauses, our put-backs, our almosts"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the opening question without moralizing, reweighting all prior observations. The beetle tin becomes charged motif, gaining meaning through the child's hiding and the house's patient guarding. Subtext operates in gesture (spoon leaning toward cup, broom lodged under chair) and the story resists tidy binaries, embracing the ambiguity of what constitutes aliveness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout: "creeping normality noticer," "inadvertently profound," "tide's small applause." Diction remains character-particular with purposeful compression ("hushed blaze," "slack, golden interval," "mild thunder"). Some constructions approach precious overwriting ("sky needs somewhere to sleep," "day deepened like ink steeping a brush"), but voice stays coherent under pressure. POV distance is stable; the narrator's way of noticing (objects as tongues, houses as bodies) filters all perception. Free indirect blurs intentionally when addressing houses ("sanctify me"), creating charged distance rather than confusion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>High figurative density ("tide slurred the pebbles," "rooms remember," "shutters stiff as bitten lips") risks overwriting but largely stays legible and voice-motivated. Some loops appear: "creeping normality" echoed in "creeping normality rehearsed," "breathe" repeated across opening paragraphs. Template cadence in places: "I [verb], and [result]" pattern runs through several beats. Information density is strong (most lines do multiple jobs), and rhythm modulates purposefully between observation and interaction. Proofreading clean, no major clarity breaks, but the accumulation of metaphor in every sentence of some beats (-0.4) and mild scaffold loops (-0.3) prevent higher bands.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise—understanding house aliveness through displaced objects and an orris shard—offers a fresh synthesis of animism and forensic attention. The "shard of hush" concept and the method of reading displacement feel specific and non-obvious. Emotional truth grounds the premise: the beetle tin and patient house create earned poignancy. The three-house structure risks template plotting but is transformed through escalating intimacy (observe/reject/participate). Some phrasing approaches familiar lyric territory ("sky needs somewhere to sleep"), and the final epiphany, while earned, arrives with slight over-articulation that dilutes surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The "creeping normality noticer" character frames the opening, drives all three house encounters through observation and placement of the orris shard, and arrives at the closing insight. Present in setup, middle investigations, and the final realization. The trait enables the method (noticing "when frames breathe") and constrains approach (must observe displacement to understand). The final insight depends on this exact perceptual mode. Two causal beats (choosing houses, interpreting objects) and closure linkage present, though much of the work is observational rather than high-stakes decision.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The orris root shard appears in setup (wrapped in gauze, described as holding smell and cracked along "a line like quiet lightning"), is used actively in three beats (pressed to doorframes, placed between spoon/cup, set on threshold, pressed to banister), and its warming/brightening provides tactile feedback that enables interpretation. The shard's properties (holding whispers, the seam that "sings") are irreplaceable; no generic tool would function. Present in all three investigative beats and directly shapes the method. Strong causal pressure and specificity, though it does not charge the final sentence image, which focuses on human ritual rather than the tool.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"A shard of hush" is named and defined early ("a boundary where silence split and let meaning leak"), recurs as the orris shard's property (the seam that sings), and the concept shapes the method (listening for what the seam reveals). Present in setup and middle beats; the final insight returns to the idea of houses holding pauses and "almosts," a thematic echo. The concept enables tactics (pressing the shard to thresholds, listening) but functions more as atmospheric frame than stake-altering force. Two-gate presence (setup, development) with lyric reprise at closure, but the ending pivots to human ritual rather than the hush itself.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Inadvertently profound" appears as label in the opening and once in description of the orris note ("inadvertently profound, like a child explaining"). The trait does not constrain a choice or enable a key action; it describes the narrator's observational style but does not trade off against another approach or carry visible cost. Present as characterization but ornamental to plot mechanics. Mentioned in setup but does not participate in middle beats or closure beyond thematic echo.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Sanctify" appears twice: once as a request ("sanctify me, I said, if I have read you falsely") and once as the dust's whisper at the beetle tin. The action marks a shift from observation to supplication, a micro-turn in stance toward the houses. It enables the reciprocal relationship in the third house (finding and returning the tin after the whispered "sanctify"). Present in middle and near-closure beats, shapes the final gesture of return, and the word's religious weight charges the narrator's humility. Two beats with causal link to the ending act, though the final sentence does not return to the word itself.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The method "through displaced objects" is signaled early ("houses, like bodies, confess in the way their belongings drift"), applied in all three house encounters (spoon/cup, rug squared, clock/broom/hat), and the mechanics matter: alignment reveals aliveness, stasis reveals mimicry. The method shapes each investigation's outcome and culminates in the beetle tin discovery, where correct replacement ("exactly where the grain fit it") triggers the house's inhale. Present across setup, all middle beats, and the closure insight depends on this exact method. Strong causal pressure and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The "quiet bay in spring" anchors location in the opening, provides atmospheric detail (tide slurring pebbles, gull's cry, seawall), and the hour while streetlights daydream frames time. The bay's breathing and the salt lane supply sensory texture but do not constrain choices; houses could be investigated in any coastal or inland setting. Present in setup and transitional beats, returns as image ("bay pulled light from the sky") but does not alter tactics. The setting enriches atmosphere without applying pressure to the investigative method or outcome.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"While the streetlights daydream" is named early as "that slack, golden interval when edges blur," marking the investigation's window. The timeframe recurs ("until the streetlights fully woke") but does not tighten decisions or create urgency; the narrator moves at contemplative pace through three houses without clock pressure. Present in setup and one transition, but the time remains atmospheric rather than tactical. No scene depends on completing work before the window closes, and the ending does not reference the timeframe.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The motivation "to understand why some houses feel alive" is declared in the opening ("I came with a single, stubborn motive") and drives all three investigations. The narrator pursues this through observation, orris placement, and interpretation, arriving at the closing insight ("some houses feel alive because we give them our pauses"). Desire is dramatized through method and shown in micro-choices (asking who, whispering thanks, returning the tin). Present across setup, middle beats, and closure. The motivation shapes all tactics, though friction between want and cost is conceptual rather than viscerally embodied.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Hushed blaze" as tone is established early ("the town held its breath in a hushed blaze") and maintained through paradoxical pairings: quiet observation charged with reverence, suppressed intensity in "mild thunder," "small moon," "tiny vows." The tone modulates with pressure (stove ticks absolution, house inhales) and charges the final image of patient attention. Coherent through all turns, the oxymoron holds steady rather than evolving. Present in setup and ending, with consistent register throughout, though the tone remains singular rather than dynamically shifting under escalation.</comment>
