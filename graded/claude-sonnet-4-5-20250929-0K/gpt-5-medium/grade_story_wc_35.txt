<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The chef's interiority is vivid and embodied ("mouth full of borrowed thunder," jaw aching "like old rope"), with concrete micro-choices (letting the filament touch, whispering to the coral, tasting the broth). Internal conflict appears—caution vs. transformative impulse—but the keeper's memory intrusion feels more told than earned through prior dramatization. The final change (keeper standing taller, memory subsumed) registers but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the peak beat; the progression reads more therapeutic than agonistic.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece builds through recurring images (puddles, coral, ice, remorse) and a cadence shift at the cooking sequence that reweights the dominant stake. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the keeper endures with visible cost ("standing taller… without bleeding every time he moved"), and the chef saves coral for future use, forecloses the path of erasure. Orientation anchors (fortress, chef, post-rain) arrive within the first 120 words. One meaningful deepening occurs when the pavilion filament touches the chef and transfers the keeper's memory, narrowing options from observation to transformative cooking. Cost is legible in the keeper's embodied relief and the chef's decision to keep a tool for future work.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sensory detail is dense and purposeful: wet stone, singed cumin, coral slick with ice, peppers hissing "like dunes in moon wind." The pavilion itself—coral frozen mid-bloom—constrains the chef's choice (must cut prisms, wrap in wet cloth, cook slowly). The fortress and its post-rain pools function as micro-setting that anchors the opening and recurs at closure ("puddles began to vanish… leaving only salt rings"). Spatial choreography is coherent across courtyard, dunes, pavilion, and kitchen.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: transform stored remorse into something bearable, signaled early ("sandpaper rough memories… leave grain without splinters"). One meaningful tightening: the pavilion's filament touches the chef, transferring the keeper's unbearable memory and raising the cost of cooking from it. The choice to cook (whispering to the coral, rendering it into broth) narrows options and forecloses the path of leaving the archive untouched. Visible cost appears in the first spoon scouring the chef's throat with brass before softening, and in the keeper's visible relief. No antagonist required; pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens as the contagious remorse accumulates and is then subsumed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—transformation of unbearable memory through precise, embodied craft—emerges from the cooking sequence without direct statement. The pavilion as archive that "wants a reader who will not just collect but transform" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of how to bear remorse. The final image (saving coral for future storms, salt rings and beetle tracks) reweights prior material: the chef becomes a keeper of tools for future rough memories, not a savior. Subtext operates in the keeper's silence, the chef's careful hedging ("not frame myself as savior"), and the fortress exhaling its dream.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable and filtered through the chef's professional lens: reading puddles as recipes, tasting air above the box, charting paths "like a vein." Diction is lyric and compressed ("desert fortress smelled of wet stone and singed cumin," "coral should not live here, and yet here everything sturdy turns brittle when kept") with a distinct perceptual signature. The two lines of dialogue (keeper's warnings, chef's question/whisper) carry subtext and goal pursuit. Psychic distance remains controlled; no head-hopping. The prose modulates with pressure: early reflective texture gives way to tighter action beats during the pavilion encounter and cooking.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("memories… taste like salt note that made my jaw ache like old rope," "emotion spilled like brine"). Minor loop: "the keeper ate while staring at his hands" repeats the motif of hands without added pressure. Template cadence appears in the opening third ("I was the chef," "People came to me," "I learned long ago") but does not pervade. One metaphor strain: "blistered peppers until they hissed like dunes in moon wind" asks peppers to sound like wind-rubbed sand, which blurs the vehicle. Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs. No major scaffold or clarity breaks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The synthesis—chef as memory-worker + coral pavilion archive beneath desert dunes—is specific and non-obvious, avoiding stock metaphors. The emotional truth (remorse that "threatened to splinter everything I used to hold steady" yet can be "subsumed into a body that could bear it") is earned through the cooking sequence rather than asserted. The piece commits fully to its lyric-accumulative design. Risk: high figurative density and compressed syntax heighten stakes without obscuring clarity, though the opening's reflective texture delays forward pressure. The premise transforms familiar memory-work tropes through the tactile, culinary lens and the paradoxical coral-ice pavilion.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The chef is present throughout and makes key choices: to go to the pavilion, to let the filament touch, to cook the coral. These decisions alter tactics (from observation to transformation) and drive the cooking sequence. The trait (tasting memories) is used on-page: tasting air above the box, tasting the broth. Visible cost: throat scoured with brass, then softening. Appears in opening, middle exploration, and closure cooking. Three beats: tasting air, receiving the keeper's memory, cooking and serving. Causal pressure: without the chef's skill, the remorse remains unprocessed. Closure linkage: the final act (saving coral) depends on the chef's role. Early signal present. Minor friction: the trait is slightly ornamental in the opening reflective passage before the box arrives.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The pavilion is discovered, explored, touched (filament reaches), and harvested (cutting prisms). Three distinct beats: opening beneath the dunes, the filament's touch transferring memory, and the cutting/wrapping for transport. Causal pressure: the pavilion's properties (ice + coral = durable + porous remorse) enable the cooking solution. Closure linkage: the coral becomes the broth and the chef saves a jar for future storms. Early signal: the blue sand box in the courtyard primes the pavilion's discovery. Specificity: coral should not live in the desert, and the ice does not melt—unique properties that matter. Visible cost: the filament's touch transfers unbearable memory. Minor friction: the pavilion itself is passive; the chef and keeper act upon it.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stored remorse shapes the dominant stake (transform it into something bearable) and the pavilion's function ("built to archive remorse"). Two beats: the keeper brings blue sand that "carries the remorse of those who drowned far from water," and the chef cooks the coral to "render… a broth that can be borne." Causal pressure: the contagious remorse narrows the chef's options—must either leave it or subsume it. Closure linkage: the keeper's remorse is subsumed, and the chef saves coral for "future rough memories." Early signal: the concept is named in the keeper's warning and the pavilion's revelation. Minor friction: the concept is more thematic than tactile; the on-page cost is the keeper's visible relief, which reads slightly summary.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Contagion through touch is established early (keeper's warning: "Do not touch… emotionally contagious through touch") and constrains two choices: the chef initially tastes air instead of touching, then later lets the filament touch and receives the keeper's memory ("emotion spilled like brine"). Visible cost: the chef reels, and the memory threatens to "splinter everything I used to hold steady." The trait enables the plot turn (only by touching can the chef access the specific remorse to cook). Present in three beats: warning, the chef's initial caution, the decisive touch. Early signal. Specificity: the touch mechanism drives the middle escalation.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Subsume" is the verb that names the chef's method ("If I cooked from it, I could subsume the worst of it") and recurs at closure ("the memory not erased but subsumed into a body that could bear it"). The cooking sequence enacts this: rendering coral into broth, tasting, serving. Two beats: the chef's internal decision ("let me render you") and the final meal. Causal role: without subsuming, the remorse remains archived and unbearable. Closure linkage: the keeper's state at the end depends on this action. Minor friction: "subsume" is slightly abstract; the cooking sequence is the concrete enactment, and "subsume" functions more as thematic label than a visible, irreplaceable action beat.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Analyzing tidal pool formations appears early ("I learned long ago to read those puddles by analyzing tidal pool formations") and is used once more when the chef studies the post-rain pools to chart a path to the pavilion ("scalloped edges told me where currents of thought would settle"). Two beats: the opening explanation and the middle navigation. The method shapes one tactic (finding the throat in the dunes) but is not returned to at closure. Minor swappability: the chef could navigate by other means (e.g., following the keeper's directions). Early signal present. Specificity: the tidal-pool metaphor is unique but not causally indispensable beyond the navigation beat.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The desert fortress after rain is anchored early (opening line) and recurs at closure ("the fortress exhaled its dream completely, and the puddles began to vanish"). The post-rain puddles function as micro-setting: they are read as recipes/maps and guide the chef to the pavilion. Three spatial zones: courtyard (puddles, box), dunes (throat, pavilion), kitchen (cooking). The rain creates the conditions (flood opens throat, puddles as maps) that enable the plot. Closure participation: the fortress's exhalation and vanishing puddles frame the final image. Minor friction: the fortress itself is more atmospheric container than active constraint; the puddles do more causal work.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"At the close of an unspoken dream" appears in the opening line and recurs once ("when the unspoken dream of the fortress had almost exhaled") and at closure ("the fortress exhaled its dream completely"). The timeframe is more lyric metaphor than a live clock; it does not tighten decisions or create urgency. No visible time pressure on the chef's choices. The phrase charges the tone (liminal, exhaling) but does not alter tactics. Lyric reprise present but without causal constraint. Late middle mention and closure callback, but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The motivation ("to sandpaper rough memories, not erase them, to leave grain without splinters") is stated early and drives the chef's vocation. Two beats: the opening explanation and the cooking decision ("let me render you into heat and cinnamon and a broth that can be borne"). The choice to cook rather than erase is dramatized, and the broth's effect (scoured throat, then softening) enacts the sandpaper metaphor. Visible cost: the chef's throat is scoured; the keeper's relief shows the memory now bearable. Minor friction: the motivation is slightly summary in the opening; the cooking sequence dramatizes it more fully. Closure linkage: the keeper's final state ("could bear it without bleeding") fulfills the motivation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Sturdy brittle" is named once midway ("coral should not live here, and yet here everything sturdy turns brittle when kept") and enacted throughout: the pavilion is coral frozen mid-bloom (sturdy + brittle), the keeper's memory threatens to splinter, the broth scours then softens, the keeper stands taller but the memory's edges remain. The tone modulates: opening lyric reflection, tightening at the pavilion touch, charged cooking sequence, quiet closure with salt rings. The oxymoron charges the final image (keeper steady but aware of fragility; chef saving coral as tool, not cure). The tone does not flatten under pressure. Two distinct tonal beats: the pavilion's cold glow and the cooking heat. Closure participation: the keeper's state and the saved coral embody sturdy-brittle coexistence.</comment>
