<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interior voice is distinctive and consistent—warmly inquisitive stance embodied through physical interaction with objects and the elevator itself. The affection toward machinery ("let my voice hum small reassurances to the bolts") grounds motivation in micro-choices. However, interiority occasionally slips into elevated abstraction ("pain is a folded letter") that reads more thematic than character-particular under pressure. The final choice to leave the diary open and arrange the letters is earned by the accumulative stance, but the cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The ten-floor structure teaches its pattern early and each rise deepens understanding of Mirek's cipher and the narrator's parallel task. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (the diary left open, letters arranged "warmly inquisitive") with conceptual cost legible in the line "joy, once found, keeps the bolts from tiring"—a reweighting of the servant's role. Orientation is clear (servant, elevator, spire) by the opening lines. One minor causality slip: the cipher wheel appears suddenly on floor seven without prior setup of negative-space technique.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The icebound spire, frost flowers, and scattered light through goggles constrain the decryption method across multiple beats. The elevator as "throat" recurs with purpose, and the final chamber of shelves provides the spatial anchor for closure. Sensory detail (whale oil smell, mica slivers, gust-seeded snow) is filtered through the narrator's affectionate focus. The micro-setting of goggles and light coins functions as environment that enables tactics, meeting the 9+ gate requirement for constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: decode the diary to honor Mirek's method of smuggling joy. Pressure accumulates floor by floor as the narrator pieces together cipher mechanics, culminating in the alignment with the tin's polish. The tightening is one meaningful deepening (understanding that encryption protects against despair, not thieves) that reweights the task. Agency is present in the arrangement choice and vocal promise, but the cost is primarily conceptual—no live option is visibly foreclosed on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the diary's purpose (joy encrypted against despair) and the narrator's parallel role as caretaker of absences. The final image—diary left open, objects arranged with "warmly inquisitive" care—offers a non-literal answer to "how to keep what breaks you" without moralizing. Mirek's line "Keep what breaks you where you can love it without smoke" lands as earned wisdom from concrete struggle. The cipher-as-affection conceit threads consistently from margins to closure without thesis statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Voice is lyric and consistent, with a perceptual signature that notices kinship between narrator and machine ("grin its toothy gears back"). Register occasionally elevates into poetic abstraction ("affectionate detachment," "weather learned mercy") that feels authorial rather than servant-bound, especially under the conceptual pressure of decryption. No dialogue present. Focalization remains stable; the narrator's way of seeing (light as coins, letters as fish learning air) is idiosyncratic and held throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully with the ten-floor structure; paragraph lengths create visual cadence. Figurative density is high throughout ("frost flowers lace," "sky…breathe on cue," "elevator shudders like a beast remembering its spine") and mostly coherent, but the accumulation in peak beats (floors 8–10) risks overwriting without clear payoff escalation. Minor template cadence: "On the [ordinal] rise" recurs mechanically across all ten beats. Information density is strong—most lines advance understanding or charge objects—but occasional paraphrase loops appear ("affection helps steadiness, so I let my voice hum small reassurances").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The ten-floor structure as decryption tutorial is a fresh synthesis; the goggles-and-scattered-light mechanic feels specific rather than stock. The inversion (encryption protects against despair, not thieves) offers a non-obvious angle on hidden-message tropes. Emotional specificity in the narrator's care for both diary and elevator distinguishes this from template "servant on a mission" plots. Risk-taking in the lyric register and accumulative pacing heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, earning modest bonus within band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Servant role frames the assignment and shapes the approach (retrieve vs. honor). The narrator's micro-choices—humming to the elevator, angling goggles repeatedly, arranging rather than clutching letters—demonstrate agency. The final vocal promise ("I answer aloud that I will") and decision to leave the diary open are closure-adjacent choices. However, most turns (understanding cipher mechanics) arise from discovery rather than decision under competing pressures.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Goggles appear on floor one, are angled to catch light coins on floor two, lifted on floor four to reveal leaping letters, angled again on floor seven for the cipher wheel, and their lens-logic enables the final tin-polish alignment. The object's crazed glass is specified early, its mechanics (scattered light decryption) recur across five distinct beats, and it directly shapes the closure moment. Removing the goggles would break the decryption method and the closure image's coherence.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The encrypted diary is unwrapped on floor three, opened on floor four, reveals Mirek's voice on floor five, shows cipher wheel on floor seven, humor column on floor eight, confession on floor nine, and final entry aligns on floor ten to deliver the thematic payload. Discovery of the diary's purpose (encrypted against despair, not thieves) reframes the narrator's task. The diary drives stakes across seven beats and provides the conceptual closure instruction, making it indispensable to the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Warmly inquisitive" is named in paragraph three and demonstrated through the narrator's handling of objects (letting voice hum reassurances, angling goggles, arranging letters "curious without trespass"). The trait enables the decryption method—Mirek's hint that "the code is read through scattered light" rewards inquisitive patience. The attribute shapes the closure stance (arranging rather than clutching) but the cost tied to this specific trait is not made visible; the narrator's warmth succeeds without visible friction or tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Unfold" recurs as both literal action (unfold parcel on floor three, pages unfold across the sequence) and metaphor for revelation ("the past begins to unfold"). Each unfolding beat advances decryption: parcel unwrapped, diary opened, cipher revealed, final entry coaxed. The closure instruction ("Keep what breaks you…") unfolds from the tin alignment. The action is mechanically and thematically load-bearing; replacing it would require rewriting the discovery structure and the central metaphor of opening/revealing.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Scattered light is introduced on floor one (cage lights shatter into coins), its mechanic hinted on floor two (Mirek's margins: "code is read through scattered light"), actively used on floors four and five (markings leap through goggles), deployed again on floor seven (reveals cipher wheel), and enables the final alignment (light fans across tin to reveal last entry). The method is signaled early, recurs across six beats, constrains decryption tactics throughout, and delivers the closure moment. Removing this exact mechanic would collapse both the puzzle and the thematic interplay of light/revelation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The spire houses the elevator and shelves, provides the ice substrate for airship scars, and supplies the frost/cold that charge the atmosphere. The vertical structure enables the ten-floor frame. However, "above the clouds" and specific ice properties do not constrain narrator choices—decryption would function identically in a different vertical setting. The setting is vividly described and thematically consonant but not mechanically indispensable; the goggles and light do the tactical work.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The ten-floor ascent is explicitly tracked ("Floor numbers blink amber, one through ten") and each rise corresponds to one decryption beat, creating a clear escalation structure and time pressure. The elevator's progress shapes pacing and provides natural scene breaks. The final floor delivers the chamber and closure alignment. The frame is signaled early, governs narrative rhythm across all beats, and the tenth-floor arrival is the spatial precondition for closure. Removing the climb structure would collapse both escalation and the story's organizing logic.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Motivation is stated in paragraph three ("my motive is gentler: to seek out the joy beneath anguish") and rewoven through Mirek's smuggled songs, the diary's encryption purpose, and the narrator's care for absences. The desire shapes the interpretive lens (reading the diary as affection-protected) and the closure stance (arranging with love rather than locking). However, the motivation is more thematic frame than source of on-page friction—no scene forces the narrator to choose joy over efficiency or safety. The desire is coherent but not tested under conflicting pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Affectionate detachment" is named on floor three and modeled through the narrator's treatment of Mirek's myth ("I stay at a slant"), machinery (humming reassurances without clutching), and letters (arranging "curious without trespass"). The tone remains stable across emotional beats—neither cold nor over-invested—and charges the closure image (leaving the diary open, teaching the sky gently). The tone is consistent, purposeful, and integrates with character and theme, though it does not modulate under pressure as much as hold steady throughout.</comment>
