<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist displays clear interior motivation—restoring trust through linguistic artistry—and the reconciliation with Lio is earned through the "symphonies of truth" composition. However, the character's "carefully reckless" trait is stated more than dramatized in choices with visible cost. The emotional arc from isolation to collaboration reads cleanly, but interiority occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("heart fugueing," "shoulders turning toward one another") that softens embodied stakes. The final joint revision of the coda provides a credible change with relational cost on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with causal elements. Orientation anchors (arcane linguist, extinct language archive, pre-dawn arrival) land clearly in the opening. The piece accumulates pressure through the composition of the three-movement score, Lio's emergence, and the joint revision, delivering a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis evolving into Charged Poise) when both characters "set the Breviary back and let the archive breathe." Cost is visible in the shift from "terrible courtesy" to collaborative vulnerability and the explicitly rewritten coda that asks them to "confess doubts aloud." One notable gap: the stele incident is recounted but its causal link to Lio's three-year absence remains somewhat fuzzy, slightly weakening the because/therefore chain at the story's emotional hinge.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The archive functions as more than backdrop: shelves "sigh," the room "has a throat," and spatial details (lamp, high windows, shadow behind stairs) are woven into the action. The glass ink well and Breviary pages become tactile instruments that the protagonist handles across beats. However, the "salt ravine" excavation site remains abstract, and occupational verisimilitude (what makes a linguist "arcane," how one "pitches the room as an instrument") is gestured at rather than grounded in specific method. The final threshold image—"dawn uncoupled from the night"—charges the closure moment effectively.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring collegial trust after Lio's three-year silence—is signaled early and tightens through the composition, test-reading, and joint revision. The protagonist's agency is clear: composing promises, placing pages strategically, inviting Lio to "play what I wrote." One meaningful reversal occurs when Lio steps out and the dynamic shifts from monologue (apology) to dialogue (collaborative rewrite). Visible cost: "we revised the coda together, bending the promises to fit," explicitly adding "clauses to confess doubts aloud"—a tangible concession that forecloses the old silence. The piece avoids multiple forced reversals and lets accumulative pressure do the work.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—truth requires accompaniment, trust as choreography rather than monument—emerges organically from the Breviary composition, the stele memory, and the final joint revision without overt moralizing. The recurring motif of "symphonies of truth" and "interconnected promises" gains weight through use: first as method, then as tested structure, finally as revised collaborative score. The ending image ("carefully reckless and leaning into our symphonies of truth") reprises the opening's "cautious exuberance" and "carefully reckless" without stating a thesis, letting the shift from solo to duet embody the thematic answer. One small slip: "Trust…is not a monument but a choreography of shoulders turning toward one another" edges toward on-page articulation of theme, though it's nested in reflection rather than climax.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable; psychic distance modulates appropriately (tight interiority during composition, wider framing for the joint revision). The prose carries a distinct lyric register ("dust motes hung like annotations," "heart fugueing") that fits the linguist's sensibility. However, register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction under pressure ("terrible courtesy old collaborators recruit," "the cruelest dialect of people once fluent in vows") that, while voice-consistent, can obscure immediacy. Dialogue is minimal but functional: Lio's lines ("he feared another awakening we could not guide") advance plot and carry subtext. The perceptual signature—seeing structure, hearing phonemes—is consistent but could be more sensorily grounded in peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative density ("dust motes…footnote to vanished grammars," "lamplight seemed a promise kept") generally supports the linguist's lens. However, several beats show paraphrase loops and synonym churn: "I composed an answer to his absence. Not a letter, not a demand, but a suite of promises inviting reply" restates the same content across three clauses without added pressure. Template cadence appears mid-story: "The first movement promised…The second promised…The third promised" uses identical stems without pattern-teaching payoff. Stock metaphors recur: "opened doors," "unblurring," "leaning into." These artifacts do not obscure causality but dull momentum in non-closure beats. Information density is high in the composition sequence but sags during the salt-ravine flashback, which summarizes rather than dramatizes the inciting rift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of musicology, extinct-language scholarship, and reconciliation through composed promises offers a fresh angle on trust-restoration narratives. The "Breviary of Maz" as a score of oaths and the archive-as-instrument conceit feel specific and non-obvious. The piece commits fully to its premise—linguist as composer, promises as musical movements—and follows implications (the room answers in overtones, the joint revision as coda). However, the salt-ravine stele incident, while intriguing, remains under-exploited: it functions more as backdrop justification than as a transformed trope with lived consequence. The ending avoids easy redemption and earns its collaborative poise through on-page revision work.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setup: signaled in opening line ("arcane linguist"). Development: composes the three-movement score, places pages strategically, invites Lio to test the promises—all choices that narrow options and raise relational cost. Payoff: jointly revises the coda, adding "clauses to confess doubts aloud," which forecloses the old silence. The character's decisions create the central turn (solo composition → collaborative revision). Strong causal pressure across all three beats and closure linkage. Minor deduction: some actions (walking aisles, singing headings) are described rather than shown altering immediate tactics.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Setup: described early ("glass ink well, clear as a held breath"). Development: protagonist fills it and dips the quill to compose the score—one functional beat. Payoff: absent from the ending; the ink well does not return or reweight meaning at closure. Two touches (description, use) meet the threshold for mid-band, and the filling/dipping enables the composition. However, it could be swapped for any writing instrument without structural loss, and its "clear as a held breath" image is not reprised or transformed. Scores in functional-but-replaceable range.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Setup: introduced early via the protagonist's intent ("restore trust…I needed every instrument") and named explicitly ("symphonies of truth require themes, variations…vulnerability"). Development: shapes the composition method (three movements as musical structure) and the test-reading with Lio. Payoff: reprised in the final line ("leaning into our symphonies of truth") and embodied in the joint revision where truth travels "with rhythm, offering hands to those it startles." The concept constrains tactics (must compose, not declare) and charges the closure image. Strong thematic and structural integration across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setup: stated in opening paragraph ("carefully reckless, a maker of risks with railings"). Development: recalled during the salt-ravine memory ("I insisted we continue, carefully reckless") to justify the inciting rift. Payoff: reprised in the final line ("carefully reckless and leaning into"). The trait is named three times but never dramatized through a present-tense choice with visible cost; the stele decision is recounted, not enacted. The label returns at closure, but its mechanics—what specific risk with what specific railing—remain abstract. Lyric-resonance path (early seed → final reprise) is present, but lack of embodied cost in on-page action caps the score.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Setup: protagonist's goal is to "unsnarl that knot" of broken trust, mentioned early. Development: the composition and placement of pages are preparatory; the actual unsnarling occurs when Lio reads the movements and they jointly revise the coda, adding escape clauses. Payoff: "we revised the coda together, bending the promises to fit" explicitly executes the unsnarling. The action is present in the ending and drives the reconciliation turn. However, "unsnarl" as a verb is used only once on the page; the work could be described as "revise," "repair," or "reweave" with minor edits. Strong closure participation but moderate replaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setup: signaled early ("I wrote them via interconnected promises, linking clauses so each would harmonize"). Development: the method is enacted during composition ("Interlock makes integrity audible") and tested when Lio reads the movements and "the room answered in overtones." Payoff: the joint revision continues the method, adding new clauses that "fit" the existing structure. The means shapes attempts (protagonist must link, not list) and matters mechanically (harmonization produces the room's response). Strong causal presence across all three gates; the interlocking structure is both method and dramatized effect.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setup: anchored early (extinct language archive, shelves, lamp, desk). Development: protagonist uses the archive's acoustics ("every shelf has a throat; you learn to pitch the room as an instrument") to place pages strategically and sing headings. The archive responds: "Wind pressed the high windows, and something answered by loosening the shadow behind the stairs," revealing Lio. Payoff: "we set the Breviary back and let the archive breathe" before exiting. The setting supplies both resource (acoustic properties) and pressure (Lio's hiding place), directly affecting the reconciliation outcome. Strong causal work and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Setup: title phrase appears in opening ("before paths diverge") and is restated late ("Before paths diverge at winter's end, I would unsnarl that knot" and "Before paths diverge, we set the Breviary back"). Development: the timeframe is mentioned but does not visibly tighten tactics; no live clock tracks elapsed minutes or a looming deadline within the scene. Payoff: reprised at closure but functions more as thematic bracket than causal pressure. The phrase appears three times as lyric refrain without altering the protagonist's moves or creating urgency. Scores as present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setup: stated early ("restore trust after silence"). Development: desire drives the composition of the three-movement score and the invitation to Lio. Friction is visible: protagonist's fear of re-opening the rift ("I faltered, thinking of our last excavation") versus the need to reach out. Payoff: motivation is tested and fulfilled when Lio agrees to revise the coda jointly, and they walk toward the threshold together. The want (restore trust) conflicts with fear (another bruise without accompaniment) and the resolution carries relational cost (both must "confess doubts aloud"). Strong causal and emotional integration across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Setup: named in opening line ("trembling with cautious exuberance"). Development: tone modulates as protagonist composes (steady wrist, fugueing heart) and falters during the salt-ravine memory. When Lio appears, tone shifts to "terrible courtesy," then eases as they collaborate. Payoff: final image ("carefully reckless and leaning into our symphonies of truth") reprises the opening's balance of caution and exuberance. Tone is coherent through turns and charges the closure moment. However, "cautious exuberance" as a phrase appears only at the start and is never directly re-invoked; the ending reprises the feeling through action rather than label. Lyric-resonance path with strong closure linkage.</comment>
