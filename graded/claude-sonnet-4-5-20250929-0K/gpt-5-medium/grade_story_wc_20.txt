<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is consistently embodied through alchemical process and specific sensory detail. Internal contradiction operates effectively: refusing closure while demanding calibration, measuring grief through materials. The final choice—carrying the fused alloy rather than expecting resurrection—lands with visible cost tied to character logic. Minor penalty: some phrases ("memory that has learned to redeem itself") edge toward label-speak at the final beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the narrator tempers grief into balanced remembrance with concrete cost ("heavier without gaining mass"). The accumulative/textural lens holds: each alchemical step deepens the dominant stake (redemption through measurement). Orientation anchors cleanly by line 2. One meaningful tightening occurs when the cup test reveals names have mass, narrowing options toward the fusion act. Cost is legible in "I am not healed, but I am held together."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The foundry environment constrains every choice: scales, furnace, assay cup, rainwater supply the tactile toolkit. The zodiac coin functions as recurring anchor and counterweight across four distinct beats, reweighted at closure when it's pressed into the melt. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (rain hiss, golden seam brightening, frogs' grammar). The micro-setting of bench, furnace door, and cup charges the final image with concrete spatial logic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—redeem Mara's loss through measured proof—is signaled by paragraph 3 and tightens across six escalating steps: repair cup, test names, feed name to furnace, add jacket button/hair, fuse coin. Agency is renunciation with visible cost: the narrator tempers grief into an alloy rather than demanding resurrection. The accumulative lens governs: each step narrows options until only fusion remains. The final carrying of the heavier coin forecloses bargaining, establishing Earned Stasis.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—limits as the line where consequence meets utterance—emerges organically from kintsugi repair, alchemical testing, and the fused-name closure. Subtext operates in "I had always measured the wrong limit," which reweights stubbornness without moralizing. The final image (coin heavier without mass gain, foundry glowing like a redeemed memory) offers resonant CR: names' arithmetic is proven through the bright scar. No thematic echo in final paragraph; prompt language ("factually mystical") is dramatized across multiple beats rather than declared.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct and consistent: alchemist idiom governs metaphor (slag, crucible, seam, alloy) and diction choices throughout. Distance remains stable; reflection is anchored to present stimuli (cup, coin, furnace) and advances choice. Purposeful compression ("Names attract their histories") reads as voice-motivated synthesis rather than opacity. Minor deduction: a few filter verbs cluster in mid-story beats ("I realized," "I do not believe") where immediacy would sharpen pressure, and one phrase ("longer than books") drifts slightly from established technical register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (establish world rules, advance grief calculus, charge motifs). Rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating through the testing sequence and breathing at the furnace door. Minor template cadence appears in paragraphs 21–23: three consecutive "I [verb]" openers without taught pattern. One paraphrase loop: paragraphs 12–13 restate the name-weight discovery. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "memory that has learned to redeem itself" in the final line edges toward abstraction. Apply −0.6 for template run and loop, but closure image remains clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—kintsugi grief measured through alchemical testing—is specific and non-obvious. The story transforms familiar guilt-and-redemption material through the factually mystical world rule and the concrete tactics of scales, lacquer, and fusion. The ending feels inevitable: measuring limits required weighing the measurer's own name. Risk-taking in voice (alchemist idiom sustained across high-emotion beats) and structure (accumulative tightening without dialogue or secondary character) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Minor swappability: the zodiac coin's Libra detail could be another symbol with minor edits, but the coin's physical properties (mass, heat capacity) are irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The balanced alchemist is signaled in paragraph 3, drives five key beats (repair, test, feed names to furnace, temper alloy, fuse coin), and the final choice—carrying the fused alloy—embodies balance earned through measured work. Removing this character trait would break the story's closure logic. Visible cost: accepting held-together rather than healed.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The zodiac coin appears in four distinct beats: received (para 8), set as counterweight (para 10), used in balance tests (paras 19–20), and fused into alloy (para 29). Its specificity (Libra scales, nicked rim, mass) matters causally: the coin's weight anchors the name tests and its fusion charges the closure. Removal would collapse the testing mechanism and the final tether image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Kintsugi intentions appear in paragraph 15 as method (repair cup with gold lacquer) and recur thematically in "bright scar" at closure. The concept shapes one key choice (repair rather than replace the cup) and the final image reweights it (seam as tether). Present across setup, middle repair, and closure reprise, but the concept does not constrain multiple beats or narrow options with visible cost beyond the initial cup choice.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Factually mystical" is established in paragraph 4, tested across six beats (name-weight experiments), and governs the closure logic (names have measurable mass). The attribute enables all alchemical proof tactics and constrains the narrator's path: grief must be calibrated, not merely felt. Removal would void the testing sequence and the fusion's necessity. Visible cost: the narrator cannot shortcut to comfort.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Redeem" is signaled in paragraph 12, drives seven beats (repair, name-etching, testing, furnace feed, alloy temper, coin fusion, return promise), and reappears in the penultimate and final paragraphs with reweighted meaning. Major turns trace to this action: the shift from measuring stone to measuring limits, the fusion choice, and the decision to return the coin heavier. Swapping for "atone" or "honor" would require structural rewrites.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Exploring limits" is signaled in paragraph 12, mechanics are shown across nine testing beats (cup balance, name variables, furnace heat, alloy composition), and the realization in paragraph 26 ("I had always measured the wrong limit") redefines the method's target. The method shapes every attempt and narrows options: only fusion satisfies both proof and wonder. Removing it would collapse the escalation sequence.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The rain-washed foundry supplies essential resources (rainwater for tests, furnace for tempering, bench for balancing) and constraints (steam, heat limits, available tools) across ten beats. Spatial choreography is precise: shelf to bench to furnace door. The setting's micro-elements (cracked cup, gutters, roof) alter tactics and charge the final glow image. Removal would void the alchemical toolkit and closure logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"After the search party disbands" anchors the opening and frames the dominant stake (closure denied, demanding calibration). The timeframe tightens decisions: the narrator works through one night (signaled by "midnight" in para 23, "Tomorrow" in para 32) with escalating urgency. The compressed window shapes the testing sequence's intensity. Could function with a vaguer frame, but the specific post-search timing adds pressure to the refusal of official closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"To understand the weight of names" is dramatized across eight beats (name-etching, balance tests, furnace feed, alloy fusion) with visible friction: the narrator's name steadies the scale, Mara's dips it, creating asymmetry the narrator must resolve through fusion. The motivation drives all testing choices and is reweighted at closure ("names have taught me their secret arithmetic"). Cost is legible: the narrator carries the fused weight rather than letting go.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>"Luminous regret" is established in the opening phrase, modulates through the testing sequence (patient scales, careful mapmaker, stubborn ghost) without flattening, and charges the final image: "foundry glows like a memory that has learned to redeem itself by being precisely remembered." The tone coheres through reversals (grief measured, not merely felt) and tightens at closure when regret becomes a held alloy. Removal would drain the emotional color from the accumulative design.</comment>
