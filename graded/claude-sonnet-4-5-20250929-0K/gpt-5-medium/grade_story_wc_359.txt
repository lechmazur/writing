<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The bell ringer's synesthetic trait is label-only ("hearing blue as a hush, tasting violet as iron") without constraining a single choice under pressure. Interior states remain abstract ("doubt rose," "trust of trapped sunlight") rather than embodied contradictions acting in scene. The motive "to certify wonder as essential" is declared but never tested by competing impulses or visible cost that forecloses a path. The sculptor is present but functionally ornamental, exerting no pressure on the bell ringer's decisions.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who and where by the opening but delays concrete stakes past the first third; the reader learns setup (bell, sheet, sculptor) without a live tightening until the synchronized strike. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the hush "unfettered" and living as "common air"), but cost is asserted ("hearts far away slowed") rather than demonstrated on the page for the protagonist. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density and aurora-color layering build toward the final release, yet the final image lacks a visible price paid by the bell ringer that forecloses an option. Cost proof test fails: no exact sentence shows the protagonist's forfeiture or reweighted choice at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The ice cavern supplies vivid sensory anchors (frost-flowers, stalactites singing harmonic glass, aurora as metronome) and the column of blue ice directly enables the bell placement. Spatial choreography is clean and the aurora's changing colors pace the ritual. The setting participates in the ending ("the hush remained unfettered") but does not constrain a final choice or charge the closure image with immediate consequence, capping the score below 7.5.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—to "unfetter a sound" and "certify wonder as essential"—is signaled early but remains abstract until the synchronized strike. The tightening (sculptor's chisel fall coordinated with bell tone) is a single beat that narrows method but not options for the protagonist. Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, escalation should show density increase or cadence shift that reweights the stake with cost; here the ritual proceeds in parallel increments without a visible trade-off or complication that forces a harder choice. The ending asserts global effect ("streets learned a softer geometry") but the protagonist's agency at closure is execution, not decision under competing pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme (wonder as essential, hush as active presence vs. noise-as-currency) emerges from ritual particulars and the amber sheet's "trapped sunlight." The final image ("the hush remained unfettered…a standard by which noise could be measured") offers a resonant answer without moralizing. The sculptor's contour-of-space figure and the bell ringer's synesthetic palette provide non-literal thematic texture. Weakness: the city/contracts backstory is told in one line without friction on the page, and the ending's conceptual repricing lacks an on-page cost that makes the protagonist's stance undeniable—lowering impact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "hearing blue as a hush," "tasted cedar, salt, mint, and bruised peach," "read the amber music sheet as if reading a weathered face." POV remains stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance. Diction is elevated and voice-motivated ("whale-road tremor," "oscillating repose") but some phrases ("certified wonder," "to stamp a seal of necessity on awe") drift toward abstraction that clashes slightly with the concrete ritual. Register holds; no head-hopping. Elision of the sculptor's interiority is clean and purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>High information density and vivid figurative language ("the sky poured a slow river of green and rose," "stone remembered snow") but density approaches overwriting in peak beats: nearly every sentence in the middle third carries metaphor without pattern-teaching or payoff (−0.4). Template cadence appears in five adjacent lines: "They [verb]…They [verb]…They [verb]" (−0.5). Some paraphrase loops: "the hush was not silence; it was a shape waiting for breath, the negative of a statue" restates the same idea across two clauses without added pressure (−0.2). Clarity remains high; no causality obscured. Combined artifact deductions total −1.1 in Q7 only.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The synesthetic bell-ringer and collaborative ritual frame offer a specific angle on sound-as-presence. "Sculpted hush" as negative space and the aurora-as-metronome method are non-obvious. Weakness: the opposition (city where "noise was currency") is summarized in one line rather than dramatized, and the ritual proceeds without complication or risk that tests the premise's limits. Transformation test: the emotional arc (proving wonder essential) could port to many settings without the ice cavern or synesthesia altering the outcome. Risk-taking in voice and image is bold but the plot's safety—no reversal, no visible protagonist cost—keeps originality in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Present in setup (paragraph 2), drives the middle beats (unpacking, striking sequences, signing to sculptor), and appears in closure ("closed the bell and folded the sheet"). The bell ringer reads the aurora and amber sheet to time actions but does not face a decision that narrows options or imposes visible cost—execution role, not choice-maker. Two gates (setup, payoff) met; middle development is method execution. Band 5.0–6.9: shapes the ritual arc but choices are pre-scripted by the amber sheet, not pressure-driven.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Amber music sheet appears in setup (paragraph 4), middle (unfolded, "the cavern brightened," read "as if reading a weathered face"), and closure (folded away). It guides the ritual and its "trapped sunlight" charges trust when doubt rises. Three gates met. Causal pressure: the sheet dictates timing and sequences but does not constrain a choice that forecloses an option. Closure linkage is gestural (folding) rather than reweighted meaning. Band 5.0–6.9: essential to method but not irreplaceable in structure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sculpted hush is the ritual's goal (paragraph 5: "unfetter a sound…a covenant of quiet"), drives the sculptor's action (paragraph 21: "It was the sculpted hush itself, an architecture of interval"), and is unfettered at closure (final paragraph: "the hush remained unfettered…a standard by which noise could be measured"). Three gates met. The concept shapes stakes (wonder vs. noise), the sculptor's contour-of-space figure, and the ending's conceptual repricing. Cost connection: the hush is released but the protagonist's personal price is not legible. Band 7.0–8.4: essential across beats and ending; irreplaceability high but cost linkage indirect.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Synesthesia is labeled in paragraph 3 ("hearing blue as a hush, tasting violet as iron") and paragraph 20 ("tasted cedar, salt, mint, and bruised peach…told them when to pause"). Setup and middle gates met; closure absent. The trait informs perception and pause-timing but does not constrain an action with visible cost or force a trade-off. Band 3.0–4.9: functional flavor but replaceable with generic "intuition" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Unfetter" is the stated goal (paragraph 5), enacted at the synchronized strike (paragraphs 15–17), and confirmed at closure (paragraph 29: "the hush remained unfettered"). Three gates met. The action is the ritual's climax but its method (bell + chisel coordination) could be swapped for other ceremonial acts without altering the emotional arc. Causal pressure: the unfettering resolves the premise but does not narrow prior options or impose a dramatized cost. Band 5.0–6.9: shapes the key turn but replaceable in mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Aurora colors appear in setup (paragraph 8), guide timing in middle beats (paragraph 14: "read the hour for beginning, because light was a metronome"), and respond at closure (paragraph 22: "the aurora lowered a curtain of pale gold"). Three gates met. The method matters: color shifts signal when to strike and pause. Weakness: the mechanics are asserted ("light was a metronome") rather than tested by a failed read or complication. Band 5.0–6.9: essential to method but its use is consistent execution, not constraint under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Ice cavern is present throughout: frost, stalactites singing, the column of blue ice that holds the bell (paragraph 10), frost-flowers blooming (paragraph 23), and the cavern "breathed in balanced measure." The column enables the bell placement (setup + middle) and the cavern's architecture rearranges at the strike (paragraph 17). Closure: implicit (the hush remains within the cavern). Three gates met. Causal pressure: the ice provides a resonant chamber and the column is a functional necessity. Cost: not directly tied to setting. Band 7.0–8.4: essential across beats and materially shapes the ritual.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The timeframe—"at the moment a sculptor's chisel first strikes marble"—is setup in paragraph 12 and enacted in paragraph 16 ("The sculptor lifted the chisel…The bell ringer raised the mallet…They sounded the bell…and the sculptor's chisel fell"). This synchronization is the ritual's hinge. Closure participation: the moment has passed; the ending describes aftermath. Two gates (setup, middle). The timeframe tightens the collaboration but does not impose a ticking clock that alters tactics if missed. Band 5.0–6.9: shapes one key turn with purposeful reprise in method but not closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Motivation stated in paragraph 6 ("to certify wonder as essential, to stamp a seal of necessity on awe") and recalled in paragraph 25 (left the city "to prove a different truth"). Setup and middle gates met; closure: implicit satisfaction, no friction. The desire drives the journey and ritual but is never tested by a competing want or cost. No on-page moment where the bell ringer weighs wonder against loss. Band 5.0–6.9: functional driver but told rather than dramatized through conflicted choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Oscillating repose" is named in paragraph 7, enacted in the ritual's pacing (paragraph 19: "sequences spaced like heartbeats"), and carried in the ending (paragraph 28: "movements like tide, slow, sure, oscillating repose carried in their spines like a tuning fork"). Three gates met. The tone is coherent and modulates gently with the aurora's rhythm. Weakness: the tone is sustained rather than tested by urgency or rupture; no moment where repose is threatened and defended. Band 5.0–6.9: charges the final image via lyric reprise but does not constrain a choice or shift under pressure.</comment>
