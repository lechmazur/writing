<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is richly embodied through gardening metaphors and the father's lockpicking inheritance, creating a distinct perceptual lens. Internal contradictions appear in the tension between pragmatic caution and the risky climb, and micro-choices (kneeling at the lock, sheltering the flame) reveal values under pressure. The final stance—instilling light in corners and alleys—feels earned by the accumulation of care and loss, though the mother's condition and the protagonist's delay remain slightly abstract. No label-speak mars the peak beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through layered images (petals, harbor, flame) and a cadence shift at the lighthouse that reweights the protagonist's grief into active care. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the beam sweeping the harbor and the child's pointing prayer crystallize the protagonist's commitment to "instill in the bricks a habit of kindness." Orientation anchors (fire escape, harbor, lighthouse) appear early and remain stable. The cost—accepting the mother's decline and choosing to act despite delay—is legible in the match-strike and beam-sweep, though it could be sharpened with a more explicit forfeiture.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective: the fire escape pots, the skiff's mended seams, the salt-bitten padlock, and the brittle wick all constrain choices and charge the final image. Micro-setting (the brass tooth, the lantern glass) functions as setting by pressuring the unlock and the rekindling. Spatial choreography is clean across three locations (escape, skiff, lighthouse). The moonlit harbor modulates from "sleeping lung" to "frank relief," supporting the tonal arc without postcard drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—responding to loss by lighting the harbor—is signaled early and tightens when the protagonist rows out and kneels at the locked gate. The unlock and flame-lighting are agency moments that foreclose inaction, and the beam's sweep delivers visible cost (accepting the mother's decline, committing to persistent care). One meaningful deepening occurs when the light shifts from private grief to shared relief. The piece does not require multiple reversals under its accumulative lens, and the protagonist's prior delay adds moral friction without melodrama.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—light as inherited care, mending as belief, protected vulnerability as architecture—emerges from concrete actions (patching the skiff, cleaning the lantern, sheltering the flame) without thesis statements. The final image of cutting light into slips and rooting it at home offers a resonant, non-literal answer to how grief and care coexist. Motifs (petals, lock teeth, fire escape pots, moon-rowing) recur with reweighted meaning at closure. No moralizing or prompt-echo language dilutes the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and lyric: "the dead are patient with our delays but the living crash on unseen jetties," "a congregation of eyes learning to forgive." POV remains stable first-person singular with no head-hopping. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (zooming from harbor-wide to match-flame intimacy). Some figurative density in the opening third ("quivering hush," "neon sighs") risks ornament, but the language tightens at the lighthouse and supports rather than obscures the closure beats. No dialogue appears; interior texture is consistent and embodied.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high ("I row toward the point with the rhythm of oars in water, steady, counting breaths, matching my pulse to the quiet thunder in the pilings"). A few early constructions lean decorative ("the harbor waits like a sleeping lung," "quivering hush") without immediate pressure payoff, and minor paraphrase appears ("the lantern breathes" / "the beam revolve through me"). The lock-pick sequence is concrete and propulsive, and the final paragraph lands with no scaffold. Overall clarity and momentum are strong, with small figurative density in non-peak beats preventing entry to the 8.5+ band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—fire escape gardener as lighthouse keeper, lockpicking as inherited care, light-instilling as literal and metaphorical act—feels specific and earned. The piece transforms the "tending/loss" template through tactile detail (bitting gauge tooth, wick "brittle as a grass blade in January") and a non-obvious moral calculus (delay as part of care rather than failure). The lyric mode and accretive structure take modest risk, though the premise remains within literary-fiction conventions. Proximity check passes; no close echoes of famous lines.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The fire escape gardener identity appears in the opening paragraph, shapes the protagonist's perceptual lens (reading soil, saving cuttings), drives the decision to row out and light the beacon, and charges the final image of cutting light into slips and rooting it at home. The trait constrains and enables across setup, middle (rowing, unlocking), and closure. The protagonist's choices—kneeling at the lock, sheltering the flame, committing to instill light—are causally central.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The lockmaster's bitting gauge tooth is introduced early as inheritance, used tactilely at the padlock ("rides the tiny notches, measuring absence"), and metaphorically reweighted in the closing image of instilling light. It appears in three beats: lap-holding, lock-picking, and thematic closure. The specificity (lock-reading as soil-reading) makes it irreplaceable, and the cost—accepting the father's legacy while the mother fades—is legible. Strong integration, just shy of indispensable because the lighthouse could theoretically be unlocked by other means.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The "quivering hush" appears early, recurs at the match-strike ("thickens as if the moon has paused"), and charges the moment of lighting. It does not constrain choices directly but reweights the stakes by embodying the protagonist's held breath and the harbor's suspense. Lyric reprise is purposeful and ties to closure cost, though its abstract nature limits causal pressure. Solid integration via early setup and ending participation, but not indispensable to plot mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Wistfully pragmatic" is demonstrated on the page: the protagonist saves cracked pots and cuttings, patches the skiff repeatedly, and delays the lighthouse trip until the final petal falls. The trait enables the unlock (patience) and constrains the timeline (waiting for a signal). It shapes the middle choice to row out and the final image of instilling light as a habit. Present across all three gates with visible trade-offs, though the label itself is understated rather than foregrounded.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Instill" is the verb tying the entire arc: the protagonist instills patience into shaking wrists at the lock, instills fire into the wick, and commits in the final lines to instill light and kindness into corners and alleys. It appears in setup (father's teaching), middle (lock and flame), and closure (rooting light at home). The action is irreplaceable; swapping it would break the thematic and causal spine. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage earn high integration.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"With the rhythm of oars in water" is signaled early, dramatized in the rowing sequence ("counting breaths, matching my pulse to the quiet thunder in the pilings"), and echoed in the final image of the moon pausing "her own rowing." The method shapes the middle transit and charges the ending's metaphor of sustained care. It does not constrain the unlock or flame-lighting directly, keeping it from indispensable status, but it is purposeful and specific across two beats.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The luminous harbor by moonlight anchors all three acts: fire escape overlook, skiff crossing, and lighthouse beam sweep. The moonlight makes "edges patient and mistakes less loud," enabling the protagonist's night journey, and the harbor's transformation from "sleeping lung" to "frank relief" under the beam delivers the closure effect. Setting pressures the rowing and charges the final image of shared light. Essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the final petal drops" is signaled in the opening line, motivates the protagonist's decision to act, and anchors the closure commitment. The petal-drop functions as a clock that has already run out, adding urgency and moral weight (delay as part of grief). It appears in setup and shapes the ending's acceptance of the mother's decline. Strong integration via early signal and closure participation, though the urgency is retrospective rather than live-ticking.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The motivation "to reflect light into dark corners" is dramatized throughout: the protagonist reads locks and soil to coax relief, cleans and lights the lantern, and commits in the final lines to water corners and alleys with light. It is present in setup (father's teaching), middle (unlock and flame), and closure (instilling kindness). The friction between this desire and the delay (grief, pragmatism) creates visible cost. Irreplaceable to the arc.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Protected vulnerability" is coherent and purposeful: the lantern houses flame with breakable glass, the protagonist shelters the match like a fledgling, and the final line names it as "architecture" rather than posture. Tone modulates from wistful opening to tense unlock to quiet resolve, always balancing fragility and care. It charges the final image of glass that can break and still be the only way light shines. Strong thematic and tonal integration across all beats and ending.</comment>
