<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is concrete and purpose-driven—"I am a charcoal portrait ash scatterer" establishes both occupation and symbolic stance. Mother's gesture ("nods toward the chest") and wrist-squeeze at the end embody contradiction and cost without therapy-speak. The final exchange—"I understand the cost of surviving without a witness"—lands as earned insight rooted in prior silence and the chair's rhythm. Minor slip: the narrator's micro-choices feel more curatorial than internally conflicted until the gallery scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of ash-scattering and object recursion by the first third; closure arrives on-page when the chair slows under the skylight and Mother acknowledges "we have said enough," a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) that makes the cost of disclosure legible. Orientation anchors (narrator, mother, house room, gallery) arrive cleanly within the opening lines. One meaningful deepening occurs when visitors "fill the gaps with their own ghosts," reweighting the mirage premise. Cost is visible in Mother's squeeze and the somber exhale.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The rocking chair constrains the final choice—Mother's decision to send it charges the gallery ending—and the skylight positions it for the climactic slowing. Ash-mixing mechanics (envelopes ground to pigment, scattered by breath/finger/brush) supply tactile process that defines the narrator's method. The gallery's "cathedral of lines" and the mask's fault-lines integrate spatial detail with theme. All key objects return with reweighted function at closure, and the somber exhale feels environmental rather than decorative.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—crystallizing love-versus-fear without pointing to the bruise—is signaled early and tightens when Mother grants permission ("take what you need") and again when she offers the chair. The gallery sequence escalates by showing visitors trembling and a boy forgetting to breathe, proving the piece's emotional accuracy. The chair's final rock under the skylight forecloses safer silence; Mother's wrist-squeeze and the acknowledgment of "surviving without a witness" make the cost undeniable. One on-page deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—danger that cannot bear to be named outright—emerges from the kintsugi mask, powdered letters, incomplete information, and the visitors' varied trembling. The ending line, "we have said enough… and left enough unsaid to let people survive the hearing," reweights all prior acts without moralizing. The second when love and fear cannot be told apart is crystallized in embodied visitor reactions rather than abstract claim. No thematic echo; the cost of surviving without a witness is dramatized in Mother's silence and final gesture.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is consistent: the narrator notices "porcelain cracks" in eyes, measures memory as "singed sugar," and filters the gallery through curatorial attention. Diction remains controlled—"weaves truth carefully without pointing to any single bruise"—and lyric compression is taught early ("night opens like a sketchbook"). Mother's single line of dialogue, "take what you need," carries subtext and advances plot. Minor slip: "I realize that I did it to crystallize a fleeting emotion" feels slightly over-articulated for the narrator's otherwise oblique voice, though it recovers quickly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift between short declarations and longer subordinate structures. Information density is high—most lines advance character, image, or stakes. Figurative language ("moon cannot find her," "dust sighs up as paper dust") is coherent and voice-motivated. Two frictions: the phrase "the mirage of safety, which is the only honest thing I have ever named" edges toward thematic statement rather than image, and "as the old rocking chair finally slows to a stop" appears identically in the opening and closing, creating a frame that some may read as lyric payoff but risks minor template cadence. No loops or scaffold; clarity holds.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The charcoal-portrait-ash-scatterer premise is fresh and fully committed; grinding unmailed letters into pigment and using incomplete information as curatorial method transforms the abuse-legacy template into something specific. The kintsugi mask with fault-lines that "gleam like tiny warnings" offers non-obvious symbolic synthesis. The gallery visitors' varied embodied reactions—trembling woman, breathless boy—avoid generic catharsis. Risk: the piece refuses exposition and trusts the reader to infer the family danger. One soft edge: the "mirage of safety" title risks over-naming the theme, though the text earns it through dramatized particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The charcoal portrait ash scatterer is the narrator; the role shapes every choice: grinding envelopes, scattering ash, curating incomplete information, and placing the chair under the skylight. Present from the opening, drives three beats (taking envelopes, mixing ash, staging the gallery), and the occupation's ethos—refusing to hide brokenness—defines the ending stance.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The mask appears on the bed (early setup), is described with kintsugi resin that "refuses to hide brokenness," and returns at the gallery's end where "one woman trembles… because the seams have found her secret map." Its fault-lines charge the final image. Three beats, thematic pressure, and specificity (shattered porcelain, gleaming seams) make it indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"The mirage of safety" is named as the exhibition title, frames the childhood premise ("we built a childhood under the mirage of safety"), and is resolved in the ending dialogue: "we have said enough… and left enough unsaid." The concept shapes every tactic—incomplete information, no placards, rooms with doors that never latch. Present in setup, middle, and closure; drives stakes throughout.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Weaves truth carefully" is dramatized in the plan—"not a confession, not exactly"—and in the method: scatter ash "in soft arcs," offer no placards, let visitors "fill the gaps with their own ghosts." The trait constrains the narrator's gallery design and forbids direct accusation. Two beats (planning, staging) with visible cost (Mother's acknowledgment that danger cannot be named outright). Could be slightly more specific in mid-scene choices.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Powder" the envelopes into pigment is the central transformative act. The action appears in setup ("planning to powder them"), is executed on-page ("I grind the envelopes, and memory sighs up as paper dust"), and enables the storm-of-faces canvas that drives visitor reactions. Removing this action breaks the piece's core mechanic. Three beats, causal necessity, specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Through incomplete information" is signaled early ("the plan… weaves truth carefully without pointing"), executed in the gallery (no labels, no placards, visitors "led by absence"), and validated at closure ("left enough unsaid to let people survive the hearing"). The method shapes every choice from ash-scattering to staging. Three beats, causal role, and thematic payoff.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The Vanishing Point Gallery frames the exhibition, supplies the skylight that positions the chair for its final rock, and creates the spatial pressure ("cathedral of lines drawing you inward until you nearly disappear"). Named early, returns in three beats (arrival, staging, visitors), and its architecture—skylight, final room—constrains the climactic moment. The name itself ("vanishing point") charges the mirage theme.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The timeframe bookends the story: "as the old rocking chair finally slows to a stop" opens and closes the piece. The chair's rhythm measures the gallery's final hour, and its slowing creates the climactic silence under the skylight. The phrase recurs with reweighted meaning, and the temporal frame tightens decisions (last night before opening, final hour). Indispensable structural hinge.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>"To crystallize a fleeting emotion" is dramatized on-page: "I realize that I did it to crystallize a fleeting emotion, the second when love and fear cannot be told apart." The motivation drives the ash-scattering method, the incomplete-information design, and is validated by visitor reactions (trembling woman, breathless boy). Present in setup (implicit in the exhibition concept), middle (realized), and closure (Mother's acknowledgment of the cost). Thematic engine.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Somber marvel" is sustained throughout—"porcelain cracks," "memory sighs up as paper dust," "visitors gather… breathless quiet," "the gallery exhales a somber marvel." Tone modulates appropriately: hushed in the house, reverent in the gallery, charged at the chair's final rock. The final exhale of "somber marvel" names and earns the tone without forcing it. Coherent, modulated, and integral to closure.</comment>
