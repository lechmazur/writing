<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is concrete and voice-specific throughout, with embodied emotion ("my throat tightened") and micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values (pocketing the crank, leaving the seal). Internal contradiction appears in the tension between shame and relief, and the final renunciation—choosing not to rebuild—feels earned by the confession's causal weight. Mother's deathbed instruction anchors motivation without exposition dump, and the caretaker's silent communication adds pressure without dialogue.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the protagonist ratifies the dynasty's pre-planned ending and transforms it from shame into mercy, forecloses restoration with visible cost (seal abandonment, crank as gavel). Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph ("dynasty ender," "sepia reading room," "first yawn of evening"). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—layers of ash-writing, gramophone mechanics, and sensory density build toward the final cadence shift where "dynasty ender" reprices to "finally beginning." One meaningful deepening occurs when the confession rewrites the protagonist's understanding of the fall, altering stance with conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The sepia reading room constrains choice through its ritual objects (gramophone, ash tray, ledgers) and charges the final image when the house "exhales its long-planned mercy." Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "lacquer, dust, and quiet promises," "breathing brass," "golden shadows pooled like tea." Spatial choreography remains clear across movements (console table, window, desk, hill descent). The crank handle and ash function as micro-setting elements that enable the revelation and thus constrain the protagonist's interpretive path.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncovering the hidden truth and deciding what to do with it—signals early and tightens when the ash-letters spell the confession. One meaningful reversal: the protagonist arrives believing the fall was shameful defeat, discovers it was strategic mercy, and the discovery forecloses restoration ("Do not rebuild the throne"). Agency is renunciation with visible cost: leaving the seal, pocketing the crank as gavel, walking away with "empty hands." Thegramophone mechanism and caretaker's choreography apply escalating pressure that narrows options under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—sacrifice to end cycles of destructive power—emerges through particulars: the confession written by vibration, "end the line to save the living," bread ovens replacing throne pillars. The final image offers a non-literal answer: the protagonist walks down "with listening ears and empty hands," transforming "dynasty ender" into "finally beginning" without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the caretaker's silence, the mother's whispered instruction, and the city already changing below. The ash-letters' recurring rewrites (confession → map → final injunction) deepen thematic pressure withouttoken recurrence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout: "marching ghosts," "boots of grief," "breathing brass," "golden shadows curving into lamp-lit commitments." POV remains stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance; filter verbs ("I could see," "I saw") are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. Diction stays within the protagonist's elevated but concrete register ("eloquently silent," "plank by plank," "tide, a strategy") without unmotivated academic drift. Rhythmic control modulates with pressure: longer, layered sentences during revelation, shorter declaratives at closure ("I pocketed the crank handle").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Information density is high; nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, revelation, or stance. Sentence openings vary purposefully, and figurative language ("letters drifting from open books," "standing waves") remains coherent and specific. Minor template-cadence slip in the middle third: several sentences open with participial constructions ("dimmed," "placed," "set," "closed") within a short span, creating brief rhythmic monotony. No paraphrase loops, and the strategic telling that compresses the protagonist's winter decree increases momentum. Propulsion is strong through the revelation sequence, though the density of metaphor in consecutive lines ("bridge of intuition," "questions wearing boots of grief") approaches overwriting without quite crossing the line.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—acoustic archaeology via gramophone, ash, and standing waves to convey a confession designed to evade tongues—feels specific and non-obvious. The transformation of "dynasty ender" from shame to mercy through the protagonists's discovery is earned in hindsight. Risk-taking in the extended metaphor of sound shaping ash into letters heightens stakes without obscuring causality. The premise (noble house deliberately ends itself to prevent power-famine) avoids template plots, though the "inherited truth via artifact" frame is familiar; here it's elevated by the acoustic-physical mechanics and the thematic commitment to silence as strategy.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Present in opening ("They call me the dynasty ender"), drives the middle turn (realizing the fall was strategic, not shameful), and shapes closure (ratifying the end, choosing bread ovens over thrones, walking away with empty hands). The protagonist's choices—setting the crank, interpreting the ash-letters, leaving the seal—create all key reversals. Cost is visible: forecloses restoration, accepts the burden alone.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Signaled early (mother presses it into protagonist's hand), used in two distinct beats (inserting it to start the gramophone, weighing it as gavel at closure), returns with reweighted meaning (key to confession → symbol of cadence/judgment). The crank's "nicked teeth" and warmth anchor physicality, and its absence would break the revelation mechanism and the closure image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Present early ("A bridge of intuition began to form") and thematically coherent (ledger arithmetic → ash-letters → final vision of workshops and councils). It shapes the protagonist's interpretive process in the middle beat and reappears in closure ("my mind crossed the bridge of intuition to its living shore"). However, the bridge functions more as metaphor than actionable stake; the protagonist could reach the same conclusion without the explicit bridge image, making it somewhat replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Seeded in opening ("eloquently silent, among ledgers"), embodied by the caretaker (hands speaking, tongue spared), and drives the revelation method (confession written by vibration, "what could never bear breath"). Constrains the forebears' communication choice with cost (they feared their own tongues), and the protagonist's final agreement with the caretaker passes "through standing waves neither throat could bear." Closure participation is strong: the reading room settles into "eloquent quiet."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Central to the revelation beat ("I began to muse on the ledger columns, their arithmetic like marching ghosts") and seeds the intuition-bridge. However, "muse" is somewhat passive observation; the gramophone and caretaker's actions drive the ash-writing, not the protagonist's musing per se. The action enables interpretation but could be replaced with "examine" or "study" without major structural loss, placing it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mechanics signaled early (gramophone hum, "tone in the horn throbbed"), demonstrated mid-scene (caretaker taps horn, hum arranges ash into rings/lattices/letters), and essential to closure (ash-letters spell confession, final directive). The method is irreplaceable: without standing-wave mechanics, the forebears' silent confession cannot materialize. Drives two distinct beats (initial revelation, final directive on vellum) with cost (only the crank-holder can unlock it).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Anchored in opening ("sepia reading room"), supplies essential resources (gramophone, ash tray, ledgers, vellum), and charges the final image ("the reading room settled into eloquent quiet, its sepia walls breathing"). The room's ritual choreography (dimming lamps, placing ash) constrains the revelation process. Removing the specific room would require redesigning the entire acoustic-archaeology mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Signals opening and closing bracket ("In the first yawn of evening" recurs in penultimate paragraph), establishes a single-session window, and implies the protagonist's decision must be made before full dark. However, time does not actively tighten tactics—the protagonist is not racing a deadline—and "yawn of evening" functions more as tone/atmosphere than constraint. Lyric reprise reweights the image (mercy exhaled at dusk) but does not drive escalation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stated early ("I came to uncover a hidden truth"), dramatized through on-page actions (inserting crank, interpreting ledgers and ash-letters), and tested by friction (truth rewrites shame into mercy, forcing choice between restoration and renunciation). The protagonist's choices (listening, accepting the burden, leaving the seal) all flow from this motivation. Cost is visible: must carry the dynasty-ender identity without vindication, walk away from power.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Established in opening ("Golden shadows pooled like tea"), modulates through the revelation (shadows "drew closer," dimmed lamps), and charges closure ("the city below had already begun to change, its golden shadows curving into lamp-lit commitments"). Tone remains coherent—solemn, ritualistic, sepia-warm—through all turns and supports the theme of mercy exhaled at dusk. The recurring "golden shadows" image gains weight each time, ending with transformation from ancestral light to communal lamp-lit work.</comment>
