<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lamplighter's interiority is concrete and particular—"the sort of person who hides behind truth, hoping it will shield me from its shadow"—and the vow at closure forecloses a path with visible cost. Embodied contradiction appears in the descent ("ease of someone who has practiced leaving") and the final promise binds without sentimentality. Micro-choices (touching pages, mouthing the vow, pressing the tag) reveal value hierarchy under pressure. Minor: the protagonist's internal stance is consistently contemplative, which limits friction, but the renunciation at closure earns the shift.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the lamplighter leaves a vow to "light the pier without tiring of attention," binding herself to patient labor with felt cost. The accumulative lens holds: descent→library discovery→hum-color realization→vow→surfacing forms a coherent tightening. Orientation anchors (pier, harbor, fog-thinned night, sky lantern release) land early. One meaningful deepening (the hum acquires "thawing silver" and the vow binds) is sufficient at this length and the cost is legible in the final commitment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The sunken ship library, kelp curtains, and hull slats create a coherent micro-setting that constrains movement and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "nacre," "pearly vibration tarnished at the edges with rust," "ash descending like patient snow." The hotel skeleton key tag—a recurring small object—anchors choice (pressing it against the ledger to leave the vow) and charges closure. Spatial choreography (pier→water→hold→stacks→surface) tracks cleanly. No occupation-level demands at this length; the lamplighter role is legible and used.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering the color of sound—is signaled early and tightens once: the hum acquires "subtle not-green, not-yellow" then "thawing silver" when the vow is mouthed, narrowing the protagonist's understanding and compelling the binding promise at closure. Agency is enacted through renunciation (leaving a vow that obligates future attention) with visible cost. No antagonist required; the accumulative lens supports this arc. The tightening is meaningful and the price (perpetual tending) forecloses casual attention.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: listening requires patient tending, brightness is seen by others first, and sound's "colorable weather" is earned, not borrowed. The vows teach "standing still while moving," and the protagonist's final promise—"I would light the pier without tiring of attention"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without a stated moral. The silver hum reweights prior material (the forgotten library's palette, the lanterns as "notes…more seen than sounded") with conceptual cost. No thematic echo; the ending trusts image over assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable; perceptual signature is distinct and selective ("a color like breath seen on glass and promptly erased"). Diction is controlled, lyric, and voice-particular: "mild star," "wet timbered bells," "tethered metronome." No dialogue to evaluate. Purposeful compression (the vows' mechanics are oblique, the library's history elided) is taught early and pays off at closure when the vow's binding quality lands. Minor: some filter constructions ("I realized," "I understood") are acceptable here as contemplative voice but slightly dull immediacy in two beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere, character, or stakes. Rhythm varies purposefully: longer lyric sentences in the library, shorter beats at surfacing. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Figurative language is dense but coherent and voice-motivated ("algae remembering lightning," "temporary birds"). Minor penalty: two adjacent sentences in the library section ("The library breathed, and I realized…" followed by "Each glowing sentence drew a thread…") slightly restate the patience-training concept without added pressure, triggering a small −0.2 deduction. Otherwise, craft is exemplary and propulsion holds.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—underwater library of luminous vows teaching color-of-sound through patient listening—is specific and non-obvious. The lamplighter's descent and final commitment feel inevitable in hindsight, rooted in prior particulars (the found tag, the practice of leaving, the sky lantern trigger). Tropes (sunken treasure, epiphany dive) are transformed through the vow mechanic and the silver-hum payoff. Slight deduction: the "color of sound" synesthesia and forgotten-library mystique evoke familiar metaphysical templates; while the execution is strong, the conceptual territory is well-trodden without a bold structural or perspectival risk that would elevate originality further.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lamplighter's role frames the piece (tending pier lamps, promising to continue without tiring) and her decisions drive key turns: choosing to dive, touching pages, mouthing the vow, leaving her own promise. Present in setup, middle exploration, and closure binding. Causal pressure is clear and the final vow would break without this exact character.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The hotel skeleton key tag appears in three beats: found/worn descent, discovered twin in ledger, pressed against page to leave vow. It enables the middle turn (matching the ledger entry) and charges closure (the protagonist uses it to bind her promise). Specificity (brass oval, stamped number) and evolving use (talisman→key→oath anchor) make it indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Luminous vows shape the protagonist's goal and the library's function. They constrain her understanding (vows "train the ear toward patience," not charm luck) and enable the closure tactic (leaving her own vow to earn the silver). Present in middle and ending, with causal pressure. Slightly below 8.0 because the vows' mechanics remain oblique and their stakes are more thematic than plot-driving.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Hides behind truth" is dramatized once: the protagonist says aloud "the thing that would not be comforted" (wanting to discover the color of sound) as an act of honesty that unlocks the hum's color. The trait enables a key beat but does not recur with visible cost at closure. Functional but not indispensable; the vow mechanic could operate without this exact formulation.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Signify" (sailors wrote shining words to signify safe passage) frames the vows' purpose and motivates the protagonist's search. It appears in setup and thematic middle but does not drive the closure turn; the protagonist's own vow "binds" rather than signifies. Purposeful setup with middle development, but the final image pivots to binding/tending rather than signification, making it replaceable at closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Wandering purposefully" is signaled ("letting the drift nudge me as my legs steered, a compromise between fate and practice") and its mechanics shape the middle beat: the protagonist's method allows her to find the matching tag and discover the vow mechanic. Present in setup implication and middle dramatization. Slightly below 7.5 because it does not constrain the closure choice directly; the final vow is deliberate rather than wandering.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The forgotten library inside the sunken ship is the story's spatial and causal anchor. It provides the luminous vows, the matching key tag, the hum-color revelation, and the ledger where the protagonist leaves her binding promise. Present in setup (pier→water→"harbor floor veers toward the forgotten library"), explored in middle, and active at closure. Removing this exact setting would collapse the story's logic and stakes entirely.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The sky lantern release provides urgency (the protagonist descends "during" it), visual pressure (lanterns rise and descend as ash while she works), and charges the closure image ("lanterns drifting homeward appeared to be the very notes I had heard"). Present in setup, middle (lanterns' shadows "like temporary birds"), and ending reprise. The timeframe tightens decisions (she must act while lanterns rise) and the final callback reweights sound-color with felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The desire to discover the color of sound is stated early, dramatized in the protagonist's descent and page-touching, and resolved when the hum acquires "thawing silver." Friction appears between wanting the color and needing to earn it ("If I wanted to keep the silver, I would have to earn it"). The motivation shapes all three acts and the closure vow binds her to the cost. High integration with visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Meteor hush" (fog thinned to it, night quiet) establishes tone in the opening and modulates through the piece: the library's "listening," the water's "settled…listening that asked nothing," and the final surfacing where lanterns are "more seen than sounded." Tone charges the final image by making silence legible as presence. Coherent through turns, with cadence shift at closure that reweights the opening hush as earned quietude.</comment>
