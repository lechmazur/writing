<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Efan's "lukewarm" steadiness is embodied through concrete micro-choices—hanging the bell, counting drips, tying seaweed threads—that show capability balanced with uncertainty. His internal contradiction ("devotion stayed brittle...cradled it with uncertain hands") acts simultaneously in scene rather than alternating in summary. The fisherman's presence adds pressure through witness and dialogue that forces Efan to articulate his stake. Minor slip: "earnestly naive" is declared early but not tested by a mistake that compounds before resolution, keeping the piece just below 8.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accrues pressure through sensory pattern (drips, gulls, bell hum) that builds to a Resonant Reconfiguration—Efan rebuilds "an echo, not the original," the sea returns "a silver ripple...modest as a memory." Cost is legible: he knows the repair is partial, the city does not cheer, and the ending image carries visible constraint ("modest," "decides to stay"). Orientation anchors (viaduct, dawn, Efan, the bell, the declaration) land cleanly within the first sixth. One tightening point: Efan's thread-and-reed calibration narrows the drip ceremony and shifts the sea's breathing, fulfilling accumulative escalation. The lens holds without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The viaduct at dawn supplies concrete tactical constraint: Efan must finish "before the sun cleared the distant chimneys" or "the day would stamp a clumsy rhythm." The broken bell is handled across multiple beats (hung from a salt scar, threaded with seaweed, set across stones, kissed by the fisherman) and its crack becomes a functional hinge for the drip ceremony. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Efan's observational lens: "sea made a sound like breathing through damp cloth, patient and irritated." The setting charges the final image when "the harbor" returns "a silver ripple" that validates the viaduct work. Spatial choreography remains clear across all moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: restore the cosmic timing hinge to allow fish (and survival) to return. One meaningful tightening occurs when Efan ties seaweed threads and taps the reed, narrowing the drips into "a new ceremony" that shifts the sea's breathing and aligns gull flight—options narrow from passive observation to active calibration. The fisherman's question ("Do we fish again, or do we listen until we learn hunger differently") forces Efan to crystallize his stance: "both were true, because the sea was also a teacher." Cost is visible: the city's muted response ("did not cheer, but its doors stayed open a little longer") and the modest return ("silver ripple...modest as a memory") make clear the repair is partial and fragile. Agency is through micro-decisions under accumulative pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—restoration as approximation, not perfection—emerges from the concrete work: Efan's chalked sleeve tide table, the threaded seaweed, the reed metronome. The final image offers a resonant answer without stating a moral: "he had only rebuilt an echo, not the original, and that was enough." The broken bell returns with shifted meaning (from failure to coordination), and the fisherman's kiss reweights the crack as "a healed knuckle." "Plausible impossibility" is enacted rather than declared: constellations crack, hours spill into nets, yet the repair happens through patient arithmetic. No thematic statement or sermon; the modest ripple carries earned weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Efan with a distinct perceptual signature: he notices drips as "single syllables of a language he could learn," holds "a map of delays, accelerations, and quiet warnings" in his head, and measures the bell's hum "not by sound, but by the pauses between gulls." Diction remains within his lexicon ("brittle devotion," "compassionate arithmetic," "small tide table") without register drift. Dialogue is goal-driven and carries subtext: the fisherman's "You are late" tests Efan's purpose; Efan's reply ("not here for fish, but for the hinge that moves them") defines his stake. Psychic distance is consistent; no head-hopping. Rhythmic control under pressure: sentence length compresses during the ceremony ("He lifted...Then he spoke...Every name...Drips aligned") without losing clarity or voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot without scaffolding. Figurative language is controlled and voice-consistent ("drips...single syllables," "devotion stayed brittle," "sea...breathing through damp cloth"). Sentence openings vary; paragraph rhythm creates visual pace. Minor loop: "He believed understanding dripping rates might let him rebuild the timing of the world" and "Once, the tides had matched the bell" restate causal backstory adjacently; apply −0.2. One filter-verb cluster in reflective beats ("He was not brilliant, but he was steady") dulls immediacy slightly but does not obscure closure; apply −0.2. No template cadence, no mixed metaphors, no synonym churn. Final image is concrete and charged: "a silver ripple returned, modest as a memory that decides to stay."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The premise—repairing cosmic imbalance through patient observation of dripping rates—synthesizes mythic stakes with mundane craft in a non-obvious way. The lukewarm mage is a fresh angle on the wizard archetype: capability without certainty, "brittle devotion" that must be cradled. The broken bell as both metaphor and tool, the seaweed threads and reed metronome, and the modest outcome ("an echo, not the original") resist template triumph. The fisherman's question and Efan's dual answer avoid binary resolution. Transformation test: swapping names and setting would lose the tidal logic, viaduct constraint, and fishless harbor that anchor the stakes. Risk-taking in tone (patient accumulation over dramatic reversal) heightens meaning without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setup: Efan named and framed by ~10% as the one sent because he "could believe in plausible impossibility without getting drunk on it." Development: multiple choices—hanging the bell, counting drips, tying threads, tapping the reed—constrain tactics and enable the ceremony. Closure: his final stance ("both were true") and the walk home carrying the bell crystallize his agency and the story's earned outcome. Two friction points: the naivety is declared but not tested by a mistake; the warmth metaphor remains implicit. Strong causal presence across all three gates and visible cost (partial repair, modest ripple) lift the score into the 7s.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setup: introduced at ~8% ("broken ship's bell in the harbor"). Development: handled in multiple beats—hung from salt scar, threaded with seaweed, set across stones as a bridge, humming at the joints, kissed by fisherman. Closure: the bell's crack becomes the functional hinge for the drip ceremony and is carried home, reweighted from failure to coordination. Causal irreplaceability: the crack itself guides drops and enables the timing repair. Visible cost: it "could only groan," and the repair is partial. All three gates met with high specificity and closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setup: introduced early as the city's reason for sending Efan ("wise ones had hardened into brittle devotion"). Development: manifested in Efan's approach—"his devotion stayed brittle...threatened to snap if tugged wrongly, so he cradled it with uncertain hands"—constraining his method to patience and care. Closure: implicit in the modest outcome and his relief that the world "answered mathematics with mercy." Two gates strong (setup, closure thematic charge); middle development is more label than enacted friction. Scores mid-6s for shaping tone and final stance without forcing a dramatic test of the brittleness on the page.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setup: declared at ~6% ("He was earnestly naive"). Development: shown in his belief that "understanding dripping rates might let him rebuild the timing of the world" and his steady work without burning certainty. Closure: his smile is "not triumphant, but relieved," and he counts "uncertain blessings." Lyric reprise reweights the trait as asset rather than flaw. One friction: the naivety does not cause a visible mistake or cost that alters tactics mid-scene. Scores low-6s for label-plus-behavior with thematic payoff but no enacted tradeoff under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setup: signaled early through the declaration ("after the last fish is caught, the city would try anything") and Efan's assignment to restore the hinge. Development: the rebuild unfolds across multiple beats—hanging, counting, threading, tapping, lifting, speaking constellation names—each narrowing the ceremony. Closure: the action culminates in "coordination, gentle as flint dust" and "the sea adjusted," producing the modest ripple. Irreplaceability: the entire plot hinges on this action; no near-synonym fits. All three gates met with high causal density and visible cost (partial success, muted city response).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setup: introduced at ~20% ("He believed understanding dripping rates might let him rebuild the timing of the world"). Development: mechanics matter—counting drips, writing numbers on sleeve, tracking when drips quicken or slow, using the reed as metronome—and shape each attempt. Closure: the method produces the coordination and sea adjustment; Efan's "small tide table of strange, compassionate arithmetic" becomes the functional tool. Causal pressure: without this exact method, the repair fails. Minor late signal (20%) applies −0.3; strong middle and closure participation lift the score into low-8s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setup: anchored at opening ("At the sapphire viaduct at dawn"). Development: the viaduct supplies tactical constraint—three-stone joint for observation, salt scar for hanging the bell, and a deadline ("before the sun cleared the distant chimneys"). Closure: Efan walks home "across the viaduct," and the harbor returns the ripple, validating the location's role. The dawn timing pressures the work window. All three gates met; the viaduct's physical features (joint, scar, proximity to sea) enable and constrain choices. Scores mid-7s for clear micro-setting function with visible constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Setup: "after the last fish is caught" declared at ~12% as the trigger for the city's desperation and Efan's mission. Development: the timeframe motivates urgency and stakes (survival depends on restoring fish), and the fisherman notes "the last fish has already been history." Closure: the modest ripple signals potential return, reweighting the post-fish moment with fragile hope. Two gates (setup, closure thematic charge); the timeframe is more premise than live ticking clock that alters mid-scene tactics. Lyric reprise without middle escalation scores low-6s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Setup: declared at ~15% ("to right a cosmic imbalance") and embodied in Efan's assignment to restore tidal timing. Development: the desire drives every choice—counting drips, threading seaweed, speaking constellation names—with visible friction ("trying to right a cosmic imbalance without shouting at the sky"). Closure: the motivation resolves in partial success with felt cost ("only rebuilt an echo, not the original, and that was enough"). All three gates met; the motivation is dramatized through micro-choices and charged by the modest outcome. High causal density and visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setup: signaled in the premise (mage sent because he "could believe in plausible impossibility without getting drunk on it") and sustained through the dawn setting and patient observation. Development: tone modulates with pressure—calm counting shifts to ceremonial intensity ("spoke the names of constellations as if clearing pebbles from gears") and resolves to relief. Closure: the final image ("silver ripple...modest as a memory that decides to stay") crystallizes the tone—neither triumph nor failure, but earned fragile hope. Coherent across beats with purposeful modulation; charges the final image without static mood or whimsy.</comment>
