<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The performer's interiority is consistent and voice-particular, filtered through a quasi-mathematical lens ("calculus of misrule," "counts dress like chance"). Motivation remains coherent throughout: orchestrating serendipity through careful observation and micro-interventions. However, the protagonist's agency is largely passive observation and light manipulation rather than choices under genuine pressure with competing costs. The janitor and girl respond predictably to prompts, and no internal contradiction forces a difficult trade-off that would elevate the characterization into the high band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through pattern, detail accretion, and the recursive return of the bishop motif. Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph (arcade, night, between acts). The piece teaches its lyric-accumulative mode early and maintains it. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final lines crystallize the performer's ongoing dance with chance and care, reweighting "between acts" as the true performance. Cost is conceptual but legible—the protagonist must continuously curate rather than rest. One meaningful deepening occurs when the janitor's grief surfaces and the bishop becomes a shared symbol. However, no decisive on-page change narrows options or forecloses a path with felt cost; the ending restates the premise rather than transforming it, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The tidal arcade is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (salt, copper, wet shadows, moon-painted chessboards on water) and remains spatially coherent throughout. The setting actively constrains and enables: the puddle becomes a chessboard, the tide steals coins, the arcade ribs "breathe with moonwater." The bishop on the music case, the chalk lines, and the coin circles function as micro-setting that charges the final image. Occupational detail (street performer's tools, accordion, music case) integrates naturally without exposition. This qualifies for the 9+ gate (environment constrains choice and charges the final image), but minor ornamental descriptions (e.g., "harbor janitor collects cups with the sympathy of old maps") occasionally drift toward metaphor-for-metaphor's-sake, preventing entry to the 8.5+ band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible: the performer must sustain his craft of "orchestrated serendipity" and survive the season through curated moments rather than applause. One tightening occurs when the janitor's grief surfaces and the performer uses the bishop to create a shared revelation. Agency is present but muted—the protagonist arranges options and waits for drift rather than making a high-cost decision. Escalation is accumulative rather than causal; pressure does not narrow options so much as deepen the atmosphere. The ending reaffirms the premise without a visible price that forecloses a path. Under the Accumulative lens, one deepening suffices, but the lack of a tangible trade-off or foreclosed option keeps this in mid-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from image and action: grief moves diagonally like a bishop, luck is rehearsed through attention, monotony is serenaded into meaning. The bishop's diagonal motion recurs with purpose, reweighted at closure when the performer "arranges what [the stars] leave." Subtext operates in gesture (the janitor hesitates, returns the bishop) and silence (his father's chess ritual). No overt moralizing; the ending offers a resonant image rather than a stated thesis. However, the thematic answer is more restatement than revelation—"rehearsal for luck" and "chance and care hold hands" feel like elegant summary rather than a non-literal discovery that reweights prior material with surprise. This keeps the score below the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: quasi-mathematical idiom ("calculus of misrule," "counts dress like chance"), selective attention to angles and probability. Diction remains consistent and voice-motivated throughout. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful—the girl's line "The one that does not blink" and the janitor's brief confession carry subtext and advance the emotional beat. The performer's internal texture stays coherent under pressure, with no filter-verb stacks or head-hopping. Psychic distance is controlled. However, some figurative language edges toward decorative lyricism ("janitor collects cups with the sympathy of old maps," "comet on the stone") that slightly dilutes immediacy in a few beats, preventing entry to the 8.5+ band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high in most beats. However, persistent overwriting and metaphor density reduce clarity and momentum: "silence is a weather vane," "moonlight washing his badge into an old lake," "breath weaving ladders the tide keeps stealing," "the arcade ribs arch like a cathedral," "nickel nebulae," "itinerant chessboards," "photons," "moonwater," "room without walls." These stack in adjacent lines without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering the Overwriting Checks penalty (−0.6 for density and register drift). No paraphrase loops or template cadence, but the figurative load in high-density beats dulls propulsion. Proofreading is clean. The accumulation of ornamental metaphor, especially in the middle third, prevents high-band entry.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise—street performer as probability conductor, orchestrating serendipity through micro-interventions—offers a fresh synthesis. The bishop as talisman and the tidal arcade as collaborative stage are specific and well-integrated. Emotional specificity in the janitor's grief and the girl's attentive beam avoids generic templates. However, the core frame (artist creating meaning through careful observation, "making luck happen") echoes familiar writerly conceits about craft and attention. The ending restates the premise rather than transforming it in hindsight. No close echoes of famous lines, but the conceptual terrain feels adjacent to prior lyric meditations on art and chance. Transformation is incomplete; the arc works but could function with different names and setting, limiting originality to mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The analytical street performer is present from the opening line and shapes every beat. Their observation drives the janitor's memory and the girl's participation. The protagonist's role is to curate rather than decide under competing pressure, so agency reads as facilitation rather than high-stakes choice. Present in setup, development, and closure; constrains tactics (light touch, orchestrated serendipity) and charges the final image. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (moderate, enabling rather than narrowing) +0.8, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.5. Late-penalty N/A. Ornamental use −0.0 (active throughout). Swappability −0.3 (could be another artist-observer). No summary-only. Base 3.0 + 4.5 adjustments = 7.5, reduced −0.3 for swappability and −0.4 for observation-over-decision pattern, yielding 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The bishop appears early (first third), is handled in multiple beats (sits on the case, leans toward puddle, performer sets it between himself and janitor, balances it on coin, skims it, janitor pockets then returns it), and returns charged in the ending ("I sign it with a diagonal"). The diagonal motion becomes thematic shorthand for grief and oblique progress. Present in setup, development, and closure. Early signal +0.7, three+ beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2 (enables the key emotional exchange with janitor), closure linkage +1.5 (diagonal signature), specificity +0.7 (chess piece with particular symbolic freight), cost connection +0.4 (janitor's hesitation and return carry emotional cost). Base 3.0 + 5.9 = 8.9, reduced −0.5 for moderate swappability (another small symbolic object could function similarly) and −0.5 for the symbol doing thematic work more than narrowing a hard choice, yielding 7.9.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Orchestrated serendipity is named in the opening third and operates throughout: the performer arranges coins, chalk lines, and prompts to shape the janitor's and girl's responses. It shapes tactics (light interventions, curated randomness) and is present at closure ("I arrange what they leave"). Setup +0.5, development (two beats) +0.9, closure participation +1.0, specificity +0.4. However, the concept is asserted more than dramatized—the mechanics remain abstract ("ordering randomness," "calculus of misrule") rather than shown through a concrete on-page choice where serendipity succeeds or fails with visible cost. Base 3.0 + 2.8 = 5.8, reduced −0.4 for abstraction over embodied pressure, yielding 5.4.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Lightly attentive" is named early ("My hands stay lightly attentive") and colors perception throughout (cataloging glances, coins, shadows; noticing the girl's beam, the janitor's hesitation). It enables the performer's method but does not constrain a choice with felt cost—no moment where heightened or diminished attention alters outcome. Setup +0.5, one beat (cataloging details that inform later moves) +0.4, closure participation (implicit in arranging) +0.5, specificity +0.3. Base 3.0 + 1.7 = 4.7, rounded up slightly for pervasive coloring of perception, but capped near 4.8 because it remains a label-only trait without a visible tradeoff on the page.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Happen" is named ("I make luck happen," "I let the moment happen like a seal surfacing") and functions as the performer's method: allowing rather than forcing. Present in setup and closure; shapes the ending image ("I let the stars rearrange themselves"). However, it is more thematic claim than a distinct action beat—nearly every performer action could be described as "letting happen" or "making happen" with minor rephrasing. Setup +0.4, closure participation +0.8, specificity +0.2. Base 3.0 + 1.4 = 4.4, raised +0.7 for recurring emphasis and thematic coherence but capped by high swappability (easily replaced by "create," "curate," "invite"), yielding 5.1.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"By ordering randomness" is explicitly named ("I begin the calculus of misrule by ordering randomness, which means arranging options for chaos to select") and demonstrated: coins on edges, chalk lines leading nowhere, bishop leaning toward puddle. The method is signaled in setup and used in the middle beat (arranging the scene for the janitor and girl). Present at closure implicitly (arranging what the stars leave). Setup +0.6, development +0.8, closure participation +0.6, specificity +0.5. Base 3.0 + 2.5 = 5.5, rounded to 5.6. The method shapes attempts but remains somewhat abstract; the exact mechanics of "ordering" are asserted more than shown through a choice where the method succeeds or fails with cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The tidal arcade under stars is present from the opening line and pressures every choice: the tide steals coins and chalk, moon paints chessboards on water, the puddle becomes a playing surface, the arcade ribs "breathe with moonwater." Setup +0.8, three+ beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.5 (tide and puddle enable/constrain the bishop exchange), closure linkage +1.6 (final image of stars rearranging and accordion folding the arcade into "a room without walls"), specificity +0.7. Base 3.0 + 6.0 = 9.0, reduced −0.8 for some decorative metaphor that drifts from immediate causal use, yielding 8.2.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Between acts" frames the opening and closing and signals the performer's liminal state. It is named early and returned at closure ("Between acts again"). However, no live clock or urgency tightens decisions—the timeframe is atmospheric rather than a forcing constraint. Setup +0.5, closure participation +0.7, specificity +0.3. Base 3.0 + 1.5 = 4.5, reduced −0.3 for vague tracking (no sense of minutes passing or next act approaching that would alter tactics), yielding 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"To serenade monotony with creativity" is named early ("The trick is to serenade monotony with creativity, so the ordinary sways on cue") and dramatized through the performer's interventions with the janitor and girl. It drives the protagonist's tactics and is implicit at closure. Setup +0.6, development (two beats) +0.9, closure participation +0.8, specificity +0.4. Base 3.0 + 2.7 = 5.7, raised +0.1 for coherent motivation throughout. No visible friction between this want and a competing cost or fear that would force a hard choice; the motivation is pursued without obstacle, capping the score near 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Calculated wilderness" is embodied in the prose from the opening: "feral in edges, disciplined in aim," quasi-mathematical idiom mixed with lyric imagery. Tone is consistent through turns and modulates with the janitor's emotional moment (softens slightly, then returns to detached observation). Present in setup, development, closure. Setup +0.7, development +0.6, closure linkage +1.0 (ending returns to calculated arrangement of stars and accordion music), specificity +0.6. Base 3.0 + 2.9 = 5.9, raised +0.5 for tonal coherence that charges the final image, yielding 6.4. Tone is more atmospheric than pressure-modulating; it supports rather than transforms the ending, capping the score in mid-band.</comment>
