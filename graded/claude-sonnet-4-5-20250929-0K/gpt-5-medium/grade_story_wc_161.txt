<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivations are concrete and embodied—training pigeons, mapping dust, preserving songs—and the internal conflict between past betrayal and new trust is consistently dramatized through micro-choices (sending Lark, climbing the beam, tying the meteorite chip). Interiority avoids therapy-speak and remains image-driven ("My past leans in with its counterfeit smiles"). The final choice to trust the violinist is earned through the accumulation of small acts and the physical gesture of sending the chip with Lark, though the secondary character (the violinist) remains slightly under-developed as a pressure source.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid): the protagonist stands in the attic, feels "a hinge loosen where suspicion had rusted it shut," and the final image—"pigeons carry us both ways at once, toward remembering and toward mercy"—reweights the dominant stake (learning to trust) with felt cost (vulnerability, the thinning bookshop, risk of theft). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout: density increases via layered images (dust, chips, songs, pigeons) and the pattern of "blooming withering" recurs to charge the ending. Orientation is clear by the opening lines (attic, noon, pigeons, the bookshop context). One meaningful deepening occurs when the bookseller announces the attic will be cleared, tightening urgency and forcing the protagonist to act.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The attic is vividly anchored (foxed atlases, buckled ledgers, single skylight, beam) and functions as micro-setting: the skylight's broken latch creates the peak physical challenge, the dust motes become a navigational tool, and the mars chip "stops against a knot, as if the house held it." Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (dust "sweet," light "blooming withering," the violinist's bow "rasps truth"). The setting constrains choices (clearing of the attic forces urgency) and charges the final image (standing under the skylight mapping dust). Spatial choreography is clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—learning to trust again after betrayal—is signaled early and tightens when the attic's clearance forces the protagonist to send the songs down to the violinist. Agency is visible: copying hymns, writing the route for Lark, climbing the beam to fix the latch, and tying the meteorite chip to the bird's ankle are all protagonist-driven decisions under pressure. The escalation is accumulative rather than reversals: each act layers trust until the final release. Cost is legible: vulnerability, risking theft again, and the impermanence of the bookshop all charge the ending.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—trust as an ongoing practice—emerges through concrete images: dust-mapped routes, the mars chip as calibration of doubt, the hymn slips as fragile choir, and the final line's double motion "toward remembering and toward mercy." The ending reweights prior material without moralizing: "My history does not vanish; it unfolds and refolds, a letter learning gentler creases." Subtext operates in gesture (the violinist's empty hat, the protagonist's whistle pattern) and the recurring "blooming withering" motif charges ambiguity. No thematic echo in prompt language; the piece resists tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Voice is lyric and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature: "the light over the stair is blooming withering, a bruised tulip folding and opening." POV remains stable in first person; focalization is tight and image-driven. Diction is specific and voice-motivated ("trustless sky," "soft as flour, strong as rope"). The prose modulates with pressure: shorter syntax during the peak beat ("I settle the latch, whistle the pattern") and returns to longer accumulative rhythms at closure. Minor register drift in a few lines ("counterfeit smiles" reads slightly elevated for the POV in peak stress) prevents a higher score.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Line-level control is strong: rhythm varies, information density is high, and figurative language is coherent (dust as clock, meteorite chip as ember, history as letter). Opening and closing lines anchor voice and resonate. However, a few repetitive stems appear ("I train," "I roost," "I steer," "I send," "I write") across the first half, and one paraphrase loop ("the echo of lost songs" recurs without added pressure in early paragraphs). These minor artifacts in non-closure beats prevent entry to the 8.5+ band but do not obscure causality or dull the ending.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of courier pigeon training, dust-mote navigation, and a mars meteorite chip as trust calibration is specific and non-obvious. The emotional arc—learning to trust after betrayal through micro-acts of release—feels earned and grounded in particular detail (the violinist's bow, the skylight latch, the choir of note-slips). The piece transforms a familiar premise (overcoming past hurt) through occupational specificity and lyric compression. Risk-taking in structure (accumulative, image-dense, lyric rhythm) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, meriting a small within-band bonus.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setup: present from the opening ("I train courier pigeons"). Development: the protagonist's choices drive every beat—mapping dust, copying hymns, writing Lark's route, climbing the beam, tying the chip, releasing the flock. Payoff: the ending hinges on the protagonist's decision to trust and send the songs, and the final image ("the pigeons carry us both ways") directly reflects the trainer's agency. Causal pressure is high; the occupation shapes tactics throughout. Cost is visible: vulnerability, risk of theft, impermanence.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setup: "The chip sits in my palm like a cooled ember" (early). Development: "lives on the scale, a steady black gleam that calibrates my doubt" (middle beat). Payoff: "The mars meteorite chip skitters but stops against a knot" (peak), then "I stitch the mars chip into a little bag and tie it beside Lark's ankle" (closure participation). The chip is handled in three distinct beats, its use evolves (from scale weight to talisman sent with the bird), and it charges the final image as "the night piece of the choir." High irreplaceability and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setup: "My tools are paper trails" (early). Development: "Paper trails braid our days, ledger to margin, feather to fingertip, until a map forms" (middle); the slips of hymns are cut and sent, functioning as the physical paper trail that connects protagonist and violinist. Payoff: "Paper trails do not chain me now; they lead, and I follow without flinching" (closure beat). The concept shapes tactics (cutting hymns into slips, sending them via pigeons) and reappears in the ending with reweighted meaning. However, "paper trails" also functions partly as metaphor for the larger history/trust theme, diluting its concreteness slightly.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Setup: "Since then, I reinvent my personal history with every route a wing remembers" (early). Development: "A courier pigeon trainer reinvents personal history by choosing which scraps will outfly their shame" (middle beat, meta-commentary but tied to choice). Payoff: "My history does not vanish; it unfolds and refolds, a letter learning gentler creases" (closure image). The attribute is dramatized through the protagonist's choices (which songs to copy, which slips to send) and carries visible cost (vulnerability, accepting impermanence). The trait constrains action and charges the ending, though some formulations lean slightly toward label.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setup: "To keep words true, I balance weight and lift, fear and release, past and next" (early framing). Development: "The mars stone goes to the far pan to balance the flock's thrilled weight" (middle beat); the protagonist climbs the beam and "My feet find balance on wood that remembers storms" (peak beat). Payoff: the final image of carrying "both ways at once" reflects the culmination of balancing competing pulls. The action appears in three distinct beats, shapes the protagonist's tactics (physical and metaphorical), and is essential to the closure image. High causal pressure and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setup: "I steer the flock by mapping the swirl of dust motes under a single skylight" (early). Development: "The motes reveal roomsized winds, small currents that crumple messages or cradle them" (middle); "I map the swirl again, and the dust answers like a clock I can finally read" (peak beat). Payoff: "Under the single skylight I keep mapping the dust, to preserve the echo of lost songs" (final line). The method is signaled early, its mechanics matter (dust patterns guide pigeon routes), and it recurs in the ending with charged meaning. The specificity (dust motes, single skylight) is irreplaceable and shapes multiple beats.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Setup: "At noon the vintage bookshop attic breathes like a lung" (opening line). Development: the attic's features (skylight, ledgers, beam, hatch) provide resources and constraints; the announcement that "the attic will be cleared" creates urgency. Payoff: "I stand in the attic and feel a hinge loosen" (closure beat); "The bookshop is thinning" (final third). The setting pressures choices (eviction forces action), supplies tools (beam, skylight latch), and anchors the final image. High integration across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setup: title line "across learning to trust again" appears in the first third ("Our winter spans across learning to trust again"). Development: the timeframe is implicit in the accumulation of traded scraps and the arc from isolation to trust. Payoff: "Trust returns across learning to trust again, as ordinary and miraculous as breath" (closure beat). The timeframe shapes the emotional arc but is not tracked as a live clock; urgency comes from the attic's impending clearance rather than a deadline tied to "learning to trust." The phrase recurs with reweighted meaning at the end, qualifying as lyric resonance, but mid-scene development is light.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Setup: "I roost here to preserve the echo of lost songs before they fade to papery sighs" (early). Development: the protagonist hurries to copy hymns, street ballads, counting tunes when the attic is threatened; the motivation drives the choice to send the slips to the violinist. Payoff: "Under the single skylight I keep mapping the dust, to preserve the echo of lost songs" (final line). The desire is dramatized through on-page choices (copying, sending) and conflicted with fear of theft. Visible cost (vulnerability, impermanence) and high closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Setup: "blooming withering" appears early as a descriptive phrase for light and recurs as a pattern. Development: the tone modulates through layered images—"soft as flour, strong as rope," "a bruised tulip folding and opening," "the attic smells of glue and cedar"—that hold contradictory states in tension. Payoff: "The bookshop is thinning, the city is thickening, and my heart holds both, blooming and withering" (closure beat); the final image sustains the tone. The duality is woven throughout and charges the ending without becoming static. High coherence and modulation under pressure.</comment>
