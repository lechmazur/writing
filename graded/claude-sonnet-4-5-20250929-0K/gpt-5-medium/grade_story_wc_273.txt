<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The albino tracker possesses a distinct perceptual signature—reading vanishing ink patterns, teaching the hummingbird to "taste ink"—and the motivation is rooted in past trauma (mentor's death). However, the final choice to refuse the throne and "let the ink on my skin disappear" feels abstract rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in action. The interiority leans toward elevated philosophical register ("consciously wild stillness," "serene anger") that occasionally distances us from embodied emotion under pressure, and the protagonist's expertise is so complete that genuine struggle is muted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page: the protagonist refuses the metronome's throne and exits, causing it to "forget how to count"—a Resonant Reconfiguration (refusal that forecloses a path). The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: ephemeral ink patterns cohere into spatial architecture, the hummingbird's song makes invisible maps bloom, and the final act of lying in the ink and disappearing reweights the premise. Cost is conceptual and visible: the protagonist becomes outline-less, the market ends. One meaningful deepening occurs when the footfall maps reveal "a second set that walks perfectly between them"—the algorithm's hunger—which narrows the question from "who profits" to confronting the non-human buyer.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The wind-carved encampment is rendered with vivid specificity—"auric ribs," "tents smoothed to fossils, alleys hollowed like flutes"—and the disappearing ink's flow is anchored in tactile action: "I seed the ground with a fresh vial." The hummingbird as a sensory tool (tasting ink, recording rock clicks) and the metronome chamber constrain the protagonist's choices and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clear throughout (lip of encampment, central trough, hut interior, chamber), and the setting's ephemeral nature (wind, vanishing ink) mirrors the thematic concern with time slowing and edges being bought.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—ending the market where crisis is currency—is signaled early and coheres throughout. Pressure tightens when the ink reveals the buyer is "not a person but a hunger: an algorithm in the metronome," narrowing options from investigative tracking to confrontation with a non-human force. The protagonist's agency at closure is renunciation: refusing the throne and letting the outline disappear, which forecloses becoming "the trader who sets the tempo." However, the escalation is more Accumulative (gathering clues through ink patterns) than a sequence of reversals that test commitment, and the final cost—becoming outline-less—is more poetic than viscerally felt as a trade-off with immediate consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: disappearing ink as ephemeral evidence, the metronome that "wants every heart to lag a fraction," and the protagonist's refusal to "become the trader." The central question—"why does time slow in crisis, and who profits when it does"—is answered non-literally through the discovery of the algorithm and the act of un-outlining, which ends the market without stating a moral. The final image ("the metronome forgets how to count") reweights the premise with conceptual cost. Subtext operates in the mentor's death beneath "falling canvas" and the protagonist's return as "the one who crawled out with the clock inside turned viscous," avoiding over-articulation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The first-person POV maintains a distinct, lyric-philosophical register—"consciously wild stillness," "serene anger," "prowling without hurry, the way a cat studies a clock"—that is consistent and apt for a tracker parsing ephemeral patterns. Perceptual signature is strong: the narrator notices ink eddies, "hiccups where time refuses and then relents," and footfalls that "belong to me" versus those that walk "perfectly between them without touching sand." However, the diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("ephemeral architecture," "viscous," "laminar tongues") that feels more authorial than character-particular under peak stress, and some constructions ("Its sound makes the patterns bloom again, swells the invisible into maps I can read") read as writerly rather than urgent perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense and often striking—"alleys hollowed like flutes," "the clock inside turned viscous," "a throne of pauses, a crown of near-misses"—but the concentration is high across most sentences, risking overwriting in a piece this compressed. Several constructions loop conceptually: "disappear" as mentor's lesson, the protagonist's learned action, the ink's property, and the final act, which charges the motif but also risks synonym churn. Line-level clarity holds in spatial moves, and information density is strong (most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes), but the elevated register and stacked metaphors in consecutive beats ("levee and a bridge," "door ripples open," "memory of fear shaped into a chamber") occasionally slow propulsion. No major template cadence or filter-verb stacks, but the richness borders on impeding momentum in the hut and chamber sequences.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of albino tracker, disappearing ink forensics, and a metronome-as-algorithm that sells slowed time is specific and non-obvious, avoiding template plots. The transformation of "disappearing" from accident (mentor's spilled bottle) to investigative method to final refusal is purposeful and original. However, the "algorithm as hunger" and "throne of pauses" metaphors, while vivid, echo familiar SF tropes of non-human intelligences offering corrupted power. The piece commits fully to its premise and follows implications without retreat, and the risk of lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring the closure effect, warranting modest bonus consideration within band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Albino tracker is present throughout, frames expectation early (tracking prints, questioning time's profit motive), and makes the decisive choice to refuse the throne and let the ink on their skin disappear, ending the market. The tracker's expertise (teaching the hummingbird to taste ink, reading ephemeral patterns) enables the investigation across multiple beats, and the final act of lying in the ink and becoming outline-less is specific to this character's skill set. The choice forecloses becoming "the trader who sets the tempo" with conceptual cost visible in the metronome forgetting how to count. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met; causal pressure and closure linkage are strong.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The artificial hummingbird drone appears early, is used in at least three distinct beats (recording quivers and clicks, tasting/sampling ink curls, perching above contracts to sing and make patterns bloom, hovering at the protagonist's throat to listen), and charges the final image ("the hummingbird loses me, then finds the hollow I left in the air and learns it as a song"). Its specific function—tasting ink and singing to make invisible patterns visible—enables the investigative method and shapes tactics. The drone's learned craft is irreplaceable; a generic recording device would not serve. Strong beat involvement, closure linkage, and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Disappearing ink is the core investigative tool: the protagonist seeds the ground with it, the hummingbird tastes it, patterns reveal the buyers, and the final act of spilling ink and lying in it opens the door to the metronome's heart. The concept shapes stakes (ephemeral evidence of who profits from slowed time) and tactics (following ink flow, reading maps before they fade) across the entire arc. The mentor's spilled bottle is the origin trauma, the ink's vanishing property mirrors the protagonist's final choice to disappear, and the concept is irreplaceable—swapping for any other forensic method would collapse the thematic resonance. Setup, development, payoff, causal pressure, and closure linkage all strong; high irreplaceability and cost connection.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Consciously wild" appears twice as a label ("consciously wild stillness," "I am consciously wild enough to know taming is a kind of theft") but does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with visible cost. The attribute is asserted rather than demonstrated through a choice where wildness forecloses a tame option or vice versa. The phrase enriches voice and tone but remains ornamental in terms of mechanical impact on tactics or outcome. Closure participation is thematic rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Disappear" is the action the protagonist learned after the mentor vanished beneath canvas, and it structures the climax: spilling ink, lying in it, letting the outline disappear, stepping through the door, refusing the throne, and exiting so "the metronome forgets how to count." The action is seeded early (mentor's fate, "the action that would haunt my trade"), used investigatively (tracking those who "refuse to ripple"), and culminates in the protagonist's literal un-outlining. Removing this exact verb would break the thematic and causal spine. Strong setup, beat involvement, closure linkage, and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The method—reading ephemeral patterns in spilled ink—is signaled early (mentor's lesson, "Read the river of it"), demonstrated in the central investigation (seeding the ground, hummingbird sampling curls, patterns revealing footfalls and the spine), and used at closure (lying in ink to open the door). The mechanics matter: ink flow under gravity, patterns that bloom with the hummingbird's song, and the protagonist's body as "levee and a bridge." The method is specific and irreplaceable; swapping for a different forensic tool would lose the ephemeral/time-slowing thematic link. All three gates met; strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The wind-carved encampment provides spatial grounding and atmospheric pressure—"auric ribs," "tents smoothed to fossils," "alleys hollowed like flutes"—and the central trough and low blue hut are navigated on-page. The setting constrains movement (seeding ink where gravity wants confession, entering the hut where panics are minted) and the ephemeral, wind-shaped quality mirrors the theme of vanishing evidence. However, the setting does not decisively alter a tactic or supply a crucial resource at closure; the protagonist could perform the final act in another location with minor edits. Strong setup and development, but closure linkage is atmospheric rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"After the eclipse ends" frames the opening and is mentioned again ("I returned now because the eclipse has just ended"), establishing a temporal anchor. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create urgency; the investigation proceeds without a live clock constraining moves, and the ending is not time-pressured. The eclipse functions more as atmospheric marker than tactical constraint. Setup gate met, but no development or payoff in terms of altering options or shaping closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The motivation—"to discover why time slows in crisis, and who profits when it does"—is stated early and shapes the investigation: tracking prints, reading ink patterns, discovering the algorithm in the metronome. The question is answered on-page (the algorithm sells seconds back during panic) and the protagonist's refusal to become the new trader is a direct response. However, the motivation is more intellectual quest than visceral want conflicting with fear or cost; it reads as purpose rather than dramatized desire under friction. Setup and development strong; closure linkage present but the emotional charge is muted by the philosophical register.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Serene anger" is named early ("Serene anger keeps my hands steady, the old fire quenched to an ember that still knows how to burn") and modulates through the investigation—controlled observation, methodical seeding of ink, calm prowling—culminating in the quiet refusal ("I am consciously wild enough to know taming is a kind of theft. I refuse the throne"). The tone is coherent and charges the final image of exit without violence. However, the tone is more consistent than dynamically modulated under pressure; we do not see it tested or intensified by a peak beat that threatens composure. Strong setup and closure linkage; development shows maintenance rather than evolution.</comment>
