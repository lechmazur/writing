<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The instructor's interiority is concrete and particular—touching the chain link, running alien exercises at night, volunteering for night crawls—showing a mind shaped by years of navigation training now confronted by something beyond sonar. The desire to "let the horizon unfold until it tells you where to fall" reflects earned wonder rather than assertion. However, the transformation from tracing trenches on scrolls to bowing with open palms in recognition feels more stated than dramatized through contradiction or costly choice in scene. The final insight arrives as a perceptual gift rather than a decision that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly (benthic city, navigation instructor, post-alien-contact era) and the piece teaches its accumulative/lyric pattern early: the instructor explains edge geometry through teaching, night mapping, and finally communion with the returning aliens. The closure—"I knew then how to teach them all"—offers Resonant Reconfiguration (the instructor's stance crystallizes from wanting to learn starlight navigation into understanding how edges hold that knowledge) with felt cost visible in the years of tracing, the voluntary night crawls, and the humility of the bow. The link from teaching exercises to answering with edge geometry to receiving unfolded horizons creates a causal thread within the accumulative frame, and the final teaching dictum reweights all prior edge-tracing with purpose.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The benthic setting supplies concrete constraint: domes with kelp shadows, thermal layers, continental shelf scarps, lamps that erase edges. The chain link functions as micro-setting—pitted with salt, heavy, riding in the instructor's pocket during night crawls—grounding abstraction in tactile reality. The city council's lamp installation versus the instructor's night mapping creates a spatial pressure (light erasing what must be mapped) that drives the volunteer crawls. The final basalt ridge and plume edge anchor the alien encounter in geography rather than void.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—learning to navigate by unseen starlight via alien edge geometry—is signaled early and tightens through teaching (students laugh, cry, go quiet), solo night mapping to preserve what lamps erase, and culminates in the alien return where the instructor answers with the geometry and receives validation. The escalation is accumulative rather than causal-turn: each iteration (classroom, night crawl, alien exchange) deepens understanding until the pattern-recognition moment "I knew then how to teach them all" forecloses the old method (dull sonar scrolls) with visible cost in the instructor's years of patient, solitary work. Agency appears as endurance and attention rather than decisive confrontation, fitting the somber-marvel frame.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the anchor chain (surface past), edge geometry (boundaries as knowledge), and the instructor's realization that stars are pressures traceable even underwater—unfolded horizons become both map and prayer without authorial declaration. The final teaching ("listen to the edges...let the horizon unfold until it tells you where to fall") reweights the entire accumulation: navigation is surrender to pattern rather than conquest of space. The piece resists tidy resolution; the city installs more lamps even as the instructor maps what they erase, and the aliens' long silences remain unexplained. The recurring motif of edges (thermal layers, shadow seams, shelf scarps) constrains choices throughout and charges the closure when edges bloom into constellation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinctive—poetic precision without purple excess ("ceilings ripple like slow glass," "vault of pressure and echoes," "horizon unfold until it tells you where to fall")—and maintains consistent psychic distance (close third with lyric latitude). Diction stays within the instructor's plausible register: technical navigation terms (scarps, rays, thermal layers) blend with philosophical reflection earned by years of teaching. No dialogue appears; the piece sustains through interior monologue and embedded teaching fragments. The perceptual signature is selective and specific: noticing edges, measuring what lamps erase, feeling cold rings of cause. Brief compression during the alien encounter ("In the turning, I saw stars traced by pressure") supports the wonder beat without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully between lyric reflection ("the sea is a sky turned inward") and concrete anchoring ("pitted with salt, heavy as a small moon"). Information density is high: most lines do multiple jobs (the chain link grounds both past and present motivation; edge geometry serves as method, teaching content, and final communication tool). Minor template cadence appears in the middle third ("I tell," "I teach," "I volunteer," "I imagine") but the pattern reads as intentional anaphora rather than scaffold, and the final third breaks it. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; clarity remains high even during the abstract alien exchange. The opening and closing lines charge the frame effectively.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of underwater setting, post-contact alienness, and navigation-as-epistemology feels specific rather than generic SF. Edge geometry as both practical skill and metaphysical practice transforms the familiar "longing for lost sky" trope into something particular: stars as pressure-imprints, horizons that unfold in layers, navigation by boundaries rather than points. The instructor's role as teacher rather than explorer shifts expected stakes from discovery to transmission. Risk appears in the lyric-technical blend and the quiet ending where knowledge is shared via geometry rather than speech. The anchor chain and lamp-versus-edge tension ground abstraction in lived detail, lifting the piece above prompt-response feel.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The instructor appears throughout as POV and agent: teaches edge geometry, runs alien exercises nightly, volunteers for night crawls, answers the aliens with expanded rays, and delivers the final teaching. The role drives two key beats (teaching students, communicating with aliens) and shapes the closure ("I knew then how to teach them all"). However, major turns feel more like recognitions than decisions that narrow options with cost; the instructor's path from wanting to learn to knowing how to teach unfolds through patient accumulation rather than a choice that forecloses alternatives on the page.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The chain link appears in three distinct beats: desk anchor tied to surface past, tactile companion during night crawls (riding in pocket, thudding against thigh), and implied presence during the final imagining of sky meeting water. It evolves from memorial object to embodied reminder of constraint (the treaty, downward listening) to symbol of connection between depths and lost surface. The link's return charges the closure by grounding the abstract unfolded-horizon moment in physical continuity, though it does not appear explicitly in the final teaching beat itself.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Unfolded horizons frames the aliens' gift, structures the instructor's night exercises, and appears explicitly in the alien return ("They replied with unfolded horizons, a blossom of planes turning in ways our eyes could not follow"). The concept shapes the central stake (learning this new navigation mode) and provides the vocabulary for the climactic exchange. However, its mechanics remain somewhat abstract—how exactly horizons unfold or what that enables tactically is more told than shown—so the concept charges theme more than it constrains specific on-page choices with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Students arrive "balancedly curious" in one phrase but the attribute never constrains a choice or generates friction. The students' reactions (laugh, cry, quiet) dramatize wonder but not balanced curiosity specifically; a student who was purely curious or purely skeptical would produce the same beat. The trait reads as label-only decoration rather than a property that enables or costs something on the page.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Expand" anchors the method throughout: rays expand through fields balanced by current, the instructor expands rays from shelf line and shadow seam to answer the aliens, and the final teaching hinges on letting horizons expand/unfold. The action drives the classroom instruction, night mapping practice, and climactic communication, appearing in at least three beats with mechanical consistency. The instructor's ability to expand rays from established edges becomes the means of breakthrough, making the action causally indispensable rather than swappable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Edge geometry is introduced early as the aliens' gift, taught in detail (mark edges, expand rays, find intersections where horizons fold), practiced in night crawls (mapping thermal layers, shelf scarps, shadow seams), and deployed as the communication language when aliens return. The method shapes the dominant stake (learning to navigate by it) and provides the tactical vocabulary for the resolution. Its mechanics—boundaries, rays, intersections—matter on the page and constrain how the instructor both teaches and answers, making it essential rather than ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The benthic city supplies concrete constraints: dome living after a treaty, kelp shadows replacing starlight, lamps that erase subtle edges the instructor must map, thermal layers and continental shelf features that become the practice-ground for edge geometry. The setting pressures the central want (navigate by unseen stars) and the instructor's counter-move (night crawls outside the dome to preserve what lamps erase). The vents, basalt ridge, and plume edge anchor the alien encounter spatially. While vivid, the setting could theoretically be swapped for another lightless, pressured environment without breaking the closure, keeping it shy of indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "after discovering aliens" anchors the premise and treaty context but does not tighten decisions beat-by-beat. The instructor's years of teaching and the aliens' return create a narrative arc, yet time remains elastic—no live clock forces tactics. The post-contact era enables the existence of edge geometry and the hope of alien return, shaping one major turn (the aliens come back) but not imposing visible urgency that alters choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The desire to navigate by starlight (echoed in students' parallel want and the instructor's life spent tracing alternatives) drives the teaching, night mapping, and final exchange with aliens. The want faces friction: stars are unseen underwater, lamps erase edges, and the method is alien and uncertain ("refused to say whether it was a map or a prayer"). The instructor's voluntary night crawls and years of patient exercise reflect the cost of pursuing this want. The motivation converges with the closure when the instructor realizes how to teach the method, fulfilling the want not through personal mastery but through transmission.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Somber marvel saturates the piece: slow glass ceilings, patient silt drift, careful alien diagrams, the heavy chain link, long silences, students' mixed reactions (laughter, tears, quiet), the bowed palms. The tone modulates subtly—wonder intensifies during the teaching of star-as-pressure and peaks with the alien return's constellation moment—without breaking into exuberance or despair. Syntax and image selection (cold machine petals, tide stamp, lantern fish aliens) maintain coherent restraint that charges the final teaching with earned reverence rather than assertion, making the tone integral to the closure effect.</comment>
