<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interior voice is distinct and maintained throughout—lyric, image-dense, consistently filtering perception through design and memory. The micro-choices (pressing the shard, following the bridge underwater, putting the shard to tongue) alter tactical engagement with the environment and advance the encounter with grief. Internal contradiction appears in the tension between designing exits for grief versus creating labyrinths that perpetuate it, though this could be sharpened with more embodied struggle. The final acceptance ("the cost is welcome if I can read its texture") feels slightly abstract; grounding it in a concrete gesture visible on the page would have strengthened the earned-stasis closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the halo fragment's repeated activation deepens the narrator's engagement with layered pasts, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) when the protagonist accepts that "the present is a continual photograph fading" and the fragment becomes a ring. The orientation anchors are present early (hedge maze designer, living bridge garden, halo fragment at throat) and the causality is lyric-associative rather than strictly because/therefore, which fits the lens. Cost is legible: the protagonist surrenders the fantasy of fixed exits for grief and instead accepts perpetual texture and fading. One concern: the middle section's rapid scene-flips (father measuring hedges, library fire, pavilion, underwater vault) risk feeling like a catalog rather than a tightening pressure, though the cumulative weight does recharge the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The living bridge garden is vividly rendered with purposeful, image-dense detail (roots that walk, bridges arcing "like a patient skeleton training itself," willow domes with ants stitching sun to shade) and the protagonist's embodied interaction—touching the shard, walking pages, descending underwater—charges multiple beats. The hyperbolic geometry reshapes space and distances in ways that constrain movement and create the retrocognitive trap. However, spatial choreography wobbles slightly: the pavilion "grown from willow domes" and the underwater vault of roots are evocative but their relative positions and transitions are sometimes unclear. The setting does constrain the final choice (the bridge beneath the water, the light path) and the textural specificity is consistent with the POV's design-oriented lens.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding and navigating grief through the maze—is signaled early and tightens as the halo fragment intensifies, forcing the protagonist deeper into retrocognitive scenes. The pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens: each fragment activation adds density (father's lesson, library fire, pavilion encounter, underwater vault) until the final acceptance that grief's exits loop back to their entrances. The woman's declaration ("You stitched grief into paths") and the protagonist's reply ("exits always end as mouths that ask for more steps") articulate the cost of perpetual engagement. One micro turn—the shard becoming a ring—reconfigures the tool and opens the final image. The escalation is more textural and accretive than a sharp reversal, but the cost is visible: the protagonist relinquishes the hope of closure and embraces ongoing reverie.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the interplay of design, grief, memory, and recursion. The blueprint that "shows a looped labyrinth whose exits pair with entrances" seeds the central question: can grief be guided into resolution, or does it demand perpetual navigation? The final image—"every bridge above me hums and the garden blooms into quaking reverie that holds still"—offers a non-literal answer (Charged Poise as stasis, not escape) without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture (kissing wordless covers, pressing the shard to tongue) and in the woman's liminal presence. The piece resists tidy binaries, embracing complexity: forgiveness as "a labyrinth too, one that returns you to the first question." Slight risk: some phrases border on the abstract ("the cost is welcome if I can read its texture") rather than landing entirely through image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is singular and sustained: lyric, image-driven, syntactically varied, with a design-and-memory lens filtering all perception. POV distance is stable first-person, and the protagonist's perceptual signature (counting angles, reading sap as ink, sensing geometry's pressure) remains consistent. Purposeful compression and non-standard syntax ("as if the timeframe is none and she is purely interval") are legible and voice-motivated. However, diction occasionally drifts toward elevated abstraction under pressure ("quaking with reverie," "pale roar") where more concrete sensory anchors might sharpen immediacy. The woman's single line of dialogue feels slightly expository ("You stitched grief into paths") but is brief enough not to break tone. Free indirect style is clean, and psychic distance modulates appropriately as memory layers deepen.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout, which suits the lyric mode, but some metaphors stack without clear payoff: "letters rise like gnats, then settle as soot in me" is vivid, but the transition from gnats to soot feels slightly forced. Template cadence appears in the middle third with repeated "I + verb" stems and "the + noun + verb" constructions across consecutive lines, creating a drumbeat that flattens momentum. Information density is generally strong (most lines do double duty), but paraphrase loops appear: "I designed it after the fire" is closely echoed by "when soot learned to speak in my breathing" without added pressure. The opening and closing images are strong, and syntactic variety improves in the final third. Proofreading is clean, and the prose avoids therapy-speak or stock metaphors, but the middle section would benefit from tighter compression and varied sentence openings.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of hedge maze design, retrocognition, hyperbolic geometry, and the halo fragment as grief-navigation tool is specific and non-obvious. The piece transforms familiar grief-as-labyrinth tropes through the lived particulars of fire, soot-as-language, and design philosophy ("Count the angles until you hear a circle breathe"). The woman as "purely interval" and the fading-photograph conceit integrate tightly with the designer's blueprint and the hyperbolic reconfiguration. Emotional truth—grief as perpetual recursion rather than resolution—feels earned and avoids platitude. The final image (shard-to-ring, bridge hum, quaking reverie held still) is resonant and non-literal. Risk-taking in structure (layered temporal planes, underwater descent, photographic pages walked through) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, though the density occasionally borders on ornament.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The hedge maze designer identity shapes perception (angles, paths, blueprint recognition) and key choices: designing the looped labyrinth after the fire, accepting that exits loop back, and following the light path at the end. The occupation is not ornamental; it frames the protagonist's relationship to grief as something to be structured and navigated. Present in setup, drives middle reflection and final acceptance.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The halo fragment appears early (throat, dim dawn, humming), is pressed multiple times to activate retrocognitive scenes (hyperbolic reorganization, bridge thickening, pavilion approach), and transforms into a ring at closure to lay the final light path. Its mechanics (touch wakes unearned scenes, vibration intensifies, becomes whole) constrain and enable tactics across at least four beats. Irreplaceable: removing it breaks the retrocognitive mechanism and the closure transformation.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Fading photographs appear in frames at the pavilion, are walked through as pages, and drive the protagonist's encounters with past scenes (father, fire, library). The concept structures the dominant stake (reading disappearing memory) and the final acceptance ("the present is a continual photograph fading"). Causally active in middle beats and thematically charged at closure, though slightly more ornamental in early mentions.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Retrocognitively trapped" is named once early and operationalized through the halo fragment's activation: the protagonist is pulled into "someone else's yesterday, breathing their damp astonishment." The constraint forces navigation of layered pasts rather than linear present action. Cost is legible (loss of present control, recursive entrapment), but the attribute could be more tightly woven into tactical choices—most action reads as voluntary engagement rather than trap.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Disintegrate" recurs across key beats: buckets disintegrate into steam during the fire, letters disintegrate into birds in the unburned library, and the blueprint's ink "thins like tea in riverwater." Each instance advances the grief-and-loss theme and the protagonist's recognition that permanence is impossible. The action is causally tied to the fading-photograph concept and charges the final acceptance. Swapping for "fade" or "dissolve" would alter tone but not break structure; still, the specific violence of disintegration elevates pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Through hyperbolic geometry" is invoked when the protagonist presses the shard: "the garden reorganizes through hyperbolic geometry, every curve birthing more curve, endlessly splaying like coral. Distances multiply and fold." The method shapes the retrocognitive mechanism and reappears when the pavilion "becomes a cathedral that cannot close its wings." Signaled early and used twice, but the mechanics remain abstract—geometry as metaphor rather than constraining rule. If the method imposed costs (e.g., longer paths, impossible returns), it would score higher.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The living bridge garden is present throughout: bridges grow where footprints wish, roots walk above streams, paths elongate and tighten into stairs. The environment actively responds to the protagonist (bridge thickens, descends underwater, lays a light path at the end) and supplies the pavilion, vault, and frames as pressure points. Setting is not backdrop but actor, shaping all navigation and the final closure image. Irreplaceable: no other setting could offer the living, mutable architecture that embodies the looped-labyrinth grief logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"To discover the texture of time" is stated early and dramatized through tactile engagement: feeling time's "nap, snag, hidden burrs," pressing the shard to taste "iron, sap, and the hush of rain rehearsing futures," and the final acceptance of texture as "rough as weathered bark and smooth as breath." The motivation drives the descent into memory and the closure negotiation with the woman. Some abstraction remains (texture as metaphor rather than concrete object), but the desire faces friction (cost of perpetual fading) and is tested across beats.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Quaking reverie" is named at the end and sustained throughout via syntax, image density, and trembling/vibrating motifs (trembling notes, fragment vibrates, bridges tremble, quaking with reverie). Tone modulates appropriately: lyric wonder in the garden, visceral loss in the fire scene, subdued negotiation with the woman, and charged stasis in the final image ("quaking reverie that holds still"). The tone is coherent across turns and charges the closure without becoming static or one-note.</comment>
