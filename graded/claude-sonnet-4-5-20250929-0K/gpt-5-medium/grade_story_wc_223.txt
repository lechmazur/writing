<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is distinctly embodied—"the real blast braided my lungs with phrases no director could erase"—and the shift from crisis actor to archivist is motivated by a need to "unbind the record from spectacle." Micro-choices under pressure (cutting away apologies while holding elbows, setting the chessboard, spelling words with footsteps) reveal a hierarchy of values. However, the cast of strangers remains largely undifferentiated beyond professional labels (nurse, janitor, widow), and their agency is limited to participating in the narrator's orchestrated ritual rather than exerting independent pressure. The change at closure—becoming a traveler with the nomadic penumbra—feels more announced than earned through visible cost that forecloses a prior path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered walking-spelling rituals, and the final image of following the nomadic penumbra reweights the opening's "luminous absence." Orientation anchors are present by the first paragraph (whispering gallery, interregnum timeframe, crisis actor turned historian). Closure takes the form of Conceptual Repricing—the narrator will "travel with the nomadic penumbra, following where small gestures shine"—which reconfigures the stakes from archiving to becoming part of the transient record. The cost is conceptual (leaving only objects behind, becoming ungoverned) rather than viscerally felt, and the final beat's assertion "They will think I vanished" tells more than it shows, but the lens holds and the pattern pays off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The whispering gallery is vivid and functional: "the marble rim carried voices like a patient river" establishes acoustic properties that enable the word-spelling method, and the lantern's movement creates the "nomadic penumbra" that structures the piece. Micro-setting elements—the chessboard's "squares scuffed by hands," the widow's button pressed onto cracked lacquer—charge the final image. Spatial choreography (participants crossing in strokes and loops, the staircase where newcomers pause) remains legible throughout. The setting constrains the method (echoes as contraband memory) and shapes the closure image (corridor full of legible silence), satisfying the 9+ test with environment directly charging the final frame.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—to archive small gestures and unbind the record from spectacle—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through the ritual: spelling "water," arranging human pawns, spelling "stay," "hear/here," "thanks," and "hush." Each word deepens the method and tests the narrator's ability to hold participants steady. However, escalation is more textural than causal; no live option is foreclosed, and the widow's button gesture in the penultimate beat introduces a new element rather than tightening prior choices. The cost at closure—leaving the gallery to travel with the penumbra—is more thematic than felt, and no antagonistic pressure forces the narrator to choose between competing goods.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the walking-spelling ritual: small gestures as resistance to grand narratives, survival as collective witness, the body as archive. The "nomadic penumbra" recurs with shifting resonance—from spatial description to the zone of ungoverned attention to the narrator's final destination—and the chessboard missing pawns anchors the piece's inquiry into agency and erasure. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the historian becomes the shadow, following where gestures shine rather than fixing them in place. No thematic echo or moralizing mars the ending. Subtext operates in silence (the gallery repeating "water," the hush completed by breath) and the particulars (soot on cuffs, warming the lantern handle) ground the abstraction without sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>First-person singular voice is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature that filters experience through performance metaphors ("crisis actor," "costume I could finally shrug," "archive without props"). Diction remains consistent—"benevolently ruthless," "nomadic penumbra," "contraband music"—and the narrator's way of noticing (scuffed lacquer as comet, echo as legible silence) is character-particular. No dialogue appears, so those bullets don't apply. Purposeful compression ("I told the gathered strangers") and lyric patterning (repeated "we spelled") are taught early and sustained. However, some figurative density in the final third—"our sentences camping where the shadow paused," "the crack in the lacquer became a comet"—edges toward overwriting without always advancing pressure, and a few filter verbs ("I could feel the old scripts inside me loosening") dull immediacy slightly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "A lantern cut a halo along the cornice, and the room grew a nomadic penumbra that drifted with our breath" anchors light, introduces the central motif, and ties it to collective presence). Opening and closing lines charge the frame effectively. However, minor scaffold appears: "I was benevolently ruthless" and "I was ruthless about detail and benevolent about motive" loop the same concept across distant beats without adding pressure, and the phrase "nomadic penumbra" recurs seven times, sometimes decoratively. A few constructions edge toward overwriting—"It was like the shadow of a tent that walks even when we rest" extends a metaphor without clarifying stakes—and the penultimate paragraph's "asking if the board wanted a king" anthropomorphizes the object in a way that softens rather than sharpens the moment.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of whispering gallery acoustics, embodied word-spelling, and the interregnum setting feels specific and non-obvious. The narrator's dual identity (crisis actor/survivor) and the shift from spectacle to small gestures offer a fresh angle on witness and archive. The chessboard missing pawns, the widow's button as comet, and the lantern-passing ritual are particular to this voice and stakes. However, the interregnum frame and the "historian of small gestures" premise echo familiar post-crisis communal-healing templates, and the piece does not fully transform them through visceral cost or moral complexity. The final image—traveling with the nomadic penumbra—is resonant but not fully inevitable in hindsight; the narrator's departure could have been dramatized earlier to seed that choice more concretely.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The crisis actor/survivor is present from the opening and frames the narrator's motivation to unbind the record from spectacle. The character's choices—entering the gallery, laying out the chessboard, guiding participants through word-spelling, holding elbows steady while cutting apologies—drive the ritual beats. The final decision to travel with the nomadic penumbra closes the arc. However, the character's decisions feel more orchestrative than conflicted; they direct others' participation without facing meaningful opposition or paying a visible cost that alters later options. The dual identity (actor/survivor) is invoked but not dramatized as a source of friction in the middle beats.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The chessboard appears in three distinct beats: initial placement at center, the arrangement of people as missing pawns, and the widow pressing a button onto its cracked lacquer. Its state (missing pawns, scuffed squares) signals prior erasure and motivates the human-pawn arrangement. The button-as-comet moment reweights the board from tactical map to memorial object. However, the board's role is more symbolic than causal; removing it would not break the word-spelling method or alter the narrator's final choice. It enriches theme but does not constrain tactics or narrow options under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The nomadic penumbra is introduced early ("the room grew a nomadic penumbra that drifted with our breath"), recurs through the middle (the shadow "camping where the shadow paused"), and anchors the closure ("I will travel with the nomadic penumbra"). The concept shapes the narrator's final choice and charges the ending image. However, it functions primarily as atmosphere and metaphor; it does not constrain on-page tactics or alter the mechanics of the word-spelling method. The piece could operate with "the moving shadow" or "shifting light" without structural loss, though thematic resonance would weaken.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Benevolently ruthless" appears twice as a label ("I was benevolently ruthless, cutting away apologies while holding their shaking elbows steady" and "I was ruthless about detail and benevolent about motive") and describes the narrator's approach to guiding participants. The trait enables the ritual's structure—cutting apologies, steadying elbows, insisting on precision—but does not create a visible tradeoff or constrain a choice with felt cost. The attribute characterizes method without dramatizing a moment where benevolence and ruthlessness conflict or foreclose an option.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Unbind" appears explicitly ("I unbind the record from spectacle") and implicitly frames the narrator's method: replacing official archive with ephemeral, echo-based memory. The action motivates the choice to use footsteps instead of recordings and to leave only objects behind. It shapes the stakes (freeing small gestures from grand narratives) and the closure (becoming ungoverned, traveling with the penumbra). However, the action is more thematic than plot-driving; no on-page beat shows the narrator actively severing a prior binding or facing resistance that tests the unbinding. The concept anchors motivation but does not generate a causal turn.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The walking-spelling method is signaled early ("My method was a pattern of walking that spells words"), demonstrated across multiple beats (water, stay, hear/here, thanks, hush), and its mechanics—strokes, loops, hitches, scuffs—are made legible on the page. The gallery's acoustic properties enable the method (echoes as contraband memory), and each word spelled deepens the ritual's stakes. The method shapes the middle beats and is present in the closure ("a corridor full of legible silence"). Removing it would collapse the story's structure. The specificity of execution (three strides and a hitch, taped shoes skidding) and the method's tie to the whispering gallery's architecture make it indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The whispering gallery is named in the opening sentence and its acoustic properties—"marble rim carried voices like a patient river," echoes traveling the curve—enable the word-spelling method and frame the stakes (memory as contraband). The setting's architecture (cornice, staircase, tiles) shapes choreography and the lantern's movement. The gallery's function (repeating words from corners where no lips moved) is causal to the ritual's success and charges the closure image (corridor full of legible silence). The space constrains the method (only here can footsteps become contraband text) and the final act (leaving the gallery to travel with the penumbra). Specificity and causal integration earn high-band entry.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The interregnum is named in the opening and establishes the political frame (no one owns time, rumor of regency forming, "old regime" referenced). It motivates the narrator's choice to archive without official sanction and shapes the stakes (ungoverned space, no doorkeepers). However, the timeframe does not constrain on-page tactics or create urgency; no countdown pressures the ritual, and the interregnum could extend indefinitely without altering the narrator's choices. The historical moment enriches atmosphere and theme but does not tighten decisions. It provides context rather than a live clock.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The motivation to become "the historian of small gestures" is stated early and drives every beat: the choice to archive via footsteps, the word selection (water, stay, hear/here, thanks, hush), the arrangement of human pawns, and the narrator's insistence on detail. The desire is tested by participants' uncertainty (needing assurance, shaking elbows) and by the tension between recording and letting go (leaving only objects, traveling with the penumbra). The final choice to follow the nomadic penumbra rather than stay with the archive reflects the motivation's evolution. However, the narrator faces no conflicting want (e.g., official recognition, safety) that would create friction and raise the cost of the choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Luminous absence" appears in the opening ("the air glowed with a luminous absence that refused to be empty") and modulates through the piece: the lantern cutting halos, the nomadic penumbra drifting with breath, the gallery repeating words from empty corners, and the final "corridor full of legible silence." Tone remains coherent through the ritual beats—elegiac without sentimentality, attentive to small gestures—and charges the closure image (absence as presence, the ungoverned shadow). The tone supports the method (ephemeral archive, contraband memory) and the stakes (resisting spectacle). Pressure modulates from instructive calm to collective breath-holding (spelling "hush"), and the ending sustains the tone without deflating into summary.</comment>
