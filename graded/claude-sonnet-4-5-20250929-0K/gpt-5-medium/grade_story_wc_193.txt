<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is concrete and embodied: "My thumbs shake," "The bolt fits...the metal knows the ritual." Internal conflict appears in lived contradiction—they are "virtuously mischievous" and simultaneously scarred by pyramid-scheme trauma, impulses that drive distinct on-page choices (volunteering for maintenance vs. prudent restraint). The final choice to volunteer delivery is earned by prior causality with visible cost (accepting the raise "like a tide" while insisting value is "only payable in trust and lungs"). Minor slip: some emotional progression reads slightly overarticulated ("I laugh, which sounds like a valve finding its note"), but it does not flatten the closure beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens inferred: Accumulative/Textural—pressure accrues through layered imagery (bolt, promise, ghostly texts, diamond-bearing mushrooms) and a decisive cadence shift at the ending reweights the dominant stake with felt cost. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land by ~80 words; the compression chamber crisis deepens once meaningfully when the narrator installs the bolt and "signs" their name, crystallizing responsibility with visible consequence (diamonds bloom, ledger dissolves). Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final image of reflection "briefly tidal and new" and the delivered crate reconfigure the opening scars and pyramid-scheme past into generative trust. Cost is legible in the refusal to patent ("only payable in trust and lungs") and the voluntary charity action that follows acceptance of the raise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The bolt returns across beats with evolving function: talisman in pocket → recognition of its "ritual of pressure" → installation that "shakes as if remembering depth" → witnessed by the engineer at dawn as evidence of method. The mushroom farm supplies immediate micro-setting constraint (slick floor, pulsing caps that "lift as if to pray," gauge tree) and charges the closure image when diamonds bloom "laced like frost, facets embedded in edible geometry." Sensory selection reflects urgency (the scent of "unbroken vows and damp paper and salt" arrives at peak pressure). Minor gap: spatial choreography of the chamber's ninety-degree rotation and hose routing could be slightly clearer under stress.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: translate pressure into value, survival after scam trauma. One meaningful tightening: gauges "flirt with the red," parallel-dimension texts escalate instructions, and the protagonist must choose whether to trust ghost-selves and "let the vow cut you before it cuts the crop." Agency is decision (installing the bolt, signing the console, opening the feed) with visible cost: accepting vulnerability, relinquishing patent control, volunteering post-success. The chamber's transformation and diamond bloom narrow options (the method cannot be replicated without trust) and foreclose the purely transactional path. Escalation driven by protagonist choices under the accumulative lens; cost unmistakable in the charity delivery and refusal to commodify the method.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: pressure as crucible, the ethics of promises, and survival's conversion into generative trust. The bolt's submarine past and "quantum promise" concept integrate without overt thesis. Final image offers non-literal answer—"virtue without mischief makes brittle diamonds"—rooted in lived tension between the narrator's scar-driven caution and their mischievous volunteerism. Subtext operates in silence and image: the ghostly chorus of scammed selves, the visor reflection of "ten ghosts of me," the shift from "ruined ledger" to "ledger of breath." No thematic echo in prompt language; the ending modulates insight through action (wheeling light through town, catching tidal reflection) rather than assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV stable throughout; first-person voice carries distinct perceptual signature (the engineer's charts "glowed like fish," the chamber "heaves," "the promise hums"). Diction remains character-particular under stress: "I laugh, which sounds like a valve finding its note." The parallel-dimension texts maintain narrative distance (they are "me, and not me") without head-hopping. Minor register drift: "a living chord asking to be tuned" and "quantum promise" occasionally elevate diction slightly beyond the blue-collar maintenance frame, though the effect supports the lyric-accumulative mode. Dialogue is minimal but goal-driven: the engineer's apology and patent offer, the narrator's refusal that establishes thematic stance. Psychic distance controlled; no POV leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, opening with lush accumulative texture ("blue caps breathe like tidepools") and tightening under crisis ("Turn the chamber ninety degrees...I wheel the steel drum"). Information density high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, and pressure without padding. Minor overwriting cluster mid-story: "The bolt fits a threaded mouth at the base of the gauge tree, a strange omitted anchor. No manual mentions it, but the metal knows the ritual of pressure like an old hymn. I screw it in, feeling oceans pretend to return"—three consecutive metaphoric constructions in a high-pressure beat risk slight opacity (−0.4). No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Clarity sustained through closure; final line ("The promise hums, and we keep walking") propels without scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Core synthesis—bioluminescent mushroom farm as pressure-to-diamond laboratory, parallel-dimension texts as survivor chorus, submarine bolt as trust artifact—feels non-obvious and integrated rather than checklist assembly. The "quantum promise" concept and the season "when concepts become physical" transform familiar survivor/redemption arc through specific world logic and occupational detail. Emotional specificity avoids templates: the narrator's IOU scars "itch most when the moon fogs," the engineer "worshiping charts" until the harvest forces recalibration. Risk-taking in the lyric-accumulative structure and parallel-self chorus heightens stakes without obscuring clarity (+0.3 within band). Transformation test passes: plot would collapse if names/places changed, as the mushroom-diamond transmutation and bolt's submarine past anchor the stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Pyramid scheme survivor surfaces in opening setup ("IOU scars that itch"), shapes the narrator's cautious/mischievous duality across middle beats (recognizing scam patterns in the ghost chorus: "we have all been scammed...and we have all crawled back"), and charges closure when the narrator refuses to patent the method, insisting value is "only payable in trust and lungs"—a direct rejection of pyramid logic with visible cost. Present across all three gates with causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Submarine porthole bolt introduced early (pocket talisman, "it likes responsibility"), used concretely at crisis (threaded into gauge tree base, "the metal knows the ritual"), and witnessed by engineer at dawn as proof of method. Evolving function across three beats; irreplaceable specificity (its submarine past under "thousands of tons of sea") charges the pressure metaphor and final trust exchange. Closure participation clear: the bolt's installation enables diamond bloom and the narrator explains its origin to justify the non-patentable method.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Quantum promise named by the engineer early, becomes the visible "filament...stretched taut like a harp string of pure intention" at peak pressure, and the narrator recognizes it "not as math, but as a living chord asking to be tuned." Shapes tactics: the protagonist must sign their name (legal spell) and "let the vow cut you before it cuts the crop" to crystallize the promise into diamonds. Closure linkage: the promise "hums" in the final line, reweighting prior material. Specific mechanics (compression, tuning, signing) alter options with conceptual cost (trust over patent).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Virtuously mischievous" appears in setup ("I volunteer for the late maintenance because I am virtuously mischievous") and returns at closure ("Virtue without mischief makes brittle diamonds"). Constrains one on-page choice: the charity delivery insists on combining virtue (helping families) with mischief (subverting pure transaction). Cost is conceptual—rejecting the "safety middle"—but the trait itself is more described than dramatized in conflicting micro-choices under pressure. Mid-range: present in closure with thematic weight but only one clear causal beat.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Volunteer action frames the narrator's access to the crisis (late maintenance shift), drives the middle choice (volunteering to interpret ghost-texts and install the bolt without supervisor approval), and recurs at closure (volunteering to deliver the crate). Each instance redefines options: initial volunteer grants agency, crisis volunteer accepts mortal/professional risk, final volunteer rejects pure profit for generative circulation. Swappability low; the specific stance of choosing exposure over safety shapes all three beats and the thematic answer.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Glitchy text messages from parallel dimensions introduced early ("texts start when gauges flirt with red...stamped with timestamps that run backward"), supply concrete middle instructions ("Turn the chamber ninety degrees," "Take responsibility"), and the protagonist texts back "thank you" before closure, screen settling into "ordinary numbers." Mechanics matter: the backward timestamps and "ghost alphabets" establish the method's ontology, and the protagonist's choice of "the thread that feels like home" narrows options. Closure participation: the exchange resolves and the method's cost (trusting ghost-selves) is paid. Not indispensable—story could function with a different oracle—but tightly woven.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Bioluminescent mushroom farm present throughout: caps "breathe like tidepools," provide spatial constraint (slick floor, pulsing lanterns counting fright), and directly participate in the transformation (caps lift "as if to pray," diamonds bloom inside them). Setting supplies the dominant stake (farm must survive the test) and the resource that alters outcome (living crop as pressure vessel). Micro-setting details—gauge tree, compression chamber, visor reflection—anchor every beat and charge the final harvest image. Essential across setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"The brief season when concepts become physical" establishes timeframe in opening and justifies the quantum-promise mechanics. Present as atmospheric condition but does not tighten tactics within the single night's crisis; the clock runs (engineer leaves early, night shift, dawn return) but elapsed time does not narrow options or escalate pressure beyond the gauges' red-flirt. Setup and development present; closure participation weak—season does not reappear or reweight the ending. Functional but replaceable with "experimental window" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Translate pressure into diamonds, one crop at a time" stated early as explicit motivation, dramatized through the chamber crisis (literal pressure conversion), and tested when the protagonist must choose between patenting (monetizing pressure) and gifting (circulating pressure as trust). Friction visible: the narrator's scar-driven caution opposes the mischievous generosity, and the final choice to deliver diamonds to the charity kitchen enacts the desire with cost (foregoing exclusive profit). Want shapes all three beats; the ledger transformation (ruined → breath) at closure pays off the motivation with conceptual repricing.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Shadowseam wonder coherent from opening ("rows of glow threading the dark like careful gossip") through crisis (visor ghosts, filament harp string, caps praying) to closure (wheeling light through waking town, reflection "briefly tidal and new"). Tone modulates with pressure—lyric density increases at peak beats, settles into quieter propulsion at resolution—and charges the final image: the promise hums, walking continues. No tonal rupture; the blend of technical procedure, lyric metaphor, and embodied survivor voice holds. Wonder sustains through turns without flattening into static mood.</comment>
