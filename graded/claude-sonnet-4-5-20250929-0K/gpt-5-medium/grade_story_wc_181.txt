<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The curator's interiority shows some concrete anchoring—he feeds the cameo rainwater and secrets, presses it to the tree—but much of his motivation remains abstract ("bewildered," "brightened disquiet") rather than embodied. The choice to eat the dullest fruit arrives without clear internal contradiction or visible cost beyond a vague sense of complicity. The aunt's vanishing mid-lecture and her role as inherited inquiry are told more than dramatized, weakening the felt stakes of his final decision.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: by ~120 words we have "astral orchard" and "lonely asteroid" but no clear temporal or spatial anchors for the curator's movements until the bathroom pod appears. The Drive Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered imagery (cameo warming, grove closing, pages turning)—and a Resonant Reconfiguration occurs when he presses the cameo into the tree and accepts his role to "curate the between." However, the cost is conceptual and implied rather than felt on the page; the final smile and silver pod invitation feel more like lyric closure than a lived price. Minor orientation debt and the abstract quality of the final reconfiguration prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The astral orchard supplies vivid particulars—star-plums with whispers, roots hiding silver pods, the grove that inhales "like tide in a seashell"—and the bathroom pod functions as micro-setting where philosophical breakthroughs occur, priming his final inquiry. The cameo pressed to bark charges the closure image. Spatial choreography remains clear across the orchard, pod, and forbidden grove, and sensory detail (tap water smell, ticking cameo, rustling leaves) is filtered through the curator's peculiar attention.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—pursuing forbidden knowledge—is signaled early but remains abstract. The move from bathroom pod to forbidden grove tightens options, and the tree's whispered rule ("ask with your lineage") narrows his approach, forcing him to use the cameo rather than voice. The choice to eat the dullest fruit feels arbitrary rather than a trade-off under pressure; no live option is visibly foreclosed. The orchard claiming him in return is stated but not dramatized with felt cost on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The theme of nonlinear inheritance—what you let answer when the world asks you to speak—emerges organically through the cameo, the aunt's archived inquiry, and the curator's acceptance of being rewritten. The final image of the grove closing "like covers" and the invitation to "wash his hands and think again" offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. However, phrases like "the pages that keep writing us as we read them" tilt toward overt theme statement rather than letting particulars speak.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The voice is distinct and consistent—philosophical, lyric, patient with metaphor—and the POV remains stable throughout. Diction such as "brightened disquiet," "nonlinear inheritance," and "the between" feels purposeful and character-specific, though occasionally elevated beyond immediate crisis idiom. No head-hopping, and the cameo as focalized object maintains coherent distance. However, some lines read as abstract philosophizing ("objects could be hungry") rather than grounded perception under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high—most lines advance atmosphere, world logic, or the curator's inquiry—but several phrases loop conceptually: "brightened disquiet" appears three times, "simply complicated" twice, and "the between" recurs without evolving meaning. Template stems such as "He [verb]" and "She [verb]" appear in clusters. Mixed metaphors are minimal, but the final paragraph's "pages that keep writing us as we read them" edges into overt meta-commentary. Paraphrase loops around the cameo and aunt's inquiry reduce propulsion in mid-story beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of astral orchard as archive, the pistachio shell cameo as inquiry vessel, and the curator inheriting his aunt's unfinished question through fruit-eating is specific and non-obvious. The bathroom as breakthrough site and the grove's rule to "ask with your lineage" feel freshly integrated. However, the core frame—forbidden knowledge pursued in a magical library-analogue—is a familiar template, and the story does not fully subvert it; the transformation lies in texture and voice rather than structural risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The bewildered curator is present throughout and his choices—locking the pod, pressing the cameo, eating the fruit—create beats. However, "bewildered" remains largely a label; his confusion does not visibly constrain tactics or force a trade-off. The final smile and acceptance of his role feel less like a decisive turn than a passive assent. Present in closure but not causally indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The pistachio shell cameo blank appears early (carried in pocket, fed rainwater and secrets), returns in the bathroom mirror scene where it shows the aunt, is pressed to the tree where lines rise "like veins filling with meaning," and is impressed into the bark as a promise at closure. It shapes three distinct beats and charges the final image. The cameo's blank state evolving into the aunt's unfinished face is specific and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Nonlinear inheritance is named early and explained through the orchard's structure (remembering futures as well as pasts). It recurs thematically in the aunt's archival vanishing and the curator's acceptance that "nonlinear inheritance was not only about bloodlines or books." However, the concept remains largely thematic; it does not constrain a middle choice or force a visible cost. Present in closure reconfiguration but not causally active.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Simply complicated" appears twice—once describing orchard rules carved by earlier keepers and once in the aunt's wordless instruction. It is a label rather than a trait that constrains action. The phrase recurs but does not enable or disable a specific on-page choice with cost. Mentioned but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Inquire" appears early (taught by the aunt to "inquire without end"), drives the bathroom mirror question, and the grove's instruction to "ask with your lineage" forces the curator to press the cameo. The final commitment to "teach his successors how to inherit out of order" and "complete the inquiry" frames closure. Present in setup, middle, and ending, with some causal pressure, though the method of inquiry itself (beyond pressing the cameo) is abstract.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Having philosophical breakthroughs in bathrooms" is seeded early ("astronauts do with orbiting epiphanies"), recurs when he locks the pod and asks the mirror a question, and is reprised at the end when the silver pod "inviting him to wash his hands and think again" closes the story. The method shapes one middle beat (mirror question) and charges the final image. Two-gate presence with lyric reprise; swappable with minor edits but purposeful.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The astral orchard blossoming on a lonely asteroid is present from the opening line, supplies the forbidden grove that does not appear on the map, and its fruit with whispers and heartbeats drive the central action. The grove's inhalation and whispered rule force the curator to use the cameo. The orchard closing its leaves "like covers" charges the closure image. Setting shapes tactics and appears across all three gates with specificity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Between the first and last page" opens and closes the story as a framing metaphor. It appears in the mirror scene when "the space between the first and last page thinned like a membrane" and the aunt walks there. However, it functions as lyric image rather than a temporal constraint that tightens decisions; no clock or deadline alters the curator's moves. Present in opening and closure but does not pressure tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"To pursue forbidden knowledge" is stated early ("He had come here to pursue forbidden knowledge") and "the prospect brightened disquiet." The forbidden grove materializes mid-story and its harvest contains "causes that sought effects"; eating the fruit is framed as complicity. The motivation is declared and shapes the move to the grove, but internal friction—what he risks versus what he gains—is told more than dramatized. Present in setup and middle; cost is conceptual at closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Brightened disquiet" appears three times: early as "the prospect brightened disquiet like a lantern raised within fog," when he leaves the pod "drawn by brightened disquiet," and at closure guiding him "through the pages that keep writing us as we read them." The tone is coherent and modulates with pressure—calm in the bathroom, rising at the grove, resolute at the end. However, the phrase is repeated rather than transformed, and the tone does not shift dramatically under peak stress. Present across beats and charges the final line.</comment>
