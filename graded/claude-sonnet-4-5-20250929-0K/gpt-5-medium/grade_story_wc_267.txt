<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is textured and character-specific, with nerve regeneration embodied through "shocks" as letters and pain as a metronome. The final choice—remaining to "renegotiate" safety's price through listening—is earned by prior causality and forecloses the easier path of departure. Internal contradictions appear (injury "choral," safety both needed and suffocating), and micro-choices (pocketing the bolt, sitting at the bench) reveal values under pressure. Backstory is minimal and anchored to present stimuli; no therapy-speak intrudes at closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with pressure building through recurring motifs (radiator clicks, cobalt windows, the bolt) until the final image crystallizes a resonant reconfiguration: silence remains but no longer demands forgiveness, and the protagonist's small action (touching the window, leaving a faint print) reweights the fortress's rule. Orientation anchors who (injured guest), where (cobalt fortress), and when (winter, nerve regeneration) by the opening paragraph. The closure unit is a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost—the protagonist endures winter, accepts cold hope, and through "stubborn listening" shifts the terms of safety without breaking the silence. One meaningful deepening occurs (week seven, radiators translate, the humming choir returns) and the cost is legible: patience, sensation, and the acceptance that hope can be cold.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The cobalt fortress and its elements—radiators clicking like teeth, bricked windows, the piano bench bolt—constrain choices and charge the final image. The nerve-regeneration wrist and the training room with the naked piano ground the protagonist's actions in tactile, lived-in detail. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency (pain sharpens attention, warmth and frost mark key beats) and spatial choreography is clear throughout the spiral staircase descent and lobby-to-training-room sequence. The bolt's physical presence and the window's fogged treble clef serve as micro-setting that alters tactics, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding and renegotiating the cost of safety—is signaled early and tightened through the protagonist's acceptance of pain, repair of the bench, and final "playing easing" at the piano. One meaningful deepening occurs at week seven when the radiators pattern becomes legible and the protagonist chooses to remain and let the humming shape breath. Agency is renunciation and endurance with on-page cost: the protagonist does not play notes but creates space, forecloses escape, and accepts cold hope. The bellhop's tears and the fortress's exhale mark a visible shift in the rule without breaking the silence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the recurring tension between safety and silence, with the piano bench bolt and the choir that cannot sing serving as concrete anchors. The final image—touching the window, leaving "a permission softer than law yet stronger than hush"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without stated moral. Subtext operates through gesture (the bellhop's zipper across lips, his tears, his bowing) and the radiator's Morse translation. The protagonist's insight that "safety could remain, but its price could be renegotiated" is earned through weeks of embodied struggle, not asserted. The piece resists tidy resolution: silence remains unpardonable but no longer asks forgiveness, a complex stance with plausible counter-readings.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and sustained: compression, lyricism, and metaphor ("metronome of me," "conch shell of cold," "cached winter like doves") cohere without obscuring causality. POV is stable single first-person with no head-hopping; distance modulates purposefully (close interiority in pain beats, wider lens for the fortress's atmosphere). Purposeful elision—what the "unpardonable silence" guards, why the choir is forbidden—is taught early and paid off at closure when the rule shifts. Free indirect style is clean; internal voice remains character-specific under stress. Minor pattern risk: several lines lean on figurative density ("seraphically mundane," "oceanic ghosts," "doves") but the accumulative mode justifies it and clarity holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; sentences layer action, atmosphere, and interiority without padding. Rhythm varies purposefully (short declarations at pain beats, longer syntactic waves during reflective passages). No paraphrase loops or template cadence; paragraph structure supports pressure. The metaphorical freight is heavy but legible, and most images anchor in concrete detail (wrist wrapped in wires, radiator clicks, bench bolt). Minor slip: "the unpardonable silence that guarded this place" and "it was an unpardonable silence because it pretended to protect" create near-restatement across two beats without added pressure, triggering a small loop deduction. Otherwise, clarity and propulsion are strong.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of cobalt fortress, silent bellhop, piano bench repair, and nerve regeneration feels organic and specific. The premise—safety purchased through enforced silence, renegotiated through small acts of listening—is non-obvious and committed to without retreat. The final image (faint print on window, bellhop bowing to the choir that never sang) transforms the opening's monastery-and-glacier patience into a charged permission. No close echoes of famous lines; emotional specificity avoids generic templates. The piece takes formal risks (lyric compression, patterned motifs) that heighten stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The silent-choir bellhop is introduced early, signals the unpardonable silence, guides the protagonist to the training room, hands over the screwdriver, and breathes the treble clef onto the window—each action narrowing options and enabling the protagonist's final choice to remain and "play easing." His tears and bow charge the ending. Two distinct beats plus closure linkage; causal pressure is clear.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The piano bench bolt appears on the lobby counter, is pocketed, then installed with "a surety I envied" to repair the bench, enabling the protagonist to sit and tune pain to the hiss. The bolt's steadiness becomes the means to renegotiate safety's price. Early signal, two beats (lobby and training room), and closure linkage (the protagonist plays from the repaired bench). Specificity high; swapping it for a generic fastener would lose the "steadiness" motif.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Unpardonable silence is named early ("the emblem of the unpardonable silence that guarded this place"), constrains action (no one can sing), and is repriced at closure: "the silence remained, it no longer asked us to forgive it." The concept shapes stakes (choir smuggled through pipes, radiator translation) and tactics (protagonist plays space, not notes). Visible friction and cost; the rule persists but its moral demand shifts.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Seraphically mundane" describes the lobby in one early beat ("scrubbed tiles, chipped halos in the grout, coffee steam rising like incense for the pragmatic") but does not constrain a later choice. The tone it establishes—sacred meets ordinary—echoes in the final permission "softer than law yet stronger than hush," a lyric reprise. Two-gate presence (setup and thematic closure linkage) without middle development; lyric resonance lifts it into mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Remain" is signaled early ("I had come to remain through winter"), tested at week seven when the choir returns, and crystallized in the final choice: "I chose to remain, to sit at the repaired bench." The action redefines options—departure versus stubborn listening—and forecloses the easier path. Present in setup, middle deepening, and closure; causal pressure high.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Via the slightest discoloration on a dusty spiral staircase" appears once in the middle, guiding the protagonist to the training room. The method is signaled and its mechanics (breath had warmed the iron) matter for the bellhop's silent guidance motif. One beat, with thematic linkage to warmth and hidden signs. Functional but not indispensable; mid-7s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The cobalt fortress supplies radiators that click in Morse, bricked windows that sweat like fever, and a training room with a naked piano—all constraining choices and shaping the protagonist's tactics (tuning pain to the hiss, sitting at the bench, touching the window). Early anchor, multiple beats, and closure linkage (final window-touch and fortress exhale). Irreplaceable; the setting's particulars drive the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"During nerve regeneration" is the timeframe, signaled early and tracked through "sparks," "shocks," and "weeks accumulated like drifts." Week seven marks the radiator pattern's legibility and the choir's return, tightening the decision to remain. The time constraint shapes tactics (learning to tune pain, writing shorter letters) and charges the ending (nerves accepting cold hope). Present across all three gates with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to understand the cost of safety" is stated early, dramatized through the protagonist's endurance of winter and repair work, and tested when the choir returns and the choice to remain crystallizes. Friction between wants (warmth, escape) and costs (patience, pain, cold hope) is palpable. The final insight—"safety could remain, but its price could be renegotiated"—emerges from specific struggle. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Frostbitten hope" is embodied from the opening ("patience of glaciers," "radiators clicked like teeth") through the middle ("hum the radiators tried to translate, a frostbitten hope") to the ending ("hope could be cold and still be hope"). Tone modulates with pressure—colder during pain beats, warmer when the bellhop breathes the treble clef—and charges the final permission. Coherent across beats and ending; the tone itself becomes argument.</comment>
