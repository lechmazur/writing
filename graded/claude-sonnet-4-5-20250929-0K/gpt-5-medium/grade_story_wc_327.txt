<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The copper-veined storyteller maintains a consistent voice and perceptual filter—notice of texture, attention to echo-tunnel physics, calibration to bird-flight patterns—that shapes each tactical choice. Internal contradiction appears in the curse-fear versus task-commitment dynamic, and the sacrifice of the "travel-name" forecloses a path with visible cost. However, the interiority leans heavily on metaphor and abstraction ("throat it had once betrayed," "ringing cavity") rather than embodied sensation, and key emotional beats—offering the name, quieting the curse with dead names—are told in summary rather than dramatized with micro-choices that show hesitation or consequence unfolding.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure accrues through density of texture-translation attempts, deepening via listener-kites and bird choreography, and the closure—a school where texture learned to sing—reconfigures the canyon from archive to living pedagogue with conceptual cost (the narrator's travel-name and permanent residence). Orientation anchors arrive within the first two paragraphs (dusk, canyon, towers of bone, echo-tunnel). One meaningful deepening occurs when the protagonist shifts from solo translation to building distributed listeners and harnessing bird-flight, which widens the tunnel's capacity and enables the treaty recitation. The cost is legible: the name sacrifice and the permanent caretaker role. Minor causality softness: the birds "teaching" the kites and "pleased" echoes anthropomorphize without clear mechanics, and the leap from texture-as-grain to "choir" and "school" compresses multiple steps into summary.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The canyon's "notch where sound did not disperse but turned" and the bone towers function as micro-setting that constrains method—only the echo-tunnel can read the stone's braille, and the updrafts enable kite-listeners. Sensory detail is vivid and selective: "rasp like bark scraped by winter," "fuzz at the edge of every echo," "cold seams" at evening. The flawed diamond's "feathered fracture" and its warming pulse anchor tactile perception filtered through the narrator's task. Spatial choreography remains clear across cliff, ridge, tunnel, and updraft zones. The setting charges the final image by folding around the diamond and becoming a school; environment pressure and resource provision are sustained throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translate the dying language's textures before they wear smooth—is signaled early and drives all moves. One meaningful tightening: when the canyon resists law/war topics and birds scatter, the protagonist retreats and offers the travel-name as payment, narrowing options (no return to travel) and enabling the treaty flood. Agency is clear in the name-sacrifice and the choice to stay as caretaker, both forecloses paths with visible cost. The storm and drought beats extend the caretaker role but do not escalate pressure; they illustrate continuation rather than new reversals. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens but the escalation arc is gentle—each attempt adds density without a sharp tightening point until the name-offer, which arrives late and resolves quickly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—preservation through transformation, translation as reciprocal contract, endings as living recursion—emerges from the diamond's curse-contract, the texture-to-sound method, and the final school image without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the canyon becomes pedagogue, the language travels again via question-carrying, and the narrator's namelessness underwrites continuity. Subtext operates in the "curse is only a contract without punctuation" line and the choice to feed the curse only dead names. The recurring diamond, echo-tunnel, and bird choreography constrain choices and reweight at closure. Minor weakness: "endings need caretakers as much as beginnings do" edges toward overt thematic statement, though it remains character-voice rather than authorial intrusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable single first-person; distance control is consistent. The voice carries a distinct lyric-archival texture—"copper-veined," "quietly articulate," "grain, scar, and dust"—that reflects the narrator's role and perceptual priority. Diction remains within the focalizer's lexicon: specialized but not academic, metaphor-dense but not ornamental. No head-hopping. Elision is purposeful: the "travel-name" sacrifice's internal cost is compressed, but the ringing cavity image conveys loss. Minor slips: "the echo-tunnel again" assumes prior mention clarity that isn't fully earned, and some peak beats ("I offered my name… the curse took it") summarize rather than dramatize the micro-sensations of choice under pressure, softening immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence openings vary and rhythm modulates with task-phases (observation, climb, coaxing, testimony). Information density is high: most lines do two jobs (e.g., "Each turn of their bodies mapped a ridge, each dive pressed a pause" advances method and stakes). No overt loops or synonym churn. However, figurative density is constant—nearly every sentence carries a metaphor or elevated image—without pattern-teaching or payoff, which risks overwriting: "schooling," "stitched a grammar," "braid of notes," "frozen-time monologue" phrasing in "quietly articulate with apology." Template cadence appears in the storm/drought parallel beats ("When storms came… When drought stretched"), which recycle structure without added pressure. Filter verbs ("I felt," "I watched," "I could hear") cluster in high-pressure lines without voice-motivated justification. These artifacts touch the closure third, so 9+ is disallowed globally and high-band entries capped at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Core synthesis—echo-archaeology via bird-flight patterns and cursed-diamond resonance—is specific and non-obvious. The texture-to-sound translation premise transforms the "dying language" trope through the canyon-as-instrument and distributed-listener mechanics. The travel-name sacrifice and permanent-caretaker closure resist tidy resolution and commit fully to the contract metaphor's implications. Voice, subject, and style cohere as lyric ethnography. Risk-taking in the elliptical bird-teaching and echo-permissions heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Minor derivative notes: the "cursed object as key" and "language-preservation quest" are familiar frames, though the canyon-braille and kite-listener specifics elevate them. Within-band bonus (+0.3) for the sustained lyric compression and the non-sentimental ending.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The copper-veined storyteller drives all key turns: choosing the notch, aligning the fracture with bird-flight, building the kite-listeners, offering the travel-name, and staying as caretaker. Setup occurs in paragraph one. Development spans cliff-climb, listener-building, and name-offer. Closure participation is direct: the narrator becomes permanent tender, charging the final school image. Causal pressure is high—each choice narrows options (no return after name-loss) and enables the treaty. Cost is visible: namelessness and permanent residency. The "copper-veined" descriptor itself remains ornamental (−0.3), but the role drives beats and closure with irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The flawed diamond appears in setup (paragraph one), is pressed against the wall to feel the pulse (beat one), lowered into the tunnel aligned with bird-flight to enable texture-speech (beat two), warms as the curse remembers betrayal (beat three), is offered around by the canyon demanding voice-payment (beat four), set in a niche during storms to translate rain (beat five), and remains implicit in the drought and final school. Setup, development across four distinct beats, and closure linkage (niche placement sustains the school) are all present. Causal pressure: the fracture's alignment is the method unlock. Cost: the curse extraction. Specificity: "feathered fracture" and warming pulse are irreplaceable. Minor deduction (−0.4): the storm/drought uses are illustrative rather than escalatory.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The tunnel of echoes is introduced in paragraph five ("a notch in the cliff where sound did not disperse but turned"), constrains method (only it can read stone braille), is pressed with the diamond (beat one), widens via kite choreography (beat two), resists law/war topics forcing the name-offer (beat three), folds around the diamond to enable the treaty (beat four), and becomes the school's core mechanism in closure. Setup, development across four beats, and closure participation are clear. Causal pressure is extreme: without the tunnel, no translation; its resistance forces the name-sacrifice. Cost: the narrator's name. Irreplaceability: the tunnel's turning property and its animate "choosing" are unique. The tunnel is the story's engine.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Quietly articulate" is introduced in paragraph two as the valley's required register, returns in the retreat-apology moment ("quietly articulate with apology"), and implicitly governs the final school's question-carrying etiquette ("without bruising them"). Setup and closure participation are present. Causal constraint: loud speech would "bruise the air" and presumably fail, so quiet articulation enables access. Cost is implicit: the trait demands restraint under pressure. Development beat: the apology moment. However, the trait is more tonal filter than on-page tradeoff—no scene shows the narrator forced to choose quiet speech over a louder, faster alternative with visible consequence. Swappability is moderate; "careful" or "gentle" could substitute without deep structural change.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Harness" appears once explicitly ("ready to harness their choreography for listening") and implicitly in the kite-listener building and bird-teaching beats. Setup occurs at the ridge-climb. Development: the narrator watches bird patterns until "the wind stitched a grammar," then builds kites the birds teach to bank and wait, enabling the tunnel to widen. Closure: the flock returns to "curtail the escape of fugitive meanings." The action shapes two beats and contributes to closure. Causal role: without harnessing the birds, the tunnel remains narrow and the treaty does not arrive. Cost: time and attention diverted to bird-study. Minor deductions: the action is one extended sequence rather than multiple distinct uses (−0.3), and "harness" as verb is somewhat swappable with "use" or "channel" (−0.3).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Through the patterns in a flock of birds in flight" is signaled at the ridge-climb (paragraph eight), used to watch until wind/grammar appears (beat one), then the patterns teach the kite-listeners to bank and curtail (beat two), and return at closure to manage fugitive meanings. Setup, two development beats, and closure participation are present. Causal pressure: the bird-pattern method unlocks the tunnel's widening. Specificity: "each turn mapped a ridge, each dive pressed a pause" ties flight geometry to echo-grammar in irreplaceable detail. Cost: the narrator must climb and wait, diverting from direct translation. The method shapes attempts and the final school's operation. Minor deduction (−0.3): the birds' teaching mechanics remain metaphoric rather than physically grounded.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Towers of bone in a canyon of endless echoes frame the entire story (setup paragraph one), supply the echo-tunnel resource (development beat one), the updrafts for kite-listeners (beat two), the stone ribs that pulse with syllables (beat three), and house the final school where texture learns to sing (closure). The setting is omnipresent and causally indispensable: no canyon, no echoes, no tunnel, no translation, no school. Spatial choreography is clear (cliff, notch, ridge, updrafts, bone towers). The setting pressures every choice and charges the final image. Irreplaceability is absolute; generic "valley" or "gorge" would not supply bone towers or endless echoes. The setting is the story's container and co-agent.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Across the death of a language" is stated in paragraph three as the timeframe and governing urgency. The "wear as a fuzz at the edge of every echo" and "my time was narrow" establish live pressure. Development: the narrator's urgency drives the kite-building and name-offer. Closure: the language "learned to travel again," suggesting the death was arrested or transformed. Setup, development pressure, and closure reversal are present. However, the timeframe's mechanics are vague—no specific countdown, no escalating symptom that forces faster moves. The "death" functions more as thematic frame than tactical clock. The wear is described but not dramatized as a closing window that alters a concrete choice. Swappability: "before the elders forget" or "before the valley is abandoned" could replace without deep structural change.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"To translate texture into sound" is introduced in paragraph three, drives every beat (pressing the diamond, watching birds, building listeners, coaxing the tunnel, gathering notes), and defines the closure outcome (texture learns to sing). Setup, development across six beats, and closure participation are clear. Causal pressure: the motivation generates all tactics. Internal friction: the task demands the name-sacrifice and permanent residency, forfeiting travel freedom. Cost is visible: namelessness and caretaker role. Specificity: "texture into sound" is irreplaceable shorthand for the canyon-braille translation. The motivation is the story's spine. Minor deduction (−0.2): the desire is told rather than shown in a scene of refusal or temptation that tests commitment.</comment>
