<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation ("the tyranny of indifference") is declared rather than embodied through contradictory impulses in scene. Interiority leans heavily on metaphorical abstraction ("folding risk into routine like a note into worn denim") rather than character-particular thought under pressure. The final action feels more symbolic than earned by prior micro-choices showing internal conflict. The museum guard detail and her self-description ("late, hungry, and useful") offer texture, but agency remains largely unopposed and the cost of her act is asserted, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens with lyric patterning, and the final image attempts Resonant Reconfiguration through Charged Poise ("the hinge, the turn, the steady hum"). However, the Orientation Test fails: who, where, and when remain vague past the 120-word threshold, with "the night," "a quiet clerk," and "the museum" offering insufficient spatial and temporal anchors. The closure unit—voices returning to the lagoon and captions beginning to "sweat"—implies cost but does not show a visible forfeiture or alteration of Mara's options on the page. Escalation is more atmospheric accumulation than a tightening of stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The auric lagoon, maintenance box, and puddle-map provide vivid sensory anchors ("smelled of penny metal and rain on paper," "furred with grass and old wire") and the setting constrains Mara's route and actions across multiple beats. Spatial choreography is mostly clear (tram yard → slope → lagoon), though the museum's physical relation to the lagoon remains abstract. The phone booth key and "singing hinge" box function as micro-setting elements that charge the final sequence, meeting the 9+ gate's requirement that setting constrain choice or charge the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring deleted voices to the museum—is signaled early and pursued consistently. However, escalation under the accumulative lens relies on atmospheric intensification (moths thickening, police siren wheeling) rather than a meaningful on-page tightening that narrows Mara's options or raises cost. The reversal (captions beginning to "sweat," voices returning) is asserted as future consequence rather than dramatized with immediate, visible price. Mara faces no on-page resistance or tactical dilemma; the process unfolds without friction, limiting pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the lagoon-as-memory motif and the tension between revised histories and lived voices, avoiding overt moralizing until the final paragraphs. The mother's voice rising from the water and the line "the world keeps the shape of what it resists" lean toward thematic echo but remain integrated into the magical-realist frame. The closing image—"the hinge, the turn, the steady hum"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the tyranny of indifference. Minor slips: "coded freedom" and "that, finally, was enough to let her reappear in herself" edge toward prompt-speak in tone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited with a consistent lyric register ("a wind played notes nobody could hear but her"). However, perceptual signature is more writerly than character-particular: Mara's way of noticing reads as authorial rather than shaped by her clerk background or resourcefulness. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("the tyranny of indifference," "the grammar of coded freedom") that feels imposed rather than voice-motivated. The piece teaches its lyric compression early and maintains legibility, but the narrator's certainty about off-page events (captions "would now begin to sweat," "tomorrow the committee would announce") violates POV modesty.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The prose carries a consistent lyric texture with vivid figurative language ("puddles...threw back a sly sky," "moths...spelled...the stubborn grammar"). However, metaphor density in high-pressure beats approaches oversaturation without pattern-teaching payoff, and several vehicles mix or contradict ("islands resurfacing after a tide cruelly withdrawn" blurs agency). Template cadence appears in the final third: multiple sentences beginning with declarative subject-verb pairs ("She would not be," "And if the guard," "That would be true") create rhythmic monotony. Paraphrase loops occur ("carefully resourceful" restated as "folding risk into routine"), and the closure beat's figurative pile-up ("the hinge, the turn, the steady hum") dilutes rather than sharpens the final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of water-as-memory, defunct infrastructure, and coded resistance offers a specific angle on archival erasure and quiet rebellion. The phone booth key, puddle-map, and singing hinge are particular enough to feel invented rather than template-derived. However, the core premise—lone rebel restores erased histories through hidden technology—maps closely to widely used "covert archivist" tropes without decisive transformation; the magical-realist frame and lyric diction elevate texture but do not fundamentally reconfigure the emotional or moral calculus. The piece takes stylistic risk with its compression and metaphor density, though this occasionally obscures rather than heightens clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara is seeded in the opening line as "underestimated rebel" and her decision to act ("decided to hold the line") launches the middle sequence. Her choices—walking to the lagoon, using the key, speaking the names—drive beats across setup, development, and closure. However, she faces no meaningful resistance or internal friction; the arc reads as enacted plan rather than choices under pressure that narrow options. The "underestimated" trait charges the guard interaction and the final self-description ("the hinge, the turn") but agency is more symbolic than causal.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The phone booth key appears early (archives flashback), is handled at the maintenance box in the climactic beat, and its use ("fit the key, and waited as lights...began to reappear") enables the core reversal. It bridges Mara's mother's hidden program and the present act, carrying specific history (defunct phone company, brass gone dull). The key's reweighted meaning—"a stitch poised to draw two torn edges together"—signals thematic charge. However, its physical properties do not constrain Mara's choices; any keyed access could serve the same function, limiting irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Revised histories frame the inciting incident (museum exhibit, deleted mother's voice), shape Mara's goal (return voices), and charge the ending (captions "would now begin to sweat," "revised histories stood beside the true ones"). The concept drives tactics: Mara uses hidden circuits to inject suppressed records. It appears across setup (museum announcement), development (speaking deleted names), and closure (captions rewriting), meeting all three gates. The cost—challenging institutional narrative—is conceptual and social, legible in the image of "cases that claimed to be the end of the story" being rewritten.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Carefully resourceful" is declared early and restated as "folding risk into routine," but on-page demonstration is thin. Mara's actions (following puddles, fitting a key, speaking names) do not require or showcase resourcefulness; no improvisation under constraint or visible tradeoff appears. The trait is asserted rather than tested. It touches setup and nominally development but does not constrain choices or generate cost, remaining ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Reappear" anchors the closure image ("let her reappear in herself") and echoes earlier: voices "reappearing" in captions, names lifting "like birds startled from reeds," islands "resurfacing." The action is thematic and metaphorical rather than a physical event, but it redefines the dominant stake from deletion to restoration. It participates in setup (museum deletion), development (speaking names that lift and return), and closure (self-restoration, "reappear"). However, the mechanics are abstract; swapping "reappear" for "return" or "restore" would require only minor edits, limiting irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The puddle-map is signaled early ("studied each puddle until it suggested a river of mirrored streetlights, a glowing thread") and guides Mara's route to the lagoon, shaping one middle beat. However, its mechanics are vague—no cost, decoding effort, or wrong turn tests its use—and it does not reappear or charge the closure. It serves functional transit rather than constraining tactical choices. Present in setup and development but absent from payoff.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The auric lagoon anchors the climactic sequence (key-turn, voice-rising, program activation) and supplies the maintenance box resource. Its properties—"water was not gold, but seemed to remember gold," ripples that "wrote back in letters"—are specific and irreplaceable, enabling the magical-realist reversal. The setting charges the final image: "at the auric lagoon under starlight, Mara felt the line hold." It appears across all three gates (announced early, used mid-story, shapes closure) and its sensory signature (penny metal, rain on paper) constrains Mara's tactics (she must reach this exact site). The lagoon's memory-holding function is essential to the plot's logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"When plans unravel" is declared but not dramatized; no on-page plan fails or forces Mara to adapt tactics. Time of day (dusk, then night) provides atmospheric progression but does not tighten decisions. The phrase appears in one line ("Now, when plans unravel, the forgotten key felt like a stitch") without causal follow-through. Setup only; no development or closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"To hold the line against the tyranny of indifference" is stated mid-story and directly motivates Mara's goal (restore voices). It frames the inciting incident (museum's erasure as indifference) and charges the ending ("felt the line hold"). However, the motivation is declared rather than dramatized through internal friction or competing wants. No on-page scene shows Mara weighing cost against desire. Present across setup (caption sting), development (decision to act), and closure (line holding), but the friction between want and cost is told, not shown.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Coded freedom" appears explicitly late ("coded, which is to say free") and implicitly throughout: hidden program, speaking in "syllables that sounded like static," Mara's answer to the hypothetical guard question. Tone is consistent—layered, elliptical, resistant to exposition—and modulates with pressure (lyric compression tightens at the lagoon). The final image ("coded...free") reweights prior secrecy as liberation. However, the phrase itself is abstract and the tone's coherence is more stylistic than charged by stakes. Present in closure and nominally in development, but late explicit naming and conceptual rather than felt charge limit integration.</comment>
