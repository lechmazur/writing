<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The recluse's interiority is embodied through concrete rituals (the glass box, daily placement of shards) and his perceptual signature is consistent—reading ghosts "through contextual clues" and answering with "pauses and careful placement." The shift from broker to witness is earned through specific memory (pesticide clauses, the signature he wore) that charges his final stance. Internal contradiction appears when he recognizes the queen as "the burning that spared him once" and opens the box despite knowing heat's cost, creating genuine tension. Minor deduction: the ghosts' collective presence could have applied more individuated pressure on his choices rather than serving primarily as mute audience.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. The piece teaches its lyric-accumulative pattern early (shimmering ghosts, daily ritual, archive logic) and sustains it through deepening—each object placed in the box reweights the covenant until the queen's arrival forces a reckoning. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid): opening the hidden panel and marking the hexagon crystallizes his role as custodian with conceptual cost legible in "the archive accepted the burden without smoldering." Orientation anchors (recluse, apiary wasteland, post-catastrophe) arrive within the first 100 words. One meaningful tightening occurs when the queen gestures to the box asking "if its archive could hold heat"—the question narrows his options from passive witness to active participant who must answer for his complicity. Cost is visible: the tolerable bee stings that "thread the present to the archive" and the hexagon sigil that commits him to indefinite custodianship.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The wasteland setting (burnt hives, wind-chiseled troughs, smoke-bruised horizon) pressures every choice—scarcity of bees makes each return delirious and sacred, the hut's noon-shade position governs the ritual's timing. The stained glass box functions as micro-setting: its warmth ("a softened memory of flame"), hidden panel, and light-spilling properties constrain the final act when he must decide whether it can hold heat. Spatial choreography is clean: lectern with skeletal comb frame, paths mapped by colored light on dust, ghosts queuing along those paths. The narrow stripe of blue the queen leaves behind becomes a road "for anyone who needed to approach without words," charging the final image with environmental consequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: whether the recluse can witness loss without being consumed by complicity. The covenant ("he promised to witness, and the ghosts promised not to drown him") establishes the terms early. Escalation occurs through accumulative pressure: daily preservation rituals deepen until the queen's arrival forces a shift from passive archive to active acceptance of heat/complicity. The turn at "He had accepted survival as witness, but he had not yet answered for it" narrows options—he must either refuse the queen (breaking the covenant) or accept the burden of holding fire (visible cost: bee stings, indefinite custodianship, marking the hexagon). Agency is clear: sliding the lid open, placing the frame within color, marking the sigil are all protagonist-driven choices that foreclose the path of detached observation. Cost is legible: pain threading present to archive, the kiln metaphor, "the archive accepted the burden without smoldering."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: unspoken words evaporate like dew, so the box "mosaics silence into fragments of concentrated daybreak." The covenant motif deepens from simple witness-pact to complicity reckoning when he remembers "the underwritten pesticides, the clause he refused to question." The hexagon sigil—"keep what cannot be said until language grows gentler around it"—offers a non-literal answer to the central question (how to bear witness without being drowned by grief or absolved of complicity) without moralizing. The final image ("waited for footsteps that might come") and the closing line ("until language returned with pollen on its mouth") reweight the entire arc: the archive is not cure but rehearsal, custodianship rather than redemption. No thematic echo or sermon; the piece trusts image and action to carry meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with tight psychic distance anchored to the recluse's perceptual signature: "tranquilly perceptive," filtering the world through archive logic and contractual memory. Diction matches his evolution from broker ("parsing clauses until meaning tasted metallic") to custodian ("mute eloquence was their dialect"). Voice modulates appropriately under pressure—syntax compresses when the queen arrives ("Her crown was a twisted veil of smoke") and expands in reflective beats. Minor deduction: occasional filter-verb stacks ("He could almost hear," "He understood, through contextual clues") dull immediacy in peak moments, and the phrase "astonished had become his only arrogance" edges toward over-articulation. No dialogue present; no head-hopping. Perceptual specificity is high: ash swirls, shadow angles, hovered hush all reveal ghost intentions through his professional habit of reading contextual clues.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong information density and purposeful figuration: "colors spilled from the glass and mapped pilgrim paths on dust" does triple work (setting, motif, ghost movement). Rhythm modulates well—lyric expansion in ritual beats, compression at the queen's arrival. Deductions: paraphrase loop between "He never touched their translucent hands, but each day he felt less alone" and the earlier "gathered, not to speak, but to gaze"; template cadence in consecutive "He [verb]" stems across several paragraphs (carried, placed, kept, read, met); filter-verb cluster in final third ("He understood, through contextual clues," "He could almost hear") that slightly dulls immediacy. The figurative load is high but mostly coherent and voice-motivated, though "pain threaded the present to the archive, knitting a path" mixes metaphors (thread vs. knit). No loops obscure closure; the hexagon sigil and blue stripe land cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of post-apocalyptic reckoning, archival custodianship, and contractual guilt is specific and non-obvious—the broker-turned-witness who must hold heat rather than achieve redemption. The stained glass box as both reliquary and kiln, preserving silence until "language grows gentler," transforms the trope of magical object into a tool of moral endurance. The hexagon sigil (beehive geometry meets reprieve) and the queen's question ("can its archive hold heat?") feel inevitable in hindsight, rooted in apiary imagery and complicity logic established early. Risk: the lyric-heavy texture and mute-eloquence conceit could flatten into atmosphere, but the piece grounds abstractions in physical action (placing scraps, tolerable stings, charcoal marking) and earns its quiet ending through accumulative pressure. The transformation test passes: swap out bees/hives/contracts and the emotional/thematic arc collapses.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Present early ("astonished recluse"), drives multiple beats: daily ritual, meeting the queen's gaze, opening the hidden panel, marking the hexagon. "Astonished had become his only arrogance, tender and deliberate" constrains his stance—he cannot flee or refuse, only witness with care. His choice to open the box fully and accept heat is causally rooted in astonishment at survival; without this trait the covenant would break differently.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Central prop across beats: opened daily, holds scraps, "brightens" silence, asked by queen if it can hold heat, warmth rises from lid, hidden panel revealed, colors flood at climax, hexagon marked inside. Irreplaceable: its stained glass properties (color-spilling, mosaic logic) and hidden compartment shape the closure action. Removal would collapse the archive mechanism and final image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The "tangled covenant" (witness/not-drown pact) is established early, pressures every choice, and is renegotiated when the queen arrives as "the covenant's other party." The recluse's recognition that he "had not yet answered for it" reframes the covenant from passive witness to active custodian. The hexagon sigil and archive-as-kiln imagery literalize the covenant's terms with cost. Drives escalation and closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Tranquilly perceptive" appears early and enables his reading of ghosts through ash swirls, shadow angles, hush—contextual clues become his dialect. The trait constrains impulsive action (he answers with "pauses and careful placement") and enables the final recognition of the queen and the decision to mark the sigil. Visible twice in beat work; shapes tactics; somewhat swappable with "patient observer" but the tranquility/astonishment pairing adds specificity.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Gaze" recurs across beats: ghosts gather to gaze, he meets the queen's gaze (recognition pivot), he keeps "his gaze answering their hush" in the covenant's continuation. The act of witnessing-as-gaze defines his role and the final stance ("waited for footsteps"). Swappable with "witness" in some lines but the mutual gaze (recluse/ghosts/queen) creates the relational pressure. Strong closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Through contextual clues" is signaled early ("He read them through contextual clues: the way ash swirled, the angle of shadow, the hovered hush") and becomes his epistemic method throughout. He understands the queen's need and the ghosts' consensus this way; his broker training in parsing contracts mutates into reading silence. The method shapes every interaction and the final understanding. Irreplaceable: no other means of ghost communication is offered.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The abandoned beekeeping oasis supplies the skeletal comb lectern, the burnt hives and troughs as physical anchors, and the apiary logic that makes bees' delirious returns and the queen's arrival resonant. The setting's post-catastrophe scarcity pressures the archive's purpose (preserving what would evaporate). The wasteland's permanence ("smoke colored the horizon a permanent bruise") enforces the recluse's isolation and makes the blue stripe road significant. Present in closure when "the wasteland seemed less scorched."</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"After ghosts became visible" establishes the timeframe and the world-rule that enables the plot. The daily noon ritual and the queen's "one afternoon" arrival mark time loosely but sufficiently. The timeframe allows the covenant and archive to exist but does not tighten decisions tactically—no countdown or urgency escalation. Functional setup; moderate closure presence ("Each dawn... each dusk"); somewhat replaceable with any post-catastrophe marker.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The motivation to "preserve the weight of unspoken words, which otherwise evaporated like dew" is dramatized through daily scrap placement, the box's function, and the final act of marking the hexagon ("keep what cannot be said until language grows gentler"). Conflicted when he must decide if the archive can hold heat—preservation risks becoming complicity-holder. Cost is visible: indefinite custodianship, bee stings, the burden "without smoldering." Drives escalation and closure; irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Mute eloquence" as tone is coherent across all beats—ghosts speak through gesture and hush, the recluse answers with pauses and placement, the queen's charred frame gesture replaces speech, the hexagon sigil substitutes for words. Tone modulates appropriately: compression at the queen's arrival, lyric expansion in ritual passages. The final image (blue stripe road, waiting for footsteps, language returning "with pollen on its mouth") charges the closure by sustaining and transforming the silence-into-meaning motif. Indispensable to voice and concept.</comment>
