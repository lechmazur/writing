<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The poet's "warmly attentive" stance drives his approach to the boy, and the shift from solitary observation to active tending is earned. However, the interiority remains abstract—phrases like "to discover beauty in the incomplete" and "woven dawns are hues braided from mistakes" read as thematic declarations rather than embodied thought under pressure. The boy's grief is more successfully rendered through the image of "wind inside him" and his stunned tracking of the kite, grounding loss in physical sensation. Micro-choices (offering the feather, kneeling to write) advance the interaction, but the poet's internal contradictions or personal cost never surface.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the poet's philosophy of tending incompleteness is seeded early, tested when the boy loses his kite, and deepened through the ritual of writing and raft-building. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the boy runs to his mother "spool light in his palm, ribbonless yet tethered to a new listening," crystallizing his shift from loss to attentive presence. The cost is oblique—he does not recover the kite, and the poet's final line "lets the ink say less than silence can" signals renunciation of complete articulation. One meaningful deepening (the boy's chest evens, birds resume) is sufficient for this length, and the lens holds without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The cobalt lagoon after rain is anchored early and recurs with evolving charge: initial hush, the boy's grief breaking the surface "like a pebble skimming once too far," the raft floating toward the vanished kite, and the lagoon darkening "to cobalt again as clouds reknit" at closure. The feather and raft function as micro-setting—physical tools that constrain the poet's ritual and the boy's participation. Sensory selection reflects urgency: the kite's "crimson diamond leaping beyond reach" sharpens loss, while "puddled sand" and "shore stones" ground the writing act. Spatial choreography remains clear across the poet's movements (rising, kneeling, floating the raft), satisfying the 9+ gate for environment charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—helping the boy process loss—is signaled when the kite string snaps and intensifies through the poet's interventions: composing aloud, offering the feather, co-creating the raft. One clear tightening occurs when the boy asks "Is it fixed" and the poet's answer ("the song is richer in the torn places") forecloses easy repair, accepting incompleteness as the resolution. The cost is visible: the kite remains lost, and the boy must carry "a new listening" rather than recovered joy. Agency belongs to the poet's choices (rising, offering, tending), and the boy's participation (drawing loops, embodying the lesson) earns the shift in his breath and stance. Under the Accumulative lens, this single deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme—beauty and healing emerge from incompleteness—arises from concrete action (writing with the feather, tying ribbon to it, floating the raft) rather than abstraction alone. However, phrases like "woven dawns are hues braided from mistakes" and "discord becomes a harbor" veer toward overt thematic statement. The final image of the kite "still writing the long sentence of sky" offers a resonant, non-literal answer, reweighting the loss as ongoing composition. The poet's line "lets the ink say less than silence can" avoids didacticism at the very end, but earlier passages risk sermonizing ("we will tend the torn...by giving it neighbors that hear its key"). The piece invites reflection, yet occasionally telegraphs its thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV remains stable in third-person limited on the poet, with perceptual specificity ("reeds breathe in a burnished hush," "a quill that remembers rain") establishing a lyric register. The poet's diction is elevated but consistent, matching his vocation and temperament. Dialogue is sparse and purposeful: "What have you lost" functions as invitation rather than interrogation, and "Look how it still writes with your line" reframes loss through the poet's lens. However, some lines ("to write what the wind is saying to the gap under your ribs") edge toward self-conscious poeticism that risks distancing the reader. Psychic distance remains controlled, and no head-hopping occurs.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout—nearly every sentence carries metaphor or elevated diction ("lacquered leaves," "a bright fish of air," "tide math")—creating cumulative lushness that occasionally slows momentum. In peak beats (the boy's grief, the raft's floating), the language remains purposeful, but phrases like "the small raft meant only to carry attention" and "giving it neighbors that hear its key" tip toward overwriting without pattern-teaching. No paraphrase loops or template cadence appear, and sentence structures vary. Proofreading is clean. The ornamental load in non-peak beats (e.g., "a bell, rung to draw the grief into the open air") applies modest line-level drag; the closure beat ("lets the ink say less than silence can") remains sharp.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The combination of poet-as-healer, lost kite, and ritual object (drake's feather repurposed with ribbon) offers a specific synthesis rather than a template premise. The woven-dawns concept and the raft as "carrying a whisper not to fetch it back, but to meet it halfway" provide fresh inflections on grief and acceptance. However, the shoreline-philosopher archetype and the teaching-through-metaphor structure feel familiar; the piece transforms them through sensory specificity (cobalt lagoon, burnished hush) and the feather's evolution from writing tool to shared talisman. Risk-taking in the lyric register and quiet closure heightens coherence without obscuring stakes, warranting a within-band lift of +0.3.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The poet is present from the opening and drives all key decisions: rising to approach the boy, offering the feather, composing aloud, kneeling to write, building the raft, and answering "Is it fixed" with the thematic renunciation. His choices narrow options (no mechanical repair) and enable the boy's shift. Early signal, three distinct beats (approach, writing, raft), closure linkage (final line with the feather), and causal pressure all present. The poet's philosophy shapes tactics throughout, and the cost (accepting incompleteness) is legible.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The drake's tail feather appears in paragraph 3 (early signal), is used to write "woven dawns" in paragraph 20, tied with the kite ribbon in paragraph 23, offered to the boy in paragraph 24, and employed in the final writing act (paragraph 35). Across five beats it evolves from personal tool to shared ritual object, its "glossy vanes" and "spine dark" providing irreplaceable texture. Causal pressure: the feather enables the writing ritual that steadies the boy, and its repurposing with ribbon creates the collaborative gesture. Closure linkage: the poet writes the final line with it, making it indispensable to the ending's charge.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Woven dawns" is introduced in paragraph 4 as the poet's phrase for "hues braided from mistakes" and returns when he writes the term in sand (paragraph 20), then explains it (paragraph 21). It frames the thematic stake—finding coherence in discord—but functions more as a conceptual label than a tactical constraint. The term shapes one middle choice (writing it to steady the boy) and charges the lyric reprise, satisfying two gates (setup, development). However, it does not pressure the ending beat directly; the feather, raft, and kite do that work. Lyric-resonance allowance applies, lifting the score into mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Warmly attentive" is stated in paragraph 6, enacted when the poet "bends to tend a torn lily pad" (paragraph 6), rises to help the boy (paragraph 12), kneels to write with him (paragraph 20), and gathers reeds for the raft (paragraph 27). The trait enables on-page actions across four beats and constrains his method—he does not scold or fix, but tends. Early signal, beat involvement, and causal link to the boy's calming are present. The cost is opportunity: the poet's time and ritual are spent on another's grief. Specificity (kneeling, gathering, floating) grounds the attribute in embodied gesture.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Tend" is seeded early ("warmly attentive to every stray glint, bending to tend a torn lily pad," paragraph 6), motivates the poet's approach ("He has tended mornings like this," paragraph 13), structures the writing ritual ("to steady the trembling air," paragraph 20), and culminates in the explicit framing: "We will tend the torn" (paragraph 31). The action drives three major beats (approach, co-writing, raft-building) and defines the resolution strategy—accept and accompany loss rather than repair it. Causal pressure: tending forecloses forceful intervention and enables the boy's shift. Closure linkage: the poet returns "to look for new incompletions" (paragraph 35), cementing tend as the story's spine.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Harmonizing discord" is introduced in paragraph 5 ("the frays and stutters find a braid by harmonizing discord") and restated in paragraph 31 ("giving it neighbors that hear its key"). The method is signaled early but remains abstract; the story dramatizes it through the writing loops and raft rather than naming the mechanics. One middle beat (co-writing the loops) enacts the principle, and the closure image (kite, raft, boy's listening) implies harmony without explicitly invoking the term. Two gates (setup, development) are met, but the method does not constrain a distinct choice—it describes an outcome. Mid-5s for thematic presence without tactical necessity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The cobalt lagoon appears in the opening line, supplies the post-rain setting that charges the hush, and returns at closure ("darkens to cobalt again as clouds reknit"). The shore provides the sand for writing (paragraph 20) and stones that clatter against the raft (paragraph 29), grounding the ritual in physical resources. The water enables the raft's floating (paragraph 28), a tactical choice that meets the lost kite "halfway." Early signal, two functional beats (writing surface, raft medium), and closure charge satisfy three gates. The setting constrains method (must write in sand, must float on water) and pressures the ending image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The kite string snaps in paragraph 9, triggering the poet's intervention and anchoring the story's present action. The phrase "as a kite string snaps" frames the inciting incident, and all subsequent beats (the boy's grief, the poet's approach, the writing, the raft) unfold in the continuous aftermath. The timeframe tightens decisions: the poet must act before the boy's distress escalates, and the raft floats "toward where the kite dwindles" (paragraph 28), marking temporal progression. Early signal, causal trigger, and continuous pressure across all beats satisfy three gates. The snap is irreplaceable—no other moment could serve as the hinge.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"To discover beauty in the incomplete" is stated in paragraph 2, enacted when the poet attends to "a torn lily pad" (paragraph 6), and tested when he helps the boy accept the lost kite. The motivation drives the approach (paragraph 12) and structures the ritual (paragraphs 20–31), but it is articulated more than dramatized. One visible cost: the poet spends solitary time on the boy's need, forgoing his own observation. The friction between the boy's want (recovery) and the poet's philosophy (acceptance) creates one beat of tension (paragraph 30, "Is it fixed"). Early signal, one middle conflict, and thematic closure linkage satisfy two gates, with lyric reprise lifting the score.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Burnished hush" appears in the opening line, recurs when the kite-snap "breaks the surface of the hush" (paragraph 9), and returns at closure ("everything returns to a burnished hush that has learned their names," paragraph 32). The tone modulates coherently: quiet opening, disruption (the boy's shout, gulls' quarrel), steadying through ritual, and final restoration charged with new knowledge. The hush is not static—it "learns," integrating the boy's grief. Early signal, purposeful modulation under pressure, and closure charge satisfy three gates. The tone constrains diction (no shouts in narration, elevated register matches the hush) and makes the ending's return resonant.</comment>
