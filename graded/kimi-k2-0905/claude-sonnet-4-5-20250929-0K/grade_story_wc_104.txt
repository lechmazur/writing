<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is concrete and character-specific; her patient decoding of the piano-bench keys shows contradictory impulses (escape vs. stewardship) under pressure. Every micro-choice—arranging keys by weight, selecting seeds, digging in cracked soil—reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The ending’s renunciation of immediate freedom for long-term resilience is earned by prior causality and forecloses a path with felt cost. No safety-hedging; her moral ambiguity (terrorist to planter) stays unresolved yet charged.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because she decoded the bench, therefore she locates the arrow; because the wall falls, therefore she slips away. One meaningful tightening—decoding the keys—narrows options and triggers the decisive change. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final image of her kneeling to plant seeds reweights freedom into stewardship with undeniable conceptual cost. Minor dip: the arrow’s evidentiary power is declared more than dramatized, so cost is felt but not maximal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The abandoned carnival is rendered through tactile, POV-filtered detail—rusted bench, rotting plush, crooked prize wheel—each item constraining her search path. Moonlight as single source keeps spatial choreography legible; objects are handled, not catalogued. The cracked soil beyond the wall mirrors her internal split between flight and rootedness. Setting charges the final image: the dry earth is the unavoidable recipient of her seeds, making environment a participant in closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—liberate truth and living seed—signals early and escalates as each decoded key forecloses wrong paths. Agency drives every turn: decoding, freeing herself, choosing planting over celebration. Visible price: she swaps immediate safety for exposure while planting in exposed wasteland. Escalation is coherent but single-cycle; no secondary reversal, yet the final planting deepens the cost under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: resilience through biodiversity vs. engineered scarcity. The arrow’s fletching of banned crop pages reweights “terrorist” to archivist-of-life. Final image reframes liberation not as wall-fall euphoria but as quiet return to scorched ground—an earned, non-moralizing answer. No thematic echo or overt thesis; meaning grows from concrete seed, soil, and silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person POV stays tight interior with consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is patient, tactile, agri-science literate—“chromatic sequence,” “drought-resistant strains.” Syntax lengthens during reflection, shortens during escape, mirroring breath. No dialogue to judge; narration avoids filter verbs, maintains vivid diction within plausible lexicon. Voice modulates but never fractures under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence length contracts in high-tempo window exit, lengthens in reflective planting. No loops or scaffold; information density high—“keys arranged by piano octaves” does world, character, and plot work in one phrase. Metaphors stay physically coherent: seeds splitting concrete, roots in impossible places. Only minor over-writing: “staggering grace” appears twice; second use feels self-conscious, not earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: piano-bench cipher + agrarian espionage + carnival ruin. Arrow fletched from banned botanical texts is specific, memorable, non-obvious. Risk of quiet ending in a celebratory wall-fall moment is taken and pays off by reconfiguring freedom as stewardship. Transformation test fails: replacing seeds with any other MacGuffin weakens core; agricultural specificity is integral.</comment>
