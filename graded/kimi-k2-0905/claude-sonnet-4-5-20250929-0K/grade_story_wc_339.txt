<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Elena’s interiority—cool, taxonomic, ever-calculating—remains concrete and particular; her habitual cataloguing of disaster (“She turned it slowly, quietly analytic…”) shows a lived-in worldview rather than a label. The contradictory pull between her forensic impulse and the dawning recognition that some absences must stay intact is dramatized in the final gesture of returning the globe. Micro-choices (photographing, writing, then relinquishing) externalize the hierarchy of values with visible cost: she surrenders the artifact and the hope of exhaustive knowledge. The sister-backstory is brief but anchored to present stimuli (the snow-globe memory triggers the notebook admission), so the reflection exception is met; still, the renunciation’s causal build-up is slightly under-powered, keeping this just shy of the 9-band.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/textural lens: each underwater detail layers density until the stake—mastery versus mystery—reweights. Orientation is fixed by word 30; the single shard (library → radio room) is cleanly bridged by motion through stacks. Closure is a Charged Poise: Elena sets the globe back, crystallizing her refusal to keep solving, and the cost is palpable (“Some small planes should remain forever in flight”). No prop or fact appears without later echo (globe, journal, notebook form a triad of “last transmissions”). The decision forecloses her prior career logic without softening the unknown; the lens holds without wobble.</comment>

<comment>The drowned library is sketched through functional specificity—mahogany shelves swaying, brass telegraph blooming verdigris—each detail pulling double duty as atmosphere and constraint. POV-filter governs notice: only a professional recovery specialist would clock “equilibrium with the ocean around it” in a snow globe. Spatial choreography is immaculate; bodies and objects track as Elena floats aft. The final image (skylight now an aquarium) recharges the setting with conceptual cost, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—will she extract meaning or leave mystery intact—tightens when the intact globe offers a “solve” (salvage, analysis, publication) versus the passenger’s mute journal. Agency: photographing, note-taking, then the deliberate relinquishment progressively foreclose options. Cost is visible: she abandons a potential career-defining exhibit and surrenders the proxy for her sister’s memory. Escalation is textural rather than causal-reversal, adequate under Accumulative lens, but the final beat could carry sharper visceral price (no immediate external consequence is shown).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question>
<comment>Theme—knowledge as diminishment—emerges through the globe-journal-notebook triad rather than assertion. Subtext accrues in silences: the skeletal librarian keeps its last secret, the salvaged journal stays unread. The ending image reroutes the opening mystery into acceptance without moralizing. A trace of abstract phrasing (“physics of letting go”) risks thematic echo, but is embedded in Elena's scientific idiom and immediately counter-weighted by tactile choice.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited maintains disciplined psychic distance; perceptual signature is crisp and discipline-coded (“quietly analytic,” “internal liquid had achieved equilibrium”). Syntax lengthens under contemplation, fragments under pressure, mirroring buoyancy. No dialogue, so voice contamination avenues are sealed. Diction stays within Elena's educated lexicon; the one elevated phrase “cathedral of loss” is earned by cumulative religious imagery and closure need.</comment>

<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Varied sentence rhythms mimic drift vs. sudden catch of light; paragraphs shrink as decisions near. Figurative language is selective and purposeful, no mixed metaphors. Minor scaffold: “some mysteries… deserved to stay buried / Some small planes should remain forever in flight” is a deliberate parallelism that pays off the title image. Information density high; each line advances character or atmosphere. No loops or artifactual synonym churn; proofing is clean.</comment>

<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fusing Amelia Earhart, Titanic-level luxury liner, and snow-globe pathos could feel gimmicky, yet all are re-visioned through Elena's anti-heroic stance: discovery as emotional subtraction. The sunken library is a fresh stage that justifies its own physics and delivers an inevitable final image. Risk—refusing to deliver a triumphant salvage—heightens thematic coherence. Specificity (brass verdigris as “underwater flowers”) prevents the concept from drifting into allegory.</comment>
