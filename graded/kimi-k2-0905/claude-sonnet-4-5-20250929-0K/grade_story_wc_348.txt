<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Maya’s grief is embodied (hands frozen on the urn, humming Leah’s melody), but interiority slips into label-speak—“grief had loosened something in her understanding” is diagnostic rather than sensed. The decisive micro-choice—splitting the ashes into five currents—pays off, yet the preceding self-recrimination is summarized, not dramatized, so the shift from paralysis to action feels telescoped. Flaw persists: competence (polymer expertise) is asserted but never allowed to complicate or fail under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Closure is clean and legible: Decisive Change via the five-fold dispersal + humming reprise produces a Resonant Reconfiguration—grief becomes “something she could live within.” Causal chain holds: foam observation → insight → ritual invention. However, orientation waiver applies: ravine geography (“braided” / “five channels”) is not anchored until ~160 words, and the disorientation is never leveraged at closure, so −0.4 is locked. Cost is felt but not persistent; no constraint carries beyond the scene.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered: foam spirals read as “memory of turbulent birth,” chrysalis is “ghost of metamorphosis.” Ravine functions as micro-setting that literally channels the ritual; the five-branch topology constrains the ash-splitting decision. Weather and scale are economical; no exposition dumps. Meets 9+ gate: setting topography charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will she scatter or hoard the ashes—signals early; pressure tightens when foam insight narrows her options to the multi-path ritual. Agency is present: her physical act disperses the ashes and forecloses avoidance. Cost is visible (empty urn, chrysalis relic) but not persistent; no future constraint is seeded. Escalation is single-cycle, sufficient for 600-word scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: divergence (five channels) as prerequisite for reunion (ocean) is dramatized by the ash ritual, not stated. Chrysalis reweights from death artifact to “doorway,” charging closure. Final humming image offers non-literal answer to “loosened grief” without moralizing. Minor echo penalty: “separation and connection weren’t opposites but movements in the same symphony” is overt thesis—drop −0.3.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Maya’s perceptual lens; polymer chemist diction surfaces once (“chains formed and broke”) yet recedes appropriately. Rhythm modulates: long reflective sentences build to short ritual beats. No dialogue, so no voice convergence. Filter verbs are minimal; “she realized” is justified by intellectual insight. Distinctive noticing—foam as “symphonic”—anchors voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, no loops or scaffold; sentence variety supports momentum. Figurative language is selective—foam “birth,” chrysalis “ghost”—and stops before clutter. One register drift: “she translated her concern into action” leans corporate; minor −0.2. Opening and closing lines are image-anchored and propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Fusion of polymer science + grief ritual is fresh; five-path ash dispersal literalizes “divergent paths” without feeling engineered. Chrysalis payoff is earned via early seed. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulative structure—but interior monologue occasionally drifts toward familiar grief tropes (“grief had loosened…”). Overall, specificity of ravine topology and ritual mechanics lifts it above template.</comment>
