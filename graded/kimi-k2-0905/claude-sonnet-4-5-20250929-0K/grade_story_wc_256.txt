<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren’s crystalline spine, her quiet refusal to argue, and the moment she invites the stranger into the sound-bath all embody a powerfully gentle interiority. The micro-choice to repurpose her hated bells into an attractor shows contradictory impulses (shame/tool) acted in scene. The ending stance—sharing rather than studying—pays off her earlier isolation with felt cost (she surrenders sole authorship of the sound). Secondary pressure from the unnamed volunteer is thin, but within single-POV default the arc is credible and specific.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the two strangers stand inside the synthetic belonging while the miner’s lamp glows above them, reconfiguring “pilgrimage” from place to shared frequency. Cost is visible—the lab’s cold LEDs are swapped for warm candle-like risk, and Maren cedes her private quest to communal use. Accumulative lens holds: pattern of recovered fragments → density → final harmonic wash that reweights meaning. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no ambiguity at end.</comment>

<comment>The carbide lamp’s yellowed glass and the tuning-fork spine function as micro-setting that constrains choice (light temperature governs volunteers’ openness; spine forces her to move carefully). Laboratory is sketched with selective sensory economy—“fractured light dancing across analog recordings”—that keeps momentum. Spatial choreography is clean: lamp adjusted → wall illuminated → playback switch → door opens. Miner’s lamp recurs in final image, charging closure with warmth against the cold blackout past.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can intimacy be artificially re-created?—is signaled early and tightens when tonight’s “most ambitious iteration” must work on a live stranger. Agency is accumulative: each layered recording thickens the risk of failure; the volunteer’s frightened arrival forces Maren to expose her private experiment publicly. Cost is legible: she yields sole control of the sound-environment and accepts the possibility of emotional contagion that could destroy her data or her fragile repute. No causal reversal, but density shift suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from particular rather than label: the recovery of “sounds between words” becomes a parable for post-collapse rebuilding. Final image of two strangers bathed in golden lamp-light offers non-literal answer—connection is not found but allowed to pass through you. Subtext operates in gesture: the volunteer’s dropping shoulders do the emotional work that exposition avoids. No final-paragraph sermon; resonance is felt via the re-lit lamp and the shared silence after the recording ends.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Maren’s perceptual filter—only her spine’s chimes and her interpretations of volunteers’ reactions are given. Syntax mirrors her measured gentleness: long vowel clusters, soft consonants, deliberate cadence. No dialogue until the final three spoken lines, each carrying subtext of invitation rather than explanation. Voice control under pressure: the climactic playback is rendered in short sensory clauses that mimic stroboscopic light, then relax into the longer final sentence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings avoid template cadence. Information density high—single sentences deliver spinal surgery backstory, lamp provenance, and emotional turn. No synonym loops; “sound” recurs but each time reweighted (artifact → data → shared bath). Metaphor vehicles stay coherent: prism-song / fractured light / golden shadows form one optic family. Minor scaffold: “the realization propelled her current project” could compress, but it occurs early and does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: acoustic archaeology + spinal tuning-fork implant + miner’s lamp as mood lighting = specific, non-oblique world. Conceptual risk—pilgrimage as frequency rather than geography—pays off in final shared standing. The blackout-years premise is familiar, but the focus on recovered “interstitial sounds” is novel and character-anchored. If names and places changed, the core texture would collapse because the crystalline vertebrae and lamp-filtered light are irreplaceable tools of the theme.</comment>
