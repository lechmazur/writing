<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Maren’s interiority is specific—she clocks time, maps drone blind-spots, and links absences into tactics—yet her contradictions stay summary (“trapped and trying to remain powerful”) rather than dramatized in-scene. The final image of the storm bottle handed off crystallizes her values, but the choice itself is off-page; we feel the cost obliquely, not through a micro-choice that forecloses a path. Still, her perceptual signature and vocationally shaped attention keep her convincingly individual.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: null-field → invisible drop → drone bypass → hand-off; each beat tightens the same stake. Closure lands with Conceptual Repricing—storm bottle/lightning as bottled people—whose social cost is legible without exposition. The lone price is oblique (Maren’s own containment), but the lens stays causal throughout and the final image reweights prior absences.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cobalt arcade is rendered through sonic, thermal, and kinetic detail (“vaulted ceiling swallowing light”, “familiar whir”, “skeletal carousel”) that doubles as tactical map; bodies and distances stay tracked during the silent drop. Twilight and dereliction mirror internal hush without overt symbolism. The micro-setting (carousel base as null-anchor) directly enables the climax, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—sneak mail across a drone-patrolled border—tightens once when the null-field is deployed, foreclosing the option of open movement. Cost is tacit: Maren’s own life is “contained” like the storm, visible in final image rather than paid in scene. Escalation is modest but coherent under causal lens; no reversal, yet options narrow decisively.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</question><comment>Theme—“emptiness can be filled, absence transformed”—emerges through the storm bottle motif and tactical use of negative space, never sermonized. Final image of daughter holding father’s storm reprises the metaphor with earned poignancy. Subtext in the silent choreography between couriers enacts the theme more than any statement could.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person close stays tight to Maren’s courier-trained perception: time-stamping, spatial triangulation, risk calculus. Syntax is controlled and rhythmic (“brittle hush that settled between these warring silences”). No dialogue to test voice distinction, but interior diction stays within her plausible lexicon; perceptual signature is unmistakable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Prose is lean and imagistic, with high density: every sentence advances setting, tactic, or metaphor (“lightning suspended in glass, crackling softly”). No loops, no filter-verb stacks; figurative language is sparse and purposeful. Occasional elevated lyricism (“warring silences”) fits atmospheric height without register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: mailman + drone null-field + storm-in-bottle turns familiar smuggle plot into resonant political metaphor. Risk is quiet—no twist—but specificity of arcade-as-blind-spot and bottle-as-people feels inevitable in hindsight. Not transformative, but angle is non-obvious and fully committed.</comment>
