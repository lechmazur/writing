<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mrs. Chen’s interiority is lyrically sketched (“expectantly resigned”) and her vocation supplies motive, but we see no contradictory impulse or micro-choice under pressure; the rehearsal scene is summarized, not dramatized, so the cost of her method is asserted, not embodied. She remains archetype more than individual.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: autumn light, zitter rosette, and humming townsfolk accumulate into a final Charged Poise image that reweights “vanishing arts” as living practice. Closure lands cleanly, but the absence of any on-page tightening choice by Mrs. Chen keeps cost conceptual rather than felt; the story tells us harmony is achieved instead of forcing her to pay a visible price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Velvet library, amber windows, and the zitter rosette are sensuously anchored and return in the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Selective auditory focus (“sound-dampening walls”) directly enables the subtraction-of-noise method, so setting constrains tactic; autumn leaves pressed like manuscripts provide a POV-filtered visual that marries season to theme without catalogue excess.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can the town’s hatred be unlearned through choral listening—is signaled early and tightens only narratively, not through a visible forfeiture or trade-off on Mrs. Chen’s part. The escalation is accumulative: discordant hums → harmony; because no option is foreclosed for her, price remains abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the rosette’s interlocked phoenixes and the humming exercise; the final image reframes “vanishing art” as relational practice rather than artifact. Avoids explicit moral, but the grandmother’s quoted aphorism in last paragraph is a mild thematic echo that keeps it from the 9-band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains consistent poetic compression; velvet/amber/octave motifs create rhythmic signature without monotony. Filter verbs rare, diction stays within a retired music teacher’s lexicon; final paragraph’s cadence mirrors a held chord, earning the quiet close.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm, sentences vary in length and opening; no loops or scaffold. Figurative layer is dense (“illuminated manuscripts,” “braid diverse voices”) yet thematically coherent; only minor register creep (“conceptual repricing”) keeps it from 9+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: community-healing via subtractive listening anchored in a Chinese zither fragment. Risk is quiet—no melodrama—yet specificity of rosette carving and humming exercise rescues it from generic “music heals” template; still, town archetypes (gruff bigot, refugee boy) feel familiar.</comment>
