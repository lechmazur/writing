<comment>Maya’s contradictory tug—professional detachment vs. the compulsion to heal strangers’ inherited grief—stays embodied (damp suit, frost-numbed fingers). The micro-choice to wrap the globe in cloth before surfacing crystallizes her hierarchy of values. Because the cost (solitude, perpetual immersion in others’ trauma) is legible in the final beat, the arc earns its Resonant Reconfiguration. Interiority never slips into diagnostic shorthand.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the ruined snow globe becomes proof that love survives drowning, reweighting Maya’s lonely vocation. Causal linkage holds—each dream transcript, each candle, therefore narrows to this dawn drive to Halifax. Orientation anchors within 50 words; no prop or motive teleporting. Cost sentence: “some things survive even drowning” makes the price felt.</comment>

<comment>The glacier shrine is not backdrop; its breathing ice walls force Maya to cut tunnels one cautious stroke at a time, literalizing how truth is carved from pressure. The melted globe’s tilted lighthouse is a micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless: globe pocketed → altar → cloth wrap → exit. Environment directly constrains the tactics of communion.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—deliver a mother’s undelivered love—tightens when Maya names Katherine and decides to drive to Evelyn; this single deepening forecloses the option to remain mere salvager. Pressure stays coherent under Accumulative lens: each whisper, dream, candle adds density until the glacier itself seems to exhale cost. No abstract stakes; the price is the ache Maya carries upward in the final line.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of salvage: value lies not in treasure but in the irreparable—warped glass, unfinished love. Subtext operates through gesture (fingers passing through globe) rather than exposition. Final image reweights “salvage” from artifact to emotional restitution, resisting tidy moral. No thematic echo sentence; insight stays welded to the object.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is precise: POV notices pressure leaks in candles, taste of ancient ice, the way starlight “borrows” shape. Rhythm accelerates with clause compression during summoning, then lengthens for the dawn promise. No filter-verb stack; diction stays within a diver’s lexicon. Ghost voice arrives as “knowing, settling into Maya’s mind like snow”—clean free indirect distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyrical yet information-dense: “whispers rising through the dark water like strings of pearls” does three jobs (sensorial, metaphor, stakes) in ten words. No scaffold loops; sentence cadence varies from fragment to long braided clauses that mimic surfacing breath. Metaphors stay physically coherent—ice breathes, starlight is borrowed, never violated. Final line lands with monosyllabic punch that recharges prior motifs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fusion of Arctic wreck-diving with dream-summoning ritual is fresh; no template plot. The snow globe as ruined compass of love inverts typical treasure logic. Specificity—Halifax, Katharina, red-coat cameos—prevents generic “diver sees ghost” tale. Conceptual risk (ghost communion inside glacier altar) pays off by making the impossible feel inevitable. Synthesis feels singular: only this globe, this ice, this driver could deliver this restitution.</comment>
