<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Marcus’s interiority is textured—his past as calligrapher vs puppet-provocateur sets up a lived contradiction—but the epiphany pivots on told summary (“understood what he needed to do”) rather than a micro-choice we watch. The reversal is declared, not dramatized, so cost feels conceptual rather than embodied. Still, his perceptual signature is consistent and the flaw-to-stance arc is credible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each puppet rehearsal thickens thematic texture until the final cadence shift reweights “half-lit epiphanies.” Closure is a Charged Poise—the dome’s expectant hush reconfigures meaning—but the cost is more metaphorical (artistic ethic) than visceral, nudging it below 8. Orientation is clean; we know who/where by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The decommissioned dome, campfire stick, and driftwood-carved symbols constrain his staging choices and echo the “meteor hush” tone; spatial choreography is airtight. Sensory selection skews auditory (hush, echoes) which mirrors the inward turn. The stick’s final placement beside the puppets recharges earlier performances, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Central stake—ethical storytelling vs exploitative provocation—tightens through each rehearsal beat; the deepening is the shift from weaponized satire to empathetic context. No external antagonist, but internal pressure suffices under Accumulative lens. Cost is present (loss of collaborator, dawn exhaustion) yet feels ambient rather than sharply paid in a single image.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the stick’s passage from prop to conscience object embodies the shift from manipulation to humility. Subtext resides in silent puppet manipulation, avoiding thematic lecture. The final image—walking toward exit with stick—offers resonant ambiguity rather than moral, satisfying the 9+ test despite a hairline whisper of writerly self-explanation mid-paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Marcus’s perceptual filter: “meteor hush,” “silk cravat,” “exploitative clothing” carry distinct idiom. Rhythm modulates with longer reflective sentences then tightens during puppet work, mirroring tension. No dialogue, so voice convergence N/A; prose is clean, pattern-taught, no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Sure-footed read-aloud rhythm; sentence openings vary, no template cadence. Information density high—each sentence advances ethic or atmosphere. One mixed metaphor “strip away pretense and speak truths” is minor; otherwise vehicles stay coherent. Zero loops or scaffold, no artifact in final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The puppet-as-ethical-mirror angle is fresh; using a Cold-War radar dome for a solitary puppet audit feels non-obvious. Risk lies in quiet resolution, but it pays off via Charged Poise. Some phrasing edges toward familiar artist-crisis tropes, keeping it from 8.5+.</comment>
