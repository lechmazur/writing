<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Mara’s contradictory drives—scholarly rigor vs. outlaw urgency—are alive in every beat: she photographs while crying, maps while risking arrest. The “ghost-pressure” on her wrist from Kenji’s grandmother embodies motive better than any label, and her final vow to “keep your promise” crystallizes a renunciation that costs her everything. Interiority is concrete, never diagnostic, and each theft is a visible micro-choice that tightens the ethical vise. Only the off-stage six-month gap keeps this from a 9: we are told, not shown, the moment she commits to burning her life down.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The accumulative/textural lens is declared on page 1 (“analytically intuitive”) and held to the last photograph: each artifact-layer reweights the stake until the tapestry-match becomes a conceptual repricing of love itself. Closure is a Charged Poise: Mara steps into sunlight carrying evidence that will convict or vindicate her—cost felt, path foreclosed. No causal gap survives; even the “lending-library arsonist” label is retroactively paid off as the institutions’ own interlibrary loans enabled her map. The story earns its final hush without explanatory exposition.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The limestone cave is not backdrop but archive—every pigment, ogre-shadow, and hand-match constrains how Mara moves, photographs, and weeps. The tapestry fragment itself functions as micro-setting: its threads literally guide her fingers to the wall, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless; bodies, light, and torn cloth track cleanly. At 8.9 only because the off-grid months outside the cave are a blank; the environment that matters is rendered with economy and sensory hierarchy.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—love’s memory vs. institutional erasure—is signaled in the vandalized portrait and escalates with each stolen page: every extraction narrows Mara’s future options. The tapestry-match beat is the visible tightening that forecloses denial; she can no longer unseen the continuum of censored love. Cost is legible: criminal status, exile, possible imprisonment. One beat short of 9 because the external antagonist (authorities) remains abstract; the pressure is archival and existential rather than imminent bodily threat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges entirely from the accretion of torn-out faces and matched threads: love refuses to stay in the footnotes. The ending’s volcanic tenderness is the inverse of explosive—it is the quiet eruption of continuity, reweighting every prior theft as fidelity rather than vandalism. No character lectures us; the last whispered “I’m keeping it” is image, not moral. The refusal to display both portrait versions would break the story’s moral logic; that double exposure is the only possible stance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate stays locked to Mara’s perceptual signature—“analytically intuitive” diction, volcanic tenderness rhythm, ochre-noticing eye. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated; even “she thought” carries archaeologist precision. No head-hop, no register drift; academic Latinate nouns feel like tools she actually wields. At 8.8 because a single clause (“dementia claimed her completely”) flirts with diagnostic label-speak, though it is instantly grounded in the grip-ghost.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “volcanic tenderness erupting in tears” compresses geologic and bodily force without purple drift. Sentence lengths modulate from spartan field-note to tidal cadence as pressure crests. Zero paraphrase loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphor; “ochre pigments still vibrant after three thousand years” is specific, not catalog tourism. The final line’s spondaic punch—“Some promises… burn down your own life”—lands the ear-test climax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade>
<comment>The conceit—an outlaw academic “burning” libraries by loan-tracing suppressed art—feels freshly excavated, not borrowed. Tethyan cave frescoes and Renaissance self-vandalism collapse into one continuum whose logic is irrefutable in hindsight. Risk is structural: a quiet ending that trusts a tapestry seam to carry the emotional detonation. If names or places changed, the moral calculus of curatorial violence would evaporate; the freshness is inseparable from the invented archive.</comment>
