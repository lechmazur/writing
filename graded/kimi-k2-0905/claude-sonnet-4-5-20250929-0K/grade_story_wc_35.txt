<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maron’s interiority is vivid—“taste memories in food,” “sandpaper the rough memories”—and his micro-choice to bare his hand despite contagion risk crystallizes values. The contradiction of wanting to heal yet fearing erasure is active in scene, not summarized. His endurance carries visible cost: “only tears—his own, this time.” The secondary keeper is sketched only as conduit, so relationship pressure is thin, capping the score just below excellence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The causal spine is coherent: dream → salt pools → descent → tactile healing → fortress dries. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the coral breathes, remorse is bearable, and Maron’s tear reweights the gift. Cost is felt—“only tears—his own”—yet the constraint (he will carry contagion risk forever) is only implied, not explicit, blocking 9-range.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sahel Fortress, tidal-pool staircase, and coral-ice pavilion are specific, sensory, and causal: the salt crystals literally guide the descent; the thawing coral mirrors emotional thaw. The body-as-setting motif—bare palm against stone—constrains the final act. Micro-setting (wet sandstone, bitter-almond grief-taste) repeatedly alters tactics and charges the final tear image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prevent collective emotional annihilation—is signaled early (“subsume everything”). Escalation is textural: each tasted memory sharpens the danger of contagion until the final softening. Maron’s agency drives every beat; no coincidences. Visible price is his solitary tear, but the broader cost (will he be infected later?) is only hinted, keeping it from the top band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of “bearing the unbearable” emerges through gesture, not thesis: kneading grief like dough, sanding memory’s edges. Final tear is resonant reconfiguration—private, bearable sorrow replaces oceanic remorse. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers about future contagion. Image of fortress that “no longer wept” offers sturdy lyric closure without abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is controlled, tactile, epic-toned: “echo of a hundred years of regret,” “coral icebound pavilion beneath the dunes.” Syntax lengthens for grandeur yet tightens under pressure—“He removed his gloves. This required touch.” No filter-verb stacks; perceptual signature is chef-chemist. Dialogue is sparse but natural; keeper’s lines carry subtext of relief. No register drift or head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Rhythm flexes with scene temperature; metaphor density is high but taught early and paid off (“sandpaper the rough memories” returns as literal method). No paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors. “Bitter almonds, spoiled milk, metallic tang” packs three senses in four words. Occasional elevated diction (“ten thousand years”) fits mythic frame; not unmotivated. Final tear is unadorned, letting cadence settle cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Memory-tasting chef summoned by ancient coral freezer beneath desert is fresh synthesis. Conceptual risk—geology, climatology, neurology all bent—commits fully and is internally consistent. Tropes of “magical healer” and “ruined fortress” are retooled through culinary chemistry and geologic time. Final tear recharges opening wall-weep, making innovation feel inevitable.</comment>
