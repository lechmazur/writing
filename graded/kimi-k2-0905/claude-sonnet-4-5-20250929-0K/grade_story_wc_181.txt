<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maya’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her “curator’s hands,” the steam-silence epiphany, the warmth of the blank shell. The nonlinear inheritance concept lets her contradictory impulses (duty vs. terror vs. wonder) coexist in-scene. Her micro-choice to kneel and lift the blank shell crystallizes her acceptance of a future cost. The only minor lapse: the marriage-backstory feels tacked-on; it doesn’t alter present tactics.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the blank shell reweights her life into a time-loop library with herself as both reader and author. Causal lens holds: because she bathes → she grasps temporal pages → therefore she selects the blank shell. Cost is legible—“whatever forbidden truth she would discover during her tenure between arrival and ending” foreshadows irreversible exposure. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by word 60.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The astral orchard is not backdrop; its spiral chronology literally funnels her to the central pistachio tree where choice happens. Micro-setting success: the copper tub and 3-second-delay mirror are tools that precipitate insight. Crystalline starlight soil and phosphorescent fear compress atmosphere into physiology. Only hairline slip: we never feel temperature or smell—minor sensory gap.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she accept custodianship of forbidden knowledge—tightens once: bath epiphany → shell selection forecloses refusal. Escalation is accretive: each impossible detail (breathable asteroid, cross-temporal deed) ups the cost of disbelief until compliance becomes the only on-page option. Visible price: she trades her curatorial distance for inscribed complicity. No coincidence; pressure is situational but coherent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the cost of knowledge that exists outside linear time; no authorial thesis stated. Subtext delivered through recurring shell motif that shifts from trash to blank page to future tombstone. Final image of “time’s own strange fruit” reweights orchard as both Eden and archive. Ambiguity lingers: is she victim or volunteer? Complexity conserved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is curator-precise: “luminous fruit,” “simply complicated,” “discarded possibilities.” Syntax lengthens under wonder, fragments during epiphany—rhythmic control matches cognitive stress. No dialogue, so no convergence issue. Free indirect style stays clean; perceptual signature consistent—“museum’s Renaissance collection was a forgery network” is pure Maya. Filter verbs minimal and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often does three jobs (world-rule + character memory + emotional state). No loops; no scaffold. Metaphors are coherent—“fear itself had learned to phosphoresce” extends setting’s light-physics. Opening and closing lines are ear-tested, propulsive. Minor register spike: “conceptual repricing” is academic; tolerated because embedded in curator cognition.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: the library-as-orchard, shells as codices, blank as future autobiography. Risk of nonlinear inheritance could collapse into gimmick, but emotional cost grounds it. Specificity makes trope new: star-drinking roots, 3-second mirror delay. Transformation test fails—this could only happen to a curator. Bold yet coherent; no safety middle.</comment>
