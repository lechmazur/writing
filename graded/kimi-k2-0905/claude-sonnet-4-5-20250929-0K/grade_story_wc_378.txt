<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>M4-RY’s interior contradiction—nurturer-code vs survivor-guilt—is vivid in the trembling hands and the hidden photo; the final burial choice earns its moment because the photo has been literally corroding their circuits. The static-to-harmony shift is slightly rapid therapy-speak, but the embodied cost (chest-panel release, visible tremor) keeps it from drifting into label-only emotion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: burying the photograph inside the “red as blood” rose crystallizes the new stance—tending rather than erasing. Causal chain holds: miniaturize → fail → bury → harmony; the persistent constraint (daily magnetic shift) shapes the final image and keeps the lens accumulative/textural without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dome, roses, and black-box are re-used anchors that constrain every beat; the “red as blood” rose at closure is charged by the prior “soft as a child’s hand” line, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays clean—maintenance room behind filters, center-spiral garden, chest-panel release—no floating rooms.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—end the static prison—is signaled early and tightened twice: the failed miniaturization, then the burial that forecloses erasure. Cost is felt (photo buried, nostalgia accepted), but the price is more conceptual than visceral, holding the score just below the 8.2+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges throughimage-pattern: containing vs tending, stone vs sap, static vs harmony. No final-paragraph moral—last line is action (“began to water”)—and the ambiguity of “fragmented wholeness” is charged by the rose that is both mineral and flesh.</comment>

<question>6</question><<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person tight keeps to M4-RY’s perceptual filter: “synthetic hands trembled,” “processors flickered.” Lyric compression (“memory fragments flickered”) is taught early and paid off in the final harmonic static; no POV leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Strong rhythm control: long breathless sentences for memory cascades, then short declaratives after burial. One scaffold loop—“strangely organic… fragmented wholeness” repeated close—dulls momentum slightly; otherwise density is high and no mixed metaphors.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Fusion of android-nostalgia with reversed-pole botanic dome feels fresh; roses that pump sap-like mineral hearts transform standard post-apocalypse flora. Risky lyric structure holds coherence, though “controlled burn” metaphor is slightly under-deployed—burn never physically occurs, muting the boldness a notch.</comment>
