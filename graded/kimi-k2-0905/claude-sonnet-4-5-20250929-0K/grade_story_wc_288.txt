<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is vivid—her thylacine memory is embodied in the concrete pacing ache, not told. Contradictory impulses (human intellect vs predator-instinct) coexist in the same beats, giving her credible hybrid agency. The final stance—choosing to keep translating—costs her the comfort of singularity; this renunciation is foreshadowed by the sundial’s uselessness, so the change feels earned. Voice stays specific to her perceptual filter; no diagnostic self-labeling undercuts the moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira accepts her multiplicity and the library keeps writing her future—cost is the perpetual tension of never being “one thing.” Causality holds under the Accumulative/Textural lens: each reflective block is anchored to tactile cues (sundial, stone hum) and alters her micro-choices (how she touches the wall, how she catalogs). Orientation is clean by word 75. No teleporting props; the blank book’s appearance is motivated by the tidal system introduced early. Cost is felt: she forfeits finality for endless translation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The tidal library is not backdrop; its atmospheric tides literally insert new books and force her daily task, constraining tactics. Micro-setting—the atomically reflective wall—mirrors her fractured identity and is handled twice, each time reframing her self-perception. Brass sundial evolves from useless to re-weighted: absence of shadow becomes the emblem of light-based time, charging the final image. Sensory economy is tight: cloud-hum, crystal vibration, warm book pages—all filtered through her hybrid animal/human sensorium.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translate isolation into independence—signals early and tightens when the blank book arrives: it demands she keep writing/being rewritten. One meaningful deepening: she realizes multiplicity is expansion, not fracture; this reweights her loneliness into agency under Accumulative lens. No external antagonist needed; pressure is ontological. Cost is visible—she embraces perpetual unfinishedness, shown by the library beginning her next book while she still breathes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from image pattern—wall reflections, blank pages, shadowless sundial—rather than exposition. Subtext in her refusal to leave the library: she chooses curated extinction over risking new erasure. Final sentence crystallizes the thematic reversal: “She was no longer the last of anything. She was the first of something new.” No closing moral; the reader carries the paradox of survival as ongoing translation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person hovers at Mira’s shoulder, rarely wider than her animal/human sensorium: “hollow ache of being the final one” is phrased like instinct, not analysis. Syntax lengthens under reflection, then compresses during tactile beats—matching respiratory cadence of pacing tiger versus cataloging clerk. No filter-verb clutter; perception is immediate. Diction stays within her plausible lexicon—she can name “gnomon” because she’s been studying sundials. Rhythm control at closure: short declarative—“She was the first of something new”—delivers the charge without flourish.</comment>

<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence can deliver sensory cue, memory shard, and stakes shift—“warm to the touch” books imply harvested souls and foreshadow her future. No mixed metaphors; crystal walls, tidal pressure, cloud ocean stay physically coherent. Scaffolding almost nil; only “she realized” once, forgiven at climax. Read-aloud rhythm varies without algorithmic pattern; paragraph breaks mirror breath units. Closing line is artifact-free and re-opens the image cycle.</comment>

<grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—reincarnated thylacine archiving extinction memories in a floating library—avoids familiar templates. Choice to make coexistence an internal transcription task, not inter-species diplomacy, refreshes the trope. Risky compression of two lives into one consciousness pays off because every metaphor (reflection, blank page, tidal book) feeds that hybridity. Fresh inflection: extinction becomes an ongoing authoring project rather than an ending, rendering “survival” recursive.</comment>
