<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Mira’s interior contradiction—yearning to understand the magnetism she never asked for while fearing its cost—remains embodied in the palmed heartbeat and the swaying tea-house. The micro-choice to stay with Chen crystallizes her hierarchy of values and is earned by the prior causal chain of strangers’ confessions. The only bar to 9-band is that Yuki’s prior “listening” is reported, not dramatized, so the inherited trait feels slightly abstract rather than compulsive on the page.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mira’s decision to apprentice reconfigures her future with visible cost—she forfeits ordinary life below and accepts the perpetual burden of others’ secrets. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of refracted light/sun-trails tightens until the final image of wings trembling with “shared understanding” reweights stakes. Causality is clean; no orientation debt; set-ups (heartbeat, morpho wings, sun-trails) all pay off in the final beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The floating tea house is not postcard backdrop; its sway forces Mira to grip the table, physically externalizing her emotional disequilibrium. Morpho wings function as micro-setting that constrains Chen’s work and charges the final image. Light’s refraction is tracked with POV-specific precision—Chen notices shadows the reader would not—meeting the 9+ gate that environment constrains choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will Mira master the unwanted magnetism or be consumed—is signaled early and deepens when Chen reveals the heart’s residual listening. One meaningful tightening: the offer to stay forecloses the option of returning to her former anonymity; cost is legible in the forfeiture implied by “the valley filled with mist” below her. Pressure escalates under Accumulative lens via intensifying light patterns; no reversal, but deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: the ethics of inherited compassion and the structural nature of visibility (light as truth, wings as refraction). Subtext resides in gesture—Chen lifting the wing like a surgeon—implying the delicate violence of illumination. Final image of trembling wings offers non-literal answer: acceptance of radiant vulnerability. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers about whether Mira can survive the glare.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Mira’s perceptual filter; diction (“quiet fire,” “iridescent caution”) mirrors her wary awe. Syntax lengthens under emotional load then fractures into short beats during sway—“Mira gripped the table edge”—showing rhythmic control. No head-hopping; Chen’s dialogue carries subtextual goals (testing, inviting). Voice remains distinct from Chen’s more surgical precision, satisfying the 9- gate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “sapphire and turquoise and colors that had no names” packs sensory data without modifier overload. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Occasional elevated phrasing (“iridescent caution,” “valley-mist wonder”) stays justified by lyric mode taught early. One hairline slip: “quietly explosive beauty” edges toward oxymoron cliché, but the pattern absorbs it.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—donor heart transmitting empathic gravity—could feel gimmicky yet is grounded in precise optical science of morpho wings and sun-trails, making the supernatural feel structurally real. Risky floating tea-house setting intensifies rather than distracts, forcing literal suspension of disbelief. Synthesis of cardiology, lepidopterology, and listening-as-dye-work feels inevitable in hindsight. Specificity of “chains that sang in the wind” prevents generic fantasy pastiche.</comment>
