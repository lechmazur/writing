<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Chen’s “warmly observant” bent is dramatized in the way he reads Mira’s hem-twist and breathing shifts, then links them to tide data; the same trait blinds him to direct emotional confrontation, giving credible interior contradiction. Mira’s want—to be “needed more directly”—is legible and feeds the dominant stake. The final stance crystallizes when he kneels and offers the cicada, a micro-choice that re-weights their status: she accepts it and leans in, a visible cost to both. Only minor softness: “I approached everything tangentially” is delivered as retrospective diagnosis rather than embodied moment. </comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Closure is clean Earned Stasis: Chen concedes his avoidance, Mira accepts partial repair, and the tide’s return images the lingering cost—options narrowed but not erased. Causal lens dominates; each beat (cicada reveal, pool metaphor, apology) is linked by because/therefore logic. Orientation anchored within 120 words (grotto, starlight, father-daughter standoff). No lens ambiguity at end; tide image re-prices the premise. </comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Grotto ceiling as faux-constellation and the centimeter-level tide gauge constrain Chen’s perceptual authority and shape his final metaphor; environment materially guides the tactics of disclosure. Salt-thick air and mineral glitter are filtered through POV bias rather than tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is flawless—cicada passed, bodies lean, water level logged. </comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—Mira’s demand for presence vs Chen’s tangential distance—tightens once via cicada reveal which forecloses the old stasis; cost is visible when he admits unfairness and she leans instead of leaving. Agency resides in Chen’s decision to risk direct emotional exposure. Escalation is single but sufficient for 700-word frame. </comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from tidal pool metaphor rather than assertion: survival through repeated loss/return becomes the non-literal answer to grief and leaving. Subtext lives in gesture (hand hover, hem twist). Final image of speaking “like careful notations” reweights cicada and tide without moralizing. </comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person lingers inside Chen’s perceptual signature—counts water levels, hears gull-equivalent silence—without leaking into Mira’s mind. Prose rhythm mimics ebb/flow: longer clauses calm, fragments when apology nears. Dialogue indirection present: “You weren’t listening” answered by object, not defense. </comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Sentences often carry double duty (action + tide data). One soft filter-verb cluster—“he could foresee the coming tide”—but forgiven because it embeds his professional lens. No mixed metaphors; closure image retains clarity. </comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Father-daughter tide-pool talk risks familiarity, but freshness arises from Chen’s scientific gaze turned inward and the cicada’s underground-to-flight metaphor sutured to tidal data. Tangential approach as emotional defense is a sharp angle. Not quite transformative enough to feel inevitable in hindsight; still, specific detail lifts it above template. </comment>
