<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Elena’s obsession with proving her theory is credibly embodied; the prism-in-pocket and frost-vision beats dramatize the stake viscerally. Hartley’s reversal is telegraphed via the frost patterns, so the conversion feels earned rather than convenient. Interior contradiction is present—her exultation vs. fear of final rejection—yet the lens stays too clean on her turmoil, keeping this shy of 9. The “truthful lies” pact crystallizes a visible cost for both, satisfying the earned-choice test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Single-scene, causal chain: frost pattern → confrontation → joint purpose. Orientation is anchored by ~80 words; prism and quartz arbor act as recurrent constraints that pay off in the final image. Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost: Hartley’s “I believed the moment I saw my wife’s face” severs his skeptic identity and commits both to professional risk. Lens holds; no causality or prop jumps.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Quartz arbor refracts light and supplies the crystalline grammar of the story; frost on glass is micro-setting that literally carries memory. Mist timing (dawn) limits visibility, forcing close-up pattern reading. The prism is tactile and re-handled; its refraction beat is the only way Elena verifies Hartley’s claim—environment constrains epistemology. Sensory detail is biased to optics and chill, fitting the scientific/mystic hybrid POV.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—Elena’s last chance for academic legitimacy—tightens when the skeptical gatekeeper offers alliance. Pressure escalates via the frost reveal, not external antagonist; coincidence (frost forming legible images) complicates rather than rescues. Agency shifts: Elena asks for help; Hartley accepts public risk. Cost is legible: Hartley confesses grief-car ownership; both face committee censure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from refractive surfaces holding human residue; no explicit thesis stated. “Truthful lies” paradox lets the ending dramatize the uneasy merger of empiricism and mysticism. The frost-etched child-hand image reweights the earlier car-crash memory without moralizing. Subtext in silence—Elena pocketing the prism instead of proclaiming victory—shows respect for grief’s privacy.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Narrative voice is close-third scientist: precise, optic-biased, slightly chilled. Diction—“refracting pale light into countless directions”—mirrors Elena’s perceptual lens. Dialogue is sparse but carries subtext: Hartley’s “I owe you truthful lies” fuses apology and self-excuse. No POV drift; free indirect stays within Elena’s sensory set.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length; clause rhythm mimics light-splitting. No template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is restrained—frost “words,” “small hand reaching”—and stays within physical logic. Opening and final lines bracket with arboreal resonance; no scaffold or overwriting touches closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Emotional-residue premise is familiar, but grounding it in daily frost on a grief-soaked car feels fresh. Prism + quartz + frost triangulates a single physics metaphor that unifies mysticism and empiricism. Risk is taken: coincidence of frost patterns could have read as twee, yet story earns it by tying pattern to Hartley’s lived mileage. Final image of “quartz formations sang” reprises without copying earlier phrasing.</comment>
