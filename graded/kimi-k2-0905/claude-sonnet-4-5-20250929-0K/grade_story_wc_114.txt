<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Mira’s contradictory impulses—guilt-driven urgency versus intellectual caution—play out in scene through her fever-fragile body at the console and the micro-choice to re-weight uncertainty itself. Interiority is concrete (“auroral sorrow, like light breaking”), never diagnostic. The arc’s cost is legible: she trades irrevocable trust in her own code for perpetual vigilance, a renunciation that hurts because the page remembers Reeves’s death. Secondary pressure from Chen is minimal but sufficient to keep the crucible hot; his single line about sleep-talking seeds the doubt she then weaponizes against her former certainty.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Driven by Causal lens: fever-break → discovery of smothered doubt → code rewrite that enshrines uncertainty. The moment Mira pulls up “marginal notes” is the decisive turn; the new oracle’s first advisory supplies visible cost (“conditions uncertain, recommend caution”). Orientation is anchored by line 4; no disorientation serves closure, so no penalty. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the station’s epistemic rule-set is permanently altered, with the price being perpetual incompleteness—felt in the final image of clouds that can now only be read hesitantly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The station’s frost-veined windows and sunrise snow operate as micro-setting that charges the final image: frost patterns once precise like the old oracle now melt under uncertain skies. The body-as-setting is live—Mira’s “limbs heavy with the aftermath of illness” constrains how fast she can code, pacing the rewrite scene. Tool detail (console, logs, algorithms) is accurate and choice-relevant; the mis-weighted pressure signatures directly motivate the rewrite. Spatial choreography holds: Chen starts at the deck, moves to her side, tea handed without teleport.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: prevent another Reeves-scale death by forcing the oracle to admit doubt. Escalation is cognitive—each scrolled log raises the stakes by revealing how close the truth came to speech. The tightening beat is the rewrite itself: Mira narrows her own future options, replacing decisive forecasts with perpetual hedging. Cost is visible: the first forecast she receives is the one that would have saved Reeves, now arriving too late—an emotional price paid on-screen.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without slogan: knowledge unsaid is still knowledge, and suppressing uncertainty kills. The nightshade illustration returns reweighted—its poison now stands for the oracle’s hidden doubt. Subtext in Chen’s silence and the shared tea carries culpability. Final image of clouds under an “uncertain” forecast offers a non-moral answer: live with incompleteness or die by false completeness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate stays locked to Mira; no head-hop. Perceptual signature is scientist-poet: “botanical illustrations rendered in ice,” “auroral sorrow” sit inside her lexicon. Rhythm modulates—short staccato diagnostics under fever, longer cadences at dawn. Filter verbs are minimal and earned (“she thought of…” appears once, justified by fever memory).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often advances plot, character, and metaphor simultaneously (“I taught it to ignore its own doubts”). No loops or scaffold; metaphor vehicles stay coherent (frost/illustration/uncertainty chain). Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene temperature. Opening and closing lines bookend the arc: frost patterns → clouds under uncertain forecast, a mirrored image that recharges motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Premise twist is fresh: fault-tolerance as moral hazard, not virtue. Specificity of weighted marginal data keeps it from feeling like generic AI-caution tale. Risk is moderate—no structural acrobatics, but the conceptual inversion is non-obvious. Emotional specificity (auroral sorrow) lifts it above think-piece territory.</comment>
