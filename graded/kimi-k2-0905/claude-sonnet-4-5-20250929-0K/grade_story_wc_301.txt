<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya’s interior contradiction—scientist’s precision vs. unmedicated emotional surge—remains embodied in every beat (wading deeper while logging data). The micro-choice to keep photographing graffiti and to write her own tile-line crystallizes her hierarchy of values. Final renunciation of the accordion is earned: taped bellows mirror her patched self, and leaving it in afternoon light costs her nostalgic buffer. Only the “Subject remains upright” note flirts with clinical shorthand that slightly flattens peak emotion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Maya’s last tile-question reframes self-forgiveness from destination to current, charging every prior river measurement with new cost. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; density of ivy, water, and graffiti layers tightens until the final image reweights the stake. Orientation (who/where/when) anchored by word 40 inside the station; no penalty. Persistent price visible: she exits without instrument or former safety, future wading now unbuffered.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Environment (river, ivy, tiled wall) directly constrains tactics: each day’s deeper wading is enabled by platform collapse that offers stair-less water access; accordion’s patched bellows mirror ivy’s repair of rust, charging final leave-behind. Sensory hierarchy true to ex-hydrologist: temperature, clarity, coordinates noticed before emotional label. Micro-setting (body in current) functions as setting when she balances notebook above thighs—choice physically limited by flow. No slips touching closure; river’s “refusal of nothing” recharges every prior reading.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Dominant stake—can she inhabit unmedicated perception without drowning—tightens once: deeper daily wading + stricter notation = visible trade-off. Escalation is Accumulative: graffiti dialogue and ivy growth add density until “forgiveness as current” reweights option. Cost legible: accordion abandoned, future solace now unaccompanied. No reversal, but deepening sufficient for 600-word window.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from pattern: river’s non-judgmental carriage of sediment contaminant = model for self-forgiveness. No thesis stated; final tile-question is image, not moral. Graffiti conversation and ivy reclamation externalize internal shift without allegory. Resonance lingers: reader forced to reweight earlier “contamination” metaphors as acceptance not damage.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Perceptual signature sharp: “cathedral of green silence,” “precision of someone seeking truth in water’s constant motion”—syntax mirrors scientific gaze fighting sentiment. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for calm observation, fragments when current hits thighs. No dialogue to distort voice. Free indirect style clean; no filter-verb stacks. Compression taught early (“medication-free and raw with feeling”) and paid off in final cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>High density: single sentences advance character, image, and theme (“She documented the ivy’s daily progress with the same care she gave the river, noting how life persisted in claiming dead spaces”). No loops or synonym churn. Metaphors consistent (water, flow, repair); none contradict physics. Register stable; no corporate drift. Final line ear-test perfect: rhythm echoes opening “cathedral” but reweights it.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Fresh synthesis: ex-hydrologist’s field notes as recovery journal, graffiti as peer review, accordion as lung-object. Ivy reclamation of station parallels neural regrowth without stating equation. Risk—quiet lyric ending—paid off by Conceptual Repricing that makes “downstream” literal and moral. Could not swap setting or object without collapsing metaphorical scaffold.</comment>
