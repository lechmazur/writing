<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Kael’s interiority is textured—his palm reading the pulse, the remembered grandmother, the decision to “travel without moving”—but the only micro-choice on-page is the decision to begin restoration work, a gentle closing beat rather than a pressured crucible. Contradictory impulses (duty vs. solitude, exhaustion vs. reverence) are named, not enacted in scene; the emotional cost is inferred, not embodied in a single visible moment. Still, the harmonic-skill lineage and his weathered resolve feel specific, keeping him above the template threshold.</comment>

<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The closure is a quiet Charged Poise: Kael turns toward the third tower, accepting “long work,” the cost reframed as patient centuries already waited. Causality holds—arrowhead → ravens → fracture diagnosis → commitment—each because/therefore legible. The lens is Accumulative/Textural: layered echoes gain density until the final stance crystallizes. No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 40. Cost is conceptual but unmistakable in the last sentence; meets 9+ cost proof.</comment>

<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Bone towers, ravens’ recursive geometries, and the pulse-trap canyon are not backdrop but tooling: the fracture in tower-three literally disrupts standing waves Kael must retune. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV—he notices wind direction and crystalline sound, not tourist vistas. Micro-setting (arrowhead in palm) constrains his immobility and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions. Environment directly shapes the only possible tactic—meditative realignment—meeting 9+ gate.</comment>

<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve resonance network—signals early; escalation is the deepening recognition that the third tower’s fracture is irreversible without weeks of stillness, foreclosing wandering freedom. Protagonist agency is attention/renunciation rather than physical battle; the tightening is conceptual but legible. Cost is the surrender of motion, paid in the closing turn. No coincidence; pressure stays coherent under Accumulative lens. Sufficient for length, though acceleration is gentle rather than sharp.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: memory as navigational infrastructure, time as audible strata, stewardship as stillness. Subtext lives in gesture—the arrowhead’s silence, the ravens’ spirals—never translated into moral. Final image reweights earlier material: “echoes would wait” reframes centuries as collaborator, not burden. No platitudes or thematic echo lines. Ambiguity is purposeful: network may still fail, cost is accepted. Integrated with character arc—his patience is the thematic answer.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Kael; no head-hop. Diction—“harmonic stone skimmer,” “standing waves,” “recursive geometries”—is precise yet within his hereditary lexicon. Rhythm swells with longer sentences during harmonic listening, then tightens at the turn: “He tucked the arrowhead… turned.” No filter-verb stacks; perception is immediate. Voice distinctiveness is the perceptual signature itself—sound as sediment, time as pattern—sustained without varietal monotony. Elision taught early (sound=stone) and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often layers world rule, sensory hit, and memory logic. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances. Metaphors stay coherent—echoes as sediment, ravens as compass—no mixed vehicles. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image. Minor cadence repetition (“had been,” “had stood”) is purposeful ancestral echo, not scaffold. Closure beat is clean of figurative muddle. Proofing clean: no typos, pronoun drift, or tense slips.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Premise—navigation by stillness, sound turned to stone—feels fresh yet inevitable. Ravens as living sonar, bone towers as antennae: specific synthesis rather than ornament. Risk of static meditation is embraced and made dramatic. Transformation test: remove canyon-acoustics and whole story collapses. No close echoes to famous scenes; avoids mystic-Indian or generic post-apocalypse tropes. The angle is non-obvious yet emotionally grounded in custodial loneliness.</comment>
