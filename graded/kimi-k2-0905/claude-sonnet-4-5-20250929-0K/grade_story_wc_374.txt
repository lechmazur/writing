<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is vivid—tasting the wind, twisting the ring—but her “luminous skeptic” label is asserted, not dramatized; no on-page contradiction between doubt and certainty. Kael arrives as weather-event more than agent; his storm dissipates on a single line of dialogue, so the relational shift feels gifted, not crucible-forged. Grandmother’s inherited gift is backstory-rich yet triggers no micro-choice here; the beat where Mira declares “It finds weather-carriers” lands as tidy exposition rather than earned recognition. The closure image of two siblings beneath aurora is poetically resonant, but the cost of Kael’s dissipating storm and Mira’s certainty is asserted, not embodied—no path is visibly foreclosed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the compass needle settles on Kael, re-weighting the siblings’ self-understanding under aurora light with conceptual cost—weather-carriers as planetary messengers. Causal chain is thin: Mira’s experiment (showing the compass) instantly converts Kael’s lifetime shame to acceptance; no intermediate tension or failure beat tests the premise. Orientation is clear by 120 words—bluff, lavender, aurora, tin ring—so no penalty. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: lyrical repetitions of taste-scents and aurora pulses tighten the texture until the final image crystallizes meaning.</comment>

<comment>Lavender bluff, aurora, and taste-metallic wind are filtered through Mira’s perceptual bias; every sensory note is anchored to her goal of decoding weather-carriers. The tin ring functions as micro-setting: handled in at least three beats—cold against finger, useless spin, final settle—its changing state tracks the shift in knowledge. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves. Environment does not constrain bodily action (no storm actually hits), so the gate for 9+ is missed, but the aurora and lichen-lit path charge the final image with atmospheric cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“why some people carry weather”—is signaled early and reiterated. Pressure escalates texturally: tastes layer (copper, cardamom, cinnamon, lime, lavender) as aurora brightens, tightening the sensorial noose. Yet the decisive turn hangs on a single spoken insight (“maybe I’m just a messenger”) rather than a choice that costs either sibling anything tangible; the storm dissolves without tangible consequence. No live option is foreclosed; the tightening is aesthetic, not tactical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Theme—planet electing humans as meteorological messengers—emerges through imagery, not lecture. Subtext of shame-vs-service is voiced by Kael but not dramatized in action. Final auroral tableau offers resonant reconfiguration: weather-carrier identity shifts from curse to vocation. No moralizing sentence mars the ending; ambiguity remains whether the message can ever be declined.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly lashed to Mira’s tongue and attention; no head-hop. Diction—“terrestrially cosmic,” “data streams made manifest”—is elevated yet consistent with her data-seeking lens. Rhythm modulates: longer cadences for aurora reverie, clipped fragments when the needle settles. Dialogue is sparse but carries subtext (Kael’s first line masks lifelong shame); no voice convergence under stress.</comment>

<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—sense data plus metaphor—without clogging beats. No template cadence or synonym loops. One mixed metaphor (“clouds gathered like curious children”) is minor. Aurora/lavender/taste motifs recur with shifting valence, avoiding static repetition. Closure line—“the future tasted like home”—is concise, propulsive, and recharges earlier taste motif without overwriting.</comment>

<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fusion of electoral forests, taste-weather, and aurora politics feels fresh yet inevitable. Grandmother’s electromagnetic compass is a single, specific object that reframes meteoropathy as civic duty. Risky lyric compression is taught early and paid off in the final auroral ballot. Concept could not survive relocation to generic fantasy sky; its integrity is bound to this bluff, this sensorium.</comment>
