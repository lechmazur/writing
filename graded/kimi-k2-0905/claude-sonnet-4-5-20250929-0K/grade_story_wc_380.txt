<comment>Maris’s contradictory impulses—scientific skepticism versus inherited mysticism—surface in simultaneous micro-choices: she both mocks the diviners and secretly adopts their coffee-ground method. Her embodied fear of “rising dangerously high” on the pier and the reflex to clutch the book against her ribs externalize interiority without label-speak. The final renunciation—cutting into the heart and letting it seal around her—pays off every earlier image of deletion and crystallizes a visible cost: she forfeits the living world for recovered time.</comment>

<comment>The whale-as-archive premise is taught by the third paragraph; orientation anchors (who=Maris, where=docks, when=three days post-beaching) arrive inside 120 words. Causal linkage holds: because the whale carried absences, gravity warps; because Maris scatters flowers, she locates the heart; because she enters it, gravity stabilizes. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the city above regains physics while Maris pays with erasure—felt cost legible in “the lanterns burned steady through the night” without her.</comment>

<comment>Recurring object-as-setting: the pressed-wildflower book first ballasts Maris against fluctuating gravity, then becomes divination tool, then salt seed inside the heart—each reuse constrains her next move. Sensory economy favors touch (“cold biting through her clothes”) and kinesthetic orientation over visual catalog. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from foggy pier to brine pool to crystalline heart without impossible positions. The gleaming silence of the chambers mirrors the internal hush of restored memory, charging the final image.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—recover deleted memories—surfaces in paragraph 5 and tightens when flowers spiral toward the heart, foreclosing retreat: enter or abandon quest forever. Agency remains constant: each gravity shift physically tests her commitment, culminating in the irreversible cut. Cost is visible—she trades corporeal life for mnemonic stasis—yet the escalation is single-cycle; no secondary reversal compounds pressure. Still, the one meaningful deepening satisfies short-form bandwidth under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges without statement: deleted selves sediment inside giants we barely notice, and rescue demands surrendering the present. The wildflower motif evolves from nostalgia artifact to divination medium to crystalline lattice—its final form reweights “pressed flowers” as literal time-storage. Subtext whispers that conservation laws apply to emotion too—every retrieval exacts deletion elsewhere. Final image of steady lanterns above empty docks offers resonant, non-moralizing answer: memory’s return is also a vanishing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person omniscient stays tightly filtered through Maris’s perceptual signature—she notices gravity vectors before visual detail, feels lantern iron before color. Syntax lengthens under gravity flux (“then sideways through dimensions she couldn’t name”) and compresses during incision (“salt and memory crystallizing together”), mirroring physical pressure. No dialogue appears; omission is purposeful, preserving lyric isolation. Diction remains within coastal-worker lexicon; no academic register leaks.</comment>

<comment>Prose is near-flawless: zero loops, scaffold, or register drift. Density doubles duty—“gasoline-slick with dissolved minerals” delivers sensory, hazard, and metaphoric information in five words. Rhythm modulates from languid dock pacing to breath-shortened heart entry without algorithmic pattern. Only hairline slip: “recursive and purposeful” abstracts a visual that could stay purely concrete, but the phrase sits outside the closure beat and does not dull final image clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The whale-as-memorial-for-unmoored-memories is a fresh synthesis of folklore and physics conservation; it feels inevitable once revealed. Risk is taken—lyric escalation inside an organ—but coherence holds because every image (salt, lanterns, flowers) reconfigures rather than decorates. Specificity anchors novelty: salt crystal geometry grown from whale brine is irreplaceable to this world. The inversion that retrieval equals self-erasure avoids sentimental rescue fantasy.</comment>
