<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Marcus’s interior contradiction—stoic craftsman vs. lonely brother—remains concrete: the thumb rubbing the cracked bookmark embodies both memory and reluctance. The micro-choice to pocket it (not discard it) tilts his stance toward outreach, earning the final gift of the sphere. Solitary POV limits relationship-as-crucible, yet the voice-driven self-interrogation keeps pressure alive. One hairline slip: “diagnostic” tag “the thawing heart” is self-named; luckily it is embedded inside remembered sibling mockery, so the flaw grazes but doesn’t sever causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/texture lens holds: each circling of the rod, each echo of river-ice cracks, thickens the pattern until the bookmark pocketing flips the emotional valence. Closure is Charged Poise—sphere lifted to light, option to reconnect crystallized, cost = years of silence acknowledged. Orientation clean by 120 wds; no prop or knowledge teleport. Single tightening sufficient for length; causality intact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eastern-window light, grime-flecked constellation motes, and frozen river soundtrack are filtered through glass-worker’s eye and supply tactile vocabulary for his metaphors. Control-room ghosts remain backdrop, never stall action; glass tools and bookmark serve as micro-setting that constrains rotation and reprise. Sensory ratio favors visual, justified by glass-craft precision. Final sphere + sun-beam image reweights entire space into “gallery of possible reunions.”</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—risk of perpetual silence with sister—signaled early via bookmark memory. Pressure escalates through glass-rotation metaphor: each circuit = accumulated regret; one decisive tightening when he pockets bookmark, accepting vulnerability cost. No external antagonist needed; internal conflict suffices for 700 wds. Price paid = abandonment of solitary sanctuary, legible on page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of release vs. preservation emerges from glass technique, not lecture: heat-then-cool parallels confront-then-reconcile. Subtext loaded into object handling—bookmark crack = family fault line; sphere = transparency he offers. Final image avoids moral, offers poise: river carries ice shards like unsent words downstream, reader left to weigh thaw. No thematic echo line in closing paragraph; wisdom stays implicit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person hovers close to Marcus’s glassblower perception: flame “kisses,” glass “collapses under stillness,” diction stays technical yet tender. Rhythm mimics rod rotation—long sentences for heating, staccato fragments for ice cracks—taught early and paid off. No dialogue, so voice convergence test n/a. Filter verbs minimal; “he noticed” etc. appear only when they duplicate gesture already shown, forgiven by poetic mode.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud ear test passes: cadence alternates between molten flow and crystalline snap without algorithmic pattern. Metaphors stay within glass physics (passion consume art, glass like trust) maintaining coherence, no mixed vehicles. No scaffold loops; each sentence adds new sensory or emotional grain. Opening and closing lines anchor and resolve with luminous specificity.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Fusion of glass-blowing craft with sibling estrangement feels non-obvious yet inevitable; process vocabulary (gather, pontil, annealing) becomes emotional grammar. Abandoned dam-control room repurposed as artisan hermitage supplies fresh stage without steampunk gimmickry. Bookmark as fissure-object avoids pure symbol by handling in two beats—table-side memory, pocket decision. Risk lies in quiet ending; poise over confrontation, but texture accumulates enough charge to justify.</comment>
