<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Cassian’s inherited guilt and crusade for full disclosure are vivid, but his interiority drifts into self-diagnosis (“he began to muse on what this meant”) that no one mid-arc utters aloud. The micro-choice to crank the cylinder is perfectly motivated; the later resolve to confront the council is foreshadowed yet lacks an embodied beat of cost on the page. Still, contradictory impulses—loyalty to blood vs. need for expiation—stay active in scene, earning a strong band.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the new crime retroactively poisons the already-destroyed dynasty, tightening the noose of guilt. Causal chain—intuition → gramophone → acoustic encoding → confession—holds without teleport. Orientation anchors who/where by sentence three; no debt. One flaw: the legal ramifications are pronounced rather than shown, a miniature “explain-everything” shimmer that keeps this just under the 9 gate.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The sepia archive is economic yet atmospheric: vanilla dust, parquet catching slant light, brass horn catching last sun—all filtered through Cassian’s selective attention. Micro-setting objects (cylinder, crank, modified diaphragm) constrain tactics: without the crank’s weight he never tries the machine. Golden shadows evolve to violet, mirroring without announcing his darkening knowledge. Spatial choreography clean; no anachronism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will Cassian find the unspoken sin that justifies his matricidal testimony—tightens once: the confession cylinder converts abstract suspicion into irrefutable ancestral crime. Escalation is Accumulative: each acoustic detail adds density until the standing-wave trick detonates prior certainty. Cost is felt conceptually rather than viscerally, nudging this under the 8-band where a visible price would live.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme—silence as inheritable crime—emerges through object and action rather than lecture. Gramophone’s “eloquent silence” turned loquacious literalizes the motif; sepia light fading to violet externalizes moral stain. The final image of Cassian listening to methodical clicks refuses to moralize, letting resonance do the work. One soft echo: “silences in family histories are themselves a kind of testimony” drifts toward thesis-statement, keeping it from 9.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Cassian with perceptual signature—“amber light filtered,” “vanilla and dust”—syntax lengthens under contemplation, shortens at mechanical contact. No head-hop. Filter verbs serve voice (“he understood this was what he’d come for”) rather than dull immediacy. Dialogue is absent, so bullets there are waived. Minor register wobble: “standing waves that only proper equipment reveals” edges academic, but fits an ex-engineer’s self-talk.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes—long sentences for dusk-light contemplation, clipped for crank-clicks. Metaphors are sparse, mixed only once (“understanding flooding like cold water”) yet paid off by emotional temperature. No loops, no synonym churn, no scaffolding. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line crystallizes time/accountability without overwriting. A single participle opener is sequential, not simultaneous. High density, propulsion clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Freshest inflection is acoustic steganography—using standing-wave encoding to bury 19th-century confession—married to archivist procedural. Dynasty-ender trope is inverted: destruction already done, now retroactively deepened. Kateri land-theft angle adds colonial specificity. Risk is moderate: tech-meets-archive rather than full lyric experiment. Synthesis feels particular, not checklist; would break if transplanted to another family or device.</comment>
