<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is textured and embodied early (“her feet whispering,” “satchel grew heavier”); the contradiction between transcription and invention is dramatized through the trembling hand that cannot sketch her own gears. The decisive micro-choice—kneeling to expose the contraband sketchbook—carries visible cost as “petrichor nostalgia” meets “ghost of what she might have become,” earning the later renunciation. Flaw complicity is present: fear of failure is both acknowledged and acted against, satisfying earned stasis without tidy resolution. Voice remains consistent, but the second mention of “excruciatingly gentle” edges toward label-speak, preventing full 9-band clearance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because she cannot invent, therefore she walks to the sanctuary; because the crystals echo buried dreams, therefore she abandons denial. The Decisive Change—sketching the sunrise/sunset clock—lands with conceptual cost: the resignation letter is now “lighter,” a tangible forfeiture of secure identity. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) are crystalline by line 3; the single transition from courtyard to return path is legible. One hairline slip: “the dream wasn’t abandoned anymore” is retrospective summary that slightly blunts the immediacy of the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Crystal forecourt functions as micro-setting: its hum answers her whisper, constraining the choice to confess and later to sketch. Rain-soaked stones and suspended droplets mirror her stalled internal gears, then evolve as dawn brightens to reflect decision. Spatial choreography is immaculate—kneel, unpack, sketch, repack—no floating props. The 9+ gate is missed only because the final image does not weaponize a concrete environmental detail for closure; the sanctuary stays atmospheric rather than tactical at the end.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—voice vs. silence of her own designs—is signaled in paragraph 1. Escalation occurs once yet meaningfully: the crystals’ hum externalizes her buried ambition, forcing the micro-turn to open the sketchbook; this tightens options because secrecy is now impossible to herself. Cost is visible: the satchel’s weight transfer signals irreversible trade of security for exposure. No second reversal, but at 700 words one meaningful pressure point suffices; cost could be sharper if the resignation letter were physically left behind.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme—reclamation of forgone creativity—emerges through the clock imagery rather than lecture. Subtext operates in the silence of the sanctuary and the unheard ticking of never-built mechanisms. The final sketch reconfigures the earlier “ghost” designs into a humble timepiece that measures both sunrise and sunset, a non-literal answer to the fear of failure. Slight sentimental overtone in “everything she had finally decided to become” nudges score down from 9.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is consistent: mechanical vocabulary (“escapement angle,” “gear ratio”) filters sensory data, distinguishing her from generic wanderer. Rhythm modulates—longer clauses during reflection, shorter fragments under crystal vibration—without syntactic monotony. No dialogue, so voice purity remains intact. One microscopic filter-verb cluster (“she understood then that”) is absorbed without momentum drag.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Density is high: “petrichor nostalgia” and “amber threads of dawn” each carry double duty (smell + time, color + light). No paraphrase loops; every sentence advances stance or image. Metaphors stay coherent—crystals as music box is extended, not contradicted. Final clause “toward everything she had finally decided to become” is slightly elevated diction for a formerly timid technician, a hairline register drift that keeps the category from 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—failed imperial transcriber seeks absolution from singing crystals—offers fresh angle on art-versus-artist trope. Specificity of heartbeat clocks and backward-running memories personalizes the concept. Risk is moderate: quiet sanctuary epiphany rather than external stakes, but coherence compensates. The crystal-echo payoff feels inevitable in hindsight yet not derivative, satisfying transformation test.</comment>
