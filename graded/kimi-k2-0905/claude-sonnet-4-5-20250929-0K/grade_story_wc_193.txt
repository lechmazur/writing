<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mira’s survivor-guilt and translated-virtue motive powers every beat; the "virtuously mischievous" tag is shown, not told, in her bolt-install gamble. Interiority is sensorily anchored ("fingers along the racks...quantum hum") and contradicts hope with residual shame. The final pocketing of diamond-and-bolt crystallises earned change with visible, portable cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: scam-backstory → glitch texts → volunteer yes → bolt seals breach → quantum diamonds. One tight micro-turn at the bolt-catch threads probability itself. Closure is Conceptual Repricing: "pressure...translated into something that could cut through any darkness" reweights the premise with undeniable social cost. No orientation drift; who/where/when clear by line 6.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The mushroom cathedral is not backdrop; rack proximity guides her reach, luminescent pulses time her breathing, and the breach opens between physical rows she has just touched. Sub bolt’s paradoxical weight anchors the micro-setting and final image. Sensory triangulation (glow, hum, cold metal) is selective, POV-filtered, never touristic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—translate her scam-pressure into something generative—signalled in first paragraph and tightened when the bolt’s impossible weight demands the install choice. Escalation is causal: each text fragment raises the cost of refusal until "Yes" forecloses retreat. Visible price: sealing the breach burns the shame into a portable diamond she must now carry.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from action: pyramid compression → carbon → diamond as lived metaphor for survivor wisdom. No explicit moral; final image of the diamond refracting "possibility into spectrum" non-literally answers the question of what scams can become. Submarine bolt reweights from prison rivet to transformative tool, reconfiguring prior scam imagery without meta-commentary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature ("shadow in seventeen different directions," "concepts became physical") is idiosyncratic yet legible. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses during bolt-turn, longer lyrical sweeps during mushroom glow. No head-hop; knowledge stays Mira-bound. Compressed elision ("She understood") is voice-motivated and pattern-taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty (description + causality) with high noun/verb specificity; no filter-verb clusters. Mixed metaphors ("sea of liquid light") are few and do not obscure closure. Occasional overwritten flourish ("symphonic brilliance") but not in peak beat; final line is clean, propulsive. Zero paraphrase loops; paragraph cut test passes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: scam-survivor trauma + quantum-fungal tech + parallel-text volunteer call. Bolt-as-physical-wrench-that-seals-multiverse-breach is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric compression ("hurt to perceive") heightens wonder without breaking clarity. Conceptual integrity commits fully to "pressure into diamonds" logic; no retreat into metaphoric safety.</comment>
