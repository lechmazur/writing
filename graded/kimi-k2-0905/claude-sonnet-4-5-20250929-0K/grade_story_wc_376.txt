<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s bodily allergy to lies is vivid, specific, and exploited in every scene; her choice to carry “lost candor” outward feels earned because the Archive sequence dramatizes the cost of honesty withheld. The grandmother reveal is the only slight neatening that keeps her from a 9-band. Interiority stays concrete—no diagnostic self-talk—and micro-choices (pocketing the map, touching the vessel) keep her hierarchy of values legible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis with visible cost: Mira accepts lifelong exposure to surface lies in order to ferry authentic words upward—"Show me how to deliver what was meant to be heard" forecloses retreat. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each shard (bodily wilt, map piece, Archive vessel) layers density until the final image reweights the premise. No causal gaps; postal fragment setup pays off in the grandmother reveal; orientation anchored by word 80. Persistent constraint—her physiological lie-detector—shapes the final tactic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Crystalline domes, spoiled-milk sky, and synthesized-water plants are more than wallpaper; they literally filter, ration, and dehydrate every breath Mira takes, guiding her downward escape. The zinc-etched fragment and gilded leaves function as micro-settings that constrain piecing and calligraphy choices. Final image—glass vessels of unsent candor—mirrors the dome city above while offering breathable truth beneath; environment charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—"find where lost conversations go"—tightens when the map proves the Archive exists, then deepens when Mira realizes delivery, not collection, is the remaining path. One meaningful deepening suffices; agency stays hers (she folds the map into her pocket, volunteers). Cost is felt: lifelong exposure to surface lies she must now re-enter. Coincidence (grandmother link) complicates rather than rescues.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from specific objects—gilded leaves that never decay versus petals that preserve perishable truth—without sermon. The final image of Mira choosing to carry honesty upward reconfigures "candor in small moments" from passive archive to active endangerment of self. No character articulates a thesis; silence, glass, and the protagonist’s bodily wilt carry subtext.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Mira’s perceptions; perceptual signature visible in "skies the color of spoiled milk" and her tactile obsession with textual fragments. Rhythm modulates—compressed clauses during descent, longer breaths in the Archive—without monotony. No head-hopping; when the elderly caretaker speaks, diction stays external, filtered through Mira’s recognition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varied; sentence openings mix prepositional, participial, and subject-first structures. Information density high—single sentences deliver map function, grandmother hint, and bodily response. No mixed metaphors; "crystalline domes," "spoiled-milk sky," and "gilded-leaf calligrapher" stay within coherent visual field. Minor filter verb in "she felt herself growing smaller" but immediately embodied by physical wilt; no loops or scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Premise—bodily allergy to lies leading to an underground archive of unsent honesty—feels fresh yet inevitable. Greenhouse dystopia + calligraphy + physiological lie-detector synthesizes familiar tropes into specific emotional engine. Risk taken: quiet, non-violent climax where the protagonist volunteers for chronic discomfort; payoff lands through earned bodily cost.</comment>
