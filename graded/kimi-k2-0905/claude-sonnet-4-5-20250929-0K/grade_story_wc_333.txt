<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Mara’s mourning, guilt, and need to know are legible on the page, but they stay at one pitch; there’s no interior contradiction or visible hierarchy of values under pressure. The locksmith is plot-function more than person, so relationship-as-crucible is absent. The sister is only remembered, never staged, so the emotional engine is second-hand. Micro-choices (ribbon decoding, stepping into the nexus) advance plot but don’t force Mara to test a flaw or belief, so the change feels symbolic rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “a new locksmith was born” reweights the city-as-mind premise with visible ontic cost. Causal chain is clean—ribbon → coordinates → descent → book → transformation—yet the locksmith’s earlier powers (materialising without footfalls, speaking in thesis) are never causally tied to Mara’s agency, so some beats feel situational rather than consequential. Orientation is late (who/where locked at ~140 words) but the disorientation is thematic currency and pays off at closure, so the Orientation Test penalty is waived. One micro-turn (streets rotate) tightens options legitimately; no off-stage resolutions.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The “shadowed nexus” is more than postcard: its impossible geometry literally re-orients Mara’s body and denies normal vectors, so setting constrains tactics and charges the final image. Starlight is used as both sensory cue and navigational instrument, keeping description tethered to action. Micro-setting (ribbon, cobblestones, doors) doubles as tool and symbol without stalling momentum. Spatial choreography is tight; no impossible positions or floating rooms.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—free the idea her sister died for—is signalled early and escalates through one meaningful tightening: the rotating streets erase retreat, forcing Mara to decode or be lost. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral—she accepts dissolution of ordinary space—but the price is legible on the page. Agency is present (she walks the combination herself), yet the locksmith’s off-stage omnipotence lightly dilates pressure. Coincidence complicates but never resolves, satisfying lens guardrails.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from concrete image—city as living brain, streets as synapses—rather than slogans; no final-paragraph thesis statement. The “enveloped secrets” motif is recharged when Mara physically steps inside the skull-like room of doors, making abstraction visceral. Subtext of collective denial is carried by silence: no citizen appears, implying complicity. Final image offers resonant ambiguity—new locksmith born, meaning the city will keep ingesting truth-seekers—without moralising.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person focalization stays tight to Mara; no head-hop. Perceptual signature is stable—she notices light, angles, symbols like a mourner scavenging for signs. Rhythm accelerates during nexus rotation via shorter declaratives, mirroring disorientation. Locksmith’s diction is deliberately plate-glass to feel forgettable, a nice risk that serves theme; voice modesty maintained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is generally clean, but two paraphrase loops (“impossible geometry… angles defying architectural logic”) and a stock metaphor string (“dark water… constellations that didn’t match”) slightly dull immediacy. Filter verbs cluster once (“Mara felt her sense of direction dissolve”) but do not obscure causality. No mixed metaphors in peak beat; final sentence lands with crisp image. Information density good; every paragraph advances knowledge or stance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>City-as-synaptic-organism is fresh, and the idea that vanished citizens become its locksmith antibodies feels inevitable in hindsight. Ribbon-encoded coordinates transform a sentimental keepsake into functional key—specific, non-portable invention. Risky choice to make the guide omnipotent yet forgettable pays off by externalising the city’s immune system. Derivative premise guardrail waived: “urban occult portal” is common, but the sister→star→locksmith lineage is particularised.</comment>
