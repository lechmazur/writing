<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maya’s contradictory motives—spymaster pragmatism vs. lighthouse grace—are present but stay summary; we see the duality only in narrated reflection, not in split-second embodied choices. The “decades of fortune writing” backstory is cleanly anchored to the microdot crisis, so her renunciation (turning espionage into hope-bearing cookies) is legible, yet the cost is asserted rather than felt—no trembling hand, no moment of doubt under the lamp. Interiority is specific to her spy-poet lens, but the emotional peak is paraphrased (“she smiled,” “she reflected”), keeping the contradiction cerebral. Enough for earned stasis, not quite for visceral price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final sweep of the beam reweights forty years of secrets into public benedictions; cost is conceptual yet undeniable—the lighthouse will keep sending “everything and nothing” messages, tying Maya to eternal vigil. Causal chain holds: dead contact → microdot under stool → fortune-cipher → UV-sealed cookie → lamp confirmation; each step is because/therefore. One micro-turn—realizing the beam itself is drop-box—tightens options without soft reset. Orientation is clean within 120 words; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lighthouse, lamp room, rocky cliff, fog, and the beam’s rotating slice of ocean are filtered through Maya’s spy-trained attention to pattern and silence; environment guides her decision to hide truth inside banality. Night-time isolation and salt smell compress her perception to the lamp’s rhythm, a living metronome for timing drops. The UV-reactive rice-paste detail gives tactile specificity; setting never stalls for tourist catalog. Beam-as-postbox charges the final image, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—move the microdot without leaving the lighthouse—emerges by line 60 and tightens once: beam = courier. No reversals needed; the ingenuity is using routine (weekly cookie batch) as dead-drop, raising cost of exposure if customs sniffs UV paste. Agency is continuous: writing, sealing, scheduling shipments, decoding blink-reply—all on-page. Price is conceptual—her father’s “stone” fate accepted—but still palpable in the eternal watch she embraces.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—grace hidden inside bureaucracy of espionage—arises from the concrete device: innocuous fortunes carrying state secrets. No character lectures us; the final line “already in your hands” reconfigures reader’s earlier dismissal of cookie chatter into quiet epiphany. Ambiguity lingers: are the random fortunes that comfort civilians accidental or willed by Maya’s cipher? Subtext in the UV numbers and the blink code rewards re-read without moral sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, lyric-elliptical, with rhythmic repetition taught early (“You will find…”, “A journey begins…”) that pays off in the final fortunes. Diction stays inside Maya’s poetic-spy lexicon: “transpose life into a new key,” “calcified him.” No dialogue to judge; narration remains in tight third with modest inference. Filter verbs appear but are voice-motivated (“she thought of all her fortunes”). No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is lean and image-dense; sentences vary in length to mimic lamp sweep. No synonym loops or template cadence. Mixed metaphors avoided—beam as courier is single, sustained vehicle. One minor scaffold: “She began writing” followed by listing three fortunes could compress, but momentum sustains. Opening and closing lines are strong, the latter recharging motif. UV-reactive rice-paste and blink code lend tactile specificity. Clean grammar, unambiguous pronouns.</comment>

<question>8</question><question>8.8</question><comment>Fusing Cold-War microdot espionage with feel-good fortune cookies is non-obvious and executed without gimmick; the premise feels organic because Maya’s father journals seeded the idea early. Risk-taking—using a lighthouse beam as information router—heightens stakes and is cued by her forty-year practice. No close echoes of well-known spy scenes; specificity of lamp-timing and UV paste creates freshness. Conceptual integrity intact: grace-through-secrecy maintained to end.</comment>
