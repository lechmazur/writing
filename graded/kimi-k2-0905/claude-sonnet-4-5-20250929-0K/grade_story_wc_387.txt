<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kenji’s interiority is concrete—weathered fingers, whistle-cadence tied to breath-and-spirit—yet the apprentice remains a thematic sounding board rather than a second pressure source. The net-as-philosophy metaphor is lived, not declared, and his refusal to punish her mistake crystallizes his earned stance. No internal contradiction is dramatized in-scene, so the arc is steady, not torn; still, the cost is palpable in the transferred net and her changed touch. Meets the 9+ test on causality and cost, but the secondary character lacks compensatory flaws, capping at 8.7.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: moon-path spirals, firefly geometries, and net-knots accrue until the bamboo whisk reweights “hidden effort” as sacred. Orientation anchored by word 60; no causality breaks. Closure = Charged Poise: Kenji returns the half-mended net, foreclosing his usual fix-everything path; apprentice’s new intentionality is the visible cost. Whistle and moon-path motifs tighten the final cadence, satisfying the 9+ cost test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Whispering parapet, rain-slick bronze harbor, and firefly traceries filter through Kenji’s net-mender gaze—every sense is vocational, not tourist. Bamboo whisk and tangled net function as micro-settings that constrain finger choreography and philosophy. Spatial choreography is immaculate: bodies seated, net passed, firefly lands on weave. Final image of moon-path across harbor re-uses the parapet height and water surface, charging the closure; thus meets 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: rescue generational knowledge before it unravels. Pressure tightens when the apprentice’s “ruined” net forces Kenji to choose—demonstrate hidden effort or let shame sever the chain. His decision to hand back the half-mended net (visible cost) escalates under Accumulative lens: pattern-break of perfect repair shifts to pattern-reveal of imperfect learning. Enough for 8+ band; lacked a second external consequence (lost catch/ income) that could have pushed higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from knot-to-knot particulars: hidden labor of ancestors, spiral而非straight wisdom, demure audacity of valuing obscurity. No final moral—last image of moon-path on water re-prices the unseen as holy. Subtext carried in gesture: apprentice’s fingers moving “with new intentionality” silently accepts mortality of tradition. Resonant reconfiguration lands via Conceptual Repricing, satisfying 9+.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Kenji’s perceptual palette: “hammered bronze” harbor, “scintillatingly somber” whistle tone—vocabulary never exceeds net-mender poetics. Rhythm mirrors spiral motion: long sentence arcs for moon paths, staccato for knot flicks. No head-hop; apprentice’s interior read through Kenji’s ear and eye. Final paragraph’s cadence reprises opening syntax, creating Charged Poise loop. Distinctive enough for 9+.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Read-aloud ear: sentence variation, paragraph breaths, zero scaffold. Figurative layer is vocational—“nets create strength through pattern”—never over-ornate. No mixed metaphors; moon paths and whisk spirals share geometry, reinforcing theme. One micro-loop: “scintillatingly somber” appears twice; reads as intentional tonal reprise, not artifact. Information-dense lines carry sensory + philosophical payload simultaneously. Closure beat clean; qualifies for high-band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Familiar mentor/apprentice repair scene is refreshed by net-mender philosopher who cites whisk spirals as epistemology. Moon-path navigation and firefly geometry convert trope into cosmological craft lesson. Risk: lyric stillness over plot reversals; risk succeeds because closure reconfigures meaning rather than event. Not fully transformative but particularized enough to approach 9- domain.</comment>
