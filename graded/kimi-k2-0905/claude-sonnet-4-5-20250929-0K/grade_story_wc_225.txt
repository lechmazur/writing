<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Petrov’s chess-teacher reflexes—tracing invisible boards, counting warps/wefts—are vivid, embodied, and motivate every beat. Guilt over the duchess threads cleanly into the present decoding task, giving interior contradiction a tactile outlet. The final renunciation (labyrinth left unseen) costs the explorer’s need for proof, earned by the prior craft-mistake parallel. Micro-choices (finger on green/gold border) reveal hierarchy of values without overt label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the village restarts, Petrov stays still—time’s resumption itself is the decisive change, felt cost is exile reframed as invitation. Causal lens holds: because he decodes “FORGIVE” in the weave, therefore he abandons descent into the maze, crystallizing new stance. Orientation anchored by line 4 (village square, suspended rain, seventeen-year stasis); no head-hop. Cost is legible in the final image—smile accepts perpetual outsiderhood as next gambit.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Frozen rain functions as micro-setting: silver needles outside the guild hall mirror the “woven hush” tension and block exit, forcing interior focus. The tapestry border becomes tool-as-setting; its knots constrain finger placement and letter mapping, guiding every micro-move. Platinum labyrinth is off-stage yet charges closure when rejected—environmental pressure without physical presence. Sensory economy favors metallic, textile, and acoustic textures that feed the POV’s tactical eye.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will he find absolution or further proof of failure?—tightens when the cipher spells “FORGIVE,” flipping quest from external maze to internal stance. Agency is intellectual: each decoded thread forecloses alternate interpretations; final refusal to descend pays visible opportunity cost (mystery remains unexplored). Escalation accumulates under Accumulative/Textural lens: density of knots + thunder nears → pattern break when time restarts. No coincidence resolves conflict; resumption is environmental, not luck.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from craft flaw parallel: tapestry’s frayed edge = tutor’s flawed opening; both hold meaning without erasure. Subtext operates in silence—rain’s refusal to fall mirrors village’s refusal to forget, until collective exhale. Final image (smile in moving crowd) non-literally answers “can exile be home?” without moral. No overt thesis; insight grows from specific textile-chess linkage. Complexity lingers: forgiveness is comprehension, not reunion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person close maintains psychic distance inside Petrov’s tactical mind; perceptual signature is geometric—patterns, grids, knight trajectories—never generic. Syntax is controlled, rhythmic, slightly formal, matching chess-master diction. No dialogue required; internal monologue avoids filter verbs. Figurative language (rain as silver needles) stays within lexicon of metallurgy/tactility. Compression in thunder cadence mirrors accelerating heartbeat without drumbeat monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>High density: “weavers had encoded their secrets generations ago” carries exposition, stakes, and time depth in one clause. Varied sentence length propels decoding sequence; no scaffold loops. Metaphors (platinum labyrinth, silver needles) stay coherent and physical. Opening line anchors voice+concept; final line resolves via image. Minor near-repeat—“woven hush” named twice—but spaced enough to avoid paraphrase penalty. Proofing clean; no typos or tense drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Frozen-time village whose emotional paralysis is literally textile-woven is fresh synthesis of clock-stop and craft-mystery tropes. Chess-tutor reading tapestry-knots as notation transforms familiar code-breaking into embodied strategy—non-obvious yet inevitable. Risk of un-seen labyrinth paid off by conceptual repricing: true maze was self-forgiveness. Specificity (guild cipher, warp/weft count) grounds premise; could not swap “tapestry” for “scroll” without breaking logic. No derivative echo detected.</comment>
