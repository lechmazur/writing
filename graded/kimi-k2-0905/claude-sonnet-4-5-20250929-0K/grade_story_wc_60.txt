<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira’s “luminous skeptic” persona is vivid—her refusal to announce herself, her habit of mapping “possible truths within natural law,” her silence as tactic. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. The only soft spot: the climactic release of memories is watched, not agonized; we see no micro-choice that costs her comfort or certainty, so the arc flirts with observer rather than actor. Still, her stance shift from pure doubt to “doubt that acknowledged mystery” is legible and earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: breadcrumb pattern → fountains → constellation → glass box; each layer deepens density rather than causal chain. Closure is a Charged Poise: the fountains fill, memories disperse, city re-perceived—cost felt in Mira’s evolved skepticism and the city’s reclaimed voice. Orientation clean by word 60; no prop teleport. The slight drag comes from the release beat being narrated rather than physically triggered; still, the final image reweights all prior material with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fountains, leaning buildings, dry basins, migrating geese—every environmental detail is filtered through Mira’s surveyor gaze and mirrors her cognitive state. The seven-fountain constellation constrains the unlocking sequence; the stained-glass box micro-setting charges the final image. Weather (autumn pause) affects timing and goose flight, hence choice. No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography tight.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</question>
<comment>Dominant stake: can skeptical method unlock trapped memory without violating natural law? Pressure mounts by accretion—each breadcrumb narrows next step; the constellation pattern forces cosmic pacing. One meaningful tightening: pressing the seventh glass panel releases the memories and fills the fountains—option space flips from sealed to reclaimed. Cost is conceptual: Mira’s epistemic framework permanently widens, foreclosing pure reductionism.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme—memory as civic water, skepticism as renewable light—emerges through concrete recurrence of fountains and lantern. No moralizing; final line (“questions that glowed brighter than answers”) offers Conceptual Repricing. Subtext operates in gesture: her refusal to speak is both defiance and surrender to wonder. Ambiguity lingers: did quantum law bend, or did pattern recognition suffice? Complexity honored.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person intimate stays locked to Mira; perceptual signature—oil-on-water color shift, “sidereal patience,” “defiant hush”—is consistent and character-specific. Rhythm swells and contracts with action: long clauses for patience, staccato for press sequences. No head-hop. Diction remains within plausible lexicon of scientifically-trained observer. Dialogue absent by design; narrative voice carries subtext without expository throat-clearing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Read-aloud ear test passes: sentence lengths vary, no template cadence. Metaphors (memories like released birds, city holding breath) stay coherent and non-contradictory. Information-dense lines do double duty: “lantern that cast more questions than light” reveals character and stakes. Zero paraphrase loops; no scaffold. Only micro-slip: “like relief itself given voice” edges toward abstraction, but occurs at closure where poetic license is earned.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</question>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: urban-ruin memory-harvest via constellation-cued puzzle box is new. Trope of trapped memory is inverted—liberation restores civic infrastructure rather than personal catharsis. Risk in quiet, accumulative structure pays off: goose pause as cosmological clock, skeptic as midwife to wonder. Specificity of chalk mark → paper crane → star scratch keeps it from feeling schematic. Transformation test: story collapses if Mira is not a methodical skeptic forced into cosmic patience—proof of irreplaceability.</comment>
