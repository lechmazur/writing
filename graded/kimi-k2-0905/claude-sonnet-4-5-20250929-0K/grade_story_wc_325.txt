<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Mara’s promise to Kove’s daughter and her own need for air under pressure give the descent a personal stake; the “compression in her chest” line shows embodied fear. Interiority stays concrete—she counts tide hours, fingers the gold—but the emotional arc is mostly discovery rather than painful contradiction, so the “change” is more knowledge than self-revision. Because no second character shares the frame, status crucible is absent; the score reflects a solid single-POV portrait whose cost is observational, not relational.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara’s camera clicks codify Kove’s erased legacy, and the rising tide re-weights the facility as both tomb and monument; cost is felt in the flooding corridors she must abandon. Causal linkage holds—tide retreat triggers sensor spike triggers camera—so lens is Causal. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) lands by line 20; no misplacement. One loop artifact (“crashing hush” repeated) nicks the top band but does not obscure cause or final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The salt-bleeding concrete and narrowing corridor body the claustrophobic drive; the gold fleck micro-setting doubles as tool and talisman, constraining her to stay and document. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—she notes cable “rubber casings degraded” because her mentor mapped them. Spatial choreography is clean: descent/ascent mirror tide ebb/flow. Environment charges the final image: rising water = unavoidable price, making the facility itself the last witness.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—give Kove posthumous credit—faces a live clock: six hours until flood. Escalation is tide-driven, not character-choice-driven; the tightening is external compression rather than a forked decision she can mis-make. The phase transition forces the camera burst, but agency is reactive; cost is environmental, not moral. Still, the tide’s retreat/flood cadence is coherent and singular, satisfying the 8-band requirement for a visible price that alters options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as “memory is maintained by action, not monuments”—the codex, cables, and camera are all networks that outlive individual voices. No explicit thesis is stated; resonance is in the final image of ocean reclaiming the unmarked station. Medieval margin + undersea cable fusion gives fresh historical depth. Ambiguity lingers: will anyone believe her plates? Complexity is embraced—no moral is spoon-fed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is marine-science precise yet lyric: “compression in her chest,” “information ghosts.” Perceptual signature is tactile—gloved finger on warm gold, degraded rubber—never tourist-catalog. Compression taught early (“crashed hush” = patterned) and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; internal distance stays tight to Mara. Diction stays within her lexicon; no filter-verb clusters. Rhythm rises/falls with tide, climax in staccato camera clicks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Strong information density: one sentence can deliver tide state + sensor spike + emotional jolt. Metaphors are restrained and consistent—network as neural tissue, facility as ribcage. One paraphrase loop (“the facility groaned—a crashing hush...”) costs −0.3; otherwise no scaffold. Sentence rhythm consciously mirrors pressure—short beats during ascent. No register drift; technical terms accurate. Opening line anchors voice and stakes simultaneously; final line resolves by returning image of rising tide.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses medieval illumination with undersea cable myth—fresh, non-obvious synthesis. Risk of “invisible data ghosts” could read as gimmick, but grounded in sensor readouts and codex history so it feels inevitable. Specific detail—gold fleck warm to touch, Roman aqueduct margin notes—prevents abstraction. Transformation test fails if cables swapped to satellites; the cable-as-nerve metaphor is integral. Bold yet coherent; no hedging.</comment>
