<comment>Mara’s interiority is concrete (“confidently uncertain,” thumb rubbing the pen-nib) and her micro-choices (straightening the nib, filling it with ink) visibly mark her pivot from observer to co-author. The endurance/reconfiguration is earned: she accepts living “in the margin between drafts” and pays the cost of forever unstable memory. Minor over-labeling (“true work,” “edited universe”) nudges her slightly toward thesis-speak, not full embodiment, keeping her just under the 8.5+ gate.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final image of writing with the newly-inked pen reweights the premise—history is still being drafted and she now helps write it. Causal linkage holds: the pen’s straightening triggers her decision, and the gravitational bookmark anomaly is revealed as the revision nexus. Cost is legible—“stars blinked in patterns that wouldn’t exist for another century” shows perpetual epistemic loss. One small lens wobble: “contingent relationships” mechanics are stated late, but the pattern is taught early enough via altered star logs to waive a penalty.</comment>

<comment>The observatory tower, sideways-drifting coffee, and the nib-as-worry-stone act as micro-settings that constrain gesture and focus attention. Sensory selection is POV-driven: Mara notices gravitational tug in her “inner ear,” professional filters notice timestamps preceding discovery dates. The gravitational anomaly as metaphorical “bookmark” charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate test. A half-step short of 9.0 only because corridor geography and station layout remain abstract; bodies never risk impossible positions, but spatial choreography is lightly sketched.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—making meaning from cosmic noise—tightens when the signal rewrites her own logs, forcing a choice: resist or participate in the revision. Escalation is textural: each archival overwrite increases density until she accepts co-authorship. The tightening forecloses certainty; cost is the perpetual instability of memory. The turn is single but decisive; entering the 8.8+ band would require a more viscerally felt price (a friendship, a lost record she personally treasured) on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</comment>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: interpretation itself becomes authorship, certainty dissolves into collaborative revision. The fountain-pen motif reprises with altered meaning—first a worry-stone, finally the instrument of authorship—reconfiguring the stake without overt statement. Subtext in gesture (straightening metal while straightening her stance) is efficient. Final-line resonance (“depending on which draft you read”) offers ambiguity that lingers; only the faintest echo of thesis in “true work” keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: gravitational wobble felt in the inner ear, celestial signals as “whispers and stutters,” professional habit of filtering noise. Syntax lengthens in reflective moments, contracts during archival flickers, mirroring Mara’s narrowing options. No dialogue present; narrative voice carries subtext and rhythm cleanly. A hairline slip into lyric abstraction (“a poem being edited”) is voice-consistent and pattern-taught early, so no penalty.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with only minor scaffold: small echo of “different dates, different discoveries” could be trimmed. Figurative language is controlled, never clustering in high-pressure beats. One paraphrase loop (“history flexed like a poem being edited” / “living in the space between drafts”) nudges overlap but serves cadence. Closure image is uncluttered, letting the inked pen scratch carry the weight; hence stays above 8.0 but shy of 8.5+ purity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: retroactive celestial editing reframes the familiar “cosmic signal” trope through textual metaphor, making starlight a palimpsest. The gravitational anomaly as editorial margin is a risk-taking conceptual flip that intensifies meaning without losing clarity. Specificity anchors novelty—the question-mark nib, Tuesday-heavier memories—so the idea feels discovered, not imposed. Only the faint whiff of meta-narrative about “drafts” keeps it just below 9.0 purity.</comment>
