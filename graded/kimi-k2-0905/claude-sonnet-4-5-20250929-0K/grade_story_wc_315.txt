<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Vera’s interior contradiction—need to please Command vs refusal to falsify data—is dramatized through tactile micro-choices (biting buckle, hand dancing across notepad) that escalate with the external challenge. The parachute buckle functions as a physical memory anchor, showing embodied emotion rather than naming it. Final renunciation of revision claim carries visible cost: professional risk expressed in the silent radio click and resumed vigil. Voice stays coherent, flaws intact; moral ambiguity preserved.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because she refuses to rescind her notation, Command ultimately accepts it—the tightening occurs through her sustained resistance. Orientation anchored by 120 words (who: Pattern Seeker; where: aerial arbor platform; when: 2:47 AM). Closure is Earned Stasis—she keeps her notation, loses external validation, cost legible in the solitary pen-resumption image. No causality breaks; pressure rises through each radio exchange.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Nocturnal arbor above clouds is more than postcard: its bioluminescent pulses supply the data stakes and physically isolate Vera, forcing self-reliance. Micro-setting of the glass dome and parachute buckle constrain tactics—buckle calms, dome limits view. Sensory hierarchy tuned to observer priorities: light sequencing, radio static, cold metal. Spatial choreography clean; no impossible moves. Final image of singing trees re-weights setting as indifferent witness, charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</question><comment></grade><comment>Dominant stake—integrity of observation vs bureaucratic doubt—signaled immediately. Tightening happens once: Command’s demand to revise forces her to risk career by confirming original notation; no coincidence, pure stance crystallization. Cost visible: potential station recall, predecessor’s breakdown ghosted. Agency is refusal/attention; path foreclosed when radio clicks off. Sufficient escalation under short-form allowance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from her refusal to bend data—truth-telling as resistance to institutional erosion—without sermonizing. Subtext operates in radio silences and buckle squeezes. Final image of arbor “singing with light” reweights premise: nature’s order indifferent to human trust, yet worth defending. Avoids tidy moral; complexity intact. Could use one more concrete particular to pierce 8-band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Vera’s perceptual filter—bioluminescent “blue-white lightning,” metal edge “bit.” Rhythm compresses under radio tension, then widens during arboreal description, mirroring vigilance cycles. Diction remains within scientist-observer lexicon; no register drift. No dialogue contamination; speech sparse, natural. No head-hopping; distance stable. Elisions (previous observer’s fate) taught early and paid off in her refusal to repeat collapse.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: short bursts during radio beats, longer lyrical flows for arboreal vistas. Figurative language limited to two key images (lightning, silver sea) that reinforce stakes, avoiding purple overlay. Information density high: single sentences convey time, professional protocol, emotional cue. No synonym loops or template cadence. Minor filter-verb clusters (“she felt”) but occur in low-pressure lines; closure image untouched. Opening and final sentences carry sonic echo without drumbeat monotony.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Premise—sky-high bioluminescent forest policed by lone human observer—offers fresh inversion of ground-vs-sky trope. Parachute buckle as memory talisman repurposes standard military object into scientific ritual. Risk taken: quiet refusal rather than explosive climax; choice pays off in earned stasis. Some arbor imagery edges toward familiar eco-wonder; one more specific ecological oddity could push higher. Still, synthesis feels organic, not checklist.</comment>
