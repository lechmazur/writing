<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses—clinging to certainty while craving nuance—are dramatized in her grip on the shard and her decision to clip it to the rail. The embodied cost (her throat tightening, the “garment she’d finally learned to wear”) is specific and felt. The keeper’s “protected vulnerability” is shown, not labeled, in his half-smile and cautious offer. Micro-choice hierarchy is legible: reputation-money-family-uncertainty.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: clipping the hollow shard reframes her vocation from answer-giver to doubt-holder. Cost is visible—the shard stays behind, rainbow fragments left on weathered wood—foreclosing the old business model. Causal chain holds: Vincent letter → doubt → beach shard → lighthouse → unhooking. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by line 8; no ambiguity at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The lighthouse gallery, wind-chime sets, and salt breeze constrain stance—she can’t pace, must listen. The shard-as-micro-setting refracts sunrise onto the deck, charging the final image. Sensory triage—smell of salt, sound of three chimes, feel of worn glass—mirrors her narrowing attention. No postcard listing; every detail is filtered through her need to “unhook.”</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Single dominant stake—can she abandon black-white certainty—tightens when the keeper reframes the shard’s emptiness as “transformed.” One meaningful turn: handing the shard over, then leaving it. Cost is the forfeiture of her lucrative old identity. Coincidence absent; escalation is internal but legible under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from particular: Vincent’s unanswered note, the shard’s refraction, the triple chime overlay. No moral stated; final image of rainbow fragments on wood reweights “certainty” as poverty. Protected vulnerability and sincere insincerity are lived, not asserted. Complexity is embraced—she’s still afraid yet free, wrong yet necessary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Mara; perceptual signature—“hollow mirror shard,” “cloak of doubt,” “sincerely insincere greeting”—is idiosyncratic and consistent. Keeper’s dialogue carries subtext: “Most people wait…” offers ritual, not advice. Syntax flexes with pressure—fragments when she climbs, longer breaths when she listens. No head-hopping, no filter-verb bloat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: short beats for climb, longer cadences for listening. High information density—each sentence adds texture or knowledge. No mixed metaphors; “cloak of doubt” is extended, not dumped. One scaffold trace—“she’d built her reputation on certainty” / “profitable certainty” is purposeful echo, not loop.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>“Conscience for hire” who abandons answers for questions is fresh; wind-chime divination as decision engine is specific to keeper’s lineage. Synthesis feels inevitable: shard’s hollow = space for doubt; lighthouse beam off at dawn = external certainty gone. Risk—quiet ending, no crime reversal—pays off via charged poise. No trope recycling without transformation.</comment>
