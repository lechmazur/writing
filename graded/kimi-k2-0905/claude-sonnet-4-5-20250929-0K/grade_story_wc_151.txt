<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Iris’s interior contradiction—clandestine name-maker now risking exposure with her own true name—grounds every beat; the trembling hand on the brass slot embodies the cost. The micro-choice to trust the children’s chalk code is specific and value-revealing. Yet the daughter remains off-stage, so relationship-as-crucible is inferred not dramatized, capping the upper band. Still, the flaw that drives the mistake (her need for self-reconciliation) is the same one that exacts the price, satisfying earned-stasis logic.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the dawn-gilded arcade, mailbox 47B, and disappearing chalk drawings thicken texture until the envelope drops re-weight authenticity itself. Orientation arrives by line 6; no causal gaps. Closure is a Charged Poise: the letter gone, Iris walks into smog-thick uncertainty—cost is the irreversible exposure felt in the brass snap of the slot. The persistent constraint (surveillance-forced secrecy) is what makes analog mail radical, tightening every beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The golden arcade’s brass columns and amber ceiling are re-used, tactile, and fate-bearing: the same mail slot that once romanticized birthday cards now risks maternal identity. Children’s chalk codes convert floor tesserae into living cipher, literally steering the send/don’t-send choice. Micro-setting—mailbox 47B mouth felt against palm—crystallizes the final image. No description excess; every sensory hit advances stake or tactic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: possibility of filial reconnection vs. total exposure. Pressure tightens once: after the final code check, the only live option is drop or retreat; tactile brass slot makes the cost visceral. Escalation is textural—sunlight and smog intensify alongside internal danger—rather than causal-reversal, fitting the chosen lens. No external antagonist needed; surveillance state remains off-page menace that forces medium choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—authenticity hidden in disregarded margins—emerges through chalk codes, obsolete mail, and Iris’s profession without explicit thesis. Subtext lives in silence: the absent daughter’s unknowing reaction dwarfs any spoken line. Children’s ephemeral art re-prices permanence at closure when footprints will soon erase the very map that kept Iris safe. No moral summary; resonance lingers in the smog she re-enters unnamed to herself.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays snug inside Iris’s perceptual filter—brass taste, chalk cipher, clip-board weight. No head-hop. Syntax flexes: longer reflective sentences in safety, clipped fragments as slot approaches, echoing heartbeat. No dialogue to distort. Occasional elevated diction (“repositories of papered memory”) fits archivist-romantic world; consistent. Voice distinctiveness slightly under 9-band because imageryCould be more idiosyncratic to her psyche.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with tension: three-beat anaphora of “why she’d…” compresses exposition without stall. Concrete nouns (ebony, brass, smog) dominate; adjectives serve not decorate. One paraphrase loop—“the dignity of stamps, the journey through human hands” —redundant but short; no closure contamination. Clean grammar, vivid specificity, high info density; minimal figurative clutter keeps slot-drop image sharp.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: data-age paranoia meets Victorian-era letter tube; chalk graffiti as encryption protocol is genuinely new. Children’s playground becomes espionage interface—risk that pays off. Iris’s occupation flips from client-service to self-service, making profession thematic engine not color. Margins/mail motif avoids abstraction by anchoring to sensory objects (clip-board, brass mouth). Risk heightens meaning without gimmick; no prior template matches this fusion.</comment>
