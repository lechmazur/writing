<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Celeste’s curator identity and reflex to “carry purpose like luggage” give her a coherent through-line; the bread-initial custom dramatizes her need to anchor names before they vanish. Interiority stays concrete—fingers on cold lens, dough under knuckles—but emotional contradiction is only asserted (“rosewater dread”) rather than enacted in-scene. Because no second character shares real-time dialogue, status crucible and micro-choice under opposition are absent; the final thaw is collective, so her personal cost feels diluted. Still, her stance crystallizes credibly: she trades passive curation for active rescue, forfeiting the safety of mere witness.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the emerald lens reframes the ice wall, turning static despair into actionable fracture—an image that reweights the entire premise. Causality holds: because Matthias dies → hives freeze → waterfall ices → city trapped; because Celeste curates loss → she mobilizes artisans → thaw begins. Orientation is swift (grotto, post-freeze, by line 5) and the single transition (museum → streets) is legible. The lens’s earlier discovery in a donation box telegraphs its payoff, so the final image feels prepared, not contrived. Cost is visible: dwindling flour, hoarse singers, bodily cold—resources foreclosed even as hope emerges.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The grotto’s perpetual mist, ice-sealed thoroughfares, and cliff-face hives are tactile and POV-filtered: Celeste notices damp before it ruins pigment, smells rot beneath rosewater. The emerald lens operates as micro-setting, its color shift literally revealing fracture lines that guide the communal thaw. Spatial choreography is clean—kitchen → corridor → artisans’ quarter—bodies and bread tracked without drift. Environment constrains every choice: cold halts glass kilns, dictates lens use, and turns bread into rationed monument. Final image of hairline cracks seen through tinted glass marries outer landscape to inner reconfiguration, meeting the 9+ gate for setting-charged closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will the displaced arts survive?”—is signaled early and tightened when flour stores drop and voices fail. The meaningful turn occurs when Celeste repurposes her curatorial tools (lens, museum authority) into insurgent salvage: she trades spectatorship for leadership, narrowing her own safety. Pressure escalates under Accumulative lens: each artisan loss (beekeeper, candlemaker, puppeteer) layers urgency until the lens reveals actionable fracture—knowledge that reweights options. Cost is legible: every loaf baked spends finite flour, and the thaw itself risks flooding; still, the beat remains one tightening rather than successive reversals, keeping the score below 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: displacement is not a temporary inconvenience but a chronic condition that can only be met by portable acts of naming—bread initials, lens-curated sight. Subtext resides in gesture: offering a “P” loaf to the puppeteer wordlessly argues that identity persists only if performed. The ending refuses moral slogans; the waterfall will flow again, but the city will still be exiled somewhere else—continuity through adaptation, not rescue. Rosewater dread lingers as olfactory irony: sweetness masking decay mirrors culture’s fragile beauty, a note neither resolved nor sermonized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly pinned to Celeste’s perceptual quirks—she catalogues pigments, notes hairline cracks, smells rot beneath perfume—creating a curator’s idiolect. Syntax lengthens during reflection, then compresses into imperative (“Look”) under pressure, mirroring tactical shift. No dialogue appears, so voice contamination risk is zero; interior diction remains consistent with an educated guide who thinks in artifactual metaphors. Occasional loftiness (“historically oriented community”) nudges toward catalogue-speak but stays within a museum worker’s plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and multi-tasking: “bread shaped like initials—a way of saying ‘you exist’” simultaneously world-builds, characterizes, and advances stakes. Metaphors are coherent—ice as museum vitrine, lens as curatorial filter—without mixed-vehicle clutter. One paraphrase loop appears (“displaced persons carried their identities in customs and crafts”) but recovers momentum immediately. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence obscure the final image; the emerald glow on cracked ice lands clean, earning high-band clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The frozen-waterfall city, beekeeper-polinated pigment gardens, and bread-initial funerary custom synthesize into a setting that feels both folkloric and biologically plausible. Using museum curation as insurgent survival tactic reframes the displaced-person trope into active cultural excavation rather than passive lament. The emerald opera glass—an object of itinerant theater—returns as both tool and symbol without feeling grafted; its tint literally reveals escape routes, marrying form to function. While echoes of ice-locked cities exist, the specificity of artisan interdependence and edible nomenclature creates a fresh, non-oblique angle.</comment>
