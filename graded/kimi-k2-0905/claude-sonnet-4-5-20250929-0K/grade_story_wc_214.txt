<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Kael’s quiet renunciation of her former life is dramatized through the ritual of mop-and-log, not told; the contradiction between solitude and cosmic communion is held in scene. Interiority stays concrete (“permeable, present, powerful in her acceptance of smallness”) without therapeutic gloss. The final endurance—keep polishing until systems fail—carries visible cost: she forfeits return, fame, even witness. Only the empathizing-with-meteors beat drifts toward abstraction; a brief filter-verb stack (“She thought about…”) keeps it from the top band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens is taught early—“dust gathered even in the void’s edge”—and held to the Charged Poise closure where lantern-glow + meteor-streak reweight solitude as vocation. One meaningful tightening: the corporation’s bankruptcy auto-payments keep running, narrowing her exit to zero. Cost is legible in the final image: shadow/old self vs light/new self, foreclosing rescue. Micro-turn at “falling was just another form of flying” feels earned because the pattern of traced trajectories has been anchored in repeated tactile acts (mop, log, polish).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Brass fixtures, amber lantern glass, and meteor-silver function as micro-setting; the glass’s flicker in ventilation current directly triggers the closing self-recognition. Spatial choreography stays clean—deck, viewport, database console—without over-mapping. Sensory economy favors light/colour over sound, mirroring the vacuum outside. The station’s forgotten-Belt location constrains choice: no elevator, no rescue, only the option to keep polishing or suicide (she chooses polish).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—remain or abandon solitude—signaled in paragraph 1. Escalation is textural: each meteor logged adds density to the stillness until the final shower forces a stance crystallization (“beautiful. necessary. brief enough to matter”). No external antagonist needed; pressure is entropic decay + cosmic indifference. Persistent constraint: autopayments could stop tomorrow—visible price is her youth spent, hair greying inside helmet reflection (implied), and data no one will read.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the accumulation of logged dust and meteors: value lies in witness, not capture. Subtext operates in the silence between log entries—what she never says to Earth. Final line “universe fall upward into light” offers Conceptual Repricing: surrender = ascension. No moralizing paragraph; resonance is optical, not didactic. The ambiguity of whether she is wasting her life is left intact, deepened rather than resolved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is crystalline: Kael notices particulate drift, microscopic seals, amber spectra—never tourist catalog. Syntax ripples under cosmic scale (“vast spirals while she remained centered”) yet stays janitor-plain (“She’d learned to empathize…”). No dialogue, so voice purity is unbroken. The compression “universe fall upward” is taught by earlier pattern of inverted falling, legitimizing the fragmentary grammar at climax.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm breathes—long sentence for galaxy spiral, short beat “She smiled.” No paraphrase loops; each meteor description adds new angle (iron, velocity, meaning). Mixed metaphor check: “flourishing stillness” is conceptually risky but paid off by botanical metaphor of dust blooming under mop. Minor scaffold: “watching and cleaning, cleaning and watching” is intentional chant; not penalized.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cosmic-janitor premise is fresh, yet grounded in mundane tools (mop, glass). Inversion of falling = flying avoids greeting-card uplift by being traced in data lines and physical polka of light on brass. Risk taken: no plot twist, no visitor, just entropic stillness—yet stakes feel absolute because closure links solitude to cosmic scale. Could swap names, but the fusion of maintenance labor with meteor entropy is specific enough to resist transplantation.</comment>
