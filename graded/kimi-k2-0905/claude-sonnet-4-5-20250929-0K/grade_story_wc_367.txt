<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Kael's interiority is vivid—"laughed not from joy but from the absurdity"—and his embodied storm-call gives a singular bodily signature. Yet the accidentally-prophetic trait is asserted more than dramatized; we hear about past quips rather than feel one combust in-scene under pressure, so the flaw stays ornamental. No contradictory impulse is staged inside the ritual beat; the glass-wick click simply succeeds, so the final turn feels pre-ordained not earned. Still, the occupation-specific lore of copper filaments and Fresnel math lends a memorable worldview that lifts the score above mid-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Closure is a lyrical Resonant Reconfiguration: the backward-illuminating green beam crystallizes Kael's stance with conceptual cost—he must keep laughing to save a world that ignores him. Pattern is taught early by "ancient shadows," paid off when dawn rises green, satisfying Accumulatory/Textural lens. Orientation is clear inside 120 words; temporal uncertainty is motif, not confusion. Micro-drag occurs because the causal trigger for tonight's storm (why 11:14? why now?) is asserted not narrowed, keeping the tightening just short of 8-band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse glass, copper filaments, and Fresnel angles constrain every micro-adjustment; environment literally steers choice. Starlight refraction and storm forks are filtered through Kael's technical gaze, giving sensory hierarchy. "Emerald stars" reprises in the final sentence, charging closure with echoed color. Spatial choreography is clean as Kael climbs, adjusts, and projects; no impossible moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keep the boundary intact—signals early via the clipping quote. Stakes deepen when the light actually bends backward, narrowing Kael's option to perpetual lonely ritual; price is the lifelong sentence of "still laughing, still prophetic." Agency is present—each wick micro-degree is a conscious steering—but externalized in lyric register rather than fraught dilemma, so the cost, while visible, is felt more conceptually than viscerally. Under Accumulative lens the tightening is the single beam that reweights meaning; it suffices for this length, though a second iteration of risk could have pushed higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: legacy media obsolescence vs. living transmission, darkness as instructor. Subtext sits in Kael's laughter—anxiety masquerading as power—never named as such. Final green dawn offers a non-literal answer: the world will keep receiving signals it no longer understands, reweighting earlier "newspaper" extinction. Insight is earned through concrete beam-patterns rather than thesis sentence; only the last paragraph flirts with overt thesis ("tending to an otherworldly routine") preventing 9-band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly fused to Kael's perceptual syntax—"laughing storm herald" diction, technical filaments, storm as addressee. Rhythmic control peaks at "Light erupted...warning, welcome, remembrance, prophecy," where comma-chain mirrors beam-splitting. No head-hopping; POV distance stable. Occasional elevated Latinate phrases ("temporal uncertainty," "conceptual repricing territory") drift above Kael's probable lexicon but read as ritual incantation, acceptable under lyric license.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High information density: each sentence layers action, tool, and metaphysics. No scaffold loops; mixed metaphors absent. One overwritten patch—"patterns that sailors once mistook for omens" followed immediately by "refracting starlight into patterns"—repeats "pattern" without new angle, a minor paraphrase. Otherwise precision shines ("copper filaments that predated electricity"). Closure image is crisp, uncluttered. Final third clean, so 9+ not disallowed.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Premise fuses maritime history with optic physics and meteorological irony—fresh synthesis. "Storms follow laughter" is a delightful causal inversion; "emerald dawn" reprises color as temporal breach. Routine of 11:14 ritual feels discovered, not contrived. Risk in lyric accumulative structure is purposeful, coherence intact. Slight proximity to "green light" Gatsby echo is acknowledged but transformed through lens science, so only a hairline deduction.</comment>
