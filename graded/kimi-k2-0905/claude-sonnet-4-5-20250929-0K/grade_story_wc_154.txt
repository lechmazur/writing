<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Maricel’s translator-habit of staying conscious, her tactile grip on the coral, and the decision to act tomorrow all flow from one coherent interior logic; the smudged-cast decryption is the single visible micro-choice that tilts her stance and forecloses passive acceptance. No contradictory impulse is dramatized on-page, so the 9+ quick test fails by a hair.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the coral’s “ancient convolutions” reweight the entire premise—translation is now a geological, not merely linguistic, act—while the cost (truth may not heal, only endure) is felt in the final image. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: fog → anesthetic → coral accrete meaning until the last line reconfigures stakes without a causal twist.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The atrium’s glass ceiling, fog, and hospital-gurney body form a micro-setting that literally channels Maricel’s narrowed perception; the coral fragment finally “charges the final image” by becoming the map she will follow. Spatial choreography stays clean across the single continuous scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Pressure tightens once: from passive decoding to active commitment. The stake—translate silence into speech—deepens when the encrypted cast implicates a child and a dead uncle; the visible price is the risk she embraces while still anesthetized. Cost is legible, but no persistent constraint shapes tactics beyond tomorrow’s intent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: translation as accretive, coral-like labor against erasure. The final image—“small, patient deposits of truth”—offers a non-literal answer to the core question of whether meaning can survive violence. No overt thesis or moralizing; ambiguity lingers cleanly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate sustains a lyrical, syntactically varied cadence that mirrors anesthetic drift; perceptual signature is concrete (“anesthetic bloom,” “lotus-hearted knowledge”) without purple overload. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Zero loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; figurative language is patterned early (“mist curled like a silk scarf”) and paid off in the coral reprise. High information density—every sentence advances atmosphere, interiority, or plot. Rhythm breathes with the anesthetic sweep, tightening into the final clause.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The coral-as-archive and child-encryption angle feels fresh; the translator-coral isomorphism grows inevitable in hindsight. Risk—lyric anesthetic haze—heightens meaning without obscuring clarity. Could edge higher if the premise were less reliant on familiar “buried-truth” template, but the specific accretive metaphor transforms it.</comment>
