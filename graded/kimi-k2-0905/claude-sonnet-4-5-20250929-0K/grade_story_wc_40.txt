<question>1</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Elara’s reticence and crystalline listening are vivid, but the interior shift from dread to testimony is compressed into a single paragraph of reflection; the cost of speaking feels intellectual rather than embodied. The crystal warms—nice—but we don’t see her pulse or breath catch, so the armor never visibly cracks.</comment>

<question>2</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Closure lands cleanly: Elara chooses testimony, accepting that language must break to bloom—earned, resonant, legible cost under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The sonic library and crystal reweight meaning in the final image; no causal turns are missing, and orientation is anchored by line 7.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The library functions as tuning fork: the chandelier crystal’s hum and dawn light constrain Elara’s method of listening and charge the final image. Shadowed stacks and “amber radiance” are selective, POV-filtered, and evolve with the beat; spatial choreography remains clean in a single scene.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—whether to defend or release language—tightens once: the Council looms, the crystal reveals compression, Elara decides to testify. The cost is conceptual (loss of old words) rather than visceral, but it is legible on the page under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: transformation requires breaking, compression is growth, dictionaries are pressed flowers. No moralizing; the final image of bloom reweights prior motifs without stating a thesis, leaving resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Lyric, hushed third-person stays close to Elara’s selective attention—dust spirals, crystal hum, “rest note in a composition.” Rhythm modulates with pressure; no head-hopping; diction remains within a lexicon a linguist-scholar would plausibly use.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>High density, minimal scaffold; only one paraphrase loop (“language was alive… needed to shed its old skin”) and one register drift toward “conceptual repricing” jargon. Metaphors stay coherent; read-aloud rhythm breathes with the dawn light; no clarity loss at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: linguistic collapse as sonic metamorphosis, library-as-instrument, children as unknowing composers. Risky conceit stays grounded in sensory specifics; crystal’s reprise feels inevitable, not gimmick.</comment>
