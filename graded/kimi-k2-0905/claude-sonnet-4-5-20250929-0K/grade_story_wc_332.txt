<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara’s stubborn grief and methodical obsession are credibly embodied; her decision to “paint herself into the spaces” is seeded by prior camera outings. Yet the interior contradiction—cling to life or dissolve into Theo’s realm—stays summarized rather than dramatized in-scene, so the final leap feels slightly abstract, not fully paid for in visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural pattern is taught early (photograph overlays → light-letters) and lands a resonant reconfiguration: Mara steps into the beam, becoming archive. Causality is lyric rather than tight—each sunrise adds density, not immediate threat—but the closing “charge” reweights all prior images; cost is legible in her forfeiture of corporeal keeper role.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The archipelago’s fog, tide-governed hours, and sea-stack geometry actively constrain when and where Mara can act; the cave only “opens” at one sun-angle, charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered; the lighthouse library and wet watercolor palette feel tactile without tourist clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes are clear: find Theo / keep library / not disappear. Pressure deepens sequentially—failed decryption, dawn chases, cave discovery—but the tightening is textural (overlay finally aligns) rather than a live trade-off; disappearance is embraced, not forced, so cost is poetic, not viscerally tested on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of “longing as traversable medium” emerges through concrete recurrence of light-images and palette; the closing Conceptual Repricing re-weights disappearance as collaboration, not loss. No overt moralizing; ambiguity lingers—will she re-emerge?—but the epiphany feels slightly rehearsed, not hard-won in a single gritty beat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a painterly cadence (“luminous absence,” “watercolors bleeding”) consistent with Mara’s perception. No dialogue; compression and ellipses are pattern-taught and readable. Filter verbs minimal; psychic distance stays close; final shimmer moment is cleanly focalized.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Rhythm modulates with scene temperature—long clauses for fog, clipped for dawn races. Two paraphrase loops (“she understood…” used twice) and one stock intensifier (“impossible archive”) dull final momentum slightly, but metaphor logic stays coherent; no artifact touches the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Inverting the vanishing-twin trope into a procedural about sunrise cryptography feels fresh; light-as-pigment mechanic is specific to place and sibling bond. The “lighthouse library” and “photograph cipher” are memorable hybrids, not off-the-shelf. Risk: lyric dissolution could feel soft, but pattern earns its ending.</comment>
