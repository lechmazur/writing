<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marissa’s curator-caregiver role is cleanly dramatized through micro-choices (arranging chairs, palming the locket, inviting Thomas to speak). Interiority stays concrete, but the “listening heals” thesis is declared rather than lived in her body; the final communal stance feels more symbolically right than individually costly. Still, her discernment drives every turning beat and her calm-sandstorm diction is consistent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: locket → key → mailbox → evidence → communal resolve. Orientation is swift and spatial logic holds as they move courtyard→mailroom. Closure lands with Earned Stasis: they foreclose eviction panic by choosing collective voice; the cost is the long legal fight ahead, felt in Jorge’s “We’ll need a lawyer” and Marissa’s tighter grip on the locket. One minor scaffold: “She’d learned that…listening heals” tells us the premise we already see.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dawn courtyard is sketched with economy—“amber and gold,” tangled bougainvillea—then re-enters as the communal stage where final stance crystallizes. Micro-setting (locket, mailbox interior) constrains literal access and therefore choice. Light recurrence reinforces warmth-with-threat without over-painting. Missing body-as-setting under pressure keeps it from 8.5+.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—collective survival vs. developer eviction—announced early and escalates through shared testimony, each beat tightening legal-cultural noose. Agency is collective: Marissa’s decision to gather and reveal evidence forecloses silence; cost is legible in Thomas’s hush and Abernathy’s tremor. One deepening suffices for 700-word span; coincidence merely seeds, never saves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—community as archive of testimony—emerges through object-lore (locket, mailbox) rather than lecture. Final image of voices braiding into “absolute certainty” reweights earlier solitude without moralizing. Subtext in Thomas’s coffee-shield and Mrs. Chen’s sealed box lets reader feel systemic erasure as intimate loss. Avoids thesis-speak except one “listening heals” line.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Marissa’s perceptual filter: “sandstorm calm,” thrift-shop sensorium of tarnished silver, neighbor voices as texture. Diction shifts register only in Mrs. Chen’s letter, appropriately archival. No head-hop; dialogue beats carry subtext (Thomas’s invisible-plumber insight). Rhythm modulates: long sentence for dawn hush, clipped fragments at mailbox reveal.</comment>

<comment>Prose is lean, image-driven, almost no scaffold; information often doubled (e.g.,“tangled bougainvillea and worn brick arches” does one job). One paraphrase loop: “listening—truly listening—could mend.” Metaphors stay coherent (sandstorm calm, photograph in developing fluid). Mailbox key turn is cleanly sequential; no simultaneity errors. Final line earns cadence echo.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Combines gentrification thriller with antique-object mystery, but emotional engine is testimony circle—fresh synthesis. Locket-as-key feels inevitable once revealed, yet not clichéd. Risk is modest: linear realism, no structural gamble. Specificity of 1970s mailbox retrofit and rent-control arc lifts it above generic “evil developer” tale.</comment>
