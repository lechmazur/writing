<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sarielle’s tactile obsession and alienation feel lived-in; the choice to wear her fingers smooth is embodied cost. Interiority stays sensory, never diagnostic. The single拔高—declaring “everything connected”—is earned by the prior beat-by-beat translation work. No contradictory impulses on stage, but the absence of a second character keeps relationship crucible inert, capping the high band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the canyon’s new permanent song is the Conceptual Repricing of her dead language. Causal chain—touch → diamond refraction → echo harmonics → bird pattern → perpetual acoustic texture—holds without gaps. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within 120 words and are reinforced by tactile cues. Cost is visible in her “fingers worn smooth” and “copper veins dimmed,” satisfying the 9+ cost proof.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Bone towers, diamond, and bird murmurations operate as micro-setting that directly enables the translation tactic; environment is not backdrop but instrument. Sensory hierarchy privileges touch over sight, consistent with Velathi ontology. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly as she moves from tower to tower. The final image of echoes that “never stop speaking” recharges the setting’s acoustic rule-set, meeting the 9+ constraint gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save the language—signaled in paragraph two. One meaningful tightening: the diamond overheats, forcing her to complete the work in a single night; time narrows, options foreclose. Escalation is textural/accumulative under the inferred lens: each translated tower adds harmonic density until the canyon itself becomes speaker. Visible price is dramatized in her depleted veins and abraded skin.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of transmutation—loss into legible resonance—emerges through the tactile-to-sound alchemy rather than assertion. Final image reweights “curse” into “fulfillment” without moralizing. Recurring texture motif (rough/smooth/sharp) migrates from bone to music, charging closure. No thematic echo violations; ambiguity lingers about whether the new chorus is consolation or haunting.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person luminous close stays glued to Sarielle’s perceptual filter; diction remains mineral, somatic, wind-carved. Syntax lengthens during discovery, fragments under bodily depletion—rhythmic modulation tied to pressure. No head-hopping; canyon “echoes” stay externalized sound, not omniscient intrusion. Metaphorical register (“copper-veined hands,” “frozen scream”) is consistent with her metallurgical lineage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sentences carry dual duty—e.g., “Light fractured through its flaw, projecting shadows that danced across the bone towers” simultaneously advances image and acoustic cause. Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. Occasional poetic elevation (“infinite conversation”) is pattern-taught early and paid off, so exempt from register drift penalty. One clause of simultaneity (“quietly articulate in a tongue no ear could hear”) is justified by internal paradox.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Core premise—haptic language transduced by flawed gem into echo-choir—feels non-obvious and inseparable from this canyon. Risk of sentimental “language lives on” trope is averted by making the afterlife a material, audible environment rather than symbolic platitude. Transformation test fails if relocated: bone towers, bird choreography, and copper veins are idiosyncratic to this world. No close echoes of canonical scenes; earns within-band bonus for bold acoustic metaphysics.</comment>
