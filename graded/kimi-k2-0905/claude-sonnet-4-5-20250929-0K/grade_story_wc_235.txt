<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Maren’s interiority is precise—her “chronologically confused” self-diagnosis feels lived, not clinical, and the scroll-keeping ritual dramatizes her coping. The jealousy toward past selves is a sharp contradictory impulse that recurs rather than alternates, and the final act of sealing the scroll is a credible renunciation with cost. Flaws (forgetting, envy, exhaustion) actively complicate every beat. No safety-hedging; her moral ambiguity stays messy.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens declared early via “time was soup now” and held to the last line. Closure is a Charged Poise: the scroll-boxing beat crystallizes her perpetual rewrite without curing displacement; cost is the knowledge that memory itself is just another story. Causality is lyric-patterned, not linear, but the tightening is the density of repeated scroll entries that foreclose the fantasy of coherent autobiography. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) taught by word 50 and never drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The cedar box and sinew-tied scroll function as micro-setting that constrains the final choice; the cabin’s darkness and owl call charge the closing image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: Maren notices ink smell and bark texture because they are her memory technology. Spatial choreography is minimal yet clean—one table, one box, no impossible moves. Weather is used as tonal echo, not backdrop cliché.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can she keep a coherent self-record before total collapse—signaled in paragraph one. Escalation is textural: each scroll entry thickens the soup of time, narrowing the fantasy that any version will stick. The final sealing of box + scroll is an earned renunciation that forecloses the hope of definitive narrative; cost is the acceptance of perpetual re-writing. Agency is expressed through the micro-choice to keep writing despite knowing its provisionality.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges from the repeating image of the scroll as both lifeline and lie: memory as editable palimpsest. No explicit thesis; the final line “That’s why she kept writing” is an action-capsule, not a moral. Subtext operates in silence—no mention of terror, yet terror saturates the owl-dark. Feral nostalgia is never labeled again after intro; it is enacted via jealousy toward airborne past selves.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: temporal displacement rendered as synesthetic soup, ink made from future YouTube, gravity obeyed only in dreams. Rhythm modulates from long liquid sentences to the staccato of “Time was soup now.” No dialogue, so voice purity remains un-contaminated. Free-indirect slides cleanly between clinical detachment and savage longing without filter-verb clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often performs scene-setting, backstory, and metaphoric re-weighting (“Tonight she reviewed her own dreams…”). Figurative language is patterned and paid off—soup, origami, thread—never stacked in pressure beats. No synonym churn or template cadence; openings vary. Minor scaffold: “edges curling like dried leaves” is familiar, but it is the only cliché and occurs early.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: lucid-dream chronicler + temporal displacement as occupational hazard. The scroll as both memoir and future artifact re-weights the familiar death-date trope. Risk—lyric accumulative structure—heightens coherence without gimmickry. Specific detail (birch ink, deer sinew) prevents generic anywhere-setting.</comment>
