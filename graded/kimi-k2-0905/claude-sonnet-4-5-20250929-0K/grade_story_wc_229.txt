<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira’s vocation-driven motive is crisp; her “screaming tenderness” test fuels every beat. Interiority stays concrete (“pressed her forehead against the cool glass”) and her micro-choice to shorten the pulse interval crystallizes values under pressure. The Cost Proof Test is met: Thomas’s slow nod is a social price—public admission that louder failed. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in scene, so the 9+ gate fails by a hair.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the heartbeat-light re-weights the safety protocol forever. Causal linkage holds: scent → captain leans in → course corrects; lighthouse pulse keeps the because/therefore chain. Cost is legible in Thomas’s weathered face shift. One scaffold loop—“the wind carried away the last traces… but its message lingered”—clips the top band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cobalt paint, salt-worn glass, and iron railing vibrations are handled, not catalogued. The lantern room’s spatial logic is tracked cleanly through the captain’s tilted face and the rocks beyond. Micro-setting (vial cork, iron stairs) constrains Mira’s stealth preparation. Environment charges the final image: the lighthouse shifts from fortress to open hand.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove whispers beat shouts—tightens when Thomas reaches for the fog-horn and Mira risks professional ridicule to stop him. Single meaningful turn: scent + heartbeat pulse forecloses the “louder” tactic on the spot; cost is Thomas’s conceded authority. No coincidence resolves; captain’s correction is agency-driven response. Escalation is modest but sufficient for 700-word frame.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of rescue logic: softness as ferocity. Subtext lives in gesture—Thomas’s hand hovers, then withdraws—and in the final lighthouse pulse that reconfigures “safety” itself. No explicit thesis; the image of open hands versus grasping fists lands non-literally. Minor deduction for “Sometimes tenderness screams loudest in its silence” echoing prompt language.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Mira’s sensorium; perceptions are filtered through lighthouse keeper idiom (“vibrations of intent”). Diction is precise yet salt-stained: “salt-worn,” “honey-thick perfume.” Rhythm breathes with scene tempo—long sentences for heat, staccato beats at midnight. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is nil.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings avoid template cadence. Information density is high—each polishing stroke doubles as meditation. One paraphrase loop (“its message lingered… waiting with open hands”) docks 0.2. No strained metaphors or register drift. Figurative language is spare, pattern-taught by grandmother’s lore, and pays off in the final pulse.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The inversion of rescue protocol—perfume instead of horn—feels fresh yet inevitable. Details are particular to maritime night-work: pulse intervals, navigation lights, iron stair resonance. Familiar trope (lighthouse salvation) is tilted by olfactory guidance rather than beacon alone. Risk is moderate; innovation is conceptual more than structural, holding the score just below 8+ excellence.</comment>
