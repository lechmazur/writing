<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Celestine’s interior arc—chaste courtesan who reclaims voice—lands cleanly; her bodily-poetic finesse and micro-choices (kneeling to untangle threads, arms wide under the singing shards) are dramatized with cost. Her contradictory hunger for both beauty’s cage and disruptive truth remains felt in the breath between sigh and smile. Only minor flaw: “living sculpture of restraint” flirts with label-speak; it is brief and does not undercut the earned laugh that ends her arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is an unmistakable Resonant Reconfiguration: the prism sanctuary explodes and releases trapped voices, reweighting the palace’s rule-set and Celestine’s identity. Causal chain holds: each untangled thread tightens stakes until the final pull collapses the web—visible, sonic, irreversible. Orientation is anchored by word 40; no lens ambiguity. Cost is on-page: she laughs amid falling crystal shrapnel, conducting a now-audible rebellion. Minor time-skip “three nights ago” is cleanly cued; does not break continuity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Silver courtyard, starlit snow, and prism sanctuary are not postcard scenery—they constrain movement and perception; the crystalline pavilion literally frames her access to the web. Micro-setting (her silk robe hem dragging fresh snow, the prism’s refracted colors guiding her finger placement) shapes the untangling choreography. The final image recycles the “silver courtyard under snow” line as charged echo, now stripped of serenity, satisfying the setting-to-closure gate. Only hedge: “like scattered diamonds” is familiar snow glitter; it passes unnoticed amid denser particulars.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—liberate suppressed voices or remain complicit—tightens through the physical act of untangling; each freed thread audibly raises palace-wide stakes. Escalation is Accumulative/Textural: density of echo-voices grows until they drown the lullaby. One meaningful turn at final pull strands Celestine between imperial wrath and conductor’s triumph; cost is the loss of her protected courtesan status, felt in the instant she chooses laughter over silence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—silence as compliance, art as insurrection—emerges through concrete particulars of echo harvest and web untangling, never sermon. The prism sanctuary’s refracted colors re-weight from decorative trick to weapon of memory, giving a non-literal answer to “what is beauty for?” Avoids tidy moral by leaving the palace’s fate unresolved; only the soundscape is changed. Alarming serenity motif modulates into joyous cacophony without authorial commentary, earning resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays pinned to Celestine’s perception; diction (“bodily poetic,” “harvest of echoes”) is hers, not authorial. Syntax lengthens and compresses with tension; no filter-verb clusters. Dialogue is absent by design—silence theme—so no voice-convergence issues. Final laugh is reported through her body language, preserving perceptual modesty.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and rhythm; high information density (e.g., “Each strand represented a suppressed voice, a denied dream…”). No looped stems, mixed metaphors, or paraphrase restatement. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and payoff without scaffolding. Metaphor strings (“lullaby of conformity,” “beautiful corpse”) are purposeful and pattern-taught early; they pay off in the final sonic rupture.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The echo-harvest spell reframes familiar “rebel in opulent court” into sensory inversion: palace beauty feeds on erased voices. Bodily-poetic courtesan as saboteur of an aesthetic totalitarian web feels specific, not archetype swap. Conceptual risk—lyric explosion instead of armed revolt—reweights meaning without diminishing stakes. Proximity check: no close echoes to canonical scenes; silver-prism imagery is fresh.</comment>
