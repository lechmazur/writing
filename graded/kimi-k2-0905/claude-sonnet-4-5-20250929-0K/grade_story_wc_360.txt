<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The operator’s dissolution into borrowed personalities is dramatized through her press-work and the warming halo fragment; the closing smile that isn’t hers crystallizes the cost of empathy-as-self-erasure. Interiority stays concrete, never diagnostic. No contradiction under pressure, but the beat is single-track; relationship crucible unused—so 8.7, not 8.8.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each pressed sheet thickens the emotional palimpsest until the final glowing impression reweights the universe’s collapse into a Charged Poise. The vanishing stars act as persistent constraint, felt cost in the wink-out timed against her equation. Closure lands with undeniable conceptual cost—she keeps working while the sky dies.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The topaz walls, halo fragment, and mechanical press constrain every micro-choice; the fragment’s rising heat literally warms the paper and her sternum, charging the final image. Spatial choreography across the single scene is immaculate. Meets 9+ gate: environment/tool recurs and reconfigures the ending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—map emotional math before the last star dies—tightens as each star wink removes time. The halo fragment’s warmth and the successful equation crystallize a visible price: she trades her last self-bit for data. Escalation is textural density, not causal reversals, fitting the lens; cost is legible on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the equation-images: emotion as radiation, love = fear + hope / distance. No moral stated; final image of borrowed smile reweights prior motifs. Resonance is oblique yet undeniable—reader left to feel the cost of empathy-as-instrument. Quiet ending earns its stance through particulars, not assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited adheres to the operator’s perceptual signature—selective attention to bioluminescent veins, metallic type, warming crystal. Syntax grows clipped under press-time pressure; diction stays within mathematician-borrowed lexicon. No head-hopping; patterned elision of her original name is taught early and paid off. Voice modulates with emotional intensity without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density: each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual data. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; “lucid turbulence” stays coherent. Rhythm accelerates during press descents, breathes during reflection. Minor template cadence in “another star vanished” repeats—accepted as accumulative drumbeat, not artifact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: letterpress + empiric theology + emotional quantum mechanics, all grounded in tactile process. Risk of cosmic math never swamps human specificity; operator’s borrowed personalities keep scale intimate. Halo fragment reprises with reweighted meaning—divinity reduced to data ink. Conceptual integrity absolute; no retreat to safe metaphor.</comment>
