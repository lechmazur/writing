<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Marcus’s interiority is concrete—bead burning in palm, knees in soil—and his renunciation (“I release you”) is embodied, not abstract. Eleanora’s contradiction (love vs. immortality) is stated more than dramatized in present action; she observes, never chooses again. The generational bead as inherited flaw is specific, but the bloodline motive is told in a single expository lump. Still, the final act costs Marcus his heirloom and ancestral guilt, a visible forfeit that satisfies Earned Stasis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: bead hum leads to door, soil burial leads to dawn. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“alchemical orchard greenhouse… winter-cracked fields”). Closure is a Decisive Change—night becomes morning, apples ripen, ghost released—paid for by the bead’s burial and ancestral forgiveness. Cost is legible in the lost relic and the irrevocable shift from eternal night to daylight; no late rule changes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The greenhouse functions as micro-setting: glass fogged, silver apples, mercury-rose scent all constrain what can happen; only burial in its soil can restart dawn. Winter-cracked fields outside mirror the stalled season inside, charging the final thaw. Spatial choreography is clean—door, aisle, oldest tree, soil. The setting’s rule (endless night) is broken by the specific act, so the environment directly shapes the outcome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—free the ghost or remain cursed—is signaled immediately. One meaningful tightening: bead’s hum escalates from curiosity to unavoidable choice once Eleanora appears. Cost is visible—the heirloom lost, night becomes day, family debt erased. Agency is Marcus’s kneeling burial; no coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without moralizing: love offered, not stolen, completes immortality. The silver-to-gold apples reweight the premise, showing formula unfinished until forgiveness is given. No character articulates a thesis; the final image of dawn carries the conceptual repricing. Ambiguity remains—what immortality now means for Marcus is left legibly unresolved.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly lashed to Marcus’s senses—temperature drop, bead pulse, scent of mercury/rose. Syntax grows shorter under pressure (“He knelt… I release you.”). Eleanora’s voice carries archaic diction (“lovingly venomous”) distinct from Marcus’s quieter interior. No head-hopping or register drift; final line lands in resonant image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is mostly clean, high density: “temperature dropped like a stone into dark water” does double sensory work. One mixed-metaphor risk—“wedding gown the color of cremation smoke”—remains vivid and coherent. No loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts are purposeful. Opening and closing sentences frame and resolve with cadence shift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Alchemic-ghost-in-greenhouse is familiar gothic territory, but the bead as inherited apparatus-piece and the dawn-for-forgiveness swap feel particular. The“lovingly venomous”phrase refreshes the femme-fatale alchemist trope. Risk is moderate—relies on ancestral curse—but the specific sensory palette and the cost of losing the relic keep it from feeling templated.</comment>
