<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira’s guilt-driven interiority is concrete—heartbeat counting, ink spills, shard placement—yet the “six-hours-dead” backstory feels author-engineered rather than lived; the pacemaker glitch is sketched in one clause, never re-enters her body-under-pressure. The final pivot from “I killed him” to “I assisted his courage” lands cleanly but relies on a recovered file rather than an on-scene micro-choice; the porcelain shard reprise supplies symbolic poise yet no new physical risk. Emotional progression is credible: trembling fingers → stillness at ribs; still, the hospital bureaucracy nightmare stays abstract, muting the flaw-to-value crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira’s reinterpretation of Chen’s sacrifice reweights her guilt into assisted courage, with felt cost—tears freeze, fingers cease counting. Causal chain holds: ink pattern → software trick → file recovery → revelation. Orientation anchors within 120 words; snow-muffled observatory is clear. No lens ambiguity; pattern recognition motif is taught early and pays off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Selective sensory layering—opal dome catching moonlight, cathedral silence of snow, ink’s organic fractal—mirrors Mira’s narrowing attention. The observatory’s cold and the shard’s glint constrain her ritual choices, charging the final image. Professional astronomy detail is light but plausible; no continuity errors. Micro-setting (shard) functions as setting and charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—guilt vs. absolution—signaled early; pressure tightens when standard recovery fails and ink ritual becomes last option. Escalation is accumulative: each ink spill deepens stakes rather than reversing them. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral—loss of self-blame—but legible on page. No external antagonist; internal conflict suffices for length.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: porcelain shard moves from relic of failure to emblem of reinterpreted courage. No explicit moralizing; final line’s “whole in its brokenness” offers conceptual repricing. Subtext operates in silence—heartbeat cessation equals acceptance. Ambiguity lingers: Chen’s heroism doesn’t erase Mira’s pain, avoiding tidy redemption.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature—mathematical counting, fractal seeing—stays consistent. No dialogue, so no voice convergence issue. Prose rhythm breathes with night-long ordeal; occasional lyrical uplift (“opal observatory gleamed”) fits contemplative mode without purple drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence detected. Figurative language is spare, used only when image advances knowledge—“pearl half-buried in white” anchors dome visually. One paraphrase loop: “corrupted files blinking error messages” repeats concept in adjacent clauses (−0.2). No mixed metaphors; register stays within Mira’s scientific lexicon.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fusion of death-certificate glitch with cosmic pattern recognition feels fresh; ink spill as defrag map is novel yet credible within chaos-theory frame. Risk taken: quiet, introspective SF with no antagonist or physical danger, but coherence rewards risk. Premise is transformed through Mira’s specific guilt ritual, not generic trauma narrative.</comment>
