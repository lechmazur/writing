<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Moth’s erased identity and intensified empathy supply a sharp, embodied contradiction; her chalking is never abstract but a tactile groping for self. The old man’s fleeting recognition and her immediate “Don’t speak it” crystallize a micro-choice hierarchy under pressure. Cost is felt: every stroke consumes the last chalk and the last chance to anchor others. The renunciation of speech for mandala-feeling is a credible, scaled foreclosure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the emergent hush reconfigures collective stakes without restoring memory, cost felt in the warm tile and the unspeaking circle. Causality holds—because she chalks, the hush coalesces—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is clean by line 4; the single transition (arrival → gathering) is legible. No late convenience breaks the lens; the persistent constraint of vanishing names tightens to the last breath.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: the grotto’s cupped limestone and dawn-mist lilac directly shape the acoustic mandala and the emergent hush. The tile flake’s resonance is a tactile extension of the walls, constraining her method. Tourist histories and echo physics are learned through chalk, not exposition. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly as strangers enter and form a ring without blocking the pattern.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—collective meaning amid erasure—is signaled in para 1 and tightens once: speech renounced for pattern-feeling forecloses the last mode of recall. Escalation is accretive: each chalk stroke consumes finite pigment and narrows the possible next stroke. The cost is visible—chalk dust on knees, the old man’s hollow eyes—altering tactics (no naming, only feeling). Agency remains hers even as crowd grows; coincidence only complicates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges bodily: memory is not retrieved but re-sculpted in shared silence. Subtext lives in gesture—tile pressed to temple, chalk circling inward—never stated. Final lilac mist reframed as sacred hush reweights the initial unease without moralizing. No echo is token; each whisper bends the pattern’s geometry.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person intimate carries a consistent lyric compression: “memories flaking like old paint” is perception-filtered, not ornamental. Psychic distance modulates—wide at grotto mouth, tight at chalk tip—under emotional intensity. No head-hopping; crowd breathes as one instrument. Filter verbs serve voice (“she could sense the shape”) and stay legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Strong density—simultaneous world-building and interiority in single strokes: “limestone curved inward like cupped palms.” Rhythm breathes with scene: long sentences for mist, staccato for chalk taps. One mixed metaphor—“unease turned sacred”—is minor, doesn’t cloud closure. No loops, no scaffold; final line is clean propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: collective amnesia met by acoustic cave art. Risk of lyric collective POV pays off by making crowd a single resonating instrument. The mandala as anti-archive is non-obvious yet inevitable. No derivative echoes; lilac mist and chalk acoustics feel native to this world alone.</comment>
