<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marta’s interior contradiction—chess strategist blithe about death yet rocked by a single loss—lands as a concrete, embodied tension. The micro-choice to drive to the cobalt silo instead of the graveyard she tends crystallizes her new risk stance. Her earned renunciation tomorrow—visiting the seven mis-remembered graves—pays the cost of abandoning her former detachment, forged through the tapestry decoding sequence. Voice stays singular, no head-hop, but limited tactile use of sovereign case keeps her from 8-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: a Conceptual Repricing that re-weights “blithe organization” into a duty to exhume buried truths, at visible social/ relational cost tomorrow. Causal lens holds—chess failure → midnight silo decoding → seven graves. Orientation anchors (who/ where/when) arrive before 120 words; no penalty. Flag droop image early teaches pattern for the later tapestry flagging; velveteen gloom reprises as earned texture.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The cobalt silo functions as embodied setting-object: its peeled spirals mirror tapestry border and physically direct Marta’s lantern-lit decoding session. Velveteen darkness inside smothers sound, forcing tactile tracing of symbols—constraining how discovery happens. Moonlit cemetery gate glimpsed from car exterior supplies orienting beacon; cobalt structure’s cosmic-finger image charges the final rooftop stargaze beat. Setting matters to tactics; no micro-object apart from sovereign case, so 9+ gate fails.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will Marta keep her cheerful distance or shoulder hidden histories—rises when chess defeat proves her pattern-seeing blind spot, pushing her to the silo investigation. One tightening suffices: realization that “tenderly organized” border marks seven wrongly recorded graves forecloses option to stay detached, exacting tomorrow’s fieldwork cost. Escalation causal under lens; no coincidence rescue. Stakes remain personal yet gain moral weight through grandmother’s legacy.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story’s theme—that the living’s intentions lurk messier than the dead’s—emerges through Marta’s shift from blithe gardener to archivist of erased lives, never stated but dramatized via tapestry decoding. Motifs (chess clock, peeling paint spirals, sovereign case) recur only when they constrain her method or charge final resolve. No sermonizing; final rooftop vigil offers charged poise rather than moral. Subtext of gold coins hints at payment for truth without exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyrical, controlled free-indirect prose (“velveteen gloom,” “cosmic lips”) sustains a hushed, star-salted tone without purple swell; perceptual signature filters every detail through Marta’s strategic, pattern-seeking eye. Rhythm modulates: long sentences for reflective pulls, fragments at decoding discoveries. No dialogue to test, so voice coherence judged solely on interiority, which stays precise. Compression (“thread-bleeding ink”) teaches reader to anticipate frayed evidence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Most sentences carry double duty (image + causality: “peeling in spirals that reminded her…”). Sparse filter verbs, no scaffold loops. One mixed metaphor—“finger pressed to cosmic lips” beside “drooping confession”—barely tolerable but reads intentional. Opening and closing lines anchor and echo without template cadence. Minimal modifiers favor concrete nouns (“cobalt silo,” “marigolds”). Proofing clean; zero artifact interference at closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Fusing chess blunder with cemetery-cipher mystery through tapestry border code offers fresh synthesis; not a stock cozy mystery. Concept of “tenderly organized” mis-burials flips nostalgia into ethical labor. Sovereign case as possible payment key retains ambiguity without gimmickry. Risk in lyric density pays off without obscuring causal chain. Specificity—spiral paint echoing embroidery—grounds originality in tactile detail rather than abstract quirk.</comment>
