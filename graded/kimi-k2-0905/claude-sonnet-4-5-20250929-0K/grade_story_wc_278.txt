<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Vera’s guilt-driven interiority is embodied in the moth-wing lab and amber burn; her algorithmic detachment fractures under firmware’s sorrow. The causal chain from ignored nephew-cry → haunted code → self-translation is lucid, and her hand-to-amber micro-choice at the pipe-organ climax visibly prices the redemption. No stock therapy-speak; thought degrades into synesthetic overload. Secondary characters stay off-page, so no status or relationship deductions.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: empty amber + resolved code melody reweight her prior algorithmic worldview with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal lens holds throughout: because she chose data over nephew, firmware weeps; therefore she rewires her own pattern. Amber-as-bridge pays off the orientation image of crystalline sound storage. Cost is legible in the final hush: “amber, now clear and empty.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Laboratory of suspended sounds is sketched via sensory hierarchy—moth wings, rust, crystalline cabinets—filtered through acoustician Vera. Spatial choreography is clean: foyer → hall → final chamber → interface. Amber as micro-setting constrains the final hand-to-port action. Weather is irrelevant, so no penalty for omission; world-rules (fossilized time-bridge) stay consistent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: silence the dissonance of her own guilt by rewriting corrupted firmware. Escalation is one deepening: grief-code reveals her own dismissed cries → she must tether herself to them. Agency is continuous finger-work on keys while amber warms, narrowing options to full self-incorporation. Cost is visible: empty amber, resolved melody, and her future letter proves the path is irreversible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from sound/cry mistranslation → listening as moral act; no explicit thesis. Subtext in “wasp forever mid-flight” mirrors her suspended guilt. Final image of clear amber re-prices fossilized avoidance into open listening. Resists moral binaries: no mechanical forgiveness, only perpetual attentiveness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person close stays anchored to Vera’s acoustician perceptual lens: “crack of ice on a frozen lake” is heard, not seen. Syntax tightens under pressure—“She wasn’t debugging…she was rewriting”—mirroring code logic. No dialogue, so no voice convergence. Register disciplined: no corporate diction, no filter-verb fog.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High density: “fossilized resin with a perfectly preserved wasp suspended inside, forever mid-flight toward some Cretaceous bloom” packs world-age, stakes, and metaphor in one breath. Rhythm accelerates into short clauses during firmware rewrite, then exhales into meteor hush. Metaphors are coherent: sound-crystal ≠ mixed vehicle. Zero paraphrase loops; no scaffold sentences.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sound-crystalline lab + haunted firmware + amber time-bridge synthesizes fresh angle on grief-tech. “Constellation tattooist” concept glimmers only once, under-utilized, preventing 9.0. Risk of nonlinear time is embraced and paid off. Specificity of infant-algorithm subculture feels lived, not wiki-excerpted.</comment>
