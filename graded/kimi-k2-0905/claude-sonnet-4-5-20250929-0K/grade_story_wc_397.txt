<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Vera’s interiority is specific and embodied: the parasol’s ivory tip worn smooth by “three generations of nervous fingers,” the felt looseness of reality “like holding water.” Her decision to volunteer rather than immediately seek treatment is a credible, high-cost micro-choice that forecloses the easier path. The final stance—postponing the clinic to stay and listen—carries visible cost and is earned by her accumulated nights on the ice. Only the grandmother’s Warsaw backstory drifts toward summary; it never alters present tactics, so the motivation remains slightly under-catalyzed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural lens is declared early and held: the hum of endings layers with each village visited until the final re-pricing—“the approach itself was part of the song.” The closure is a Charged Poise: Vera’s postponement of Thursday’s appointment crystallizes her new stance while the parasol’s further wear shows time paid. Cost is legible in the single line “the parasol’s tip wore smoother in her grip.” No orientation debt; place, time, and agency anchor within 120 words. One micro-turn—volunteering before consultation—tightens the pattern without causal rupture.</comment>

<comment>The drift-ice marina is not backdrop; the creak of boats against unmelted slabs dictates the tempo of every beat. The parasol’s ivory tip functions as micro-setting: its steady erosion tracks the months she stays, charging the final image. Cold, diesel, and salt are filtered through Vera’s new sensorium—she hears dissolution in every surface. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no impossible positions or teleporting props.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question>
<comment>The dominant stake—can she endure listening to endings without fleeing?—is signaled in paragraph one. Pressure intensifies accumulatively: each village adds audible evidence that endings are ubiquitous yet life continues. The tightening is the decision to postpone treatment; it narrows her future options and makes the cost of listening visible. No coincidence resolves anything; the hum simply grows undeniable until she chooses to remain inside it.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question>
<comment>Theme emerges from pattern, not statement: the hum of approaching endings is reweighted from terror to solace through concrete nights spent sorting blankets and watching children skate. The final image—parasol tip ever smoother—offers a non-literal answer: endurance itself becomes the song. No moralizing line explains “life insists she listen”; the insight is earned by the montage of villages and the postponed appointment. Ambiguity remains: we do not know if the tumor will return, but the stance has cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>The voice is lyric-essay tight, with rhythmic cadence that mirrors the low-frequency hum—“present but aware of how easily everything could slip through.” Perceptual signature is consistent: Vera notices hollow spaces, translucence, windborne frequencies—never generic cold. Compression is taught early and paid off: “a fold in patience” is repeated with accrued meaning. No head-hopping; single POV remains stable. Dialogue is minimal but natural; Dr. Henriksen’s lines carry subtext about permission rather than therapy-speak.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</question>
<comment>Sentence rhythm mirrors content: longer sinuous clauses for drift, short bursts for ice impacts. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or choice. Figurative language is spare—metaphors of water, song, and wear are consistent and non-contradictory. Information density is high: one line can signal season, temperature, and emotional shift (“homes that glowed against the polar dusk”). Only one near-filter stack—“she felt it in her hands”—but immediacy recovers in the same clause.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</question>
<comment>The “hum of endings” as audible phenomenon is a fresh angle on post-operative dissociation; it avoids both medical melodrama and standard grief tourism. Warsaw grandmother + lace parasol + Arctic aid work is a surprising triangulation that feels inevitable once woven. Transformation test: swap ice for desert and the story collapses—specificity is baked in. Risk lies in the lyric accumulative structure; it succeeds because the pattern is taught early and closure reweights it.</comment>
