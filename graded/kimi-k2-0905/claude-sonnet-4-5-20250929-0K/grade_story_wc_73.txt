<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mara’s “grim optimist” interiority is concrete—she repeatedly calculates escape yet crawls back to risk. Her contradictory fear-of-failure / hunger-for-discovery is shown, not told, and drives the sideways step into void. The dice micro-choice in pocket and roll under pressure crystallizes values. Cost is felt: she wakes with email drafted, path foreclosed, reputation on the line.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each stair climb because she fled her proof; Castellano appears because her guilt summons him; sideways leap therefore ruptures loop. Anchors clear by line 4. Closure unit (CR): pressing “send” reprices her rule-set— career safety traded for reopened rupture-risk—conceptual cost undeniable. One causality blip: dice roll defying gravity is over-ruled as dream logic without pre-cue, but dream frame taught early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The Escher-esque staircase and body-as-micro-setting constrain every move; “cold stone against legs” grounds abstract space. Sourceless light and echo create texture without checklist overload. Setting evolves: step → void → office desk, each shift causally linked to her decision. Dice as recurring object charges final image, but environment never alters tactics as much as psyche; hence 9+ gate missed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—escape lifelong cowardice—signalled in paragraph 2. Tightening occurs when Castellano declares “stop trying to calculate,” forcing her first non-analytic move; cost legible in post-fall bruised psyche. Agency drives every beat: climb, roll, sideways leap, send. Pressure coherent under causal lens, but only one real escalation; second plateau rather than further spike.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: perpetual motion as metaphor for obsessive regret; dice chip = acceptable imperfection. Final image of finger hovering then hitting “send” offers non-literal answer—risk over perfect equilibrium. No sermonizing; insight earned through stair ordeal and dice roll. Subtext in silences (Mara wordless before leap) and gesture (pocketing dice) deepens resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Mara without head-hop. Perceptual signature—physics equations as “musical notation,” gravity as negotiable—remains consistent. Syntax shifts with stress: short clauses during void-fall. Dialogue sparse but distinct: Castellano’s “You’re trying to calculate your way out” carries professorial cadence. No filter-verb clutter; psychic distance controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose breathes: paragraph lengths vary, openings rotate. High density—“equations balanced perfectly on paper, a symphony of variables that danced”—does multiple jobs. One scaffold loop: “without destination, without rest, without decay” triplet could compress. No mixed metaphors, no artifacts in closure beat. Rhythm accelerates into fall, slows into office wake-up, matching emotional arc.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fusion of surreal staircase with physics guilt feels fresh; perpetual-motion-as-purgatory twist is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Specific detail—dice chip altering probability—grounds speculative frame. Risk taken with dream logic, but pattern taught early and closure remains legible. Emotional core (fear of scientific failure) is universal yet individualized; avoids stock “imposter” cliché by linking to fundamental-force terror.</comment>
