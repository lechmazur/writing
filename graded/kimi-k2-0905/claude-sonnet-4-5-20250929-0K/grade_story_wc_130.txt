<comment>Elara’s contradictory drives—mathematician’s need for proof vs. conjurer’s surrender to ambiguity—are alive in every beat; the decision to keep planting without final proof is earned by the prior ritual with the glass eyes, paying a visible cost of perpetual uncertainty. Interiority is concrete, never diagnostic (“she felt grief” becomes “theorems whispered into darkness”). The glass eyes act as an externalized blind spot: she can’t know what they see, mirroring her epistemic limit. Flaw persists: she never tests the prime-shadow code against an outside witness, so the renunciation feels solitary but not dangerously mistaken—acceptable at this length.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the parallel orchard image reweights the premise—loss is not a void but a co-existent garden—leaving the cost (perpetual search without reunion) legible in the final line “growing toward its own mysterious proof.” Accumulative/Textural lens holds: moonlight → dripping rhythm → glass-eye gleam → blossom opening is a density chain that culminates in the double vision, not a causal puzzle to solve. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) are fixed by line 10; no penalty. No teleporting props; the glass eyes warm in her hand, a persistent constraint that shapes the final image.</comment>

<comment>Micro-setting triumph: the mosaic stepping stone’s chipped patterns physically generate the prime-shadow sequence that catalyzes the vision—environment literally writes the code she cannot. Stalactite drips act as metronome, pacing her whispered equations, then synchronize with the blossoms opening, fusing sensory planes. Spatial choreography is clean: she kneels, places eyes, stands, exits—no floating bodies. The “silver milk” moonlight and “glow-apples” risk near-purple, but each image is filtered through mathematician-perceiver who quantifies glow, so diction stays in POV lexicon.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—can ambiguous loss be lived with instead of solved—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightened when the double vision offers reunion yet she refuses to call out, crystallizing the cost of permanent uncertainty. Escalation is textural: silence thickens, moonlight intensifies, blossoms open in wrong season—each accumulates pressure without external antagonist. Agency is expressed through attention: she chooses to keep calculating rather than chase the figure, a renunciation that forecloses immediate reunion. Price is visible: the warmed glass eyes she must pocket, knowing they will never blink back.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without thesis statement: grief is not a problem to solve but a dimension to inhabit, proven by the final image of an orchard “growing toward its own mysterious proof.” Subtext operates in the taxidermy eyes—objects meant to preserve sight for the dead—now repurposed to glimpse the living absent, reversing their taxidermic logic. The prime numbers remain unpatterned, enacting the theme that some systems resist closure. No late moralizing; the last line is an image, not a lesson.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays latched to Elara’s perceptual filter—she notices light angles as “silver milk,” hears drips as metronome, never grants interiority to the possible brother. Syntax mirrors mathematician mind: clauses balance like equations (“not solved… but mapped”). No head-hopping; the double vision is POV-legible hallucination. Register holds; “topology of absence” is warranted by her academic background and arrives mid-ritual, not as exposition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyrically compressed yet propulsive: every sentence does double duty—description advances metaphorical logic (“roots drinking from pools fed by stalactites” fuses geology and nurture). No paraphrase loops; each apple-blossom mention adds sensory layer. Metaphor coherence holds: glass eyes → sight → parallel vision → unsolvable topology, all vehicles obey internal physics. Minor filter-verb cluster (“she wondered if… she felt certain…”) in one line, but it sits in low-pressure beat; does not touch closure.</comment>

<comment>Fusion of mathematics, taxidermy, and subterranean orchard is idiosyncratic and inevitable—no existing template matches this synthesis. The “mathematics of emotion” could have slid into gimmick, but here it is grounded in tactile ritual (placing eyes, reading chipped tiles) so the concept earns emotional truth. Prime numbers refuse pattern, subverting reader expectation that code will solve mystery—risky choice that heightens thematic coherence. Fresh inflection: ambiguous loss becomes a literal parallel orchard one can glimpse but never enter, turning psychological trope into spatial reality.</comment>
