<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Esme’s motive—coincidence as prayer—drives every move; the retrocognitive flashes are embodied (hand on shard, frost-flower mind-bloom) and alter her next action, not just mood. The renunciation of accident belief costs her solitude and safety, felt when she descends alone at dawn. Minor slip: “understood with sudden clarity” skirts diagnostic-speak but is saved by immediate physical consequence (charts spread, prism pieces lifted). Interiority stays character-specific; no stock beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the future-echo of light blooming across ruins reweights earlier coincidences into constellation, with conceptual cost—she forfeits her tower isolation to become itinerant pattern-prover. Causal chain holds: prism break → star alignment → map of intersections → journey; each because/therefore is legible. Mosaic shards (temple, gallery, archive) are taught early via star-chart overlay; transitions are crystalline, not confusing. No orientation debt; anchors (who, where, when) arrive by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Glass pavilion hums wind-through-crystal, a live instrument that guides choice—its song shifts pitch when Esme decides, turning micro-setting into actor. Star-chart overlay on city ruins gives tactile geography; “vine-choked towers” is selective, not tourist. Broken prism functions as portable setting: its internal starlight memory constrains how Esme maps the city. Weather (dawn wind) is causal, not backdrop. Spatial choreography clean: descent, bench, chamber, city spread tracked without drift.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—prove meaning behind coincidence—tightens when each prism shard demands a ruin-side quest, foreclosing the safety of tower isolation. Escalation is accumulative: each star-path intersection reduces her options from stasis to pilgrimage; the Silence Archive shard will cost literal stillness, a tangible price. Agency sits with Esme; no star solves anything for her. Luck (tremor) complicates but is immediately converted into purpose, satisfying situational lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as pattern vs. chaos; the final image of light blooming over ruins offers non-literal answer—meaning is made, not found. Subtext in “shard of hush” (absence as fuel) quietly reframes silence from emptiness to generative medium. No final-paragraph moral; last line is action-cadence. Recurrence of glass-song/prism echoes shift from mourning to invitation, charging closure. Complexity intact: she may fail, but the stance is irreversible.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Lyric third-person hovers close to Esme’s perceptual filter: “starlight in its matrix for ten thousand years” is idiom she would internalize. Rhythm modulates—long breath while charting, staccato when shards align. No dialogue, so voice contamination absent. Filter verbs (“she saw”) are voice-motivated, marking retrocognitive mode. Tense stable; no head-hop. Prose mirrors her glass-song affinity via assonance and crystalline syntax.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High density: “coincidences were prayers in disguise” compresses premise and stakes in one stroke. Mixed metaphors avoided; vehicles (thistle-down, frost flowers) stay botanical, coherent. Rhythm breathes—paragraph lengths visually echo tower spiral. Zero paraphrase loops; “shard of hush” is introduced once and propagated via implication. Opening and closing lines bookend with beacon imagery, satisfying ear test.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: retrocognition + post-collapse astronomy + silence-as-fuel. “Shard of hush” is non-obvious world rule that reweights stillness from void to resource. Risk in mosaic structure pays off—closure still legible under single lens. No trope laundering; custodian-beacon trope inverted into map-maker role. Specificity of glass pavilion song and star-chart overlay could not transplant to another setting without breakage.</comment>
