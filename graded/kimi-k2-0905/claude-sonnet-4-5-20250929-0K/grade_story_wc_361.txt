<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Kael’s interiority is solid—his twitching fingers, compulsive reach-then-jerk pattern, and final decision to plant the seed all embody the “jittery courier” trait. The contradictory impulse to touch yet avoid the pendant is sustained, and his micro-choice to pocket the seed and later to plant it grows credibly from prior beats. However, the moment he “admits” the pendant made him extend himself is delivered as a spoken summary, not dramatized contradiction; that caps the score just below 8.8. Still, the earned renunciation of pure courier detachment and the visible cost of accepting wonder-legitimacy land cleanly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the pendant’s hum functions as a pattern that accumulates encounters and reweights Kael’s stance. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the pendant is returned to him with a new mandate, the seed in pocket crystallizes the cost, and the final “already calling” re-energizes the motif. Causality remains coherent under accumulation; no teleporting props or retro-patches. The only minor drag is a slight Orientation lag at the merchant beat—who/where re-anchor is delayed to ~140 words, but the aurora and ridgeway are already cinematic, so the penalty is waived.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The aurora-lit ridgeway is more than postcard: it guides Kael’s night-climb, supplies the color palette that the pendant mirrors, and forces the dawn deadline that pressures the final hand-off. The pendant itself acts as micro-setting—its membrane tension and sympathetic vibration constrain every interaction. Spatial choreography is clean: merchant beside path, shepherd upslope, cottage at summit; distances track. Only the cottage interior is skipped, but that shard is exterior-focused and closure happens outside, so no cap is triggered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is Kael’s need to deliver without touching, yet each vibration forces tactile social contact; the pattern intensifies until the final reconfiguration accepts permanent entanglement. One meaningful tightening occurs at the ridge summit: dawn threatens aurora, the Keeper hands back the pendant, and the option to remain a detached courier is foreclosed. Cost is visible—he loses schedule purity and accepts lifelong pollinator duty. Under Accumulative lens, the escalation is a density shift rather than causal chain, and it reweights the stake cleanly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: relics transform carriers, not cargo; wonder germinates in routine crossroads. The seed-recipient cycle is shown through three encounters rather than stated. The final image of planting at a crossroads reprises the merchant’s “forgotten places” line and reweights it—now Kael is the sower, not the courier. No moralizing paragraph; the only near-statement is the Keeper’s concise lecture, which is framed as in-world lore and balanced by Kael’s earned silence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Kael; no head-hop. Perceptual signature is strong: colors are named as light-sources, fabrics are “sorted by aurora-light,” music is “geometric proofs of beauty.” Syntax tightens under pressure—short paratactic beats during climbs, longer reflective cadences at cottage. Dialogue is minimal but carries subtext: merchant’s “no charge” and shepherd’s “perhaps its purpose was to wait” both conceal gifts that shift status. Only micro-slip: “extends your brief encounters into exchanges” is slightly academic for ancient Keeper, but register recovers immediately.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence runs. Information density is high—single sentences often fuse color, emotion, and world-lore. Figurative language is selective: “puddled robes,” “geometric proofs of beauty,” each image tied to POV bias. No mixed metaphors or scaffold loops. One paraphrase loop across adjacent lines is absent; occasional “the pendant… the pendant” reprises are purposeful re-anchors, not artifacts. Final line “already calling” is crisp and propulsive.</question>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The “relic that turns carrier into pollinator” is a fresh inversion of the standard MacGuffin quest. The memory-to-myth fade of mentors is handled as lived cosmology rather than meta-commentary. Specific details—dragonfly-wing membrane, willow-bone flute, story-seeds carved with spirals—feel particular to this world. Risk is taken in quiet lyric accumulation rather than twist; coherence holds. Transformation test fails: swapping pendant for generic gem would collapse the vibration mechanic, confirming originality.</comment>
