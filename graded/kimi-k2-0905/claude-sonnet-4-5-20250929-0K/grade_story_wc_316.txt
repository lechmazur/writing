<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction is sharp—“I don’t love her” lands as embodied cost—but micro-choices cluster in summary blocks rather than dramatized beats. Clone-Kira’s grief is shown only in “eyes glistened,” flattening the potential status war. The final handshake is earned, yet the prior numbness is declared more than performed. Still, the互补 opposite logic keeps both Kiras credibly flawed and necessary.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure unit is a Charged Poise: the clasped hands over the jar reconfigure custody into co-stewardship with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain holds: numbness → need for counterweight → joint claim. Orientation is anchored by word 40 (“floating rock dojo”), history-rewrite rule taught early, lens = Hybrid tilting Situational. Minor waiver: the jar’s prior off-stage duplication could feel convenient, but the label retroactively legitimizes it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Floating rock and quantum foam below function as micro-setting that literally rewrites causal backstory, charging the final image. The dojo’s slow spin and glass floor are returned to at the beat level, constraining stance and balance. Sensory economy is strong—obsidian, preservative bath, cold glass—yet stays subordinate to emotional stakes. Spatial choreography is flawless; no drift into tourist-catalog cosmology.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake = who will parent the child; signaled in line 3. Escalation is one tightening: the either/or custody question narrows to joint custody plus the jar as living third pole. Cost is legible—Kira admits she will use her numbness as a tool, accepting ethical risk. Agency sits with Kira’s proposal and Clone-Kira’s consent; no coin-flip resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of wholeness-through-fracture emerges from the duplicated brain and mirrored selves, never sermonized. Final image reprises the jar as literal and figurative third lobe of motherhood, reweighting “DUPLICATE” into synergy. The piece avoids pat moral equivalence: numbness is weaponized, passion is warned it may smother. Resonance lingers in the paradox that only a divided self can raise an undivided child.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical-scientific: “probability streams,” “quantum foam,” yet filtered through post-ego detachment that justifies the lexicon. Rhythm modulates—short staccato admissions (“Not experiment—vivify”) versus long reflective sentences showing drift. No head-hopping; both Kiras’ interiority is separated by paragraph breaks. Distinction is achieved through stance, not dialect, fulfilling sci-fi elevation without artificial gravity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often performs worldbuilding, backstory, and emotional stakes. No template cadence or synonym loops; metaphors stay coherent (“Timelines branched and merged like neural pathways”). Micro-scaffolding appears once (“Whole. / Not simple. / But vivified.”) but is purposeful cadence, not clutter. Final paragraph fragment serves Charged Poise rather than drumbeat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Clone-custody on a meditation asteroid that edits its own past is refreshingly non-stock. The brain-in-jar as third parent transposes backup culture into domestic ethics. Concept follows implication—probability foam visible, ego death as literal vocational hazard—without late-rule bailouts. Risk in structure (quiet standoff instead of courtroom drama) pays off through conceptual reconfiguration.</comment>
