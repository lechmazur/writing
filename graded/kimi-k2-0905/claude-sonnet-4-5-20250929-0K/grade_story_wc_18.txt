<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aria’s grief-driven fixation is visceral, and the mirror-paste ritual gives her a tactile, high-stakes micro-choice. The brother’s translucent return shows cost on both sides, but his interiority is reported second-hand, so the emotional ledger feels slightly lopsided. Still, her anchored body-breath-fog sync and the final hand-clasp crystallize a believable, costly reunion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the sextant-mended arc becomes the literal bridge across the dissolved boundary, and the fog’s shift from erasure to illumination pays off the core risk. Causal linkage holds—every beat of silver-paste breathing pulls the lost instrument and the lost brother into alignment. The cost is felt in the cold fire that still burns on the restored arc, proving the crossing was not free.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Workbench, frost, and fog form a micro-setting triad that actively constrains breathing rhythm and tool manipulation. The calcified orchard’s silver bark and petrified fruit are re-used in the final shimmer, charging the closure image. Spatial choreography is immaculate: the sextant’s pieces, the door, and the brother’s translucent edges track cleanly across the final beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—recover or relinquish the brother—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when the frost-covered sextant lands on the doorstep. The meaningful turn arrives with the mirrored breath-fog synchronization: it is the only way to rebuild the boundary he dissolved, and it forecloses her safe detachment from the fog. Price is visible: she trades her solitary clarity for a half-translucent sibling who may yet fade.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the fog’s shift: boundaries are not abolished but remade, fragile yet necessary. The mirror-paste literalizes the idea that reflection can be reconstruction, not mere recall. No moral is stated; the final image of frost-bright lines silently reweights the premise with conceptual cost—every future crossing will demand fresh silver and breath.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person close stays locked to Aria’s perceptual filter; diction is precise—“calcified,” “silver oxide,” “prismatic fragments”—without vaulting above her artisan lexicon. Breath-matched cadence mirrors fog pulses, creating a hypnotic rhythm that escalates under pressure. No dialogue, so voice purity remains intact.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and syntactic shape, propelling the ritual beat. Figurative layers (“frost that wouldn’t melt,” “cold fire”) recur with disciplined consistency, never crowding a single clause. Zero loops, zero scaffold; every line either advances paste application or tightens fog sync. Final line lands on a stark, image-driven clause that refracts earlier glass motifs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The mirror-maker who repairs boundaries by breathing with fog is a fresh synthesis of craft-magic and grief-tech; the sextant as emotional compass feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk—using breath rhythm as plot engine—pays off when the fog literally exhales the brother back. Specificity of calcified apples and non-melting frost anchors the conceit in sensory reality, resisting allegorical drift.</comment>
