<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is concrete and embodied—her knees lock, hands freeze, throat tightens—showing contradictory impulses (grief vs. caretaking) in scene. The pearl-of-stillness practice is dramatized through micro-choices: she stops mid-prune, waits, breathes, then resumes, proving renunciation costs time and exposure to memory. The photograph’s pocketed presence and final release mark a visible, scaled cost: she lets go of the last intact relic. Only the “planned to work in refugee advocacy” line leans label-like, slightly blunting the arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Mira returns to seedlings after releasing the photo, foreclosing the path of constant mourning. The cost is legible—she will “never stop missing them” yet chooses cultivation—crystallized in the night-blooming cereus anecdote that reweights grief into attentive waiting. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: layers of daily ritual, seasonal bloom, photo handling accumulate to tighten meaning rather than causal plot turns. Orientation is clean (cliff arboretum, morning, lone gardener) by line 4.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The arboretum’s salt-kissed air, bromeliads, Japanese maple, and decommissioned lighthouse cohere as micro-setting that constrains Mira—she must choose plants that survive exposure, mirroring her own exposure to memory. The cliff edge and decaying lighthouse supply persistent physical risk and metaphorical obsolescence that charges the final image of her “working on, quietly talented.” Tactile details (gravel paths, shears suspended) weave through action rather than pausing it.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: can Mira inhabit a present worth living while carrying unmoving grief? Pressure tightens somatically—each freeze is a beat where cultivation halts—then releases through the pearl method, costing her time, vulnerability, and ultimately the photograph. No external antagonist; escalation is pattern-deepening: more freezes, longer waits, until the final layer allows release. Cost is visible: relinquishing relic, accepting perpetual ache.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through vegetal metaphor: invasion coated into luminous survival. No abstract statement—idea is encoded in oyster/image, cereus bloom, seedling transplant. The pregnant couple’s wonder reframes Mira’s private arc without moralizing, letting reader feel that attentive waiting can coexist with irreparable loss. Final image reweights earlier motifs—photo released, seedlings anchored—answering the thematic question non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is botanically exact: “economical and precise” movements, “salt-kissed air,” “shears suspended above a stem.” Syntax is calm, rhythmic, mirroring the pearl-layering process; no drumbeat patterns. Compression in “hope like jewelry” and “sky had opened with fire” teaches lyric density early and pays off in the final bloom line. No dialogue, so voice stays single, coherent, and character-bound.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>High density: “coaxed from stubborn soil” does world, character, and metaphor in five words. Varied sentence length breathes with panic crest/recall cycles. Zero paraphrase loops; no filter-verb stacks. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge voice. Minor elevated note—“conceptual repricing,” “somatic markers”—reads as Mira’s acquired clinical lexicon, motivated, not register drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><question>8.5</question>
<comment>Fusing trauma recovery with orchid propagation feels fresh; pearl metaphor grows inevitable in hindsight yet non-obvious at entry. Obsolescent lighthouse as emotional echo is specific to this cliff, not a trope transplant. Risk: lyric stillness over plot, but coherence holds. Transformation test fails if arboretum setting removed—verdict: genuinely integrated.</comment>
