<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Marin’s interiority is sharp—her linguistic training surfaces in sensory, non-generic ways (“proto-linguistic fragments reality once spoke”). The single contradiction—coming to rescue yet ready to seed knowledge outside—drives the climax negotiation, but the cost (she leaves carrying blank pages now sprouting new language) is stated more than felt; a hairline slip keeps this just outside the 9 band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens: each paragraph thickens the bookstore’s living lexicon until the “symphony” re-weights meaning at the end. Orientation declared by word 40; missing-books-as-map taught early; closure is a Conceptual Repricing—Marin’s offer reframes the bookstore from predator to exchange partner, and the diary pages begin self-writing as visible cost. Persistent constraint: the unheard frequencies remain, now composing outward rather than inward.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The mountain-breathing shelves, neural-path corridors, and dust-on-absent-books atlas are tactile, POV-filtered, and directly enable navigation and the final trade. No object or body part charges the exit image as decisively as the setting itself, so the 9+ gate is just missed; still, the bookstore’s organic reconfiguration supplies the decisive resource for both rescue and propagation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—liberate the seventeen—locked early; pressure escalates as descent = stronger bone-resonant “music,” narrowing options to submit or negotiate. Marin’s agency drives the turn: she risks becoming the eighteenth to propose exchange, and the bookstore’s audible shift in harmony is the visible price. One minor slack: the seventeen’s fates feel abstract until the final paragraph; cost is more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of knowledge-as-ecology emerges through living shelves, moon-fed plants, and the counter-economy of forgetting; no explicit thesis. The closing image—blank pages auto-filling—re-weights earlier “negative-space catalog” motif into new growth, achieving resonance without moralizing. Subtext in gesture (rising from chairs, returning diary) implies consent rather than conquest, preserving complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Marin; perceptual signature fuses linguist precision with synesthetic hearing (“frequencies that bypassed ears… mathematical precision”). Compressed clauses match descent urgency; no head-hop. Dialogue minimal, but the time-traveler’s single line carries subtext of recognition rather than exposition, maintaining distinct cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High-density lines (“shelves branching like neural pathways through stone and crystal”) perform atmosphere and world-rule in one stroke. Rhythm accelerates down the mountain, breathes at negotiation, re-tightens on exit—no template cadence. A single scaffold echo (“unheard symphony… symphony of what never was… symphony shifted”) is thematic recurrence, not loop; it pays off in harmonic re-orchestration at end.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Combines living-library trope with linguistics-of-reality and forgotten botany, then flips predator-to-pollinator economy; synthesis feels inevitable after diary’s “moonlight photosynthesis” entry. Risk: bookstore as organism could collapse into anthropomorphic cliché, but the harmonic consent keeps it non-anthropocentric. Final re-seeding outward avoids fortress-library stagnation, giving the idea fresh motion.</comment>
