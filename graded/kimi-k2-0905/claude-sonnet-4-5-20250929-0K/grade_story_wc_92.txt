<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren’s “vigilant lock sentinel” persona is vividly sketched in the dark-fort beats, but her internal contradiction—the loyal guardian who has already decided to betray—remains asserted rather than dramatized in scene; we are told she’s been waiting for the blackout rather than shown a micro-choice that proves it. Commander Voss steps in as a second on-page voice, yet their shared complicity is exchanged in tidy agreement, not tested under pressure, so the relationship crucible never really fires. The final smile is a serviceable Earned Stasis, but the cost feels light because the story never lets us see what she’s truly risking (job, life, friends). Interiority is concrete (“her fingers trailing along familiar walls”) yet slips into diagnostic summary (“she’d been waiting for it”) that blunts the edge of genuine struggle.</comment>

<comment>The causal spine holds: blackout ➜ coded sundial ➜ silent coup, each beat linked by visible paint and shared darkness. Closure lands cleanly with Charged Poise: the fort now glows “from within,” re-weighting the premise of guardianship. The cost is palpable in the image but not personalized to Maren—no wound, no named loved one lost—so the resonance stays conceptual rather than felt. Orientation is solid within 120 words; lens is straightforward Causal and never wavers.</comment>

<comment>The white-stone fort at twilight is sketched in two sensory strokes yet immediately orients us; blackout narrows perception to touch and faint glow, mirroring secrecy. The bronze quill holder and half-painted sundial function as micro-setting—handled, tilted, re-interpreted under match-light—so environment physically constrains the next move. Spatial choreography stays clean: workshop door, corridor darkness, footsteps tracking outward. Weather and scale stay off-stage, appropriate for this length, but “luminous fort” never acquires a tactile lived-in detail beyond walls, so the world feels lightly wallpapered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—can the revolution ignite unseen?—is signaled at blackout start and deepens when the sundial angles become a live map. One meaningful tightening occurs: the 3-hour clock (“We disabled the backup systems ourselves”) collapses options and forces distribution now. Cost is collective rather than personal (no named sentinel who might catch them, no ink on Maren’s hands), so pressure stays medium. Agency is shared off-page (Voss already acted), muting the protagonist-driven spike that would punch the score higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><<grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges cleanly: guardianship can invert into imprisonment, and keys can unlock ideology as well as doors. The sundial’s shadow-code is a sharp particular that re-weights meaning when it glows in darkness. Subtext operates in silence—the handshake of complicity conveyed by Voss’s “winking hush.” Final image resists moral tag yet lands slightly pat because the story never exposes a counter-view (a genuine loyalist voice) to complicate the binaries.</comment>

<question>6</question><<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person stays tight to Maren’s perceptual filter: tactile darkness, lock-sentinel diction (“practiced ease,” “coded angles”). Rhythm modulates—long sentence for creeping blackout, staccato exchange with Voss—without drumbeat patterns. “Winking hush” and “conspirator’s cloak” risk ornamental flourish yet fit the twilight espionage tone. Dialogue is sparse but carries subtext; the single line from Voss simultaneously compliments and tests, so speech works as action.</comment>

<question>7</question><<grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Opening sentence plants fort + twilight + blackout in one breath, meeting the ear test. Information density is high: every mention of paint, quill, or angle performs double duty (world plus plot). Minor scaffold: “its white stone walls glowing with the day’s final light, when every lamp and torch inside simultaneously died” could lose the second clause without loss. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks; lucid prop tracking keeps closure legible.</comment>

<question>8</question><<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Fresh spin: a lock sentinel weaponizes her own keys for internal regime change, turning decorative sundial into clandestine bulletin board. Cradle-of-sparks phosphorescence adds a verifiable, non-generic light source. Yet the coup blueprint feels safely familiar—sympathetic insiders, noble cause, tidy alliance—so the premise never bites into darker moral trade-offs. Specificity of the sundial angles rescues it from pure trope, but transformation is moderate, not breathtaking.</comment>
