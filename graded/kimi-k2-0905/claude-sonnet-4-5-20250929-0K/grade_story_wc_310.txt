<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira’s quiet enthusiasm and the backwards-prophecy method root her interiority; the coins function as an embodied ritual that charges her choices. Kael’s arc from cynic to disciple is sketched cleanly, but his final “Teach me” pivot is compressed into a single sentence—no visible cost or contradiction on him. Micro-choices (selecting coins, adjusting headset) reveal hierarchy of values, yet secondary pressures on her motivation remain abstract—no tangible flaw or loss is dramatized. Earned stasis is asserted, not felt: the ending’s transformation cost is collective, so her personal price stays off-stage.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the universe’s contraction reframes the coins’ randomness into survival instruction, cost legible in the white-out final image. Causality under the Accumulative/Textural lens tightens through density of static bursts and coin patterns; each new burst re-weights the stake. Orientation is clean: crystalline dome, brass bowl, collapsing cosmos anchor who/where/when inside 50 words. One scaffold loop—“wavelength aligning with purpose” repeated near end—slips cadence but does not touch the final image, so penalty stays minor.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The amber-filtered observatory dome functions as both environment and tool: its light color-codes the tightening frequency and literally colors the final white-out. Coins serve as micro-setting handled in 3+ beats, embodying extinct value systems that foreshadow repricing at closure. Spatial choreography stays clean—console, bowl, headset, pressure seal track without drift. Sensory palette is narrow (visual/auditory) but purposeful; crisis narrows perception to static bursts, aligning with theme. No world-rule contradiction; scientific shorthand stays plausible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</question><grade>comment>Dominant stake—survive the Big Crunch via frequency match—signals early and tightens when static shrieks escalate. One meaningful deepening: Mira realizes the coins are receiving, not predicting, instructions; this reweights randomness as survival tactic. Protagonist agency drives every beat (coin toss, headset adjustment, teaching others). Cost is conceptual rather than visceral—loss of former causality—but remains legible on page through the final white-out transition; could be stronger if an individual forfeiture were dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: value itself becomes a transmissible frequency across civilizational endings. No abstract sermon—coins’ reprise at end reweights “medium of exchange” into “medium of continuity.” Subtext operates in Kael’s silent return of staff—doubt converted off-page yet visible in collective action. Final image avoids moral; it crystallizes meaning without dictating it, satisfying CR. Quiet cynic-to-hope arc for Kael supplies emotional aftereffect, though thematic complexity remains moderate at this length.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Mira; no head-hopping. Diction—“stellar doubt,” “death rattle,” “wavelength aligning”—creates a consistent cosmological register without crowding. Syntax modulates: longer reflective sentences contract into clipped “Teach me,” mirroring universe’s compression. Free indirect style is clean; no filter-verb clutter. Dialogue is sparse but goal-driven, carries subtext of desperation vs. belief. Perceptual signature strong: Mira notices light frequency, coin wear, static timbre—professional astronomer’s bias rendered.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with escalation: descriptive cadence accelerates into white-out single-sentence climax. High information density—each sentence handles both world-collapse scale and tactile coin detail. Metaphors disciplined: “universe’s death rattle” stays physical via static shriek. One paraphrase loop on “wavelength align” costs −0.2. No mixed metaphors or register drift. Opening and closing lines both anchor and recharge; paragraph cut test passes. Typos absent; grammar clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: divination via reversed causality compressed into apocalypse survival manual. Coins as data receivers from a future Big Bounce feels non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Tropes of dystopian doubt and messianic scientist are inverted—Mira is quietly enthusiastic, not manic. Risk in backwards-time prophecy is fully committed to, not hedged; closure pays off the rule set. Specific detail (Persian, Atlantean, pre-human coins) prevents generic anywhere/anytime slippage.</comment>
