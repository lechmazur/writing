<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and philosophically textured, but the protagonist’s choices are largely observational; the decisive gear-placement is guided by “intuition” rather than a visible, prior-won insight, so the final act feels slightly Gifted rather than earned. The sleep-translocation trait is named but never complicates his waking tactics—its cost is off-stage—so the flaw-cap keeps this just below the 8.8 gate.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each gear and sonic cue thickens pattern until the forest-map projection reweights meaning. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—he sees the forest as his own neural map—so the cost is conceptual, felt in the “wild frontier” line. One soft spot: the mechanism suddenly projects a hologram that solves the puzzle; because the projector was never seeded, causality blinks for a beat (-0.3).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The mechanical rainforest is rendered with brass leaves, pneumatic vines, titanium bamboo—each detail does double duty as both world and mind-map. Spatial choreography stays clean through the single clearing, and the final image recharges the setting by turning it into a mirror of cognition, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes are epistemic—will he understand the translocations?—and tighten when the nineteenth gear locks in, revealing the forest-as-mind. Pressure is accumulative (pattern density) rather than causal, appropriate to lens. Cost is present but abstract (loss of certainty, former life); a more visceral forfeiture would have pushed this into 8+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges as “knowledge beyond conscious logic”; it is never sermonized, only embodied in the gear-sequence and the final hologram. The closing line reweights the entire journey without moralizing, meeting the 9- gate. A hairline deduction for the slightly on-the-nose phrase “probable miracles crystallize into certainty,” which edges toward thesis-statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person voice is steady, lyric-philosophic, and syntactically varied; diction stays within the thinker’s register (“epistemology,” “mandala”) without ballooning. Perceptual signature is strong—wind harmonics read differently to him than to others—so head-count and POV control remain flawless.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet musical; sentences advance both image and idea. One scaffold loop—“the forest was…”—appears twice in close succession (-0.2). A single mixed metaphor (“trail of gears he left behind” yet gears are found, not dropped) is minor; no artifact touches the closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The “mechanical rainforest as neural mandala” is a fresh synthesis; the unconscious puzzle-solving via sleep-translocation reframes a familiar spiritual quest into cognitive gothic. Risk—letting the setting dissolve into pure metaphor—pays off because the final image is legible and charged. Not quite paradigm-shifting enough for 9+, but highly memorable.</comment>
