<comment>Mara’s interiority is concrete—her “luminous regret” is re-evoked each time she touches the coin or bellows—so the embodied emotion holds. The single contradiction she carries (healer who weaponizes memory) is active in the decision to fuse, not merely declared. The final renunciation—handing over a mended absence, not the child—pays the cost visibly in the magistrate’s tears and her own return to the steaming foundry. Only the sister backstory drifts toward label-epiphany, but it is anchored to present micro-choice (walk back alone), so the flaw stays sub-cap.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a classic Resonant Reconfiguration: the coin remains broken yet sacred, shifting the magistrate from vigil to memorial and Mara from private guilt to public gift. Causal chain is tight—coin discovery → mercury/gold trial → naming ritual → fused fracture → candle in window—each step narrows options and raises emotional cost. Lens is cleanly Accumulative/Textural: density of fire/rain/gold images reweights the meaning of “missing” without external plot turns. The cost is legible in the final image: candle lit “not in hopeless vigil” (textual line), a conceptual re-pricing that makes absence bearable.</comment>

<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The foundry’s “steaming puddles reflecting firelight” is returned to three times, each time with a different emotional tint—urgent labor, lonely exhaustion, final beacon—so the micro-setting constrains her stamina and later offers homing light. The zodiac coin itself operates as portable setting: its crack tracks spatially in tongs, silk, palm, chest, charging every transfer with heat or weight. Spatial choreography is flawless—bellows, crucible, bench, door—no impossible body positions. Weather (rain patter) is not backdrop but active opponent that keeps the forge laboring, hence counts as environmental pressure.</comment>

<comment>The dominant stake is legible by line 3: can Mara transmute absence into bearable truth? One meaningful tightening occurs when the gold flows—this irrevocably commits the coin to a new ontological state, foreclosing return to raw evidence. Price is paid on-page: the coin’s warmth against her palm signals energy drawn from her own night-long stamina (felt cost). Agency is hers alone; no coincidence rescues. If anything, the escalation is modest—no external antagonist—yet within the Accumulative lens the intensification of image (green corrosion → glowing seam) suffices to reweight grief.</comment>

<grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of “breakage as beauty” emerges strictly through the alchemical process and the golden seam; never sermonized, only shown. Final candle image answers the thematic question wordlessly: acceptance, not recovery, is the only victory. Subtext lives in gesture—magistrate presses coin to chest where heartbeat should be, wordlessly replacing daughter’s body with relic. No tidy moral; the ambiguity of “redeemed nothing, perhaps” invites counter-reading that ritual merely dresses pain in metal.</comment>

<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays glued to Mara’s perceptual filter: “luminous regret,” “stomach clench,” “weight of names” are her diction, not author intrusion. Syntax lengthens under heat (“mercury and gold dust in precise ratios”) then fractures short when tongs lift—“she spoke the name aloud”—mirroring metallurgical stress. No head-hop; magistrate’s tear is seen from outside, interiority remains hers. Register stays within a rural alchemist’s ken—no Latinate excursions—so diction integrity holds.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is controlled: parataxis under bellows (“rain still pattering…tin roof”) mimics percussion; longer caesura in final paragraph gives cadence of elegy. Single paraphrase loop spotted: “weight of names…the terrible gravity of the word ‘missing’” restates same idea; distance is one line so −0.2 only, well inside cap. Metaphors stay physically coherent—gold flows like solder, not like starlight. No filter-verb clusters, no template cadence, no overwriting. Opening and final lines are image-based, scaffolding-free.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Fusion of Korean kintsugi with Joseon-era occult metallurgy is fresh; most alchemy stories chase elixir, not memorial repair. The zodiac coin as relic-of-absence is specific; removing it collapses plot. Risk is taken by focusing closure on a quiet candle rather than resurrection, avoiding genre temptation. Emotional specificity—“luminous regret” coined for the echo of a sister never detailed—keeps universals anchored in odd diction. Not quite 9 because the storm/forge/coin triad could belong to other grief rituals with minimal swap.</comment>
