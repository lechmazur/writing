<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira’s archive-garden obsession is vivid and embodied; her micro-choice to press the shell to her ear while moonflowers pulse anchors her motive under pressure. The refusal to share her method is a credibly costly renunciation. Interiority drifts into self-diagnosis (“I’m not crazy”) that flattens the contradiction momentarily. Still, the hierarchy of values—sister-love vs. state control—remains legible and paid for.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Mira’s dawn refusal forever forecloses legitimacy, the shell bisection re-enshrined as irreversible cost. Causal chain holds: resonance poisoning → quarantine habit → garden → invitation → refusal. The “velvet garden at twilight” orients within 30 words; no orientation debt. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: each flower adds density until the final cadence reweights solitude as victory. Cost is unmistakable—“ Recognition. Legitimacy.” rejected in the same breath that names them.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The garden is not backdrop but archive—every bloom stores actionable memory, constraining her night walk and the final choice. “Velvet” and “tragically radiant” are re-used with shifting emotional charge, satisfying the micro-setting rule. Spatial choreography is clean: rows, center spot, buried half-shell all track. Weather shift from purple to dawn blue externalizes the ticking clock without cliché.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keep memory alive without triggering resonance—tightens when the state invitation threatens to standardize her method. One meaningful deepening: the shell whisper grows louder as dawn nears, forcing the decision. Agency is renunciation, not defeat; the price is permanent outsider status. Cost is visible on-page: “the morning star beginning its fade” as she writes refusal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: forced forgetting vs. chosen fragmentation. Subtext sits in the bisected shell—love preserved through damage. Final image reweights “isolation” as sovereign space, not exile. No sermonizing; the moral is lived, not stated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person hovering close to Mira sustains a ghostly, lyrical register without filter-verb clutter. “Ghostly resolve” and “charmed skeptic” surface only as lived attitude, not labels. Sentence rhythm mirrors her slow patrol—long cadences, then clipped refusal. No dialogue, so voice purity remains intact.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “experiences too dangerous to keep whole, split and planted” performs its own fracturing. One paraphrase loop—“tragically radiant” repeated twice—slips by without dulling momentum. Metaphors stay coherent (garden as archive) and physically grounded. Final sentence cadence earns its uplift without syrup.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Quarantined memories grown in flowers is fresh synthesis; the shell fragment as both keepsake and data node feels inevitable in hindsight. Government “Cognitive Contagion” is sketched, not dumped, leaving imaginative space. Risk: lyric refusal of plot violence, trusting image to carry stakes—coheres under Accumulative lens. Not gimmicky; the conceptual follow-through is complete.</comment>
