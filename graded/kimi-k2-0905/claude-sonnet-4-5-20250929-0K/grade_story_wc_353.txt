<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren’s “tree-song sculptor” identity animates her tactile, synesthetic attention, but interiority leans on lyrical summary (“quiet intensity”) rather than micro-choice under siege; the final strum is the only beat where embodied decision visibly forks her fate, so the arc feels pre-orchestrated rather than risked.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/lyric lens holds: each porcelain fracture accumulates sonic possibility until dawn birds arrive as living crescendo; closure lands with Resonant Reconfiguration—music re-enters the world—yet causality is impressionistic (no setback or trade-off) so cost feels conceptual rather than personal, keeping it shy of 8-band.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Grove is rendered through Maren’s haptic bias—“bark ridges…frozen symphonies”—so setting IS her instrument; porcelain spider-silk telegraph metaphor recurs and physically channels the final sound, satisfying 9+ gate by constraining both method and climax.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Stakes are poetic (resurrect world-song) but pressure is atmospheric, not tactical; wind and dawn arrive externally, so the tightening is a reveal of success rather than a narrowing of options—no live risk or forfeiture on page—hence escalation stays gentle, accumulative, rather than urgent.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of fracture-as-voice emerges organically from porcelain physics and lightning-scarred wood; final image of silent birds listening reweights silence itself as participatory, avoiding explicit moral—yet message drifts close to thesis (“she could teach it to sing again”), slightly softening resonance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric achieves a consistent synesthetic timbre—sound as heat, cracks as geography—without filter-verb clutter; cadence swells and hushes in mimicry of wind-through-glass, maintaining perceptual signature that is both poetically compressed and immediately legible.</comment>  
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentences breathe in rising-falling arcs that mirror acoustic swell; only minor scaffold (“she had learned…”) and one mixed metaphor (“fossilized spider silk”) but diction never drags closure, high density with purposeful repetition of “cracks” as motif rather than artifact.</comment>  
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Premise—post-avian silence healed by empathic materials science—feels fresh; risk lies in lyrical passivity yet piece commits fully to accumulative sound-canvas, so transformation test passes: this exact alder-grove porcelain orchestra could not swap with generic magic without gutting resonance.</comment>
