<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Miren’s interior engine runs on tactile, embodied detail (“ice-hewn shelves,” “rust furred their edges like orange moss”), so her competence feels inherited, not asserted. The micro-choices—heating a pick, filing a meteor-gear—translate motive into visible gesture, satisfying the contradiction test. Cost is present but muted: she forfeits perfect rhythm for imperfect survival, yet the price is stated rather than dramatized in her body. Still, the profession-specific sensory hierarchy keeps her individuated; no stock locksmith cliché intrudes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final image of waves “meshing with the sky” re-weights the premise that imperfection can be beautiful function. The causal lens holds—each gear replacement tightens lunar time—and the cost is legible in the syncopated tick she walks away with. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are crystalline by line 6; no debt applied. One minor soft spot: the missing third gear is narrated as “consumed by whatever force,” a faint explanatory hand-wave that slightly dilutes the because/therefore chain.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The frozen library above clouds is not postcard backdrop; its ice shelves shatter if mishandled, forcing Miren to treat books as fragile clock-parts. The Hall of Mirrors acts as micro-setting that literally multiplies her labor and reflects moonlight onto the mechanism, charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy skews toward touch and temperature—gloved palms, heated pick—matching a locksmith’s attentions. Light specificity (“hauntingly bright” gears) constrains the repair tempo, integrating atmosphere with stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</question><grade>comment>Dominant stake—celestial time itself—tightens once: when three stopped gears foreclose the option of perfect restoration. The protagonist’s agency is precise: she chooses irregular meteor-gear over flawless absence, narrowing possibilities under pressure. Cost is conceptual but felt on-page: the mechanism’s tick is now syncopated, a permanent auditory reminder of compromise. Escalation is single-pulse yet sufficient for 700-word scale; no false multi-reversals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: fracture as beauty, repair as translation rather than cure. The driftwood image re-appears in the final paragraph, re-weighted from decay to resilient adornment—an earned non-literal answer. No epiphany is spoken; the resonance stays in the image of imperfect gears ticking. Ambiguity is preserved: the world will fracture again, and that is acceptable.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person intimate maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature istool-and-touch obsessed, never ventriloquising cosmic lore. Syntax modulates: longer clauses for frozen grandeur, staccato “click… scrape… click” during repair. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. Register stays within a craftswoman’s lexicon; only “conceptual repricing” risks a touch of academic diction but occurs post-resolution and feels like narrator summary, not POV slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rhythmic control is exemplary: ice / reflected ice / reflected ice mirrors the infinite recession without syntactic monotony. Information density high—one sentence often delivers tool-action, sensory data, and metaphor (“rust furred their edges like orange moss”). One micro-loop: “the rhythm of repair, not just the mechanical sequence but the deeper music beneath it” restates the same idea twice; costs −0.2. Otherwise zero scaffold, no mixed metaphors, strong propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lunar-eclipse locksmith is fresh; meteor-cut gears that remember vacuum is specific non-obvious synthesis. The Hall of Mirrors functions as both literal architecture and thematic engine for infinite labor, transforming trope into crucible. Risk is taken—lyric accumulative structure, not conventional scene—but coherence holds. If names and places were swapped, the emotional arc would collapse because the mechanic-of-eclipses premise is irreplaceable.</comment>
