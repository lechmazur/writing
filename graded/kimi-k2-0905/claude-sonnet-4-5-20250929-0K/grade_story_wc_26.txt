<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Sera’s interior contradiction—clinging to a private dream while curating a public archive—remains abstract; the river stone warms but never forces a micro-choice that costs her anything on the page. Her decision to copy old files is declared, not dramatized, so the renunciation feels frictionless. The “sharp-eyed dusk noticer” label is repeated but never tested by an observable error or sacrifice. Earned stasis is asserted (“she would begin sharing”) rather than embodied in a beat where we feel the path close.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The causal chain is present—footage comparison → insight → decision—but the decisive change is off-stage. Closure lands on a future intention (“tomorrow she would begin sharing”) rather than an irreversible act that forecloses the archive’s sanctioned path. The river stone’s final placement is symbolic, not causal, so the cost is conceptual, not felt. The lens holds, yet the ending’s charge is blunted because the archive’s retaliation or her personal loss is neither faced nor implied beyond the rhetorical.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The glass-petal library above the clouds is economically anchored; its dream-glass shelves and cloud drift are tactile and bias-filtered through Sera’s curator gaze. Spatial choreography is clean: she palms the stone, activates shelves, stands at a console—each object is handled, not catalogued. The setting constrains her access to forbidden footage and provides the technical means to copy, so it passes the 9+ gate. Minor lapse: no sensory price (cold, vertigo) is extracted from the altitude, keeping it just short of exemplary.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stakes are declared early—dreams are being sterilized—but the tightening is intellectual: she compares frames, notices smoothing, decides to act. No archive authority confronts her, no personal risk is levied, so the pressure plateaus rather than spikes. The cost is abstract (“truth has weight”) rather than a concrete forfeiture on the page. Escalation is present but bloodless; the protagonist’s agency is never punished, so the tension feels academic.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly: commodification bleeds hope of its shadow, and only unpolished regret remains honest. The reprise of the river stone beside the copied files reweights the motif without sermonizing. Subtext is woven through image—gardens stripped of thorns, laughter tuned to frequency—avoiding thesis statements. The final sentence’s “luminous regret” risks echoing the prompt, but the phrase is earned by the footage montage and grandmother’s dream, so the abstraction feels inevitable, not grafted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person POV stays tight to Sera’s perceptual filter; diction skews lyrical but consistent with a curator who names dream-glass and focus-grouped petals. Rhythm modulates: longer clause-chains for archival awe, clipped fragments at the insight beat (“It was saturated”). No head-hopping or register drift. The voice is not strikingly idiosyncratic, yet it sustains a coherent atmospheric texture that supports the concept without crowding it.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid, with high information density: single sentences deliver world-rule, sensory cue, and thematic echo. A few template cadences (“Every…every…every…”) are purposeful, listing sterilization, so they escape penalty. No mixed metaphors or paraphrase loops. The closing line’s cadence is satisfying, but the penultimate sentence’s “truth had weight, and weight created shadows…” edges toward maxim; trimmed one clause, the line would tighten.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>The dream-commodity premise is familiar, yet the altitude library and dusk-noticer profession refresh the frame. Specificity—glass petals, focus-grouped bloom colors—grounds the abstraction. The river-stone as unshareable memory token is not itself novel, but its placement beside contraband footage re-inflects it. Story avoids allegorical labeling and commits fully to its lyric register; the risk is modest, the execution polished.</comment>
