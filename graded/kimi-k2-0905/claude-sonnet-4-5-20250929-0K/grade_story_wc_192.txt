<comment>Mara’s motivation—to teach suffocating to breathe—lands as consistent, but the interiority drifts into therapeutic abstraction (“make suffocating breathe,” “love means accommodation”). Scars as linking method are declared, not dramatized; the girl’s arrival is passive, so the micro-choice of “taking her hand” feels pre-ordained rather than pressured. Earned stasis is credible, yet the absence of any visible flaw or mistake keeps the arc emotionally tidy. Interior contradiction is asserted, not enacted under pressure.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the threshold dissolves, the girl crosses, and the final image reweights “emptiness” as oxygen. Causality is accumulative/textural; pattern of burning/bridges/ash layers toward the crystallized moment. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no penalty. Lens holds, but the cost is conceptual rather than visceral—no object lost, no breath actually fought for—so the reconfiguration is elegant yet lightly felt.</comment>

<comment>The sanctuary’s charcoal pillars and starlit ash function as micro-setting: they supply the visual grammar for burning/oxygen metaphors and constrain the ritual silence. Selective sensory focus—scars catching starlight, footprints in ash—keeps description woven through action; no white-room syndrome. The ring of melted wedding bands is concrete, tactile, and repurposed; it charges the final hand-to-hand touch. Setting never overloads; it mirrors internal state without overt symbolic declaration.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—learning to exhale—is signaled early and tightens once: the threshold flickers, the girl appears, the option of retreat is erased. Escalation is situational pressure culminating in stance crystallization; no external antagonist, no reversals, yet the foreclosing of “out there” is legible. Cost is conceptual (loss of old ties) rather than tangible; the price is felt but not dramatized as loss on the page. Sufficient for length, but lacks a visible forfeiture that would push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through accumulation of fire/ash/oxygen imagery rather than declaration; the final “emptiness held everything necessary” reweights the motif. Subtext of self-erasure vs. self-oxygenation is carried in gesture—hand hovering over silent ring, scars meeting scars—avoiding explicit moral. Ambiguity is preserved: burning bridges is both loss and liberation. The refusal to name the girl’s abusers keeps universality without flattening into sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric, controlled, sentence-level rhythm modulates with pressure—short imperative bursts at threshold, longer reflective coils in ash. Perceptual signature leans toward metaphoric density (“confession in ash and charcoal”) yet stays legible; no head-hop. Filter verbs are minimal; metaphors are coherent within fire/breath lexicon. Minor register elevation (“latticed across her wrists like delicate embroidery”) edges purple but remains consistent with elevated ritual tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is varied; paragraph lengths create visual breath. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is dense but patterned—fire, ash, breath—so coherence survives. One paraphrase loop (“burned carefully…methodically…watching each connection flame”) is flagged but does not touch closure; density remains high elsewhere.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Premise—sanctuary arrived at by burning every bridge—offers fresh inversion of self-care trope: destruction as oxygen. Ritual objects (silent ring, charcoal pews) are specific, not borrowed from genre kit. Synthesis of fire/breath metaphors feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk lies in quiet ending; stakes stay internal, but coherence is complete. No close echoes; transformation test passes—story collapses if ring or ash is swapped.</comment>
