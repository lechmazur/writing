<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Katrin’s calm, ritualized bearing and tactile attention to the brass pull give her a sharp, idiosyncratic presence; her interiority is concretely anchored (turning the pull under moonlight) and her risk—standing alone between armies—carries visible cost. The “recycle mistakes into wisdom” motive is asserted more than dramatized in micro-choice, so the internal contradiction feels slightly under-cooked. Still, her authority and fatigue land as lived-in, and the final solitude earns a credible renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the exchange completes, both soldiers walk free, and Katrin stays behind in charged poise—cost felt in her solitary exhale and the moonlit parapet. The causal lens holds: moon-phase clock drives the beat-by-beat timing, the drawer pull anchors generational trust, and every beat tightens the synchrony. Minor deduction: the apology/forgiveness framing is declared, not dramatized, so the trust leap hinges on exposition rather than shown erosion. Still, the image of the lone negotiator under apex moon reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The parapet’s slick stone, whistling wind, and silvering mist are woven through action—feet halt, mist swirls, moon glints on brass—so environment guides stance and timing. Spatial choreography is flawless; groups approach east vs. west, halt at ten paces, cross at apex. The micro-setting (brass pull) also constrains choice, satisfying the 9+ gate. Only the valley below stays generic, a hair’s-breadth shy of fullest specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Single dominant stake—simultaneous release without bloodshed—tightens once via moon-apex countdown; that deadline narrows options and forces the synchronized step. Cost is visible: Katrin’s lone exposure on the wall, armies’ fingers on triggers. The trust gap is declared more than tested in-scene, so pressure feels administrative rather than viscerally escalated, keeping the score just inside the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges obliquely: neutral ground, lunar indifference, and recycled error become a quiet ethics of procedural patience. The drawer pull’s final reprise reweights “open what’s closed” from family heirloom to living treaty—an image that answers the central question without moralizing. No thematic echo lines mar the ending, and the refusal to grant forgiveness on-page preserves ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Katrin’s perceptual filter—brass warmth, moon angle, wind on stone—syntax mirroring her measured cadence. No head-hop, no filter-verb bloat. Voice carries a faint archaic tilt (“moon phases,” “untether”) that feels intentional and consistent. Dialogue is sparse but distinct: Northern commander’s blunt distrust vs. Katrin’s furrowed hush.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense without purple drift; sentences vary, no template cadence. Figurative choices (“stone ribbon fraying,” “furrowed hush”) are fresh yet coherent. One paraphrase loop—“mist swirled / mist rolled” in adjacent sentences—dings slightly. No scaffold, no synonym churn in closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The moon-phase exchange mechanic feels novel yet inevitable, turning astrophysical neutrality into diplomatic currency. The drawer pull as mnemonic treaty-seed is a lovely, specific synthesis of heirloom and protocol. Risk is taken—quiet ending, no gunfire—and it pays off by reconfiguring trust as process, not spectacle. Could edge higher if the apology/forgiveness limbo were more than conceptual.</comment>
