<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Miriam’s interiority is concrete—her finger in dust, the brass button pressing her palm—and her choice to cross-file Samuel/Isaiah is earned by the accumulation of loss she witnesses. The “broken-hearted archivist” trait is label-heavy early on, but her embodied cataloguing gestures and the final micro-choice (she “began a new file”) convert the label into action with visible cost: she accepts perpetual heart-tending. Secondary pressure is absent—no one else appears—so relationship crucible is N/A. Flaw is present (emotional self-exile) and complicates her stance; the ending’s Earned Stasis is credible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Miriam’s decision to create a cross-referenced file crystallizes her new stance—permanent witness instead of private grief—charged by the brass button’s weight. Causality holds under Accumulative lens: dust patterns → hidden file → revelation → re-cataloguing. Cost is legible in the final line: “That would be enough” carries the forfeiture of personal repair. Orientation is clean within 60 words; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The file room operates as micro-setting: dust thickness, manila scent, and metal shelves directly guide discovery (“dust patterns…creating faint pathways”). The brass button functions as portable setting/handled tool; its tarnish constrains later action—she archives it as evidence. Spatial choreography is tight; no geography drift. Era details (1867–75 placement chaos) are filtered through POV’s archival priorities, lending credibility without exposition dump.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recovering lost kinship—ignites with Samuel’s first letter; pressure tightens when Miriam realizes the indexing error separated father from son forever. Meaningful deepening occurs at the 1869 adoption sheet: the clerk’s arbitrary letter choice forecloses reunion, a visible price that reweights Miriam’s task. Protagonist agency drives final escalation: she re-files to prevent recurrence, enduring perpetual emotional labor. Coincidence (dust trail) complicates, does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: arbitrary bureaucratic labels cleave lives; small archival kindnesses (teacher’s letter, Sutton updates) counteract systemic indifference. No explicit thesis; final image of button-pressed-between-fingers reweights premise—archives can still wound or heal. Subtext inhabits silence: absence of Samuel’s voice after 1875 equals death, unspoken. Complexity lingers: no apology from the system, only individual repair.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited sustains consistent distance; perceptual signature is archival—Miriam “catalogues dust,” “cross-references grief.” Syntax grows slightly choppier under pressure (“She couldn’t reunite…But she could ensure…”) mirroring internal acceleration. No dialogue, so voice distinction N/A. Diction stays within county-archivist lexicon; no register drift. Free indirect glimmers (“maddeningly brief”) remain in character.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is mostly loop-free; only minor scaffold (“she began…she would contact”) that does not stall momentum. Figurative control high—“dust rivers,” “laugh…bells”—anchored in POV’s archival eye. Information density strong; one sentence often does two jobs (e.g., description + stakes). Final line cadence is purposeful, propelling exit.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Freshest inflection: bureaucratic misfiling as generational trauma, surfaced through dust archaeology. Brass button concretizes Union service + parental proof in one portable object; not a stock metaphor. Risk taken—quiet, accumulative structure—pays off in Charged Poise ending. Could swap 1870s war orphan trope with another era, but archival dust-as-map methodology feels unique to this piece.</comment>
