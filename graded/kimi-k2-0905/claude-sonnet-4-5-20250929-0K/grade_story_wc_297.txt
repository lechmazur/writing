<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira’s “root-bound” interior contradiction is shown only in abstract summary (“dreams grew so dense…”), never dramatized as a live tension that tilts a micro-choice. The pivotal scar-link beat relies on a single, already-revealed wound; no visible cost or new flaw complicates the merger. Marcus remains a thematic echo rather than a crucible—his presence does not force a status shift or force Mira to betray a value. The ending renunciation (old covenant) is declared, not embodied; we are told the clipping “dissolved,” but Mira’s interior stance is unchanged on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Causal chain is present: clipped topiary → scar-link → shared vision → new covenant, each link legible. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the covenant’s collapse is re-weighted by the fertile soil image—yet the cost is abstract (lost certainty) rather than felt on the body or in imminent risk. Orientation is clean by line 5; no teleporting props. One soft reset: the “anxious elation” label is stated identically before and after the link, flattening the because/therefore rise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Cobalt glade is vivid—blue spiraling grass, dusk bruise—yet remains scenic backdrop; it never constrains movement or supplies tactical friction. The topiary clipping functions as micro-setting and is handled in two beats (clutch, crush), qualifying for 9+ gate, but its geometric order never collides with the chaotic glade to narrow choices. Spatial choreography is flawless; distance between Mira/Marcus tracked. Weather/light is decorative rather than causal.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—”write a new covenant”—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening: the future’s early arrival collapses prep time, forcing the scar-link gamble. Cost is announced (“we can still guide it”) but not dramatized; no tangible loss (blood, time, memory) is paid on the page, keeping pressure abstract. Escalation is thus conceptual, not visceral—sufficient for lyric mode but not for causal high-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme—trauma as navigational tool—emerges through the scar-link image rather than authorial statement. Subtext is strongest in the clipping’s dissolution: order fertilizes new possibility. No final-paragraph moralizing; the thematic echo (“purposefully curious”) is used twice but never unpacked, blunting resonance. Counter-readings are plausible: the merger may repeat the old covenant’s hubris, but the text does not seed this doubt.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person omniscient lite stays consistently anchored in Mira’s perceptual filter; no head-hop. Distinct texture—“root-bound,” “cobalt glade,” “recursive patterns”—creates lyric signature. Syntax modulates: longer reflective sentences collapse into short, syncopated fragments at the link beat, mirroring pulse. One register drift: “conceptual repricing” sounds like craft-talk, not Mira’s idiom, but occurs only once and does not contaminate dialogue.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm; sentence openings varied. One paraphrase loop: “time to prepare, time to understand, time to find” could compress. Mixed metaphor risk—“bruised purples” beside “defiant, unnatural spirals”—remains coherent. No scaffold sentences; information density high. Filter verbs minimal; props tracked cleanly. Closure image fertile soil is crisp and recharging.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Premise folds two psychic archetypes (depth vs. breadth seers) into a single moment; synthesis feels fresh. Scar-link as GPS is a non-obvious mechanics that pays off visually. Cobalt glade avoids generic forest; spiraling grass is memorable. Risk is moderate—lyric speculative rather than world-scale—but coherence stays high. Could swap Marcus for any scatter-dreamer, so not fully irreplaceable.</comment>
