<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses—guilt versus the need to aestheticize guilt—are dramatized in each echo-game; the final “I forge through you” crystallizes a renunciation that costs her the clean absolution the ritual promised. Interiority stays concrete via ink-stained fingers and the tactile bone spire. Micro-choices (whispering verses, teaching others to refract) visibly advance her stance. Flaw: elder’s pushback is talked about more than felt; relationship crucible remains under-charged.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mara steps toward the spire having redefined forgiveness as polyphonic, the cost being the elders’ withheld absolution. Causal chain holds—each echo experiment tightens her resolve; elder confrontation forces the final stance. Orientation is clean by line 10. One tight lens (Accumulative/Textural) taught early and held. The “price” is conceptually reweighted on-page in the final echo.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Bone towers plus echo physics function as active obstacle: they amplify, distort, and ultimately authorize her refracting tactic; the pale spire is re-handled at entry, midpoint, and final image. Mist and canyon walls narrow acoustic choice, guiding her impromptu stages. Sensory hierarchy favors audition over visuals, matching POV bias. World rules stay consistent without exposition; no object drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“can she achieve forgiveness without surrendering her art?”—is signaled in paragraph 1 and sharpened by the elder’s threat. The refracting sessions deepen tension by publicly undermining ritual authority; each echo overlap raises social cost. One clear tightening: elder orders her to climb anyway, foreclosing escape. Price is legible: she keeps her aesthetic but loses institutional absolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through acoustic metaphor: truth as prism versus single beam. Subtext resides in the elders’ frightened silence and the penitents’ migrating loyalty. Final line reframes “forgiveness” into creative forging without moralizing. Complexity preserved: ritual integrity is damaged yet her guilt remains intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lingers inside Mara’s perceptual filter—sound-before-sight, rhythm-before-meaning—creating a distinct poetic signature consistent with her artist role. Syntax modulates from long legato echo-lines to clipped declaratives under elder pressure. No head-hop; psychic distance tightens incrementally toward the hand-on-spire moment. Dialogue is minimal but carries indirection (“You conduct the ritual” returning as echo).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose shows lyrical control without purple overload: figurative language is patterned (echo variations) and paid off. High information density—each whisper line advances both plot and theme. No synonym loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“polyphonic,” “conceptual repricing”) stays within an artist-thinker lexicon, justified.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Freshened premise: penitential canyon that literally distorts confession, weaponized by a poet. Bone towers, inked fabric scraps, and refractive ritual feel idiosyncratic to this world. Transformation test fails if swapped to standard temple—acoustic rule-set is essential. Risk in lyric structure heightens meaning without obscuring stakes.</comment>
