<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Celeste’s interiority is concrete and embodied—her fingertips on the rail, the tingle of psychometric signature—while her contradictory impulses (hunger to mend vs. recognition that moments are gone) play out in the final gesture of dispersing the strips. The renunciation is earned: she pays the quiet cost of accepting love cannot be returned to source. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible n/a; micro-choices (opening the rusted box, projecting the map) reveal value hierarchy cleanly. Voice remains particular, never drifts into diagnostic speak.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the rain-broken thunder become the “forgotten lyrics finding their tune,” undeniable auditory proof that unused love is now in motion, reweighting the premise with social/imaginative cost. Causal chain holds—because she reads the strip, therefore finds the archive, therefore chooses dispersal—under Causal lens. Orientation (who/where/when) anchored by line 3. Persistent constraint: the strips’ physicality and the map’s necessity shape every late tactic. Cost visible in the final auditory image.</comment>

<comment>The projection booth functions as micro-setting that constrains every move—narrow stairs, brass rail worn smooth, rusted box bolted to wall—while the empty auditorium below supplies the emotional echo chamber. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven: Celeste notices dust motes as emotional static, reels as love incubators. Weather (muffled thunder → breaking rain) is tracked and finally charges the closure image. Spatial choreography is airtight: her body, the box, the window, the wall where map projects.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can dormant love be returned or released—tightens when the map reveals dispersal, not restitution, as the only live option; this narrowing is the single meaningful turn. Agency is decision: she chooses to scatter the strips, paying the cost of relinquishing reunion. Pressure escalates under Causal lens because each discovery (film → letters → map) forecloses the previous fantasy. Price is legible: she forfeits the consoling illusion that love can be delivered to its first intended.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from image pattern: film as petrified love → map as circulation → rain as released song, all without authorial thesis. Final non-literal answer: “forgotten lyrics finding their tune” reweights prior material, making unuttered affection socially consequential after all. Subtext operates in silence—hands almost touching, letters unsent—never explained. Emotional aftereffect is concrete: reader left hearing that rain-song, aware that unspent feeling still quests for new hearts.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays strictly inside Celeste’s perceptual filter: “dust motes swirled through shafts… she could still sense” etc. Psychometric visions are cleanly signaled as interior access, not head-hop. Diction remains within plausible lexicon for an itinerant seer; no sudden academic register. Rhythm modulates—long breath while reading, then clipped as she pries the box—mirroring pressure without syntactic monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Zero paraphrase loops or template cadence; each sentence advances knowledge or image. High density: brass rail worn smooth in same line as emotional static. Metaphors are coherent—love as “golden and luminous,” later as “water breaking through a dam”—and never mixed. Read-aloud ear test passes: varied sentence lengths, opening subjects shift, paragraph cuts yield visible rhythm. No artifact appears in final third; closure image remains luminous and clear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—unused love as tangible archive inside a dead cinema—feels fresh yet inevitable. Risk: turning sentiment into literal physics, but execution grounds it in sensory detail and causal map. Tropes (psychometry, lost letters) are transformed through the projection-light map device that externalizes emotional stasis. Final auditory twist rewards the “lyrics searching for tune” seed without gimmickry.</comment>
