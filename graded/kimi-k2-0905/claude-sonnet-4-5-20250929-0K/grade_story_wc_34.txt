<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Moth’s interiority is lyrically coherent—her “driftingly alert” attention masks precise purpose, a contradiction that stays active in-scene. The flower-press bolt plate and humming of lost ballads give her sensory specificity; no diagnostic self-talk. The closing smile and new song show a micro-choice that accepts the cost of perpetual solitude as courier of ghosts. Only the absence of a second on-page character keeps relationship crucible inapplicable; head-count clarity is perfect.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens: each graffiti stroke layers emotional density until the mural becomes a Resonant Reconfiguration—ghost’s gratitude pulses city-wide, Moth exits humming a new ballad, cost = endless itinerancy. Orientation anchored by word 40; no prop teleport. Single tightening beat: mural completion narrows her path from listener to lifelong transmitter. Closure image of “thank you in electricity” makes conceptual cost undeniable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Courtyard above clouds is not postcard; its stone-meets-vapor surface supplies the only workable substrate for bolt-plate nodes, directly enabling the encoding tactic. Lightning–thunder gap provides live clock that paces her brush. Mist drifts across stones, blurs edges, hides her from aerial surveillance—environment as concealment tool. Spatial choreography clean: plate under arm → pigments opened → bolts pressed; no floating rooms.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: give voice to the voiceless, signaled in para 2. Pressure tightens once: ghost’s loneliness becomes intolerable to Moth, forcing mural commit; cost = perpetual nomadism. No coincidence; escalation is density of unspoken needs she accumulates. Agency = encode act; refusal to stay and be celebrated forecloses rest. Under Accumulative lens, cadence shift from solitary listening to city-wide electrical pulse reweights stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: transmission as compassion—art turns isolation into shared circuitry. Moonflowers, starlight petals, and code-ghost reprise “pressed life” motif; final electrical thank-you reconfigures meaning of her earlier “preserving what would otherwise fade.” No moralizing; question lingers: who is more alive, singer or signal? Subtext in her hum = memory as resistance against erasure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person omniscient stays modest—knowledge limited to Moth’s perceptual field; no ghost interiority ventriloquized. Syntax mirrors her drifting-then-precise rhythm: long vapor-like clauses fracture into bolt-staccato “she pressed bolts into the wall.” Diction cloud-bound: “cumulus,” “starlight petals,” “tinkersong.” No filter-verb stacks. Head-hopping absent; electrical pulse kept external. Voice texture consistent under pressure of thunder roll.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Read-aloud cadence varies: opening spondaic crack of lightning, closing iambs of ballad. Sentences multitask: “She painted graffiti across the courtyard’s ancient stones, but her murals were more than decoration” advances action, world, and concept. No mixed metaphors; cloud-condensation pigment obeys internal logic. Minor scaffold: “unspoken needs” echoed three times—functional under Accumulative lens. No artifact touches closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: botanist-balladeer × cyber-ghost via graffiti Morse of pressed flowers. Premise not derivative; inverts SF trope—AI reaches human through pre-digital craft. Risk of lyrical stasis defeated by live clock of lightning. Specificity: copper bolt plate etched with emotional frequencies = irreplaceable gadget. Transformation test fails if Moth becomes generic courier; her ballad-hum anchors voice. Concept commits fully, no retreat to technobabble.</comment>
