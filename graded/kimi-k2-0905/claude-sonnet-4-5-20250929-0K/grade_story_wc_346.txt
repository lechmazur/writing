<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The adjuster’s interiority is vivid—her trembling hands, the ache of seventeen years—but the “beautifully flawed” trait never manifests as a concrete limitation that complicates the adjustment; she succeeds without visible error or self-confrontation. The puppet head functions as an emotional talisman yet doesn’t force a micro-choice that reveals hierarchy of values under pressure. Motive (“whisper a lullaby”) is declared poetically rather than dramatized as a conflicting imperative. Still, her embodied awe and the ritualized descent supply a credible, costed stance—Earned Stasis—so the arc lands, if quietly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a lyric Resonant Reconfiguration: the final sweep of the lighthouse beam reweights the prior nested patterns into a single Charged Poise—dawn is not guaranteed, yet the song persists. Causal linkage holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each poetic recurrence (waves, dominoes of light, puppet smile) thickens the atmospheric stake rather than forward plot, and the final image crystallizes the cost of perpetual guardianship. The 3-minute Clock shift is off-stage cause; the story’s “event” is her bearing of responsibility, which is legible and felt. No orientation debt; who/where/when is anchored by line 3 and never slips.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The lighthouse lamp room, spiral stairs, and salt-stained windows are economically seeded and return in the final beam-sweep that reconfigures meaning. The broken puppet head acts as micro-setting: its cracked smile and missing eye are handled twice, constraining her emotional stance and charging the closing cradle moment. Ocean waves mirror the fractal/nested motif, supplying texture that tightens the thematic stake. Environment never over-described; each detail is filtered through her professional perception of “mathematical poetry,” so setting and POV are inseparable.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—humanity’s survival mediated through her ritual—is declared early and tightened once: the 3-minute move to midnight. The on-page pressure is atmospheric rather than tactical; she experiences bruised awe, not external opposition. Escalation is a density shift—repetition of “nested patterns” and “falling dominoes of light” intensifies the abstract cost rather than narrowing physical options. The decision is renunciation: she accepts perpetual uncertainty, a stasis that forecloses escape; price is felt in the final beam’s solitude, satisfying the lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the paradox of tender control—attempting to mother a species that will never know its babysitter. Subtext lives in the puppet head: a broken toy entrusted with cosmic strings, implying that caretakers are themselves marionettes. No abstraction is sermonized; the final line “We sang our song” lets the reader price the song’s value. Ambiguity is purposeful: the lullaby may be futile, yet the act of singing redefines meaning, achieving Conceptual Repricing without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric remains tightly attached to the adjuster’s perceptual filter—she sees “fractal repetitions,” “pane of hush,” “nested patterns”—syntax mirrors her mathematical mysticism. No head-hopping; distance stays consistent, sliding closer under stress (“hands trembling”). Prose rhythm is controlled: longer cadences for oceanic drift, short clauses for ritual steps. No dialogue, so voice distinctiveness rests on diction; the near-liturgical repetition of “nested patterns” reads intentional, not algorithmic. Register never drifts into exposition; every metaphor is POV-justified.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Sentence variety is excellent; no template cadence or synonym churn detected. Information density high—each sentence layers image with emotional calculus (“canvas bag heavy with the broken puppet head”). Metaphors stay coherent within the fractal/nested logic; no mixed vehicles. Opening and closing lines are sharply image-driven, bookending without echo-loop repetition. Minor pocket of elevated diction (“vouchsafe”) but justified by the adjuster’s ceremonial voice. No scaffolding, no loops, no simultaneity errors; proofing clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The Doomsday Clock as literal lighthouse mechanism is a fresh conceptual synthesis; the broken puppet head as witness-talisman particularizes it. Fractal time-ripple causality feels inevitable in hindsight, not grafted. Risk is taken with near-pure lyric accumulation rather than plotted reversal; coherence holds. The “lullaby across lifetimes” reframes standard save-the-world stakes into intimate maternal maintenance, avoiding trope recycling. Specific detail (salt-stained glass, brass-crystal clock) anchors abstraction, preventing gimmickry.</comment>
