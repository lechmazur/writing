<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren’s interiority is lyrically specific—”the smoke clouds learned to hold their shape”—and her stoic, dreamless vigil is credibly exhausted. The renunciation of dreaming is Earned Stasis with cost: she forfeits private self for public nurture. No contradictory micro-choices are dramatized on-page, so the arc leans accumulative rather than causal; still, her final whisper-gesture lands as credible endurance. Secondary figure exists only as echo, so relationship crucible is waived without penalty.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is Charged Poise: the seeds root across superposed futures while the chess clock ticks once—time persuaded, cost paid in her perpetual wakefulness. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of luminous dune, humming seeds, and frozen midnight tightens meaning rather than plot causality. Orientation anchors inside 120 words; no lens ambiguity. One beat—seed scatter—reconfigures the world’s possibilities with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The glowing dune is not backdrop but tactical partner: approaching with “eyes half-closed” keeps it multiply real, constraining her choreography. Micro-setting objects—frozen clock, humming seeds—are handled, their states altering choices. Sensory triage favors haptic and auditory frequencies over postcard visuals. Environment directly charges the final image; meets 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: keep plural futures alive by preventing collapse of the dune’s superposition. Escalation is a single deepening—her song joins the flowers, tightening the ligature between guardian and cargo. Cost is visible: she pays with perpetual vigilance and the one-second leak of the clock. Agency is attention and renunciation rather than reversible decision, fitting Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges as: nurturing possibility demands personal forfeiture of private futures (dreams). No explicit thesis; final image of seeds rooting across timelines reweights earlier “dreamless” state into sacrificial credential. Subtext in the frozen clock’s single tick implies even persuaded time extracts a toll. Complexity lingers—some forests burn forever—avoiding moral symmetry.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is sustained lyric-fugue: long vowel chains, fractured lullaby cadence, scientific diction (“superposition,” “wave functions”) melted into incantation. Perceptual signature—quantum gardener who hears seed frequencies—remains unique and consistent. No dialogue, so voice convergence test is waived. Patterned elision (“occasionally everywhere”) is taught early and paid off at closure without clarity loss.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm modulates between propulsive freight-train clauses and hush-soft hortative lines. Metaphors stay internally coherent—smoke clouds “learn,” flowers “harmonize in broken beauty.” No synonym loops or filler stacks; information density high. One near-mixed metaphor—“roots diving through multiple realities at once”—is permissible under lyric license and does not dull closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses solarpunk hope with quantum ontology; not a trope checklist. The dreamless freight guard seeding collapsed timelines is a fresh synthesis; removal of any core node collapses the entire conceit. Risk in second-person shimmer-figure enriches without gimmickry. Final reprise of “time could be charmed” feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
