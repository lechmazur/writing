<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—precision vs. filial loyalty—plays out in concrete micro-choices (phone in pocket, rehearsed confession). The moment she chooses restorative justice over exposure is credibly earned; Vincent’s collapse carries visible paternal cost. “Mathematics of fair trade” edges toward label-speak but is immediately embodied by the 8K restitution plan, so the slip stays beneath the −0.4 diagnostic threshold.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: ink pot recognition → documentation → Jacobson upstairs → father confronted → treatment offer. The mid-scene reveal that asylum documents are already forged tightens options; closure lands as Earned Stasis—Vincent’s freedom traded for rehab, cost legible in his tears. Orientation anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prep-room chrome, formaldehyde, and second shrouded body narrow Mara’s attention and mirror her stripped-down ethic; the ink pot’s mother-of-pearl flash reappears at climax to refract blame. Spatial track holds: father crosses threshold, pot remains between them, Jacobson upstairs stays locatable. Environment constrains the choice—only in this “honest” room does Mara risk the breach.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Mara’s first act of whistle-blowing—signalled by word 40. Escalation: pot spotted → evidence gathered → widow briefed → confrontation → irreversible exposure. The tightening choice (dialing Jacobson) narrows Vincent’s options to surrender or arrest; cost shifts from moral abstraction to paternal sobs on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of ethical calculus emerges through iterated images of balance (scales of pearl inlay, equation metaphors) rather than declaration. Final image—Vincent crying beside the embalming table—reweights “deathly vitality” as rebirth prerequisite, achieving Conceptual Repricing without moralizing. Subtext in the widow’s unseen desperation keeps asylum stakes human, not rhetorical.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited sticks to Mara’s perceptual filter: fluorescent glare, chromed instruments, arithmetic idiom. Free indirect (“honesty was its own kind of mathematics”) stays inside her lexicon. No head-hopping; Vincent’s tears are externally observed, preserving distance. Rhythm modulates—long reflective sentences in early beats, clipped clauses during confrontation—mirroring rising pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Opening sentence marries metaphor and anchoring in one stroke. No filter-verb stacks; verbs are strong (“liquefied rigid thinking,” “chrome instruments gleamed”). One paraphrase loop detected (“deathly vitality” repeated in similar cadence within 30 words) but occurs in low-pressure exposition; closure line untouched. Metaphors stay coherent under mortuary lighting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Familiar father/daughter con-artist dynamic is refreshed through embalming-room crucible and asylum-forgery specificity; the ink pot converts estate-sale relic into evidentiary smoking gun. “Deathly vitality” as operational tone rather than decorative phrase feels idiosyncratic. Risk taken—restorative justice instead of police finale—lands cleanly, reweighting genre expectations.</comment>
