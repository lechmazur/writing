<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Iris’s “compassionate distance” is dramatized in the laundromat beat where she smoothes the crumpled invite against her thigh—an embodied micro-choice that shows her simultaneously reaching out and holding back. The wedding-ghost backstory is anchored to a present cue (the invite) and tilts her stance in-scene, satisfying BRR. Closure—choosing to stay by choosing when to go—reverses her prior equation of absence = protection, and the cost is felt in the final image of her reading herself back into the world. Interiority stays concrete: “static of human proximity” is sensory, not diagnostic.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the paradox rule-set is re-weighted when Iris realizes “staying while leaving wasn’t the mistake; thinking they were the same was.” Cost is legible—she forecloses the safety of perpetual withdrawal. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of mirrored paradoxes (library geometry, invitation arrival, emotional contradiction) tightens once at midnight, reconfiguring meaning. Orientation is clean: address, time, and impossible geometry are anchored by 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The “enlarged tranquility” of the library is rendered through sensory selectivity: shelves that “curved into themselves,” light that “cast no shadows.” This micro-setting functions as a tool—the impossible architecture literalizes the paradox rules and constrains Iris’s final stance. Coffee-shop brick façade is reused anchor, grounding the fantastic inside the everyday. Spatial choreography remains coherent despite the spatial paradox; the body is tracked as Iris descends the staircase that shouldn’t exist.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to love without disappearing—signals early and tightens once when the elderly woman reframes the mistake, narrowing Iris’s options to “stay by choosing when to go.” Pressure stays coherent under Accumulative lens: each paradoxical image (invitation arriving unseen, library larger than physics allows) increases density until the final reconfiguration. Cost is visible: Iris accepts that presence will now include moments of necessary absence, forfeiting the total safety of withdrawal. No off-stage resolution; coincidence (door unlocks) complicates rather than solves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from specific particulars rather than thesis: the invitation’s stealth delivery, the library’s Möbius shelves, the sister’s silence. Final image of Iris reading herself “back into the world” offers resonant, non-literal answer—no moral is stated. Subtext operates in silence: the collective reading commune embodies the solution before Iris articulates it. Avoids thematic echo; the woman’s line about hiding to become visible is dramatized by the setting, not abstract assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly focalized through Iris; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent: numeric exactitude (“eleven forty-seven,” “eleven fifty-three”) and sensory filtering of fluorescent hum fit her hyper-empathic, slightly compulsive nature. Prose texture varies rhythm—long sentences for impossible library description, short beats for midnight arrival. Dialogue sparse but functional; woman’s diction carries calm-water authority distinct from Iris’s anxious precision.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; no filter-verb stacks. Sentences carry double duty: “present but elsewhere” compresses status and psychology. Metaphors are clean—library light “cast no shadows” fits the physical paradox without figurative muddle. Opening line anchors voice and stakes simultaneously; final line cadence resolves by image. Density high without purple overload.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Premise—secret paradox library for empaths who hide—feels fresh yet inevitable in hindsight. Specific detail (crumpled invite, Möbius shelves) transforms familiar trope of magical doorway. Emotional specificity rescues concept from gimmickry: the “static of human proximity” is a lived, tactile cost. Risk in architectural impossibility pays off by dramatizing theme, not obscuring clarity.</comment>
