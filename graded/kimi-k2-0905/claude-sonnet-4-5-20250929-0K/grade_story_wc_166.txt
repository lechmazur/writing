<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kaleth’s interiority is lyrical and embodied—her spine “curved like waves” and cells “writing into DNA” give visceral stakes to exile. Yet her contradictory impulses (remember vs. ban compliance) are asserted more than dramatized; no moment forces an explicit choice between safety and memory until the swallow, so the renunciation feels foregone rather than fought. The final stasis is earned—she is “spontaneously anchored not by gravity generators but by the weight of what she’d become”—but the cost is poetic, not tactical. Voice is distinct, obsession credible; still, a single micro-choice under threat would have nudged this into high band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of “gaps” and crystalline imagery taught early and re-weighted at the end when her body becomes the final text. Closure is a Charged Poise—she stands in hieroglyph, galaxies in her eyes—conceptual cost legible: exile is now irreversible, her body the last scroll. Causality is lyric, not sequential, but the moonstone dissolve is the single because/therefore pivot that locks the verse into flesh. Orientation clean by 120 wds; no prop teleport; lyrical elision is purposeful.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Crystalline petals and gravity generators are sketched in motion, never catalogued; orbital garden remains slightly abstract but always filtered through dancer’s proprioception. The moonstone speck works as micro-setting that literally enters and rewrites her bloodstream, satisfying the 9+ constraint. Spatial choreography is maintained—kneel, rise, final pose—so the body itself becomes the set. Twilight under stars is atmospheric but static; it could have pressed harder (oxygen limits, orbital rotation) yet serves as mirror for memory’s last light.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: will she finish the forbidden verse before dawn/authority intervenes? Pressure is situational—time and ban loom—but escalation is poetic, not tactical: each dance phrase heightens density of memory rather than external danger. Moonstone swallow is the single tightening that makes the inscription irreversible; cost is conceptual (she becomes the text) rather than a lost option on the page. Agency is pure endurance/creation; because lens is lyric, this suffices, but a sharper external risk beat would have lifted the score.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges as embodied memory > nostalgia ban: “exile chosen freely was the purest form of belonging.” Subtext operates in gesture—she never says “ocean,” yet reader feels tide. Final image reconfigures premise: body as scripture is not rebellion but transcendence, a conceptual repricing of ban itself. No moralizing, only crystallized stance; ambiguity lingers—will caretaker report her?—which invites reflection without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close maintains dancer’s kinetic diction—obsidian grace, mercury flow—without head-hop. Syntax lengthens and contracts with breath of choreography; filter verbs avoided. No dialogue, so voice must carry all texture; it does, through rhythmic repetition of “she danced.” One minor register slip: “conceptual repricing” is academic lexicon POV probably wouldn’t use, but buried mid-paragraph, forgivable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm mirrors choreography—long sentences swell, then final line snaps to stillness. Figurative layering is dense yet coherent (crystalline petals, mercury gestures) and never muddles causal clarity. No scaffold, loops, or mixed metaphors; moonstone dissolution is precise. Occasional elevated diction (“kinaesthetic poetry”) is earned by context; no artifacts in closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fusion of tide-dancing, nostalgia ban, and body-as-manuscript is fresh; not a prompt checklist but organic synthesis. “Elective exile to orbital garden” and “cosmic verse on mortal skin” could have read gimmicky yet accrue emotional gravity through sensory specificity. Risk taken: lyric accumulation over causal plot; pays off in Charged Poise. Slight proximity to “forbidden art” trope, but dancer’s kinaesthetic language transforms it.</comment>
