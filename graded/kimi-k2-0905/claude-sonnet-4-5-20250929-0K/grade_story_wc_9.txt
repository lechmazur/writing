<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The cartomancer’s interior contradiction—yearning to atone yet still stealing time even on the pilgrimage—remains concrete and embodied. Her final micro-choice to trace her hand three times beside the infant’s print crystallizes a value hierarchy with felt cost: the cloud-beauty she surrenders versus the living skin she finally touches. The tablecloth object anchors generational guilt without slipping into abstracts. Flaw compounds choice: her compulsive busy-ness is the very sin she must abandon, making the renunciation earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the repeated tracing reweights the premise—time is not found but given—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The pattern is taught by the first cloud-ascension image and returns in the final nursery light, cadence-shifted. Cost is legible: the glade’s “choking beauty” is relinquished for mundane cradle light. No orientation debt; who/where/when land by line 4 and the moon-anchored geography remains coherent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The midnight glade above clouds is not backdrop but pressure engine: the rare air demands repentance and the luminous sap leaking from the cracked saucer literally materializes stolen time, forcing her recognition. Micro-setting inside the birthday cloth likewise constrains—every traced hand is a prior foreclosure that now dictates her promise. Sensory selection narrows under crisis: the star-flower scent “burns her throat” mirrors internal shame. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from ascent to descent with no impossible moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she keep stealing moments or give presence?—tightens once when the cards become windows foreclosing denial. Agency drives escalation: she chooses to spread the cloth, to look, to descend. Cost accumulates: each phantom object (cracked saucer weeping sap) is a viscerable price of hours already forfeited. The final tracing does not erase loss but forecloses future theft, satisfying the visible-price test.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of the cartomancer’s own lexicon: prophecy turns inward, time becomes tactile, “reading” becomes writing by marker on cloth. Subtext resides in silence—no dialogue—gesture substituting for speech: the triple tracing is vow enough. There is no moral slogan; the final image of fingers on baby skin reweights all prior card-ink as mere shadow. Ambiguity lingers: she may still fail, but the stakes are now flesh, not fate.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyric third-person hovers at a distance that lets metaphor breathe yet stays filtered through her selective attention: she notices root-sap, phone-light, hand-size. Syntax lengthens during cloud-float, then fragments on descent (“I will be here. I will be here.”) mirroring psychic distance collapse. No head-hopping; unreliability accrues only in her self-misbelief. Diction stays within plausible cartomancer lexicon—“cartomancer,” “cloudbound repentance”—without forced ornament.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is almost loop-free; only minor scaffold (“She...She...She” triad) is purposeful echo. Rhythm breathes with scene: long clauses for ascent, staccato repetends for promise. Metaphors are coherent—moonlight as spilled mercury, time calcified into ghost-objects—and never mixed. High information density: one sentence can anchor generation, guilt, and tool use. No artifact obscures closure; final tracing lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Cloud-divination as parental repentance feels fresh; trope inversion turns the seer’s craft back on her own fractured motherhood. Specificity—traced-hand cloth, saucer crack weeping sap—anchors the fantastical in irreplicable domestic detail. Risk is taken with lyric accumulation rather than causal reversals, paid off when the same hands become vow. Could edge higher if the fantastical rules were seeded earlier, but the emotional synthesis is non-obvious and resonant.</comment>
