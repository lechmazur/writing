<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Marina’s interiority is vivid—her pocketed stone fragment, the weight of “hopeful desperation,” the reflex to greet the soaked newcomer all embody her orderly-yet-intuitive nature. The contradiction between preservationist loyalty and pragmatic empathy is dramatized in her graffiti campaign, not just declared. One minor slip: the final invitation (“Let me show you how to really see it”) recycles an earlier beat without fresh cost, muting the arc’s crest.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the raft city’s “endless, defiant dance” reconfigures options—Marina recommits to motion, not stasis, with the stone’s weight now a conscious burden. Causal chain holds: gentrification threat → encoded graffiti → reclaimed platforms → renewed welcome ritual. Orientation is swift; only two reflective paragraphs exceed 20 % but each toggles present action (speedboat wake, chip in pocket) so momentum survives.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The brackish harbor, calliope drone, and fried-dough fog are filtered through Marina’s custodial gaze; sensory hierarchy favors what she must monitor to absorb shock. Micro-setting—her oil-wrapped stone scraping against denim—constrains the final choice to keep moving. Designer-boutique encroachment is sketched with satirical brevity that avoids tourist-catalog excess. Spatial choreography stays clean across platform hops and parade blockades.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—cultural survival versus sanitized “stability”—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when artisanal coffee floats displace fish stalls. One meaningful escalation: graffiti code shifts from heritage lesson to insurgent tactic, foreclosing passive nostalgia. Cost is visible in sleepless boutiques and Marina’s pocket-weight; options narrow to perpetual motion or surrender. No coincidence rescues; the developers are stalled by collective action she orchestrated.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through encroaching pastel storefronts and carousel-horse compass arrows: culture is a living, rearranging performance, not a museum diorama. Subtext resides in the stone chip—once foundation, now talisman—its meaning repriced from relic to ballast. Final image of the rocking platform refuses a moral, offering instead a kinetic credo. Only a whisper of editorial intrusion (“they wanted the carnival sanitized”) keeps this from the 9-tier.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays pinned to Marina’s sensory filter: “smell of fried dough and saltwater mingled into something that eventually felt like home.” Syntax lengthens under reflection, then fragments during graffiti raids, mirroring risk. No dialogue appears, so voice distinctness rests on perceptual signature—calliope timbre, barnacle metaphor—and remains consistent. Register never drifts into academic abstraction; carnival argot is organic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical, with strong verbs—“speedboats cutting aggressive wakes,” “music swelled”—and only one paraphrase loop (“constant motion, constant adaptation, constant refusal”) that reads as intentional incantation. Metaphors stay coherent: barnacles as gentrification, carousel horses as compass needles. No filter-verb stacks or purple overload. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Floating carnival-as-resistance reframes climate-gentrification narratives without sermon; the graffiti-code insurgency feels both playful and plausible. Transformation test fails if relocated to a landlocked town, confirming specificity. Risk lies in siding with chaos over security, yet the story commits fully to perpetual drift. Slight deduction for echoing familiar “artist vs developer” arc, though encoded symbology refreshes it.</comment>
