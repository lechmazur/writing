<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The stationer’s interiority is textured—her tactile obsession with “how a Tuesday in 1953 felt against the skin” is character-specific and embodied. Her single micro-choice—recording the honest oak “falsely”—crystallizes her flaw and costs her the possibility of unmediated truth, earning the renunciation. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene, however; the contradiction is only asserted in the final line, keeping this just shy of the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each lamp-hum and botanical distortion thickens the texture of time until the final “charged poise” under the proportionate oak reweights the premise—she will lie even at the zero-degree of truth. The closure image carries unmistakable conceptual cost: “Only the beautiful untruths require gilded leaves.” Orientation is clear by word 80; no causal break occurs.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The fluorescent lamps, notepad cardboard “soft as cloth,” and gigantized cherry blossoms are specific, sensory, and bias-filtered. Each environmental oddity (root-burst maples, humming tubes) constrains her charting method and charges the final image. The miniature/full-scale dissonance is not just vivid; it supplies the story’s governing metaphor for compressed/expanded time, cleanly meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—collecting tactile time-textures—is signaled early and tightens once: the honest oak forces her to choose between documentary truth and her gilded vocation. The pressure is textural rather than causal; cost is conceptual (she embraces falsity) but not viscerally felt on the page. Sufficient for this length, but the absence of a tangible forfeiture keeps it below 8.5.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: the human need to aestheticize experience even at the expense of truth. The final line revalues the entire quest without moralizing. No motif is forced; the gilded leaf recurs only as vocational signature, not symbol harvested for points. The ambiguity—beauty vs. veracity—lingers cleanly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to her sensorium; perceptual signature is consistent—“she listened” to lamps, “pressed her palm against the roots.” Syntax lengthens under wonder, contracts at the close: “The truth needs no stationer.” No head-hopping or register drift. Voice modulation tracks the intensification of texture without ever breaking pattern.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet breathable; each sentence layers image and idea (“blossoms remember being large”). No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. One clause—“their petals impossibly large, each bloom the size it would have been had the tree grown full-height”—is syntactically front-heavy, a hairline drag in the peak descriptive beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The premise—using bonsai groves and flickering fluorescent harmonics to map strata of experienced time—is non-obvious and fully committed to. The disproportionate bloom phenomenon is not quirky ornament; it embodies the core idea. Risky lyric accumulation pays off in the final conceptual repricing. Removing any botanical or acoustic detail would collapse the story’s logic.</comment>
