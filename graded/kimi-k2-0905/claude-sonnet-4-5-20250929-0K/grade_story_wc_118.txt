<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Miren’s curator-observer trait is vivid and embodied—her fingertip reading of the tapestry threads shows sensuous specificity—but her interiority never fractures under contradiction; the “odd historian” label is asserted rather than dramatized by aberrant choice. Backstory allotment is efficient (≤20%) and anchored to the tactile present, yet the closing smile feels performative, not a visible cost for the path foreclosed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the tapestry’s claw re-weighted by Catherine’s diaries reconfigures meaning with felt conceptual cost—“someone needed to remember.” Accumulative lens holds: pattern of salvaged objects → reprise at mount. Orientation clear by line 5; no caps triggered. Micro-turn (dragon-claw/shield ID) is the single tightening required at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The silo-library is evoked through lived motion—spiral shelves, dust motes in bronze shafts—rather than catalogue. Object-as-setting (tapestry fragment) constrains the final gesture of mounting; meets 9+ gate. Sensory hierarchy stays faithful to Miren’s curator bias: texture first, visual second. Spatial choreography is clean across the single continuous scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“preserve unheard stories”—is signaled early and deepens through the diary-tapestry axis; micro-turn tightens options when Miren commits wall-space. Cost (perpetual, possibly fruitless labor) is implied but not viscerally felt on-page; hence capped below 8.8. Accumulative escalation sufficient under lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of memory as tactile resistance to collective amnesia emerges organically from object-handling; no overt thesis stated. Final image of two women touching the same weave offers resonant non-literal answer. Avoids sentimentality by keeping Catherine’s fate unresolved. Slight softness because “bronze quiet” tone is named rather than re-inflected at end.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person free-indirect stays tight to Miren’s curator perception: “sensitively perceptive” becomes verb-music—“her fingers… traced the edges.” Rhythm swells in long sentences for awe, contracts for discovery. No dialogue, so voice carries entire differential. Diction remains within plausible lexicon; no filter-verb bloat.</comment>

<comment>Prose is clean, lyrical, and info-dense: one sentence = texture + backstory + emotional tilt. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Figurative language is sparse and paid off (“industrial bones” mirrored by later mounting). Opening and closing lines are image-anchored, avoiding explanation. Minor over-alliteration in “bronze quiet of late afternoon” is tolerable.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Post-dream extinction world plus object-archive is fresh synthesis; “library of salvaged things” reverses expectation of books. Transformation test passed—plot collapses without silo-archive rule. Risk is moderat—concept is bold but execution stays safe lyricism rather than formal gamble. No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
