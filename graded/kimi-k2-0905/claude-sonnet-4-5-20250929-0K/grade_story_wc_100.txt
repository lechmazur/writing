<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Marcel’s interiority is vivid—his bone-deep fatigue, the way he packs “diving equipment he couldn’t properly use,” the quiet conviction “The dead have hired me.” These micro-choices reveal a man trading familiar competence for unknown service, and the final smile into dreamless sleep shows earned release. The only gap is absence of a second on-page character to pressure status, but single-POV compression is acceptable at this length; contradictory impulses (fear vs. vocation) are felt in scene.</comment>

<comment>Causal lens holds: package arrival → dreams → recognition of liminal dead → decision to descend → restoration → release. Each beat is a because/therefore link; the decisive moment—“You can rest now”—carries visible cost as Marcel rises “already falling asleep,” relinquishing the library he just rebuilt. No orientation debt; transitions (boat→bell→library) are legible. Closure reconfigures meaning: death as relocation now has an address, and Marcel’s exhaustion is the price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Setting is the story’s engine: the oilcloth smelling of “brine and decay,” the impossible foyer existing at three depths, bioluminescent light fractured through the broken lens. Details are filtered through Marcel’s embalmer eye—he notices stillness, preservation, catalog order—and the library’s atmosphere literally supplies breathable air, constraining his choice to stay and repair. Final image of surface glitter refracts earlier motif, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake: give the drowned scholars rest by restoring their sanctuary. Pressure tightens once: realization that burial is impossible → only revitalization remains. Escalation is accumulative—each shelved book increases spectral clarity until “they began to fade.” Cost is Marcel’s cumulative exhaustion; the stillness he carries home is the felt price. Agency resides in every act of reordering; no coincidence resolves the core conflict.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges without statement: devotion to knowledge outlasts death; caretaking is a relocation service, not an ending. Subtext in the broken lens—fractured light finally guides souls home—reweights earlier image of “constellation of sharp-edged fragments.” Final smile into empty dreams offers quiet conceptual repricing: undertaker’s own death-anxiety relocated. No moralizing, only resonance.</comment>

<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is undertaker-tired: clauses weighted like lead, rhythm slowing under pressure (“He worked for days or hours—time flowed strangely here”). Perceptual signature precise—Marcel catalogs sensations as an embalmer would, noticing decay, stillness, refraction. Lexicon stays within his diction; no head-hopping. Compression in later paragraphs mirrors his fading stamina, teaching the pattern and paying off in the emptied dream-space.</comment>

<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density—each sentence advances stakes or aura (“lighthouse lens… fractured into a constellation of sharp-edged fragments” does double duty as image + foreshadowing). Figurative language is spare, marine, and coherent; no mixed metaphors. Final line lands by image, not explanation. Opening line anchors voice and mystery in one stroke. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; no filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: undertaker + underwater library + broken lighthouse as funeral lantern. Devotion to scholarship persisting as ghosts who need shelving is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risk in concept—liminal architecture that supplies its own atmosphere—pays off by making restoration the only viable ritual. Specificity of embalming tools used as library supplies deepens integration. No derivative premise drag; transformation is complete.</comment>
