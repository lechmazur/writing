<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses—prophetic omniscience vs. her own desperation for surprise—clash inside every beat; the renunciation of sight is credibly paid for by the prior cascade of stolen futures, the final “Teach me” crystallizes Earned Stasis with unmistakable cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the cave’s new song reweights every prior prophecy as theft; the drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern break of the pearl’s darkness re-tunes the cave’s music—and the price (irreversible loss of sight) is on the final line.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The rotating cave pearl functions as micro-setting that first enables and then annihilates Mara’s tactics; crystalline acoustics constrain her perceptual grammar throughout, and the final “bright darkness” is inseparable from the spatialized sonic geometry that charges the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—control vs. surrender of wonder—tightens when the pearl shows void instead of futures; protagonist agency drives the turn (she asks to be stripped of sight), and the cost (perceptual blackout) is legible in the final sensory reversal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: prophecy as colonial extraction of surprise; the cave’s new song reprises earlier “copper and starlight” but now uninterpretable, forcing reader to reprice every prior miracle as diminishment—resonant, non-literal, undogmatic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Distinctive perceptual signature—tasting frequencies, seeing shadows overlap—remains stable under pressure; patterned elision (“bright darkness”) is taught early and paid off at closure; no head-hop, no register drift; syntax mirrors sonic curvature.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density with zero paraphrase loops; figurative language is selective (“shadows grew teeth” earns its keep); rhythm accelerates with the pearl’s spin and snaps into short declaratives at the void reveal—no scaffold, no mixed metaphors at climax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: clairvoyant anti-oracle who steals wonder; cave-as-instrument that retunes itself to punish extraction; risk taken by making protagonist’s triumph a voluntary blindness—specific, non-portable, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
