<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Kael’s desperation is palpable and embodied; his interiority stays concrete (“clutched his pack…pressed deeper”). The final endurance carries cost—lantern spent, stone now his burden—yet the internal contradiction between fear and duty could be sharper on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: because the surface is unbearable ∴ Kael descends; because he reads ripple-marks ∴ he finds the echo-stone; because he yields his own silence ∴ the bloom flowers. Closure lands as Charged Poise—stone glowing, village breathing in new spaces—cost visible in spent lantern and Kael’s solitary ascent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setting is tactile and POV-filtered: ripple marks as “waves frozen mid-crash,” ice-fractals read like deltas. Harmonic caves actively distort under alien intrusion, guiding his choices; the echo-stone functions as micro-setting that reweights the final image. Spatial choreography stays clean in single POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes—surface noise vs. sought silence—tighten once: the stone’s activation forecloses retreat, creates breathable pockets between alien pulses. Escalation is single but sufficient for length; cost (lantern dark, Kael alone) is on-page. Agency is attention/renunciation rather than combat, fitting lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges inductively: trauma read through “patterns that trauma left behind,” silence as forged repose rather than absence. Final line reweights ripple-maps from hobby to survival tool—earned, not declared. Avoids sermon, invites lingering ambiguity about sustainability of hush.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-limited voice maintains perceptual signature—cartographer’s metaphors, sonic vocabulary. Rhythm swells during stone-activation, then contracts to short declaratives for ascent, mirroring breath reclaimed. No head-hop; diction stays within plausible rural-scientific lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose stays lean: “glass and teeth ache” compresses sensory overload. Figurative language is selective—only two metaphors per high-pressure paragraph—preventing density bleed. No template cadence; sentence openings vary. Final line’s “bloom of hush” recycles earlier phrase with reweighted charge, acceptable echo.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fusion of cartography + acoustics + alien sound invasion feels fresh; “ripple-mark mapkeeper” profession is specific invention. Premise could risk trope but grounded in grandfather journals and ice-fractal literacy. Risk—quiet resolution—pays off by reconfiguring silence as cultivated space rather than weapon.</comment>
