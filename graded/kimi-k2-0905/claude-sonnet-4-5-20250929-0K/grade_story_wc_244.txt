<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s loneliness is embodied in her one-way conversation with a rock and the reflexive “desperately jocular bark” she admits is a mask; the arrival of Emil and the others forces micro-shifts from isolation to wary connection that accumulate into the final choice to “stay found.” Interior contradiction is vivid—“laughed—that desperately jocular bark she’d perfected to deflect genuine emotion”—and the stance tilt is dramatized when she lifts the stone in the dim light, recognizing the fragments as “permission.” The network-of-care payoff is earned because her prior competence and solitary reflexes are visibly costed by the pattern of vanishing before gratitude can attach. Only the secondary cast stays slightly schematic, preventing a higher band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the seventeen fragments reweighted as “permission to stop moving” crystallizes a new social contract under the ivy station roof; cost is felt in the forfeiture of perpetual vanishing. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: each arrival thickens pattern until the combined fragments reframe loneliness itself. Orientation is anchored by word 54 with “disused railway station…ivy,” satisfying the 120-word test. No causality breaks; the rumor chains are presented as mysterious but never resolve through luck—final stance is internally driven.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The station’s broken windows and moss benches are lived-in logistics shelves; crates of purifiers determine where characters sit and how they navigate space. The ivy operates as both metaphor and physical curtain, guiding Emil’s partial concealment in the doorway and later framing the communal table. Micro-setting of the ticket office constrains the gathering size and keeps the climax intimate. Final image of moon fragments on the shared table reuses the setting’s dominant visual (dim platform light) to charge the new, permanent “infrastructure of mutual aid.”</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—loneliness versus mutual aid—is signaled in Mara’s opening rock monologue. One meaningful tightening occurs when the seventeenth fragment arrives and the option to vanish again is foreclosed; the price is the surrender of her anonymity ritual. Agency is collective but still readable: they “choose, finally, to stay found,” a renunciation with visible social cost. Pressure accumulates through each new arrival rather than a single antagonistic turn, coherent with the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges organically: reciprocity as an “invisible currency” moves from abstract ethos to concrete social infrastructure without a summarizing moral. The moon rock motif starts as kitsch, is reweighted as catalyst, then reprised on the shared table as emblem of the new network—its final charge is earned. Subtext operates in gesture (“wild gleam of someone who’d decoded too many conspiracy theories”) rather than thesis. Final line “We heard a rumor” offers resonant, non-literal answer: connection is itself the perpetual rumor they now sustain.</comment>

<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person POV stays tight to Mara’s perceptual filter: “ivy that crept…like nature reclaiming its due” is her professional metaphor for forgotten zones. Syntax is controlled and varied—“polite anarchy of people who’d learned that mutual aid began with aiding each other” lands as compressed credo. Dialogue is minimal but distinctive: Emil’s first line jolts with conspiratorial idiom; Mara’s reply stays terse, logistical. No head-hopping; when others arrive they remain external, preserving her focal center.</comment>

<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive—“disused railway station had become Mara’s headquarters not by design but by necessity” performs characterization, setting, and backstory in one stroke. Metaphors stay coherent (ivy as reclamation, rumors as travel) and do not stack during high-pressure beats. No synonym loops or template cadence; sentence openings vary. Final clause “We heard a rumor” functions as rhythmic snap-close that echoes opening causality without scaffolding. Minor over-adjectiving (“desperately jocular bark,” “practiced anarchy”) is justified by voice and not repeated to clutter.</comment>

<grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses disaster logistics with found-family lyricism; “reciprocity” as cure for loneliness is fresh inversion of typical savior narrative. Moon rock fragments act as non-magical MacGuffin—permission tokens rather than plot gadgets—avoiding cliché. Structure (rumor chain as breadcrumb trail) is taught early and paid off in final punch-line. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped because the specificity of relief-worker argot and the station ecology are inseparable from emotional payoff. Risk in quiet, anti-spectacular climax heightens coherence.</comment>
