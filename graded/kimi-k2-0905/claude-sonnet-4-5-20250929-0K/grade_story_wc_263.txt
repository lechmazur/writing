<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Celestine’s interiority is lyrical and specific—“dreams that whispered coordinates in languages she shouldn't understand”—but her contradictory impulses stay mostly summarized; the decisive turn (deliberately skewing the astrolabe) is visible and earned, yet the cost is more conceptual than visceral, softening the renunciation’s sting.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: “Create” reweights the premise, felt cost is the Keeper’s dissolution and Celestine’s prior calcification, causal lens (Accu/Lyric) holds cleanly; the single scene is anchored by 120 wds and the final aurora-to-dawn cadence tightens meaning without outside contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The aurora-lit archway functions as micro-setting that constrains and finally releases the Keeper; selective sensory detail (“ribbons of green and violet aurora,” “frozen fingers”) is POV-filtered and purposeful, charging the final imperfect star-traced arc that crystallizes freedom.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Pressure tightens once: Celestine’s choice to introduce imperfection forecloses perfect prediction and frees the Keeper; cost is legible (Keeper dissolves, astrolabe goes cold), but escalation is single-beat, lacking an intermediate tactical loss that would push the score higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme—art vs. formulaic control—emerges through the Keeper’s backstory and Celestine’s final imperfect trace; the closing imperative “Create” offers resonant non-literal answer, avoiding moralizing, though the thematic counter-argument (value of precision) is briefly asserted rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet controlled, with patterned compression (“voice like wind through empty cathedrals”) taught early; perceptual signature remains consistent, no head-hop, free indirect style stays clean, rhythm modulates under aurora intensity—minor loop near “falling stars traced paths” keeps it sub-9.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm, high density (“stardust pattern—for every atom…”), only minor scaffold (“she understood… she too had been calcifying”) and one mixed-metaphor ripple; no artifact touches closure, but stacked figurative sentences in the mid-section dull propulsion slightly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The trapped-artist-via-astronomy premise feels fresh; stardust memory and aurora portal are specific to this world, and the inverse tragedy—perfection as prison—supplies a non-obvious moral calculus, though the narrative arc follows a familiar mentor-release template.</comment>
