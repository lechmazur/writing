<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rielle’s interior contradiction—longing to learn the real cost vs. dread of discovering it—stays alive in every micro-choice (trudging upstairs, letting Silent-Choir guide her, touching the broken bolt). Her left-hand numbness and slowly returning pins-and-needles embody guilt/relief in the same gesture; the bench-wobble under her weight literalizes shared damage. Silent-Choir’s vow of silence is motive and obstacle: he can testify only via gesture and music; when he presses middle C then completes the chord, that single escalation changes Rielle’s goal from interrogation to duet. The final renunciation—playing on, accepting perpetual winter and partial reparation—earns its cost because the reader has felt her fingers ache back to life.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: two survivors share a broken anthem whose meaning has been repriced—safety now equals perpetual shared debt. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—snow, silence, nerve regrowth, and bolt-splinters accrue until the chord crystallizes them. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive by line 2; no penalty. Cost is visible on-page: “each note a small resurrection” while snow keeps burying footprints—hope and erasure locked together.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The cobalt fortress, eternal snowfall, and war-damaged interior (crooked door, arrow-slit light, sheared bench bolt) actively constrain tactics: Kovacs could mask children only because the piano room survived; Rielle can play only because the bench is braced, not replaced. Snow functions as micro-setting—Rielle’s climb is slowed, numbing, metaphorical. Sensory range is selective (cold iron banister, wobbling bench, single resonant middle C) and filtered through a soldier’s priorities. Space stays coherent: staircase → landing → corridor → music room; bodies move without teleport.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding the price of survival—tightens when evidence accumulates: discoloration proves others kept climbing; the bolt exposes shared fracture; Silent-Choir’s chord forces her to bear witness. One decisive deepening rather than multiple reversals suits the accumulative lens. Agency is endurance and participation: she keeps climbing, sits, plays. Cost is visible in her tingling fingertips and the unsung anthem that will never resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: the cost of collective safety is that someone stays silent so others can speak later. Bolt, discoloration, and numb fingers form a returning motif whose final re-weighting occurs when she realizes “the grace was in not paying it alone.” No moral is stated; the image of two players in a broken room while snow buries prints offers an open, resonant answer that reframes every prior beat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is crisp: tactile military cataloguing (discoloration, sheared metal, wobble) meets lyrical winter metaphors without ever departing from Rielle’s sensorium. Compression is taught early—“snow that never stopped falling” signals patterned diction; payoff is the final cadence “snow continued its eternal descent.” No head-hopping; Silent-Choir’s interior is implied solely through gesture, maintaining distance control. Rhythm flexes from sinuous long sentences (ascent) to staccato clauses under piano chord pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences layer time, body, and metaphor (“Three months since the battle—three months of nerve regeneration, of pins and needles blossoming into crude sensation”). No loops or paraphrase; “snow that never stopped falling” is purposeful incantation, not synonym churn. Metaphors stay internally coherent (frozen fingers/clawing turrets). Grammar clean; pronouns unambiguous after subject shift to Silent-Choir. Final line offers resonant send-off without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The “mute witness who can only testify by music” trope is refreshed by giving him the occupation of bellhop—seraphically mundane precision under fire. Discolored staircase dust as historical ledger is a fresh forensic device; bolt-as-fracture literalizes shared damage. Balances risk and clarity: lyric repetitions could have slid into monotony but serve accumulative lens, rewarded. The synthesis feels inevitable yet not borrowed from a familiar war-story template.</comment>
