<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mei’s interiority is concrete—her hand steadies while her heart lurches—and her hierarchy of values (village > life) drives every micro-choice. The Magistrate’s softening eyes and deliberate key-offer show status shifting under pressure. Only the “heritage rose wisdom” line drifts toward slogan; the rest is earned through embodied action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the jade key is revealed not as a physical opener but as permission itself, reweighting every prior forgery. The causal lens holds—each forgery exists because the Magistrate silently enabled it—and the final image of Mei adding the key to her “tools” crystallizes the new rule-set with visible cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Marble sanctuary, green aurora, and stalactite drips are filtered through Mei’s urgent selectivity; the drip cadence literally masks her brush strokes, fusing setting to tactic. The heritage rose outside mirrors the thorn she keeps on her desk, constraining her notion of “wise blood.” Only the aurora remains decorative—it never limits choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—village survival vs. personal execution—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when the Magistrate appears. The final transfer of the key forecloses the option of ever again pretending the forgeries are unsanctioned; the price is the Magistrate’s impending loss of office. One meaningful deepening is sufficient and felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: governance can be merciful only when it betrays its own cruelty. The rose-thorn motif re-prices from metaphor to tool, showing that protection sometimes demands blood. No moralizing final paragraph; the green aurora over the blooming rose supplies the resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person hovers close to Mei’s perceptual filter—“pearl twilight,” “calligrapher’s brush trembling”—with rhythmic compression under pressure. Syntax grows clipped when the Magistrate steps forward, mirroring her cardiac skip. No head-hopping; the brief drift into the Magistrate’s twenty-year search is cleanly cued by his spoken memory.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “water droplets fell…marking empires” fuses time, sound, and stakes in one stroke. One mixed metaphor—“green fire dancing across marble”—is minor. No loops, no filter-verb stacks; paragraph cuts are crisp. Final line outside the sanctuary re-uses aurora and rose with reweighted charge.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The sanctioned-forgery premise feels fresh, but “wise thorn” and “pearl twilight” flirt with aesthetic shorthand. The jade-key-as-permission twist, however, is genuinely non-obvious and retroactively rewrites every prior scene. Risk is present—empire bureaucrats collude in their own subversion—yet the piece stops just short of bold structural experimentation.</comment>
