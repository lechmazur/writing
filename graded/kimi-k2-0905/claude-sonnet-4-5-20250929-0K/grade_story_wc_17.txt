<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Maya’s loneliness and hypersensitive vocation feel lived-in; the moment she palms the wall and registers “ancient respiration” shows interior contradiction in action. The diary/film discovery externalizes internal stakes cleanly; her trembling hands dramatize embodied cost without label-speak. The closing micro-choice—“she would continue mapping”—is a credible renunciation that forecloses escape from the family curse. Missing only a secondary on-page relationship to act as crucible, but single-POV pressure holds.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens governs: each sensed echo thickens the pattern until the final image of “ivy exhaled” reweights what “dreaming with walls” costs. Closure lands as Charged Poise: Maya accepts lifelong entanglement, cost crystallized in the satchel’s weight and the passage’s breath. Orientation swift within 120 words; no set-up left unpaid. One minor scaffold (“She returned…with renewed purpose”) could trim, but rhythm recovers before final beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ivy as living circuitry, sodden ash flashing into preserved film—these tactile specifics anchor the fantastical premise without exposition dump. Micro-setting (marble hearth, leather satchel) doubles as tool and memory trigger, constraining how Maya can extract clues. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and acoustic texture, matching cartographer POV. Final ivy “exhale” recharges the environmental motif so it participates in closure instead of decorating it.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“what do walls dream?”—signals early; each sonic layer raises the cost of knowing until the film proves the walls preview futures, tightening irrevocably. No external antagonist needed; pressure is epistemic and heritable. Protagonist agency turns on staying, accepting the dream-circuit, with visible price: lifelong obsession like her grandfather’s. One deepening suffices for length; escalation stays coherent under accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete inversion: memory is forward-looking; architecture anticipates flesh. No moral stated—final image of dreaming corridor re-prices legacy from burden to communion. Subtext carries in gesture (hand on stone) and silence (no one else hears). Ambiguity lingers: is she chosen or caged? Complexity preserved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice carries a hush of acoustic precision—“ghost-pressure of thousands of hands”—that distinguishes narrator from generic lyric mode. Syntax lengthens during discovery, contracts at tremor, mirroring pulse. No dialogue to test, yet interior monologue avoids filter verbs. Register consistent: scientific diction (“acoustic signatures”) stays within educated lay POV. Ivy personification “exhaled” earns poetic license via earlier pattern.</question>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong information density: one sentence often layers sensory data, metaphor, and plot advancement. Only two paraphrase loops (“walls remember / walls anticipate”) but separation wide enough to read as purposeful echo. No mixed metaphors; vehicles stay architectural. Rhythm modulates without algorithmic pattern. Opening and closing lines perform symmetry without drum-beat monotony. Minor prop-state clarity: film negative described as “curled” then “holding…strip”; spatial moment briefly floats but restored next clause.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Echo-cartography as climate-science mysticism feels fresh; trope of haunted building flipped into predictive architecture. Grandfather’s absence drives present choice, avoiding passive heritage cliché. Conceptual risk—buildings dream forward—committed fully, implication followed to last line. Specific detail (ivy leather-thick, sodden ash) prevents abstraction. Transformation test fails if relocated: drowned university, acoustic mapping, climate-adapted ivy are inseparable.</comment>
