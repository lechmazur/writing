<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira’s desire to “honor overlooked histories” is stated early and re-anchored in the grandmother memory, but her interior contradiction—yearning for the tangible while translating the immaterial—never sharpens into a single high-cost micro-choice. The lens fragment is handled, yet the beat where she “positions it over the first painting” is summarized, not dramatized, so the visible price (time, risk, emotional exposure) is only asserted. Closure earns a modest Charged Poise: she watches the next child, feeling “time compress,” but the cost is retrospective, not freshly paid on the page. Still, the occupation-specific perceptual bias (seeing “between languages”) colors every image, keeping her above stock.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the rainbow-cast names reweight the city’s narrative authority, and the cost is the irreversibility of public exposure—legible if thin. Causality holds on an Accumulative lens: each shard of recovered memory adds density until the final exhibition crystallizes meaning. Orientation is clean by line 3; the single transition from market to studio is marked by nightfall. No lens ambiguity; pattern taught early (“spaces where cultures touched”) and paid off in the closing rainbow. Meets 9+ quick test except that the final cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt.</comment>

<comment>The alchemist’s market is immediate: rope bridges sway “with each transaction,” starlight is sold in bottles. The lens fragment functions as micro-setting, constraining Mira’s gaze and literally refracting what can be known. Sensory hierarchy favors the visual, but it is POV-justified—translator as watcher. Final image of rainbow across “forgotten names” reuses the elevated vantage established in paragraph one, so spatial choreography stays coherent.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—recover erased immigrant lives—signaled in paragraph two. Pressure tightens once: the lens reveals hidden portraits, turning abstract duty into specific faces; this deepens rather than reverses, sufficient for Accumulative lens. No coincidences resolve; the vendor’s offer is motivated by grandmother history. Cost is present but light: Mira’s evenings lost to documentation are mentioned, not shown. Enough to enter 8-band, not 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through refracted light and recycled materials: what is deemed obsolete still guides. Subtext resides in the unspoken civic guilt of a city that “scrubbed” names. The final rainbow re-prices the official narrative without moralizing. Complexity is honored: the city is neither villain nor savior, merely layered.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Mira’s perceptual filter—“between-worlds” idiom shapes every noun choice (“bottled starlight,” “crystallized memories”). Syntax lengthens during reflective beats, shortens during object handling, mirroring translator precision. No dialogue, so voice distinction bullet is N/A. One minor register lift—“conceptual repricing” zone—but diction stays within Mira’s educated lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty: “platforms had once been tenement floors” embeds history inside spatial note. No paraphrase loops; each metaphor extends the light/vision motif without contradiction. Opening and closing lines book-end with refracted sunset, creating purposeful ring structure. Clean grammar, no scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fantastical immigrant-memory market feels fresh, yet grounded in real urban erasure. The lighthouse-keeper-as-painter twist is foreshadowed, not sprung. Risk taken: no antagonist, no violent turn, yet coherence maintained. Could swap city name, but the specific conjunction of translator + lens + erased murals is unlikely to emerge by template.</comment>
