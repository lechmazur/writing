<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira’s calm indexer persona is vivid and consistent; her “tranquilly perceptive” stance under pressure is dramatized through micro-choices (cross-referencing by lamplight, re-stamping the sheet). Interior contradiction is light—no real tension between caution and obsession—but embodied emotion (“pulse quickened”) and tactile handling of stamp/tools keep her alive. The arc is a quiet crystallization rather than a change, satisfying Earned Stasis yet missing a sharper cost or flaw-driven mistake.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single-scene arc under Accumulative/Textural lens: each new stamped volume tightens the pattern until the hidden press is revealed. Orientation is swift—blackout, sunken library, table, lamp by line 5. Causality is light but coherent: blackout → analog method → pattern noticed → purpose renewed. Closure lands with Charged Poise: final stamp becomes her own vow, cost legible in the last line “marking her own beginning.”</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Water-pressed marble table, mineral-slick floors, bloated spines—details are selective, sensory, and filter through Mira’s cataloguer gaze. The stamp-as-micro-setting constrains action: its hidden lettering and weight shape every discovery. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves. Final image recharges the same stamp, now repurposed as her pledge, meeting the 9+ gate for object-as-setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“trace honest origins”—is signaled early and escalates as each stamped volume widens the hidden archive. Tightening is intellectual, not perilous: risk of scholarly omission rather than physical danger. One credible cost is the blackout itself, forcing analog labor that enables discovery; felt price is slight but present. Agency is observational—pattern recognition—yet it forecloses her old neutral indexing stance, satisfying lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>Theme emerges organically: drowned official histories vs submerged counter-histories, paralleling Mira’s own submerged purpose. No explicit moral; final stamp-image reweights “Truth Before All” as personal creed. Subtext is carried throughobjects—stamp, ink, seawarped pages—rather than assertion. Quiet ending avoids sermon, leaving resonant ambiguity about what reclaiming truth will cost her.</question>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person intimate stays glued to Mira’s perceptual filter; diction (“catalogue drawer,” “spines bloated”) is profession-specific yet lyrical. Rhythm flexes—long sentences for methodical search, short bursts for discovery. No dialogue, so no voice convergence. Filter verbs are minimal; prose itself becomes her indexing mind, achieving textured coherence under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is clean, mostly rhythmic, high density; a few template stems (“she… then she…”) appear but do not cluster at climax. Mixed metaphors avoided; “dappled resolve” is the only ornamental phrase, yet it is motif-earned. No loops or synonym churn; paragraphs advance knowledge. Closure line is crisp, unburdened by overwriting, sustaining momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Flooded-archive premise is fresh, but “hidden press reveals suppressed history” is a familiar beat; specificity of indexer POV and stamp-mechanic transform it enough. Risk is moderate—quiet intellectual rather than physical stakes. Final re-purposing of stamp into personal pledge offers a small but memorable reweighting. Could swap settings with minor edits, hence not top-band.</comment>
