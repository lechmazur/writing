<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Mara’s night-shift solitude keeps relationships off-stage, yet her interiority is textured—“what memories live in their rings” shows a private cosmology. The sextant micro-choices anchor her agency, but the moment she presses bark and grief drops from 4.3 to 0.1 is abstractly reported rather than embodied, muting cost visibility. A stronger physical correlative or after-tremor would have nailed the transformation to her body and lifted the score into the 8-band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative lens: pattern of dream-extractions tightens tone and stakes without causal reversals; each amber bead is a visible unit of reweighting. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—fountain dissolves transformed grief into water that will “nourish new seedlings,” making future loss inherit prior healing; cost is the irreversibility of that transfer. Orientation is crisp within 120 words; no props teleport. One soft spot: no persistent constraint carried forward—Mara’s tools are intact, her body unscathed, so felt cost is existential rather than tactical, keeping the score just below 9.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Stormlit tower functions as micro-setting: lightning silver and moon shaft explicitly guide the sextant’s lens, binding weather to action. Hedge maze geography stays coherent—pin drop anchors corridor, exterior stairs lead to tower summit, descent returns to northwest quadrant. Sensory triage matches urgency: narrow attention to chime, bark palpability, resin glow; no checklist dilation. Final image—fountain dissolution—leans on prior environmental detail, satisfying the “recharge” test for 9-band, but lacks physical constraint on tactics, capping at 8.4.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: prevent maze from becoming sentient archive of unfiltered sorrow; each extraction tightens the threat. Escalation is accretive—branch after branch, sorrow unit after unit—rather than a single reversal; cumulative weight is the pressure. Visible price: dream-amber physically removed, tree returned to “simple wood,” meaning Mara permanently strips the maze of its witness; ethical cost is hers to bear. Agency is continuous; no coincidence resolves anything. Lacks a second tightening pivot, keeping score in low 8s.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through iterative image: trees as outsourced memory banks whose rings measure human grief in decimal points. Final fountain image reframes maintenance work as ecological therapy—sorrow recycled into irrigation—without declaring a moral. Subtext is carried by silence: no screamed epiphany, only moonlight arithmetic. Avoids thematic echo by never naming “healing” until the last clause, and even then attaches it to moonlight, not sermon. Could edge 9-band if an earlier seed of personal stake in Mara’s own grief had flowered there.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate stays locked to Mara; distance modulates—compressed telegraphic lists in tool paragraph, lyrical dilation during moonlit sextant moment. Diction is maintenance-worker precise (“pruning shears that cut through probability”) yet tinged with private mysticism, avoiding generic fantasy register. No head-hop, no filter-verb clusters. Rhythm breathes with task tempo: short sentences for snip-extractions, longer ones for philosophical drift under storm. Voice specificity is high; slight repetition of “dream”-root nouns softens perfect 9 but keeps strong 8-band.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, scaffold-free; no paraphrase loops, no synonym churn around “tree,” “dream,” “moonlight.” Figurative layers serve concept: “amber resin” marries organic and emotional without mixed-metaphor clash. Information density high—each sentence layers task, world-rule, or image. One micro-loop: “maintenance… maintain” in closing line; too slight to deduct more. Closure image clear, uncluttered. Achieves 9-band cleanliness except for that echo, holding at 8.6.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Concept of arboreal dream-auditing is fresh; “quantified sorrow” marries fantasy to data science without spreadsheet coldness. Broken sextant repurposed as dream-theodolite is specific, non-obvious tech. Familiar “labyrinth at midnight” frame is reanimated via maintenance rather than hero’s quest. Risk—lyric accretive structure—pays off in charge of final fountain dissolution. Transformation test fails: swap any names and the arc still works, preventing 9-band entry, but synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, earning high 8s.</comment>
