<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s grief-forged need to “preserve what love had whispered” drives every micro-choice; the contradiction between her caster-precision and memory-failure is lived in finger-level braiding, not told. The final act of pouring rope into bronze bells crystallizes a credible renunciation—she gifts the voices to the wind, not to herself—paying the cost of perpetual exile from the memories she saves. Interiority remains concrete and tool-bound; only once drifts toward “she understood it was listening,” a quasi-epiphany that nicks the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the bells ring once for her, then stay as wind-borne guardians—cost is the unkeepable sound she walks away from. Causal chain holds: forgiveness → access to sanctum → rope re-braiding → bronze pour → voices externalized. Aurora-ice-rope-bronze pattern is taught by 25 % and re-weights the ending; no orientation debt. Micro-turn at “she could finally work” tightens options cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Ice walls, aurora, and ceremonial rope function as micro-setting that literally guides the casting choreography. The aurora’s “green fire” is not backdrop—it listens, becomes an agent in the final illumination beat. Spatial tracking is immaculate; bronze pour heat vs. ice enclosure creates tactile contradiction that charges the bells’ birth. Meets 9+ gate: environmental constraints shape tactics and final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“preserve forgotten names”—is signaled in paragraph two and escalates through each braid adjustment. One meaningful tightening: the moment rope shimmer requires her to decide whether to embed her own voice forever or release it to wind; she chooses exile, paying the felt price. Agency is continuous; no coincidence resolves. Slight knock because cost is poetic rather than viscerally reiterated at exit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of casting: instead of destroying wax to create vessel, Mira destroys self-access to create public memory—an earned conceptual repricing. No moralizing; final image of wind-rung bells offers ambiguous aftereffect: communion or perpetual loss. Subtext coils around “stay” whispered by lover—word becomes both anchor and letting-go. Resonance is non-literal, haunting, and invites rereading.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Mira’s tool-centric perception; no head-hop. Rhythm waxes lyrical under aurora, then compresses to metallic clang during pour—syntax mirrors temperature shift. Diction remains within an artisan’s lexicon; “snowmelt ardor” is the single risky phrase but is ear-validated by “inexorable” and pays off thematically. Voice avoids poetic committee-speak; every metaphor is grounded in casting or ice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero scaffold loops; no mixed metaphors; sentences carry double duty—e.g., “molten bronze hissed and sang” advances both sound and material state. Paragraph cuts are surgical; removal of any one would collapse causal or emotional linkage. Opening line anchors voice and stakes simultaneously; final line resolves by recharged image (“sound followed her up through the glacier”). Read-aloud ear test passes: rhythm modulates from slow braid to ringing release.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fusing lost-wax metallurgy with mnemonic shamanism is fresh; no genre template duplicates this synthesis. The punched street-organ card scrap repurposed as memory-sieve is specific, non-ornate, and inevitable in hindsight. Risk—lyric accumulative structure under ice—heightens rather than obscures clarity. Transformation test fails if relocated to temperate workshop, proving irreplaceability.</comment>
