<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Martin’s interior contradiction—thirty years of craft now felt “hollow”—is concrete and anchored early. The embodied emotion (scarred hands, pocketed stone) stays specific, and the micro-choice to throw the stone crystallizes his shift from repair to revelation. No second character means relationship/status bullets are N/A; the solo arc suffices at this length. Closure is credible renunciation: he pockets the remaining stones, foreclosing passive contemplation, cost felt in the即时 image of turning “toward town."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the final image of Martin walking back “where the harbor was beginning to show its colors” reweights his earlier hollow routine into charged poise, cost legible in the refusal to linger. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of light/rings/mist accrues meaning until the cadence shift at the pond edge; no causal antagonist needed. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (place, time, who). No meaningful escalation cap triggered; single tightening suffices.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prism atrium functions as micro-setting that constrains the final epiphany: the broken glass panels literalize “finding light in what others dismissed” and their reflected pillars bend the interference patterns Martin reads. Mist, dawn light, and still pond are selectively filtered through glazier’s eye for fracture and transparency. Spatial choreography is clean—stone splash → rings → pillar reflections → edge disappearance. Environment directly charges the closure image; meets 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover meaning in mundane work—is signaled in paragraph 1 (“seeking something he couldn’t name”). Pressure tightens once: the splash/ring revelation reweights his craft from repair to witness, foreclosing passive contemplation. Agency is attention rather than external confrontation; cost is the implicit return to unchanged workload with transformed seeing. No visible resource loss, but conceptual cost (permanent shift in perceptual burden) is felt; sufficient at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: glass panes → frames of lives, interference rings → grammar of attention, pocketed stones → rejected passivity. No explicit thesis; final image of “harbor beginning to show its colors” offers non-literal answer to initial hollowness. Subtext resides in silence: no spoken dialogue, meaning carried by gesture and optics. Epiphany is earned via two stones and watched patterns, not asserted.</comment>

<comment>Third-person close stays locked to Martin’s perceptual signature—light fractured by glass, invisible cracks, weight of windows in lives. Syntax mirrors glazier precision: measured clauses, reflective pauses, sudden short bursts at splash. No dialogue to contaminate voice. Free indirect thought is clean (“This was his work, he realized suddenly”). Diction remains within craftsman lexicon; no filter-verb clusters. Rhythm modulates with dawn lifting, matching emotional crescendo then quiet return.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive: each sentence advances atmosphere or insight (“mist still clung to water like breath on glass” does double sensory work). No loops or scaffold; metaphor vehicles stay internally consistent (glass, light, fracture). Sentence variety high—participial openings used sparingly and correctly. Read-aloud ear test passes: cadence rises with ring expansion, softens with “disappeared.” No artifacts in closure beat; final line is crisp image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh angle: professional glazier as secular priest of attention, using pond optics instead of stained glass. Synthesis of rare noctilucent clouds with common window-pane epiphany feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk taken with quiet, contemplative arc in under 800 words pays off via charged final image. Some trope overlap (stone-in-pond revelation) is offset by trade-specific refraction; transformation test passed—story collapses without glazier optic.</comment>
