<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Celeste’s interiority is concrete—her fingers on brass, the nib scratching, the whispered “clever old ghost”—and her renunciation of silence carries visible cost. The flaw is that the emotional peak is filtered through a self-diagnosing tag (“the question orbited her still”) instead of a fresh bodily cue, docking 0.3. Still, the hierarchy of values is legible: inherited empire vs. moral orbit, with the pen and observatory as instruments of that choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the editorial she writes crystallizes a new stance—“silence was loudest when it pretended to be surrender”—with undeniable conceptual cost. The causal lens holds: because father retracted strategically, therefore Celeste now publishes, and the persistent constraint (family name, observatory isolation) shapes the final image. Cost is legible in the single sentence where dawn light meets clouds below, foreclosing retreat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The observatory’s copper instruments and echoing dome act as micro-setting that literally guides her choices—she weights documents with sextants, hears whispers refract. The rosewood nib is handled three times, its tactile specificity constraining the editorial act at closure. One minor slip: “vaulted chamber” is slightly generic; still, the place is lived-in and stakes-scale matched.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Pressure tightens once: the journalist’s call reopens the father’s orbit of regret, forcing Celeste to decide publish/retract. The cost is visible—she forfeits her above-the-clouds detachment when she points the telescope downward. Escalation is causal under that lens, though the tightening is single rather than deepening; enough for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: silence-as-orbit vs. intervention-as-escape. The final image of dawn glowing on clouds reweights the earlier “above the clouds” insulation into a cost she now owns. No moral is declared; the reader is left to feel the spiral ascending, not circular and endless.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is character-specific: astronomical diction (“proper ellipse,” “stellar coordinates”) married to newspaper argot (“circulation numbers”). Rhythm modulates—long sentences for reflection, staccato scratch of nib for action. No head-hopping; POV modesty intact (“she sometimes forgot” not “she must have forgotten”).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High information density: “starlight bounced off copper instruments, creating whispers that multiplied into conversations with themselves” does three jobs in one line. No loops or scaffold; metaphor vehicles stay coherent (telescope as creature waking). One near-mixed metaphor—“orbit of regret”—but accepted as character diction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The strategic-retraction twist feels inevitable in hindsight yet non-obvious: the retraction as dare flips a trope into fresh moral calculus. Risk is taken—proof-by-contradiction as narrative engine—without gimmickry. Specific detail (shell-company surveys as orbital paths) anchors the premise so it could not swap names and survive.</comment>
