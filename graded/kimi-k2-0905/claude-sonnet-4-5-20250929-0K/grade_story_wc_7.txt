<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Mara’s grief-for-joie-de-vivre is sketched but not embodied; we see no sensory contradiction or micro-choice that hurts during the planting or the first bite. “Hollow” is named, not tasted; the decisive turn to share fruit is inferred rather than dramatized with visible risk—no moment where she might refuse and lose something. Closure earns mild poise yet lacks a felt cost exacted from her own body/relationships. Competent interiority, but the emotional crucible never tightens enough for high-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Linear causal chain—seed, sprout, share—holds; closure is a Conceptual Repricing (“different future was quietly taking root”) whose social cost is legible. Orientation clear by mid-page. The single-scene default met; no meaningful reversal or resource lost on-page, so escalation stays modest. Consequence is societal, not personal; that lessens the immediacy of cost but satisfies short-form scale.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rusted greenhouse, corroded glass, soil flakes give tactile anchor and mirror societal decay. Stewardship details—pruning for beauty not yield—show occupation-to-stance link. Celestial triangle remains visual only, never limits action; weather absent, distance inside greenhouse fuzzy. Setting constrains choices lightly, charges final sunrise image adequately for mid-band excellence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Central conflict—memory-sharing legality vs. communal truth—announced early, but on-page pressure stays diffuse: no authority figure or ticking clock forces Mara to adapt tactics. One soft tightening: authorities “eventually” notice, but it happens off-page and does not foreclose any shown option. Cost transferred to anonymous growers rather than protagonist. Stakes resonate thematically yet lack a visible price paid by Mara in scene.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: system commodifies nostalgia, true memory is insurgent. “Taste each other’s truths” could drift into slogan, but is localized in purple fruit and quiet seed-sharing. Final image of sunrise on rust re-weights premise without moralizing. Ambiguity held: reader cannot decide if network is utopian or doomed—complexity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lyric, slightly elevated third-person channels Mara’s yearning without losing clarity. Perceptual signature present (“taste fear in factory-farmed vegetables”). No dialogue to test voice distinction; narration stable. Infrequent filter verbs; rhythm breathes with paragraph variety. High-band borderline: no slippage, but no knockout sonic or syntactic risk to push above 8.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose fluid, mostly free of scaffold; “silver line across the sky,” “warm with stored starlight” verge on postcard but remain readable. Some conceptual overlap: “gentle rebellion” / “quietly taking root” echo without fresh inflection. No mixed metaphors or loops in peak beats. Clean copy, good information density, minor reliance on lyrical generics keep it mid-7s.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Mnemonic fruit seeded in dystopia is familiar, yet the graft onto haute-cuisine palate gifts a fresh angle. Pruning as revolutionary act is elegant, specific, underused. Execution stays safe—no formal risk or linguistic inversion—so ingenuity plateaus. Sufficiently particularized to avoid derivative-premise penalty, but not boldly transformative.</comment>
