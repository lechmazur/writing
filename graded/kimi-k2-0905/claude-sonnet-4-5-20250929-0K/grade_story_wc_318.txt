<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Martin’s grief is embodied (leaf-blower baton, lullaby humming), but the interior contradiction is thin; he never questions or fights his own ritual, so growth is only additive. Sarah arrives as echo-helper rather than crucible, so the marital relationship alters only by declaration. The final “mournfully eager” stance is the same as the first; cost is atmospheric, not character-forced.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each gust thickens the acoustic grief-texture until the joined song reweights silence. Closure is a Charged Poise—no option is foreclosed, but the tunnel’s echo reframes their household quiet with felt cost (“laughter remembers its way home”). The hourglass line is a late abstraction that conceptually reprices time, yet causality between leaf-blower gas exhaustion and emotional permission is thin; the engine dies, therefore they sing floats too conveniently.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The tunnel is the star: doubled sound, suspended dust galaxies, spatial choreography exact (“angled the nozzle toward corners”). It functions as micro-setting that constrains every acoustic choice. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—Martin notices vibration, dust motes, echo-delay, filtered through grief attention. The final image charges the setting: laughter now ricochets where absence did; without the tunnel the reweighting collapses.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore household sound—is signaled early. Pressure escalates texturally: each gust layers memory-noise onto silence, tightening the felt cost of quiet. No reversal or trade-off is forced; the leaf blower runs out of gas but presents no dilemma, only opportunity. The cost is atmospheric, not tactical—options are never narrowed, only emotions reweighted.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: grief can be tuned, not banished, using the humblest instruments. The mockingbird lullaby migrates from infant memory to broken duet, reweighting “mocking” as echo rather than substitution. No moral is stated; the final line offers quiet conceptual repricing. Subtext in gesture—Sarah’s hand still on the cord—carries more than any dialogue could.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person intimate stays close to Martin’s perceptual filter: sound-doubling, dust galaxies, engine wheeze. Diction is grief-numb, avoiding decorative flourish; syntax lengthens during conducting, contracts when motor dies. Dialogue minimal, natural, subtext-heavy (“Show me”). No head-hopping; Sarah’s interior is implied only through audible breath and laughter. Voice modulates with acoustic pressure, not emotional declaration.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm breathes with blower surges; sentence variety controls tempo. High density: one sentence often carries sensory, emotional, and metaphorical work. A few decorative stacks (“macerated a spider web, ancient and abandoned”) flirt with overdensity but align with grief magnification. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; metaphor stays acoustically consistent. Final paragraph abstracts into thesis-tinged territory but earns it through prior concrete sound imagery.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Leaf-blower grief orchestra is fresh; no trope template matches this exact acoustic ritual. The tunnel as echo-chamber crucible repurposes a mundane basement into instrument. Risk is taken: engine noise becomes bass line, off-key lullaby becomes reconciliation. Transformation test passes—swap any prop or setting and the entire acoustic logic collapses. Could edge higher if the cost to Martin were more than atmospheric, but ingenuity within tight word count is evident.</comment>
