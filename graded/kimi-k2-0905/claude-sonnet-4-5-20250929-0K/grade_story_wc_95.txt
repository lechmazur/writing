<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Adelaine’s mechanical-arm calculations and “diplomatically fierce” tone are vividly particular; the shift from duel to joint decoding is earned by her visible ingenuity and Harwick’s gradual curiosity. Interior contradiction is light—she never doubts her method—so the arc is more partnership than personal wrench. The cost is social: she concedes future combat in exchange for intellectual alliance, a credible trade.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Causal lens holds: Bellini puzzle → Adelaine stalls duel → joint solution reframes violence into collaboration. Closure is a Charged Poise: the handshake and scheduled next week crystallize a new, cost-laden ritual. The sundial angle-to-music reveal lands with precise timing and felt price—Harwick sheaths sword, Adelaine accepts ongoing intellectual combat. No teleporting props or causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Glass atrium, brook murmur, and brass gears are filtered through Adelaine’s instrument-biased perception; light angles double as musical notation, tying setting to stakes. The Danish needle card acts as micro-setting—its harmonic grid literally scores the overture—constraining the final discovery. Spatial choreography is clean; bodies orbit the sundial without drift. Environment guides choice: light beams dictate when they can read each angle.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: will violence yield to knowledge? Pressure escalates when Adelaine’s decoding delays the duel, then tightens as collaborative discovery offers a bloodless victory. Cost is legible: Harwick’s white knuckles relax, Adelaine schedules future intellectual “duels,” trading physical risk for ongoing contest. One meaningful turn suffices; no coincidence resolves the standoff.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme—questions become destinations—emerges through the sundial’s transformation from timekeeper to musical score; no character sermonizes. Final image of “cathedral of questions without answers” reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext in dialogue (“I’ll bring my rapier” / “I’ll bring another puzzle”) shows violence rechanneled, not denied. Ambiguity lingers: next week may still draw blood.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited anchors cleanly in Adelaine’s perceptual signature—brass whirs, crystalline panels, harmonic ratios. Harwick’s dialogue carries distinct aristocratic impatience versus her measured academic cadence. No head-hopping; psychic distance contracts under decoding intensity. Mechanical arm’s clicks become rhythmic prose device, integrating voice with machine body.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary length and opening; high-density lines (“glass atrium caught the afternoon light in fractured beams”) advance image and theme simultaneously. No filter-verb stacks or paraphrase loops. Metaphors stay coherent—geometric shadows, brook’s eternal question—without purple overload. Final paragraph’s “cathedral of questions” offers crisp, earned lyric lift.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Combines steampunk duel, musical cryptography, and Kantian feud into fresh synthesis; sundial-as-score feels inevitable once revealed. Risk—stalling a sword fight for geometry—pays off by reframing combat into collaboration. Specificity of Danish needle card and harmonic theory anchors novelty in tactile detail. Transformation test fails if relocated to generic modern campus, confirming freshness.</comment>
