<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Maren’s calm-warrior interiority is concrete—her stillness is weaponized, not asserted. The apprentice’s frozen terror is shown through the suspended scream and rigid clutch, not labeled. Maren’s final refusal to explain what she saw crystallizes her guardedness with cost: she walks away alone, blade sheathed in serenity. Only micro-gap: the apprentice’s sudden articulate confession (“I wanted to grow something…”) edges toward explanatory speech rather than embodied memory under shock.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: Maren’s laconic last line reweights the whole search—truth is not missing, people are. Causal lattice holds: expanding-circle method taught early, seeds foreshadow forbidden motive, mirror-gaze triggers paralysis, war-song cracks it. Orientation anchored by line 4 (who, where, when). One hairline slip: “three days ago” is offstage exposition, but it motivates the search and never breaks the lens.</comment>

<comment>The orchard-vortex is not backdrop—it tightens the rescue: spiral roots limit footing, blossom shrapnel slices skin, black water drinks sound. Micro-setting of the clenched pouch (seeds + mirror shard) literally holds the moral crime and charges the final image as it sinks. Sensory triage under crisis: wind taste of rot, blossom blur, scream swallowed by water—each filters through Maren’s soldier-druid attention. Only minus: spatial exactitude of the two mirror-pools could be one sentence sharper.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—retrieve the apprentice—signaled in para 2. Escalation is situational pressure: spiral tightens, song hammers the frozen moment, scream finally tears loose, dropping body toward water cost is felt. Agency is Maren’s decision to switch from comfort-song to war-song; that pivot reweights stakes from rescue to confrontation with self-lie. Price paid: apprentice’s humiliation and Maren’s solitary exit—both foreclose future ease.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme—people freeze themselves inside their own false reflection—emerges through image-chain: mirror shard, suspended scream, seeds that eat illusions. No explicit thesis until the final line, which conceptually re-prices every prior search Maren has made. Subtext in the apprentice’s clutch: he keeps the pouch even while paralyzed—guilt literally in hand. Ambiguity is preserved: we never learn what Maren saw, only that she refuses to carry anyone else’s lie.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Maren’s soldier-druid perception: “wind screaming through skeletal branches” is heard as enemy, not spectacle. Syntax lengthens then chops to mimic spiral tightening; diction stays iron-in-moss plain, never drifts to mage-cant. No filter-verb stacks; immediacy in “she planted her staff and began to sing.” Final sentence’s blade metaphor sheathes the voice in its own metallic cadence—rhythmic closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often does two jobs (“apple trees grew in impossible spirals…drinking black water”). No synonym loops; “spiral” recurs only when physical geometry tightens. Metaphors stay coherent—warlike serenity is blade/sheath, not mixed weapon sets. One micro-scaffold: “frozen confession, caught between speaking and silence” slightly paraphrases itself; too minor to dull cadence or closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Familiar rescue-quest is inverted: druid is retrieval specialist who refuses to retrieve souls, only bodies. Mirror-eating seeds give fresh body-horror twist to self-reflection trope. Warlike serenity as operational mood is non-stock for magic-wielders. Conceptual repricing at end makes the fresh angle inevitable in hindsight: the lost thing was never the boy, it was his willingness to face his own distortion.</comment>
