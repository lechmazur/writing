<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The poet’s 300-year insomnia and her vow to “photosynthesize pain into beauty” are vivid, embodied motives; every beat of the poem-writing ritual is a micro-choice that costs her sleep and sanity. The final smile-and-begin-again is a credible renunciation that forecloses any ordinary human future, paying the visible price of perpetual solitude. Interior contradiction is present—wanting peace yet feeding on war’s grief—but stays slightly abstract; a single moment of bodily collapse or tremor would have pushed it to 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each layer of nacre-like poems tightens the stake of “can longing itself be enough?” Closure is a Charged Poise—dawn light reframes the shell into a cathedral of ongoing labor, cost felt in the phrase “she began again.” Orientation is clear by word 60; no lens ambiguity. The cost is conceptual yet undeniable: centuries foregone, the poem’s spiral now her only biography.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The shell is not backdrop but breathing constraint: its spiral dictates where she walks, where verses are wedged, how sound escapes at dawn. The galaxy postcard functions as micro-setting—held, tilted, re-tilted—its star-origin re-prices her earthly insomnia. Reef-shadow light is a tactile filter that shapes what she can see and therefore write. Environment, tool, and body converge in the final image: shell-mouth, postcard-galaxy, poet’s hand—impossible to swap without collapsing the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will transmuting grief into art suffice for a life?”—tightens through accretion: each new war, each new poem narrows the possibility she will ever exit the shell. No single external reversal, but the incremental density of centuries reaches a qualitative shift at dawn: the poem-read-aloud becomes an act that can no longer be followed by sleep. Cost is legible in the final line: “she began again” = perpetual forfeiture of closure for others and herself.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without thesis: art as oxygen-maker from human CO₂ of war. The cherry-blossom armistice image is the Conceptual Repricing—beauty not ending war but ending the poet’s need for war to end. No moral is declared; instead the postcard galaxy re-weights longing itself as cosmically-enduring, making personal insomnia bearable. Emotional after-effect is concrete: reader exhales, having been supplied the oxygen of that poem.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Lyrical third-person hovers at poet’s shoulder, diction salted with marine biology and astronomical lexicon—“nacre,” “polyps,” “spiral arms”—consistent with her lifelong solitude inside a shell. Syntax elongates then compresses to mimic tidal inhale/exhale, climaxing in the staccato of “she began again.” No filter verbs; perception is direct: “wind sang badly” not “she heard the wind.” Compression taught early (“reef-shadow joy”) and paid off in final paragraph without ever breaking legibility.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</question>
<comment>Zero loops, zero scaffold; every sentence advances image or pressure. Mixed-metaphor risk (calcium/time → photosynthesis → galaxy) is justified by the poet’s own metaphoric logic, never violating physical laws. Read-aloud rhythm is deliberate: clause-layering mimics nacre accretion, then final paragraph shortens like exhaled breath. Information density high—“diesel fumes, someone’s cooking, the electronic chirp of crossing signals” telescopes an entire city into one line.</comment>

<question>8</question><question>8.8</question>
<comment>Insomniac poet inside a grown-shell that became both cave and cathedral is a premise that feels simultaneously ancient and freshly observed. The blossom armistice concept re-visions peace not as treaty but as arboreal decree—specific, whimsical, yet emotionally serious. Spiral structure mirrors spiral galaxy, mirrors shell, mirrors poem—an organic pattern rather than checklist motif. Risk lies in lyric stillness over plot; the gamble pays off because the final image re-weights all prior stasis into earned poise.</question>
