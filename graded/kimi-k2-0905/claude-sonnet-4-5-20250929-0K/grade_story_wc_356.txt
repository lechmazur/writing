<comment>Mira’s interior contradiction—ambitious healer vs. scent-battered sensitivity—is dramatized in the planting scene where fingers work gently while nose revolts, embodying cost. The final stance of open-window endurance is earned: journals and pollen passed to neighbors grow directly from her seven-year scent apprenticeship. No second character on page, so status and relationship bullets skipped. Micro-choices (tying sachets, opening windows) map value hierarchy cleanly; still, the epiphany edges toward labeled summary (“wisdom asks us to endure”) rather than fully embodied contradiction, capping at 7.2.

<comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: each sensory assault and journal entry thickens the texture until the scent itself reweights Mira’s ambition. Closure—“Wisdom asks us to endure… grace”—is a Resonant Reconfiguration that conceptually reprices discomfort as the path to serenity; cost is felt in the lingering stench villagers still brave. The turn lands at ~720 words, within scope; one soft transition (seed → years-later bloom) is legible. No orientation debt; anchors (treetop workshop, lamplight, names) appear by line 60. The closing maxim is slightly exposed, preventing 9-band, but the repricing is on-page and coherent under the accrued texture.

<comment>Treetop workshop and suspended pot function as micro-setting: sway-with-the-trees constraint shapes the pot design and later the pollen harvest. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—nose filters every detail, charcoal/aged bark choices reveal herbal expertise, not generic garden lore. Weather is implicit (windows open in winter) but affects action. Spatial choreography clean; no impossible body shifts. The corpse-flower’s architectural bloom recharges the earlier “dark oval” image, qualifying as recurring object that charges closure. While broader village geography remains sketch, the body-in-tree and tool constraints do tangible work, satisfying 9+ gate.

<comment>Dominant stake—create serenity without stillness for sway-battered villagers—is signaled early and tightened when the scent forces Mira to live her own medicine. Agency is accumulative: every journaling beat and scent assault narrows her options until she chooses open-window endurance, paying the cost of perpetual discomfort. No coincidence; pressure grows from the plant she summoned. The tightening forecloses the option of odor-free sanctuary, visible in her mask-to-windows trajectory. Cost is legible but shared communally rather than personally acute at the end, keeping it short of 8.8+ threshold.

<comment>Theme emerges through pattern: scent as teacher contradicts the healer’s control fantasy, culminating in the insight that grace is motion-with-stench, not escape. The doodled wrapping paper reprise at closure crystallizes generational transmission without overt statement. Final maxim is the only echo of thematic-label speak, lightly penalized, yet it is framed inside the pollen-sharing ceremony so the assertion is partially earned. Subtext in gesture (windows thrown wide) carries more weight than the spoken line, keeping the score high. Complexity acknowledged: no promise the village will stay serene, only that Mira has reconfigured her own stance.

<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly tethered to Mira’s perceptual filters—every smell is a decision point. Diction is botanical but not showy (“whisper of rot,” “wildflower hush”) and remains within healer lexicon. Rhythm lengthens during planting, compresses during bloom-day chaos, mirroring emotional tempo. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets skipped. Free indirect style is clean; no filter-verb clog. Voice distinctiveness resides in scent-metaphor density—almost every sentence carries an olfactory image—preventing generic texture while staying purposeful.

<comment>Prose is dense and lyrical yet propulsive; sentences layer scent, memory, and action simultaneously (“faint at first, then increasingly present” does double duty). No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; each image advances knowledge or pressure. Metaphors stay coherent within arboreal olfactory logic. A single mixed metaphor (“wildflower hush” beside architectural corpse bloom) is noticeable but purposeful tension between delicacy and grotesque. Opening and closing lines are sharp, the latter recharging “tide of thought” phrase. Minor scaffold in “weeks that followed” transit phrase is efficient compression, not artifact. Closure beat untouched by clutter.

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Fusion of corpse-flower stench as meditation teacher is fresh; trope of “plant that changes you” is subverted by making the odor the cure, not the pollen alone. Treetop apothecary village is sketched minimally but through functional details (suspended pot, canopy bridges) rather than exotic garnish. Grandmother’s doodles act as inherited lived-in magic, not sentimental prop. The insight that serenity demands embracing discomfort is earned via specific sensory ordeal, not abstract slogan. Risk taken in foregrounding revolting smell for 700+ words pays off narratively and thematically. Could edge higher if village culture beyond Mira were individuated.
