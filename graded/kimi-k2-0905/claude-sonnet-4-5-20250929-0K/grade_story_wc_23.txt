<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—grief’s pull vs. the need to map a way out—remains concrete in every micro-choice (tracing stitched coastlines, wiring cores, lifting the bronze). The final renunciation (“I navigate what remains”) is earned by the iterative building beats and carries visible cost: she stays alone under a broken dome while the world walks inward. Voice never slips into diagnostic abstraction; emotion stays lodged in calloused fingers and the jacket’s atlas. Only the brother/mother flashbacks feel slightly shorthand, keeping her from the top band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the compass reveals migration is a temporal gravity well, reweighting every prior beat. Causality holds—each midnight call escalates the build, the bronze’s shifting patina motivates the design change, and the finished device crystallizes her refusal. Orientation is clean within 60 words; no prop or knowledge teleporting. Cost is unmistakable: she accepts perpetual exile while the antenna stays dead—an Earned Stasis that forecloses reunion.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The dead starlit station, broken dome, and valley-scattered satellite debris constrain scavenging choices and supply the gyro/magnet parts. The bronze censer foot doubles as micro-setting: its color-shift under starlight directly steers the compass calibration. Sensory selection stays urgent—starlight on oxidation, jacket patches under fingernails—never tourist catalog. Environment mirrors interior decay yet remains physically coherent; spatial choreography tracks cleanly as she wires cores around the bronze axis.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—find why loved ones left and whether a counter-path exists—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens when the midnight voice reframes the compass goal. The single meaningful turn: realizing the pull is temporal, not spatial, which forecloses any chance of intercepting the migrants in present space. Agency sits entirely with Mara’s iterative building; each salvage beat narrows options and increases material cost. Price is legible: she finishes the device alone, accepting irreversible separation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: memory as gravitational drag vs. navigation as forward motion. The bronze’s corrosion calendar and stitched jacket maps embody the tension without commentary. Final image—device humming while she stays—reweights prior material: loss becomes the engine of future cartography. No moralizing; resonance lingers in the unresolved tension between pull and plotted escape vector.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Mara’s perceptual filter: “calloused fingers,” “jacket a patchwork of navigation charts.” Syntax lengthens during reflective beats, shortens during soldering action, mirroring cognitive load. Midnight caller’s diction carries smoke texture without stealing focalization. No head-hopping; psychic distance shifts are intentional and tied to emotional crests.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is rhythmically alive: “the great antenna locked into place, pointing uselessly toward a constellation that no longer mattered” varies cadence and stakes in one breath. No synonym loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or causality. Figurative language stays accurate—oxidation as calendar, jacket as atlas—without mixed-metaphor clutter. One minor filter verb cluster (“she felt it in her sternum”) keeps it from 9+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Reverse migration as temporal gravity well is a fresh synthesis of collective nostalgia and hard-SF conceit. The bronze censer foot repurposed as compass heart fuses sacred relic with scientific instrument, an image not seen elsewhere. Risk-taking—dead tech, off-stage mass exodus, lyric midnight calls—pays off by making the cosmic intimate. Specificity of jacket-chart patches and corrosion calendar renders the premise un-swappable.</comment>
