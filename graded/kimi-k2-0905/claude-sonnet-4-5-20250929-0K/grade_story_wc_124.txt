<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maren’s interiority is concrete—her tactile reach for the vial, the tremor before the light bloom—showing embodied emotion rather than labels. Contradictory impulses (hope vs. dread about re-smelling) coexist in the same beat, and the final re-corking is a micro-choice that forecloses denial with visible cost. The wife remains off-page, so relationship-as-crucible is quiet, yet the vial becomes the proxy crucible, charged by the ultraviolet scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each sensory deprivation layer (empty greenhouse, silent vial, colorless air) accretes until the ultraviolet reveal reweights loss into visible love. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“The greenhouse smelled of nothing…”) and the single transition into the lab is legible. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Maren re-corks a now-“filled” vial, accepting a new spectrum of grief; the conceptual cost is the permanent substitution of light for scent, legible in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The greenhouse’s glass cases, the vial on its chain, and the ultraviolet device each function as micro-settings that constrain choice: Maren can neither open a case nor sniff the vial until the machine offers a third path. Selective sensory compression—visual spectrum standing in for olfactory—mirrors the world rule and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean: the walk from aisle to centerpiece to lab, bodies never teleport. No caps triggered; the vial-as-setting satisfies the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—can Maren recover a dimension of grief the plague erased—tightens when the ultraviolet reveal offers a one-time glimpse, forcing a stance crystallization. The deepening is textural: each extinct plant and color ribbon increases the density of irretrievability until the final fade makes the cost legible. Agency is renunciation: she corks the light-scent, knowingly choosing memory over continued access. Cost is the irrevocable substitution of visible for smelled love, felt as the colors wink out.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: the human need to mourn via sensory proxy, and the bittersweet trade of one spectrum for another. Subtext lives in gesture—hand to vial, cork back to heart—showing acceptance rather than declaring it. The midnight orchid’s silence and the color bloom refrain in echo, reweighted at closure when the orchid remains scent-deaf while Maren’s heart is “filled” with light. No moralizing; the final line lets “carry loss in a new spectrum” resonate as Conceptual Repricing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person close stays strictly within Maren’s perceptual filter; no head-hop. Diction—“lantern broker,” “crystal shadows,” “amber fractals”—is idiosyncratic to her light-trade vocation and persists under emotional pressure. Syntax tightens from languid garden sentences to short, almost breathless clauses during the color bloom, mirroring awe. Dialogue is minimal, indirect, and goal-driven: Kovač’s three lines exist only to place the vial under the lamp.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is varied; paragraph lengths visually swell then contract with the color spiral. Information density is high—“crystal perfume vial hung from a silver chain around her neck” does triple duty: prop, marriage relic, future light-film screen. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new sensory angle or emotional nuance. Metaphors stay coherent (light as scent) and do not violate the world’s physics; no artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The scent-to-light transmutation feels inevitable yet fresh, growing from Maren’s lantern-trade expertise rather than arbitrary tech. The extinct-plant greenhouse and ultraviolet reveal synthesize climate grief with intimate bereavement, avoiding gimmickry. Specificity—“midnight orchid in preservation solution”—anchors universals; removing any core element breaks the logic. Risk in concept is high, but execution keeps emotional clarity, earning the +0.3 within-band bump.</comment>
