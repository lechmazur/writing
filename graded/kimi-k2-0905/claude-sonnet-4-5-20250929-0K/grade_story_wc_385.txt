<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is concrete and particular—her breath catching at the shell-voice, her eyes stinging as she traces the petroglyphs—yet the epiphany “I could never echo because I never let anyone truly hear me” drifts toward diagnostic label-speak, slightly blunting embodied cost. The renunciation of solitude is earned, but the final pivot to communal teaching is asserted more than dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the rule-set “echoes require a listener” reweights the nexus’s memory-logic, and the cost is felt when Mara’s hoarse voice forecloses lifelong solitude. Lens holds Accumulative: each spiral disclosure thickens stakes until the starlit chamber crystallizes a new social contract. No orientation debt; geography and causality remain clean.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The seashell half charges every beat—warming, cooling, guiding descent—and the petroglyph wall literally scripts the final teaching mission, satisfying the 9+ gate. Canyon acoustics constrain tactics: sound’s refusal to die forces Mara to become the listener her sister lacked, binding setting to closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Pressure tightens through Accumulative lens: each shell disclosure layers guilt and responsibility, narrowing Mara's options from private grief to public song. The cost—raw throat, vowed return—grounds the shift; no reversal but a deepening that makes silence unaffordable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Theme emerges without sermon: heard vs. unheard reframes mortality itself. The sister’s recorded thesis is borderline thematic echo, but it is embedded inside an object-event, not tacked on, and the final communal song complicates solitude without moral absolutes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</question>
<comment>Third-person hovers close to Mara's sensorium, syntax flexing with canyon wind—“reed-blown melancholy,” “shadows pooled like spilled ink”—without purple overload. Perceptual signature stays consistent: sound is tactile, starlight a filter, shell a spiral ear. No dialogue, so voice purity remains intact.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</question>
<comment>Strong density—every sentence layers mythic and sensory data—yet two adjacent “she sang/she would return” stems flirt with template cadence. Mixed metaphors are avoided; only once do “webs of intrigue” risk abstraction, quickly anchored by shell-whisper.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</question>
<comment>Acoustic afterlife as social credit is fresh; the half-shell twin mystery seeds future story without cheap twist. The nexus’s memory-economy feels inevitable yet un-mined in prior fiction, and the lyric reprise of sisterly absence avoids sentimentality.</comment>
