<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kess’s barefoot vulnerability and opera-glass gaze give her a sharp perceptual signature; the internal contradiction between rebellious past and philosophical stillness is present but remains more asserted than embodied. The final renunciation inside the stone circle is credible because the hum is felt in her bones, yet the epiphany is slightly over-articulated (“they’d forgotten how to see”). No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A. Overall: strong, but the interior monologue flirts with diagnostic label-speak in the climax.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Conceptual Repricing: the stone circle rewrites the rebellion’s premise, cost is the surrender of old tactics, felt in the subsonic hum. Causal chain: because the rebellion lulled → Kess searches → finds circle → circle re-educates her stance. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) arrives by line 3, no penalty. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of decay→circle→reframe. One minor loop: “the way silence could roar… the way stillness could shake you” is near-paraphrase; does not touch closure, so −0.2 routed to Q7 only.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Spaceport repair bay is tactile: cold metal grating, rusted scaffolding, glass shards under bare skin; every detail is filtered through Kess’s philosophical slant. Micro-setting (bare feet, opera glasses) constrains movement and becomes the lens for final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions. The ancient stone circle is given tactile weight (dark stone, subsonic hum) and directly shapes the final choice. No world-level accuracy demands here; specificity earns high band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: find meaning after rebellion’s lull. Tightening occurs when the hum forces a binary—old rebellion vs. new sight—with the cost of abandoning prior tactics. Agency is attention/renunciation rather than external fight, fitting accumulative lens. Price is legible: she forfeits the comfort of righteous anger and steps barefoot into unknown frequency. Could wish for one earlier micro-choice that shows tactical alteration under hum; still, escalation coheres.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: failed revolutions recycle oppressor logic; true resistance requires perceptual revolution. Subtext is carried by the opera glasses—tool for “seeing differently”—and the hum that predates human empires. Final image reweights prior debris into pattern without moralizing. No tidy thesis statement; the sentence on the stones is allowed because it is archaic command, not authorial summary. Emotional aftereffect lingers as uneasy humility.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person lyrical, perceptual signature sharp: “toes curled against cold metal grating,” “vintage opera glasses pressed to her eyes.” Rhythm modulates: longer reflective sentences slow to match dusk, then tighten at hum’s climax. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets N/A. Free indirect style stays clean; no filter-verb clusters. Diction stays within Kess’s reach; no corporate register drift. Voice feels singular and sustained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong information density: one sentence often does setting + metaphor + interiority. One paraphrase loop noted above; otherwise no synonym churn or template cadence. Metaphors are precise: “thunderous serenity” is oxymoron that pays off in hum. No mixed metaphors at closure. Opening line anchors voice; final line crystallizes image. Proofing clean. Minor −0.2 for loop leaves room for 8.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fusion of stone-circle mysticism with derelict spaceport feels fresh; trope inversion: rebellion fails not from force but from perceptual poverty. Opera glasses as activist’s inherited talisman is specific and memorable. Synthesis of ancient future is not gimmick—it reconfigures the stakes. Risk taken with quiet, non-confrontational climax; cost is conceptual rather than physical, but coherence holds. No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
