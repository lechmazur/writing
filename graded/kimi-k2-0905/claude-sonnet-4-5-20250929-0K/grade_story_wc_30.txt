<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Maris’s interior contradiction—clinging to routine while engineering surprise—drives every micro-choice; the molten-fish gesture crystallizes her value hierarchy with felt cost as she pays forward the wonder she can no longer personally feel. The visiting woman’s arc is slighter but still earns its micro-turn: from disorientation to re-appropriated “tomorrow” speech. Voice convergence between the two is minor and late; internal textures remain distinct under pressure. One diagnostic beat of therapeutic self-label (“wonder needs only the unknown”) is quickly embodied in the returning-scroll gesture, so the slip is capped at −0.3.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the mobile of identity-fish reframes “who we are becoming” as an eternal present-school whose pattern, not future, supplies wonder. Accumulative lens holds: each reveal (shelves, scroll, fish) deepens thematic density rather than causally reversing stakes; the final moonlit school image reweights prior material with undeniable social cost—identity is now an aesthetic migration, not a telic journey. Orientation is anchored by line 15; no penalty. Persistent constraint (no tomorrow) shapes every tactic; cost is legible in the repurposed licenses reduced to ornamental fish.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The tidal atrium’s water-level catwalks and moon-synchronized gears constrain Maris’s every step and timing; the mobile of fish-in-air re-appears as the charged final image, its light-catch re-pricing identity. Micro-setting (bamboo creel repurposed as scroll-cradle) alters Maris’s gesture economy and ties past occupation to present ritual. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and motion over visual catalog, matching a librarian-fisher’s kinesthetic bias. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no impossible positions across rising/falling floors.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“how to preserve wonder without tomorrow”—is signaled early; pressure tightens when Maris hands the stranger a scroll whose unbuildable lighthouse literalizes the stakes. Agency is accretive: each gear-turn and molten-fish adds density rather than causal reversals, but the final image forces stance crystallization with visible cost (identity metal forever swimming, never arriving). No coincidence resolves tension; the moon’s mechanical pull is accepted fate, not luck. Price is paid in obsolete passports reduced to art; options are conceptually foreclosed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the contradiction between routine and surprise; the mobile’s ever-new constellation of unchanged fish offers a non-literal answer to the question of becoming without future. No character sermonizes; the lighthouse scroll’s unbuilt silhouette carries the thematic weight. Final image reweights prior motifs (creel, gears, moon) without moral tag. Ambiguity is purposeful: routine is both suffocating and salvific. Emotional aftereffect is wistful buoyancy rather than despair—an honest complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person close focalization stays locked to Maris with lyric compression (“serenity of winter sunlight filtering through ice”) that teaches its pattern early and pays off in the final moonlit hush. Diction remains within a former-fisher’s lexicon; no academic register intrudes. Syntax modulates from long tidal sentences to short forge beats, mirroring task rhythm. Dialogue is minimal but carries subtext (“I’ll return it tomorrow” laughed away) without ventriloquizing the narrator. No head-hopping or filter-verb clutter.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings avoid template cadence. Information density is high—single sentences layer gear mechanics, lunar phase, and emotional tint. Figurative language is selective: moon “three-quarters full, waxing toward completion” foreshadows the closure image without overwriting. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; no mixed metaphors. Line-level artifacts do not touch the final mobile image. Opening and closing lines are anchored and resonant, respectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The “no-tomorrow” premise is familiar, but its synthesis with moon-phase mechanical library and identity-smelted fish feels inevitable and freshly specific. Titan-gear + tidal atrium is a risk-taking structural choice that heightens meaning without gimmickry. Transformation test fails: swap gears for clocks or fish for birds and the emotional math collapses—detail is irreplaceably patinated to this world. Risk distinction applies (+0.3) because unconventional apparatus sharpens rather than obscures closure clarity.</comment>
