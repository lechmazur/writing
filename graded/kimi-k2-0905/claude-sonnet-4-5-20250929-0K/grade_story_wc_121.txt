<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Kael’s interiority is vivid—“gravity loosen its claim on her bones” and “cotton candy and regret” are specific, embodied perceptions. The final reintegration carries visible cost: she feels the literal weight of knees and chill, enacting earned stasis. Yet the emotional progression is smoothed by lyric swell; we see no contradictory micro-choice mid-retrace that reveals hierarchy of values under live pressure. Still, the arc of scattering-to-wholeness is dramatized, not summarized, so motivation remains legible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: “She was here, now, whole” crystallizes the dominant lens (Accumulative/Textural) by reweighting self-unity over omnipresence. Persistent constraint—ordinary gravity—returns as felt cost. Orientation is anchored within 120 words: “viaduct… dying sun… ancient mortar.” Causality across mosaic shards is pattern-taught (“retrace” repeated, rune-map revealed) so lens holds. Minor bump: tablet’s instant crumble feels slightly convenient, but dust moment is tied to final image and thus forgiven.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Wet-stone viaduct is not backdrop but tool: its varying states (moss, light veins) mark the iterative retrace mechanic, and the eventual solidity literalizes earned singularity. Sensory selection matches urgency—visual, tactile, never tourist list. Spatial choreography is clear across seventeen iterations; no impossible positions. Object-as-setting test met: the arch’s changing texture constrains Kael’s choices and charges the final grounded stance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reintegrate fractured selves—signals early and tightens when rune-map forces choice of harder paths. Escalation is textural: each retrace adds density until “gravity reasserted its claim.” Cost is visible: loss of omnipresence, return of physical ache. Agency sits in choosing grief not avoided; coincidence never resolves. One meaningful intensification suffices, and it lands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from specific paradox: freedom from gravity reveals deeper self-maze. Labyrinth motif refrains from overt thesis; final image of weighted feet offers non-literal answer. No closing moral—cost is the statement. Ambiguity lingers: is ordinary life the prison or the refuge? Complexity embraced.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: shifting runes, gravity-loosened bones, “procedurally generated realities” idiom. Rhythm modulates—long lyric sentences for suspension, short beats (“The tablet crumbled”) for finality. No head-hopping; single POV holds. Diction stays within Kael’s metaphysical lexicon; no register drift. If this is AI-patterned, the cadence is at least voice-motivated and consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>High information density: “wet stone catching the last defiant rays” does three jobs (setting, time, character defiance). Figurative language is controlled—no mixed metaphors. A few template stems (“She was… she felt…”) appear but not in closure beat. No loops, no synonym churn. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with escalation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Familiar trope—time-fragments reunited—feels fresh via procedural-generation metaphor and gravity as emotional ballast. Retrace mechanic is specific to viaduct iteration, not generic “fix timeline.” Risk taken: lyric mosaic rather than showdown, yet coherence maintained. Final grounded stance inverts typical transcendence arc, supplying non-obvious payoff.</comment>
