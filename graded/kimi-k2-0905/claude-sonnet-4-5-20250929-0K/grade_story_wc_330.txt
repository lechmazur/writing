<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The carpenter’s mute, ritualized devotion is rendered with patient, embodied detail—his stained hands, the wordless hymn, the way brass warmth is felt against his chest. Interior contradiction is light (he craves silence yet sings), but the final act of “translation” is earned by years of solitary craft shown, not told. No secondary character appears, so status/relationship tests are waived; the single POV remains coherent, specific, and unsentimental. The quiet closure—his gleaming hands reaching for the next fragment—makes the cost of endless making visible without exposition.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each salvaged piece adds density until the halo fragment completes the crown and the new music layers onto wind-bell chimes. Causality is soft—discovery by “wrong turn” is coincidence—but the final rotation is irreversible, reconfiguring silence into visible motion. Anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 4 and hold; no orientation debt. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the sculpture spins, foreclosing endless repair yet confirming the carpenter’s vocation; cost is the never-finished labor embodied in his glowing hands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Desert-circus train, spring-fed grove, and cottonwood shade are sketched with swift, camera-like selection; every sensory stroke (light through broken windows, brass catching water-ripple gleam) doubles as emotional filter. Spatial choreography is flawless—fragments, tools, and body move without drift. The micro-setting of the crown itself becomes the final environmental constraint: its spin demands tomorrow’s hanging elements, locking next action. Weather and scale modulate naturally, never catalogued for tourism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—proving broken things can sing—signals early and tightens once: the halo fragment either crowns the sculpture or remains scrap. Escalation is quiet but real: the crown’s first spin audibly layers music onto bells, foreclosing the option of leaving the piece static. Cost is felt (endless future labor, the unreachable finish), yet pressure stays internal and situational rather than antagonistic. Sufficient for length, but lacks external test or resource loss beyond time itself.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of reclamation-as-revelation emerges through concrete acts: sanding splinters, soldering scrap, letting wind become motion. No thesis statements; the final image of gleaming hands reaching for more salvage offers a resonant, non-moral answer to silence’s possibility. Subtext operates in gesture—the unspoken hymn is the real manifesto. Ambiguity is intact: the sculpture may never be seen, the carpenter may never stop.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close stays tightly lashed to the carpenter’s perceptual bias—every noticed gleam or chime is filtered through his tactile creed. Syntax lengthens and shortens with breath of work; no filter-verb clutter. Diction remains within a laborer’s lexicon; “misting hush,” “whispering gleam” are permissible lyric compressions taught early. No dialogue, so voice distinction test is waived; narrative voice itself is individuated and sustained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes—long anacrustic sentences for dawn calm, clipped fragments at solder sparks. Metaphors are spare and coherent (brass “sings,” light “dances”); no mixed vehicles. Information density high: one sentence often layers tool, body, and light. Zero paraphrase loops; no scaffold. Copy is clean; only nit—a stray “its” that could tighten—but closure image stays luminous and uncluttered.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Abandoned-circus-train oasis is familiar seed, yet the sculpture-as-wind-chapel and the halo fragment as compass are fresh inflections. Risk lies in quiet accumulative structure paying off in a non-event spin; the gamble succeeds because cadence and image carry weight. Specificity of salvaged materials (carousel horses, wheel-bearing crown) anchors novelty. Conceptual integrity holds: no retreat to sentimental redemption.</comment>
