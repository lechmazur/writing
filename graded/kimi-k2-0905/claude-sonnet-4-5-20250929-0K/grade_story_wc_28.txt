<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Layla’s interiority is vivid—steel hands cooling after memory-extraction, the choice to read forbidden names aloud—but the “gentle radicalism” is asserted more than dramatized; we are told she “weaponizes empathy” rather than shown a micro-choice that risks new pain. The retrocognitive trap supplies constant pressure, yet the moment she breaks free feels slightly under-cooked: no bodily cost beyond shaking, no external consequence registered in the present plaza. Still, her contradiction—former burner turned archivist—remains legible and emotionally specific, earning a solid high-band foothold.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the naming of the dead rewrites the plaza’s future, a Conceptual Repricing that costs her the safety of anonymity beneath a regime still hunting her. Causality holds—each tessera she places is a because/therefore step toward that final inscription—though the loop’s mechanics (how physically touching a chip unmakes the spell) is hand-waved rather than taught. Orientation is swift: plaza, post-fire, augmented soldier all anchor within the first 100 words. The tiny causality wobble keeps it just south of 9.</comment>

<comment>The ancient plaza is rendered through tactile ruins—cooling steel fingers on sun-warmed shards, fountains turned to rubble—while the “shattered sky” becomes an environmental mirror of cracked memory. Spatial choreography stays clean as Layla kneels, gathers, arranges; bodies emerge from hidden pockets without stage-direction clutter. The blue tessera from the fallen minaret is returned in the final line, recharging the opening image and constraining her choice to stay and face reprisal; this object-as-setting satisfies the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Primary stake—can she end the retrocognitive loop and reclaim the plaza for the erased—is signaled on page 1. Escalation arrives when she deciphers the banned alphabet in the chips, foreclosing the safe option of silence; each spoken name tightens the noose she invites. Cost is visible: regime retaliation now inevitable, her anonymity sacrificed. One minor drag: the loop’s intensity is repeated in similar language three times; the middle iteration could have probed a new physical price to push this into 8.5+ territory.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without sermon: memory as insurgency, naming as refusal to let empire finish its erasure. The mosaic’s re-weighting—from prison to testament—supplies the final resonance image, a quiet answer that needs no moral spelled out. Subtext lives in gesture: Layla’s steel hands cradle rather than crush, a reversal of their design that the reader completes. Only a breath of meta-commentary (“this was her gentle radicalism”) slightly surfaces the theme; it is early enough not to undercut the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person close maintains tight psychic distance, perceptual signature filtered through tactical attention—cracks, pigments, thermal memory in metal. Syntax flexes under pressure: short paratactic clauses when she rips free of vision, longer sinuous lines inside the memory loop, mirroring temporal suction. Diction stays concrete and Near-Eastern (tessera, minaret) without exoticist flourish. One微型 slippage: “warm coldness” is named but not embodied in voice texture; still, rhythm control is confident and artifact-free.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>High information density: a single sentence often slots place, history, sensory cue, and emotional valence (“ancient stones, her augmented fingers tracing chipped patterns of a mosaic stepping stone that had once adorned a minaret”). Metaphors are few but precise—sky “fractured like broken glass” sets tone without overcrowding later beats. Zero paraphrase loops or synonym churn; paragraph cuts all earn their keep. A lone participle opener (“Forcing everyone to kneel…”) is sequential and coherent. Clean enough for 9 territory, held to 8.7 by one mixed image—“sky itself seeming to crack from the heat”—that momentarily anthropomorphizes atmosphere.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Familiar tropes—cyborg soldier with regret, memory-as-prison—are re-forged through the specific artifact of Islamic mosaic tesserae and the ritual of speaking banned names aloud. The retrocognitive curse bound to architectural fragments is fresh, as is the idea that the same tiles used to erase a people can be re-sorted to resurrect them. Risk in structure (lyric loop vs. forward plot) pays off because closure reconfigures meaning rather than delivering a conventional fight-or-flight payoff. Synthesis feels inevitable after the fact, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
