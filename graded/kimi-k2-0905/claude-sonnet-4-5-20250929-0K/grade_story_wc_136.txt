<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mara’s “analytically artistic” mind is shown sketching the cracks, aligning motive with moment; her decision to “dare” feels earned because the notebook and七年 route-mapping history are concrete. Interiority is mostly concrete (“hammering heart” vs headlamp beam), but a few abstractions (“felt like signing a contract in starlight”) approach stock. The closure is a credible endurance/renunciation—she keeps mapping, now including the hidden city—so the path is foreclosed with visible cost. No second character on page, so relationship crucible and status bullets are N/A.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara’s name carved in the fortress wall forces her to redraw her maps, reweighting her prior “rational” cartography; the cost is the irreversible knowledge of her own suppressed truth. Causal chain holds: crack-arrows → conductor’s validation → tunnel → fortress → new map. Orientation is anchored by 120 words (station clock, platform, headlamp). Lens is Causal throughout. No meaningful escalation break; single tightening is sufficient at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The starlit vault of mist, cracked concrete, and brass punch are specific, sensorily balanced, and filter through Mara’s mapper gaze. The “cathedral” ceiling and pulsing constellations mirror her awe while guiding her deeper. Environment literally constrains path: the arrows are the only route to the fortress. Micro-setting (notebook, punch) recurs and charges the final act of mapping.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“map the hidden city or stay safely surface”—is signaled early. Tightening occurs when the conductor punch validates passage and the fortress wall reveals Mara’s own suppressed truth, foreclosing denial. Cost is legible: she must now map truths that will “unmake” her prior lie-built life. Agency is continuous—each step deeper is a choice to keep following arrows.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: cartography of the self is as necessary as cartography of the city. The punch that leaves no physical mark but validates passage becomes a quiet metaphor for psychological admission. Subtext in dialogue (“Maps won’t help you there”) and silence (names pressed into wall) carries weight. Final image of blank pages waiting for new maps offers resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person close stays tightly adhered to Mara’s perceptual filter—angles, trajectories, artistic shorthand. Syntax is rhythmic, with controlled elevation (“infrastructure’s decay,” “calcified into architecture”) that fits her mapper intellect. No head-hopping. Dialogue brief but carries subtext; conductor’s idiom is archaic yet distinct. No register drift under pressure.</comment>

<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence runs. High information density: “validation she couldn’t explain” advances both plot and emotion. A few metaphors verge on decorative (“starlit cathedral”) but none contradict physics or dull closure. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; props track cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Urban-legend cartography fused with suppressed-memory fortress is a fresh synthesis; the phantom punch that validates immaterial passage transforms familiar ghost-trope into psychological ticket. Specificity: crack-arrows as map legend, mist-star ceiling as liminal clock, are not interchangeable. Conceptual integrity: hidden city rules stay consistent. Risky deep-tunnel descent pays off with earned revelation rather than gimmick.</comment>
