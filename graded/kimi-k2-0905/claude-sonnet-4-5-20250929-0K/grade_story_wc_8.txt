<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elena’s “rescue truth” drive is concrete and consistent; her micro-choice to photograph the letter rather than steal it shows embodied stakes. The interiority is mostly character-specific, but “heroes could be flawed and foundations could be both false and necessary” drifts toward thesis-speak. Hawthorne’s guardian role is credibly conflicted, yet his final relief is asserted rather than dramatized. The cost—public exposure of myth—is felt, but Elena’s personal price remains abstract.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the letter’s confession reframes national myth with visible social cost. Causal chain holds: rose petal → deadline → confrontation → transfer → publication plan. Hawthorne’s capitulation is the weak hinge; his shift from absolute guardian to cooperative donor is asserted via civic argument, not forced by a new pressure. Orientation is clean; ivy station anchors by line 6.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ivy-choked station is vivid and selective—green light, bird nests, cracked tiles—filtering through Elena’s goal-driven gaze. The rosebush works as micro-setting/timekeeper, its bare branch mirrored in the stripped myth. No spatial drift; props (satchel, climate case) are handled. The environment never actively constrains a tactical choice, so the 9+ gate is missed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—publish vs. protect the letter—is signaled early and tightens once: Hawthorne’s consent narrows options. Elena’s agency is rhetorical, not physical; the verbal parallel-drawing persuades, but we do not see her risk tangible loss (career, safety). Cost is societal, not personal, keeping pressure cerebral. Escalation is single-step, sufficient for length, but low visceral charge.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: founding myths as necessary compromise versus mature accountability. Subtext lives in Hawthorne’s ivy—“something almost alive”—mirroring the living lie. The final image of “truth finally blooming” risks overt botanical metaphor yet still reweights the rose motif. No moral sermon, but the insight “they weren’t villains, they were people” is safely moderate.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person close stays pinned to Elena with historian’s perceptual signature—dates, pigments, archival logic. Syntax is controlled, rhythmic variation supports beats. Dialogue distinguishes Hawthorne’s curt formality from Elena’s measured academic cadence. No head-hop, no filter-verb clutter; voice compression under pressure is clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, high-density; most sentences carry dual duty (action + atmosphere). Occasional gentle uplift—“spiraling down through dusty sunlight”—but no metaphor pile-ups. One scaffold trace: “noble lie, a beautiful fiction designed to unite” is immediate gloss; could compress. Punctuation and tense clean; no loops or synonym churn. Final line cadence lands cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Freshens familiar “hidden truth” trope by focusing on archivist ethics and civic maturation rather than conspiracy thrills. Ivy-railway station as archive is a pleasing spatial twist. The parallelist argument tactic is intellectually neat yet not deeply personal, muting risk. Specificity of manuscript pigments and 19th-century nation-building lore keeps it from feeling template.</comment>
