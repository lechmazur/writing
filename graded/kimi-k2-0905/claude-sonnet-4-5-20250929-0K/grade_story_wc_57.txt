<comment>Mira’s patient decoding and tactile reverence for the rope make her feel like a lone apostate of a lost religion; the moment she re-nests the fulgurite, we see a credo distilled into gesture. No interior clichés, only salt-stung fingers and the decision to archive rather than exhibit—an earned renunciation that costs her the public recognition she secretly craves. The only minor drag: “infinitely patient” is stated once rather than shown through a final test of waiting, but the body-language throughout is so disciplined that the trait still breathes.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: Mira’s re-sealing of the rope reweights every prior knot into a living filament of continuity, and the cost—she will remain the invisible keeper—is legible in the final white-out image. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each revealed artifact thickens the pattern until the dock itself becomes a loom of memory. No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) settle by line 3. The rope-map could have tightened causality one beat earlier, preventing a bare 0.1 slip.</comment>

<comment>The golden dock radiating warmth against snow is instantly cinematic yet filtered through Mira’s calloused palms; every plank and frayed fiber is judged by its utility to her archive. Fog functions as acoustic insulation, forcing attention inward to the hush that parallels hermetic knowledge. Micro-setting triumph: the rope itself becomes topography—coves of oilcloth, headlands of birch-bark script—guiding her final choice to reseal rather than expose.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—preserve the weavers’ epistemic DNA—surfaces in paragraph four and tightens with each knot: every opened loop risks irreversible loss. The fulgurite’s re-nesting is the single decisive turn that forecloses fame and confirms custodianship; price is the continued solitude implied by the erasing fog. No coincidence, only escalating intimacy with artifactual time. Pressure stays accumulative; a sharper external threat (storm, visitor) could have pushed the score higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as transmission versus display: knowledge survives only when re-wound into working line, not museumified. The rosetta-stone rope quietly argues that craft is a continuum, not a relic. Final image re-prices the stakes—secrecy itself becomes the active, ethical stance. No naked thesis, only the hush after the last knot is retied, leaving reader suspended inside the same ethical loom.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person close stays welded to Mira’s perceptual hierarchy: salt-taste before color, fiber before word. The prose inhales when she inhales—long rhythmic sentences for fog, staccato noun phrases for knots—creating a syntactic analogue to her patience. No head-hop, no filter-verb clutter. Academic diction (“epistemic,” “genetic memory”) is rationed to moments when she would literally think those terms, preserving voice coherence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentence-level propulsion is relentless: every clause either advances tactile discovery or thickens atmospheric pressure. No paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors; even “oceanic hush” is re-earned by fog’s acoustic flattening. Information density peaks when three artifacts are revealed in a single sentence triad, each noun doing double duty as clue and emotional increment. Final line cadence—white silence / rope / knots—creates a drumless heartbeat that seals the lyric architecture.</comment>

<comment>The secret-weaving fishermen encoded as knot-librarians is a fresh cultural invention; fulgurite-as-portent repurposes a fringe geological curiosity into bibliographic DNA. Risk distinction granted (+0.3): the entire plot hinges on decoding cordage, a deliberately low-tech premise that courts boredom yet becomes electric through tactile specifics. Transformation test passed: swap rope for parchment and the story collapses. Specificity of coastal plant leaf pressed into oilcloth makes the world un-stealable.</comment>
