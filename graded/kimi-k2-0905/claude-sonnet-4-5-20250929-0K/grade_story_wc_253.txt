<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Marcus’s compulsive narration is embodied and specific; the micro-choice to abandon it at the end crystallizes a credible shift. Emma’s mask-crack is minimal but motivated by the shared memory of the funeral flowers, so the change carries cost. Interior contradiction is present—he performs compliance while craving authentic grief—but the daughter’s arc is thinner, keeping the score just below the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the final silent carve reweights the premise—grief no longer illegal yet still unspoken—and the cost is the father’s surrender of his protective script. Causality holds: because he narrated survival, therefore he can stop only once the hush is mutually broken. One reflective block (≤20 %) is anchored to present stimuli and tilts the stance. Orientation is clean within 120 words; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The farmhouse-turbine shadow is sketched with spare, selective strokes; the dried bouquet functions as micro-setting that constrains the final choice to speak plainly. Sensory hierarchy reflects Marcus’s performative detachment—sound of brittle stems, visual grayness—keeping detail purposeful. Spatial choreography is coherent across the single room. The turbines do not actively constrain tactics, so the score stays below 8.5.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—recovering the right to feel grief without performance—is signaled early and tightens when the narration must be relinquished to reach Emma. One meaningful deepening: the flowers shift from relic to witness, forcing the father to drop the script. Cost is legible—loss of the shield that kept him safe during the mandate. Escalation is accumulative rather than causal-plot, sufficient for this lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: sanctioned performance vs. unsanctioned mourning. The bouquet’s reprise reweights “lightness” as shared carrying rather than erasure. No moralizing—final image is silent whittling, inviting the reader to complete the meaning. Subtext operates in gesture: the hand-off of flowers replaces any declaration of love.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Marcus; perceptual signature is precise—megawatt counts, theatrical diction—mirroring his coping mechanism. Rhythm modulates: long performative sentences collapse into the whispered “I am watching my daughter feel again.” Dialogue is minimal yet carries subtext; Emma’s two spoken lines fracture the mask without ventriloquizing her interior. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, varied, and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful—“wood curls fell like tiny prayers” compresses grief and craft. One mixed moment: “renewable indifference” edges editorial, but fits Marcus’s ironic stance. No artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The Happiness Mandate aftermath is familiar dystopian turf, yet the survival mechanism—dramatic self-narration—feels fresh and specific to this father. Risk is taken by staging the entire turn around the cessation of voice rather than an external event. Freshness would sharpen if the turbines’ presence altered tactics rather than merely looming; hence not quite 8.5.</comment>
