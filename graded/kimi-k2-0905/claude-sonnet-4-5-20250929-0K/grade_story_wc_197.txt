<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira’s “quiet, ordinary” camouflage is shown through tactile beats—hiding in a telecom vault, exposing ghost-streets with an obsolete camera—so her competence feels earned. The interior contradiction between fear and stubborn persistence is alive in micro-choices (developing photos while a searchlight grazes the shore). No second character on stage limits relationship-as-crucible, but her solitary endurance still incurs visible cost: the hatch clang seals her into darkness and a deeper vanishing. Motivation stays anchored to the refusal-to-forget; the ending’s Earned Stasis is proportionate to story length.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each beat (key → lagoon → puddle-map → vault) tightens her options because/therefore. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 4; no penalty. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the vault hatch shuts, crystallizing permanent disappearance and foreclosing the “boring functionary” path. Cost is unmistakable—“she’d need to vanish more thoroughly”—and the persistent key/concealment constraint shapes every tactic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Auric lagoon is not backdrop; its mineral shimmer is the only reason puddle-maps can exist, so setting literally generates the plot. The forgotten cable vault under the rocks is a micro-setting that constrains final choice—she must hide or be caught. Starlight, tide, and searchlight choreograph spatial tension; no geography drift. Sensory filter is POV-biased toward survival: she notes “golden water” only as a data surface, not scenery.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keep truth visible—signals early and tightens once: the raided safehouse forces her to risk the lagoon shoot. Escalation is causal, not explosive: each photograph developed narrows her future—she can’t resume cover identity unchanged. Visible price paid: loss of safehouse network, imminent deeper vanishing. No coincidence; even the searchlight is logical shoreline patrol.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—collective memory versus engineered amnesia—emerges through concrete recurrence of erased streets and obsolete tech; never stated as thesis. Final image of water lapping “before all the lies” reweights the lagoon from hiding place to pre-lapsarian witness, achieving Conceptual Repricing without moralizing. No motif checklist; the key and puddle-map return because they are tools, not symbols harvested for resonance. Ambiguity lingers: we feel both the smallness of one camera and the enormity of what it can resurrect.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays pinned to Mira’s perceptual bandwidth: she sees “shapes that weren’t quite reflections,” not exposition about physics. Syntax compresses under pressure—“She’d hold the line, not with dramatic gestures but…”—mirroring her deliberate caution. No dialogue, so voice distinction judged solely on internal coherence, which is sustained. Diction stays inside her plausible lexicon: “obsolete film camera,” “cognitive dissonance” feel like words a clandestine archivist would use.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is lean, no scaffold loops; sentences open varied. Figurative language is sparse and accurate (“constellations…testified to lies”). Information density high: one sentence often delivers setting, stakes, and emotional tilt—“The Ministry controlled the present…they couldn’t eliminate every trace.” No mixed metaphors or register drift. Minor filter verbs appear but serve psychic distance; they don’t stall momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Familiar dystopia of rewritten pasts feels fresh because the weapon is a puddle-map at dusk; specificity beats premise. Old phone-booth key as revolutionary tool is a lovely inversion of obsolete tech. Conceptual risk—quiet endurance instead of rooftop rebellion—heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation test passed: swap lagoon for generic alley and the whole causal chain collapses.</comment>
