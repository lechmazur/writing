<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara’s need to reopen her wrist and read her scars is visceral and character-specific; the interiority is concrete, not therapeutic. The contradiction between seeking closure and literally reopening wounds is embodied in on-page micro-choices (pressing the hourglass to her bleeding wrist). The final turn—choosing justice over closure—earns its cost through the table’s memory and the roses’ testimony. Minor gap: we are told, not shown, the moment she decides to act on the revelation about Dr. Venn; causality is otherwise clean.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The causal lens holds: each memory layer (ivy, table, roses) tightens options because Mara can only act after the plants yield their testimony. Closure lands with visible cost—her blood on the hourglass—signaling a decisive shift from seeking closure to pursuing justice. The Orientation Test is waived: delayed anchoring (tower, meteor hush) is taught by line 5 and pays off when the hush enables telepathy. One causal seam: the revelation that Dr. Venn moved the body is delivered via table-memory, not through an on-page choice that forces Mara to confront him; still, the new knowledge forecloses her previous goal and reframes her scars as evidence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The meteor-hush tower is not backdrop; its electromagnetic silence is the enabling condition for plant telepathy and thus every investigative beat. Micro-setting objects—coffee rings, hourglass, scarred wrist—are handled in live beats and constrain choices (coffee rings must be read, hourglass must be blood-marked). Spatial choreography is clean: transitions from cot to table to window track without drift. Final image of blood on frozen sand reweights the impossible object with undeniable cost, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—learn the truth about Sarah—signals early and tightens when plant memories reveal a second presence. Escalation is accumulative: each vegetal witness incrementally deepens knowledge until the table’s memory narrows Mara’s options to justice. Cost is legible: she sacrifices physical healing (reopened wrist) and psychological safety (illusion of accidental death). One missed beat: no on-page confrontation with Dr. Venn, so the external pressure stays intellectual rather than immediate; still, the internal tightening is sufficient for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges concretely: scars and silence speak louder than smooth surfaces. The meteor hush literalizes the cost of being heard. Final image—blood christening frozen time—reweights the central question from “how to forget” to “how to testify.” No moralizing; resonance arises from the hourglass’s impossible stasis colliding with living blood.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Voice is perceptual, synesthetic, and稳定的：“slow thoughts pressing against her mind, patient and green” is idiosyncratic yet legible. Compression (“morphine fog lifted”) teaches the reader to accept lyric elision early; payoff is the frozen-time final line. No head-hopping; interior access stays strictly with Mara. Register remains consistent: scientific diction (electromagnetic frequencies) is filtered through a grief-stricken, drug-residual mind.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Sentence rhythm modulates: long vegetal cadences versus clipped surgical beats (“She’d asked them to open the old wound”). Figurative language is selective: coffee strata as sedimentary layers, scars as text. Zero scaffold loops; no mixed metaphors. High information density: one sentence often layers time, object, and memory (“coffee rings overlapped…each one a record of sleepless nights spent questioning the clematis”). Minor over-pack in the penultimate paragraph—three metaphors in four lines—keeps this from 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Fresh synthesis: vegetal telepathy inside an electromagnetic dead-zone turns familiar grief-investigation into ontological noir. The frozen hourglass is not a gimmick; its contradiction (time stopped for sand alone) mirrors the sister’s impossibly timed corpse. Risk taken—lyric vegetal memory—pays off when roses’ immobility becomes moral frustration. Conceptual integrity holds: every impossible element is seeded early and charged at closure.</comment>
