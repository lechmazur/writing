<comment>Vera’s reticence is credibly preserved until the final act; her decision to write and surrender the sea glass feels earned because we’ve watched her carry others’ confessions without adding her own. The micro-choice to pocket the glass early anchors later symbolism without telegraphing. Marcus’s interior is sketched only through his dying words, yet his bottled-safety motive is vivid and consistent with the lamp failure. No contradictory impulses are dramatized for Vera on-page before the climax, so the internal-conflict bullet is only weakly met.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the act of writing and inserting the glass visibly reconfigures Vera’s identity and perpetuates the chain with tangible cost—she finally exposes her own loneliness. The causal lens holds: lamp failure → urgency → Marcus’s plea → Vera’s decision to write, each step tightening options. Orientation is clean within 120 words. The only hairline slip is the late reveal of “Reticent Skipper” as signature; the story never shows her earlier drafts or hesitation to sign, so the moment feels slightly convenient rather than inevitable.</comment>

<comment>The lantern room, sea glass, and stone cairns all constrain choice: Vera must climb the tower, handle the glass, and interpret the cairns to understand Marcus. Sensory detail is selective—purple Fresnel light, iron stairs, thrum of rotor—filtered through Vera’s professional priorities. Micro-setting (glass in pocket) reweights meaning at closure. Spatial choreography is flawless; no impossible positions.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—keeping the light/chain alive—tightens when the lamp dies, forcing Vera from observer to participant. Single meaningful turn: she chooses to write, paying the cost of her anonymity. Escalation is causal under lens; no coincidence resolves the problem. Cost is visible: she surrenders her private talisman and her privacy.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges without sermon: passing light becomes passing words; broken glass becomes broken solitude. Final image reweights prior motifs—sea glass as bottled safety now shared. Subtext in stacked stones (“thinking of you”) quietly echoes Vera’s final act. No thematic echo violations.</comment>

<question>6</question><<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is maritime, restrained, lyric: “weathered perfection,” “bone against the sky,” “frozen chrysanthemum.” Rhythm accelerates under rotor thrum, slows on spiral stairs. Perceptual signature is Captain Vera’s—she notices fuel lines, cairns, sardine tins. No POV leakage; filter verbs serve cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Density high: “lighthouse stood like a bone,” “frozen chrysanthemum,” each metaphor fresh and apt. No mixed metaphors or loops. Final sentence cadence mirrors beacon pulse. Micro-movements (“clutched,” “squeezed”) carry subtext; no puppet-master narration.</comment>

<question>8</question><<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: anonymous confessional chain + maritime lamp logbook = emotional lighthouse. Sea glass as talismanic object feels inevitable, not gimmick. Risk taken in quiet ending (writing, not rescue) pays off. Could swap names, but glass-and-stone language is specific enough to resist full interchangeability.</comment>
