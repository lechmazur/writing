<comment>Kael’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her chest “ache[s] with luminescent longing,” her tears stream when she reveals the sculpture—while her contradictory impulses (yearning to join yet fearing erasure) stay active in-scene. The micro-choice to etch the first tag is on-page and character-specific, and her final decision to stand inside the arbor is earned by the prior weaving of names. Minor safety-hedging: the community’s instant embrace feels friction-free, slightly softening the cost.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the twin arbors breathe light while Kael sings back—an undeniable image of inclusion with felt emotional cost. Causal chain holds: each tag is a because/therefore step that pulls her closer until the sculpture forces the final stance. The single transition (orchard→marsh→crater edge) is legible; no orientation debt. One hairline slip: the communal lift-and-install is compressed into two sentences, barely shortchanging the labor cost.</comment>

<comment>The crystalline orchard and obsidian arbor are not postcard backdrops: the singing fruit frequencies and frozen-starlight bark direct Kael’s reed-selection and later echo in her own “singing back.” The arbor’s pulsing glow literally guides the nightly gatherings, while the woven replica becomes the physical seat of belonging—micro-setting charging the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless; bodies move from crater lip to marsh and back without drift. Only the shimmering crater itself stays ornamental, never constraining choice.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—belonging vs. self-erasure—is signaled early and tightens through each discovered tag; the seventh-day sculpture is the decisive escalation that forecloses outsider distance. Agency is continuous: Kael acts (etches, teaches, weaves) rather than waits. Cost is visible—her tears, the risk of exposure—but could be sharper if one relationship tangibly rejected her earlier. Still, the final image reweights options under the causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of inclusion-as-weaving emerges organically from the reed-work and the name-knot; no explicit moralizing. The arbor-twin image offers a non-literal answer: belonging is not absorption but parallel resonance. Subtext lives in gesture—Kael always stands “just outside the arbor’s shadow”—until the twin structure reconfigures that spatial grammar. The “luminescent ache” tone never collapses into sentimental platitude because it stays anchored in sensory particulars.</comment>

<comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains a consistent perceptual signature: Kael notices “frequencies beyond the murmur of lost languages,” her fingers trail “frozen starlight.” Syntax lengthens and softens under longing, then tightens into staccato revelation (“I wanted to show you”). No head-hopping; communal voices stay external. The final “she sang back” cadence is a taught payoff to the fruit’s wordless songs, crystallizing the pattern.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “a prayer frozen in glass” packs metaphor without mixed-vehicle clutter. Rhythm modulates from languid orchard pacing to urgent marsh discovery, then to hymnal close. One scaffold trace: “the community gathered each evening, sharing stories and songs” is slightly generic; tighter specificity would lift the peak. No loops or synonym churn; final line lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fusion of bio-luminal botany with marsh-weaving memory-capture feels fresh, not checklist speculative. The tag-trail as love-letter-to-communal-self is a non-obvious inversion of outsider-art tropes. Specificity—“reeds woven through starlight” knot that “shifts when you weren’t looking”—prevents generic fantasy arbor. Risk taken: quiet choral ending rather than rupture, but the image recharges prior motifs, earning the gamble.</comment>
