<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Vera’s interiority is sensorially anchored and contradicted: her threadbare gloves expose fingertips to frost yet move with meditative precision, embodying both vulnerability and mastery. Her motive—mapping arboreal heartbeats—gains credibility through the observatory logbook fragment and the tactile ritual of arranging discarded cores/bark/ice. The earned stasis of sealing the maps inside the oldest tree forecloses her chance to use them elsewhere, a visible cost that scales to 750 words. No head-hop or status dynamic to test; single-POV focus remains tight.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the copper plate’s return inside the hollow tree reweights the orchard’s “impossible spring” from abstract hope to mapped electrical persistence. Cost is legible in the wax seal and whispered promise—she surrenders her only artifact to the orchard, not to human eyes. Causal chain intact: logbook → starlight sheets → pattern → map → sacrifice. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by word 60 (“subarctic crater floor”). Lens: Accumulative/Textural; density of light/discard imagery tightens toward final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Frozen orchard functions as micro-setting that constrains every move: frost limits finger exposure, dictates slow choreography, and preserves photon traces in silver paper. The crater’s perpetual twilight creates the “world holds its breath” clock that compresses usable hours. Sensory hierarchy obeys Vera’s alchemical lens—she notices electromagnetic whispers before color, starlight before snow. Final image of maps sealed in cambial hollow fuses body, tool, and environment into one charged object.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can the orchard’s dying electrical life be saved as legible maps—tightens once: after the aurora pass, the paper either burns or records. No external antagonist; pressure is situational/stillness-bound. Vera’s agency is attention-based; she risks her copper plate and 3 years of starlight, forfeiting external validation. Escalation is a single deepening: the orchard’s heartbeat syncs with hers, making the cost of keeping the maps inside the tree felt. No reversal, but the narrowing from possibility to sealed gift is decisive.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme—persistence as cartography—emerges through concrete inversion: waste (cores, bark, ice) becomes data, starlight becomes ink, death becomes map. No explicit thesis; final “orchard would remember” reweights prior discard imagery into mnemonic code. Subtext in gesture: sealing wax = burial and gift simultaneously. Conceptual repricing occurs when reader realizes the maps are unread by any human—value is purely arboreal, a non-anthropic archive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited sustains alchemical perceptual signature: verbs like “crystallizing,” “kindled,” “cambial” mirror her metallurgical diction. Rhythm elongates in long sentences during pattern-making, then fractures into shorter units at aurora climax, mirroring breath. No dialogue to distort; interiority stays concrete (“her own heart drum against the copper”). Compression taught early (“flash-paper would ignite at a touch”) legitimizes later ellipses. No head-hop or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>High density: “photons that traveled eons…bound in cellulose and silver” compresses cosmology into craft. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new sensory or causal layer. Metaphors remain coherent (starlight = memory = map) and physically consistent. Read-aloud rhythm modulates: anaphoric “where their roots dreamed…where their branches remembered” gives ceremonial cadence that justifies repetition. No scaffold, no filter-verb stacking.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Takes familiar eco-grief trope and rotates it 90°: instead of saving trees, she archives their internal longing in a format they alone can re-read. Flash-paper alchemist is fresh occupation; coupling starlight harvesting with EKG botany creates non-obvious stakes. Copper storybook plate transforms from nostalgic prop to printing press for arboreal memory. Risk of unread archive pays off—closure offers Charged Poise where human loss (never seeing maps) equals planetary persistence.</comment>
