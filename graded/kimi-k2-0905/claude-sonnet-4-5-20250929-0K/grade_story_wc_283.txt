<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s quietly inspired trait remains ornamental; the internal pivot from passive cataloguer to prophecy-spinner is told rather than dramatized with micro-choices. The moment she “began to study the buttons with new urgency” summarizes the shift instead of embodying it. Earned cost exists—she risks the warehouse becoming “just another tomb”—but the contradiction between duty and rebellion is asserted, not staged. Still, her embodied loneliness and the final, visible act of placing the jar and charts for strangers give her credible, flawed agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the hourglasses physically slow, confirming that shared context reweights time itself. Causality is intact—Mara’s public staging of echo + charts triggers the collective response. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern density (buttons, echo) accretes until the cadence flips. Cost is felt on-page: “the warehouse would become just another tomb” is forestalled by her exposed act, and the new foot-traffic permanently alters the space’s social function.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The amber panels and canyon echo are not backdrop; they constrain acoustics and perception—Mara uses the echo’s audible loneliness as the catalyst that reconfigures visitor desire. Spatial choreography stays clean: deepest corner → shelf → entrance, each move altering tactical possibility. Honey-colored light and preserved sound are micro-settings that charge the final image when the jar is opened in public. Setting detail is selective, never touristic, and filters through Mara’s cataloguer gaze.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: prevent the warehouse from ossifying into meaninglessness. One meaningful tightening occurs when the accelerating hourglasses foreclose the option to wait—cataloguing must become public ritual now. Cost is legible: once the echo jar is opened and charts displayed, the archive is exposed to possible ridicacy, dilution, or loss of mystique—yet this gamble is the only remaining path. Agency is accretive rather than explosive, fitting the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particular—buttons as prophecy, echo as communal mirror—rather than direct assertion. The final image of visitors adding their own buttons turns the archive into a “living map,” reweighting loss as ongoing connection without moralizing. Ambiguity is preserved: the prophecy is not prevention but possibility. Subtext operates in gesture (jar placement) and institutional silence, avoiding tidy thesis statements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Narrative distance stays tight third; no head-hopping. Voice carries cataloguer precision—“severed from its original purpose,” “shared wisdom written in fragments”—that mirrors Mara’s vocational eye. Syntax lengthens slightly under reflection, then compresses into present-tense urgency at “she took the canyon echo jar,” tracking emotional surge. No filter-verb stacks; perceptual signature remains consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and image-dense: “amber warehouse beneath the cliffs” anchors palette and scale in four words. Rhythm modulates—long, cadenced sentences for archival vastness, staccato “They might hold on, or let go with intention” for prophetic list. No synonym loops or mixed metaphors; “unscrambling history” is apt mechanical metaphor for button data. Final line cadence—“We continue”—earns its capitalized brevity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses memory-archive with geological time-storage; canyon echo bottled in 1947 is fresh, non-steampunk tech. Buttons as generational prophecy encoding cycles of loss takes mundane object into conceptual repricing territory. Risk—quiet, accretive stakes rather than explosive plot—pays off by making slowness itself the victory. Specificity of “amber panels,” “orphaned gloves,” and jar label dates prevents template feel.</comment>
