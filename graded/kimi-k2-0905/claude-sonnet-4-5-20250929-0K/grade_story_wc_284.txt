<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Marcus’s scarred hands and pillbox-fidgeting give us embodied, character-specific emotion; the contradiction between paralysis and the need to act is kept alive in every beat. The micro-choice to descend and recruit Emma crystallizes his shift from self-erasure to agency, paying the cost of exposure. Interiority avoids label-speak, relying on sensory cues like “silver hush.” The only minus: Sarah, though dead, is treated as an off-stage moral compass rather than a second pressure point, so relationship-as-crucible is absent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: Marcus pockets the pillbox and walks downhill—an Earned Stasis that costs him the safety of isolation forever. Causal chain holds: pillbox → snow-map → Emma → documentation; each because/therefore linkage is legible on-page. Snow-melt clock (three days) tightens options, satisfying the 9+ persistent-constraint test. Orientation (who/where/when) is anchored by line 11; no debt applied.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The pillbox, body-in-motion on slick frost, and drone—three micro-settings—directly constrain tactics and charge the final image. Mist-lift reveal is timed to coincide with knowledge shift, so weather serves plot rather than décor. Spatial choreography is flawless: descent path, village tavern, valley camera angles track cleanly. Zephyr bluff earns irreplaceability: only its seasonal melt schedule makes the stake urgent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—give Sarah’s evidence life before melt—is signaled inside the first 100 words. Escalation is single but meaningful: once Marcus sees the melt rate, the option to “keep hiding” evaporates on-page. Cost is visible: he trades anonymity for collective justice, foreclosing retreat. No coincidence resolves; Emma’s presence is set up by prior tavern chatter, keeping agency protagonist-driven.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of “repair through fracture” emerges via the engraved line “You were never broken, only afraid,” but the story avoids final-paragraph sermon by letting the image of Marcus walking downhill carry the insight. Snow-codes literalize the idea that damage can encode evidence, a fresh particular rather than abstract maxim. Complexity is respected: no tidy redemption, only a costly stance crystallized. Subtext in silence—Marcus grips the box, says nothing—carries as much weight as text.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Marcus; no head-hop. Vocals like “silver hush,” “prudently daring,” and frost-slick syntax create a consistent lyric tension that modulates into propulsive short sentences once decision hits. Dialogue is minimal but natural; Emma’s “Show me” is goal-driven, not declarative. Free indirect style is clean: “he understood now” slides seamlessly from narration to interior.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density: one sentence can deliver weather, melt-rate, and emotional cue without padding. Rhythm breathes—long frost-images contract to staccato climb-down once clock starts. No mixed metaphors; snow as archive is sustained, not contradicted. Minor scaffold: “the valley… the valley” echo in adjacent lines (−0.2), but it does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The snow-map dead-drop is a fresh twist on spy tradecraft, evolving Sarah’s playful genius into seasonal poetics. Transformation test passes: swap snow for leaves or chalk and the whole emotional-archival logic collapses. Risk is taken—quiet, lyric espionage instead of gunplay—yet coherence remains. Slight deduction for familiar “burned spy redeems via dead mentor” spine, but local specifics outweigh template.</comment>
