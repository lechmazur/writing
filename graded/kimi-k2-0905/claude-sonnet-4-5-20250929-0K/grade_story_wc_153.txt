<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Meera’s calm authority and the client’s trembling need are sharply embodied; the micro-choice to hand over the shard crystallizes Meera’s vocation. Interiority is concrete (“grief-hollowed face,” “fierce tenderness”) and avoids therapy-speak. The client’s final breath of release shows a credible, earned shift; the cost is the permanent absence of the sister, felt in the shard pressed to the chest. Voice distinction is irrelevant—only Meera speaks at length—but her cryptic register stays consistent and particular.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens: “because the letter was never sent, therefore the shard must reopen the moment before choice.” Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—client re-weights her own past, cost is the unchangeable death, felt when the shard is pressed to her chest. Anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3; no orientation debt. One meaningful tightening: the condensation messages appear → choice to send the letter to her past-self. No causal breaks; persistent constraint is the irreversibility of death.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mangrove labyrinth and moonlit shard function as micro-setting that literally enables the ritual; spatial choreography is clean (houseboat window, shard dragged through droplets). Sensory selection skews to sound (spirits) and touch (warm stone), reflecting perceptual urgency. Setting constrains exit—only the labyrinth keeps the spirits’ song audible, hence the healing possible. Final image of fading condensation recharges the stakes: the place lets the encounter evaporate, underlining impermanence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: unsent apology vs. irreversible death. Escalation is singular but sufficient: reading the letter → condensation message → decision to “send” apology to past-self. Cost is emotional and legible: shard against chest, tears, realization that only internal narrative can change. Agency lies in the client’s consent to re-feel the moment; coincidence is absent. Pressure tightens once, yet the moral weight feels scaled to the word-limit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particular: “apology as time-travel” vs. “time as apology.” Subtext in silence—Meera never says “forgive yourself,” yet the shard transfer implies it. Final image of fading condensation offers resonant non-literal answer: absolution evaporates but has still existed. No explicit moral; ambiguity lingers about whether the revision is illusion or grace, inviting reflection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person hovers close to Meera; perceptual signature is botanical-sonic (“roots twisted like arthritic fingers,” “spirits sang their endless, wordless songs”). Syntax lengthens under wonder, shortens under instruction (“Read one”). No dialogue clutter; client’s three spoken lines carry subtext of shame. Register stays within POV’s mystic lexicon; no head-hopping. Rhythm mirrors tide: long sentences → short imperative → quiet close.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm; sentence openings vary; no template cadence. Information density high—each line moves image or emotion (e.g., “shard had its own history of catching tears”). One mixed metaphor “arthritic fingers” is vivid enough to pass. No loops or scaffold. Final paragraph avoids over-explanation; condensation fade is concrete, not abstract. commas clean; no typos.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Familiar “grief-ritual” premise refreshed by mangrove-spirit choir and tear-catching cathedral shard. Synthesis of Catholic debris (gargoyle) with brackish spirituality feels non-obvious. Emotional specificity: apology sent to past-self via moonlit window-writing—turns trope inward. Risk in quiet ending paid off by charged poise. Without the exact shard and condensation mechanics, plot collapses—high irreplaceability.</comment>
