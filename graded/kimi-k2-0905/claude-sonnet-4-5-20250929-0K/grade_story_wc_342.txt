<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The portrait artist’s face-blindness and tactile method are vividly embodied; her inability to “recognize” yet capacity to “render” creates a taut internal contradiction that drives every beat. The moment she wipes condensation from “his cheek” believing it is her lover, then recoils at a stranger’s aftershave, crystallizes her limits under pressure. Micro-choices—fingering the coin, adding the star-reflection—trace a credible arc from confidence to honest resignation. The portrait never becomes a person, and that failure is the earned cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final brush-stroke of starlight reframes the entire enterprise—precision without recognition is its own form of sight. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern and texture accrete until the肖像’s empty perfection becomes unbearable. The single-scene orientation is anchored by ~100 words inside the hollowed oak; no penalty applies. Causality is internal but coherent: each tactile pass over the coin deepens the stakes of “getting it right,” culminating in the quiet renunciation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The tree-trunk library is not a postcard; it actively constrains—sawn-off crown admits murderous starlight, curved shelves force awkward canvas angles, the empty book-safe becomes a metaphor for absent recognition. Weather is the ticking clock: pre-dawn chill seeps into paint viscosity, her shivers translate to micro-tremors in the brush. The silver coin’s temperature and wear are tracked across beats, its evolving warmth a proxy for elapsed time. Final image—canvas carried into morning light—re-prices the setting as relic, not refuge.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can tactile precision transcend face-blindness to birth a personhood on canvas? Escalation is textural—each coin-rub, each failed glance at the painting, thickens the dread that the answer is no. The single meaningful tightening arrives when she adds the star-reflection: an admission that the portrait will never cross the recognition threshold. Cost is conceptual—her method’s ceiling is exposed, foreclosing future commissions of this kind.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: the limit of empiricism when the data are human. Subtext resides in the empty book-safe—knowledge once stored, now gone, like the sitter’s identity. The final star-glint in painted eyes reweights the coin’s worn profile into cosmic indifference; recognition is a luxury the universe also denies. No moral is declared; the emotional after-effect is a hush of respectful defeat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person intimate stays locked to the artist’s tactile cognition: verbs of pressure, friction, temperature. Syntax lengthens during coin-contemplation, shortens during brush-strokes, mirroring respiration. No filter-verb stacks; perceptions arrive as bodily events (“the metal’s chill crept up her metacarpals”). Voice never editorializes beyond her perceptual reach; the sky is “fractaling into infinity” because that is how pattern-sees, not authorial flourish.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm alternates between long textured sentences that mimic coin-circles and staccato fragments for brush-flicks. No scaffold; every paragraph advances either paint-layer, time, or interior realization. One near-loop: “she had learned…she had built” is purposeful anaphora, not redundancy. Closing sentence—“still unable to recognize the face she’d rendered so perfectly”—delivers the repricing without poetic inflation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Face-blind portraitist forced to paint from a worn coin is a fresh angle on the limits of expertise. The hollowed oak library as condemned studio fuses natural and intellectual history into a single crucible. Star-reflection as surrender rather than transcendence avoids expected uplift. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulation instead of plot reversals—but coherence justifies the choice.</comment>
