<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maren’s wearied, ritual-hardened interiority is vivid; her micro-choice to interrupt the general with “This is the method” crystallises her authority under pressure. The contradiction between diplomatic gentleness and steely coercion is dramatised, not told. However, no on-page flaw or blind-spot compounds to cost her personally—her gamble wins too smoothly—so the arc feels competent rather than crucible-scarred.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the clipboard, once bureaucratic prop, becomes sacred repository whose gravity forces an imperfect treaty. Causal chain holds: name-reading → emotional rupture → narrowed negotiation options. Orientation anchored within first 120 words; single scene, no teleporting props. The felt cost is collective, but Maren’s personal price remains off-page, keeping it just shy of 9+ perfection.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The terrace’s layered scorch-marks and blood function as micro-setting that constrains tone and choice; midsummer heat presses like a second antagonist. Sensory selection stays filtered through Maren’s fatigued priorities. Spatial choreography is clean despite eight named delegates. Environment could more actively shape the final concession beat, capping the score below 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—stop adding civilian names—signals early and tightens when reading aloud makes loss undeniable. Ritual deepens rather than widens conflict, forcing recognitional cost. One meaningful escalation suffices under Accumulative lens. The treaty’s fragility is felt, but external military pressures stay abstract, preventing higher-band entry.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: peace as the exhausted space between violences. Subtext lives in the clipboard’s metamorphosis from administrative tool to relic. Final image reweights prior material without moralising. No thematic echo or tidy maxim intrudes; ambiguity about durability is earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-limited stays locked to Maren; perceptual signature—sun as ‘lazy arc’, clipboard that ‘absorbs light’—is distinct and consistent. Syntax breathes with cadence shifts under mounting names. Dialogue sparse but goal-driven; general’s-single objection efficiently voices resistance. No register drift or filter-verb clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lines carry double duty—portable cross / penitent’s cross—without purple overload. Rhythm accelerates through name-list anaphora then exhales into post-ritual silence. One paraphrase loop: ‘transparent…transparency’ near ritual intro costs −0.2. Otherwise clean propulsion, zero scaffold, metaphors cohere.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Familiar war-zone trope is refreshed through the name-reading ritual and the clipboard’s secular sacramentality. Synthesis feels inevitable yet not derivative. Risk taken in foregrounding bureaucratic grief over battlefield heroics pays off. Could push further into Maren’s unique cultural backstory for full 8.5+ distinction.</comment>
