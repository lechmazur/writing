<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elena’s quiet, embodied diligence and the moment she touches the first glowing mote give a credible micro-choice that tilts her stance; the interior contradiction between fatigue and elation is present but stays summary-level, so the final “smile” feels slightly unearned—cost is implied, not dramatized on her body.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the dust’s luminescent speech reweights the famine itself; the causal chain (lyrics → method → mote activation → city-wide plan) is legible under an Accumulative/Textural lens, and the amber radio pulse supplies a visible constraint. One tightening beat suffices; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The ember alcove, shortwave dial glow, and mist-pressed window constrain attention and supply the only light source that makes the phosphorescent dust legible; spatial choreography is clean, sensory hierarchy mirrors Elena's copyist priorities, and the micro-setting directly charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore stories via dust—is signaled early; pressure intensifies when the broadcast shifts to childhood melody, forcing Elena from transcription to physical contact with dust. The tightening narrows options (she must now disseminate the method) and carries a felt price in the aching fingers and solitary labor; cost is legible, though secondary stakes remain abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the inversion of erasure—absence itself as archive—without moralizing; the final image of “language written in absence” reweights earlier static into resonance. Subtext in the pirate’s fragments (“dust remembers”) pays off when dust literally speaks, creating earned irony.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elena’s perceptual filter; diction (“thistled calm,” “ember alcove”) is specific to her patient, music-trained attention. Rhythm modulates with the broadcast’s cadence, and no filter verbs dilute immediacy; voice remains coherent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and musical; sentences carry double duty (action + atmosphere) without metaphor pile-up. One scaffold loop—“dust dancing luminous around her head” echoes prior “dust particles suspended”—but it occurs post-closure and does not dull the final image. Read-aloud rhythm is controlled and propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The “story famine” and “teaching dust to speak” synthesize fresh mythic logic; pirate radio as resurrection manual feels non-obvious and internally consistent. Specificity of the copyist’s manuscript labor anchors the concept, and the luminous dust reprise is inevitable in hindsight—risk-taking that sharpens rather than obscures.</comment>
