<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid—fractal hand-tracing, pendant-touching—but “static-shock-as-origin” feels convenient, not earned; Chen is warmly sketched yet remains a sounding board. The final “Tonight, I map…” is a credible renunciation of certainty, but the cost is asserted, not dramatized. Still, embodied tics and contradictory hope/doubt lift her above stereotype.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Closure lands cleanly: Mara’s choice to map pathways crystallizes a new vocation with felt cost—her lost boundaries. Causal lens holds: because the shock rewired her, therefore she can see, therefore she resolves to guide others. One soft spot: the shock→pill interaction is retro-explained rather than witnessed; a micro-drag but not fatal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Studio darkness, crystalline photos, copper-wire pendant—details are selective and mirrored in Mara’s layered mind. The geode’s “cool edges ground her spiraling awareness” directly constrains her micro-choice mid-scene. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room syndrome. Micro-setting qualifies and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“save eight hundred drowning minds”—is signaled early; pressure tightens when Mara locates the “confluence where connections tangle.” Agency: she decides to map, forfeiting rest and certainty. Cost is visible in her exhausted “Tonight…” vow. Slight abstraction: we don’t see one named victim, keeping stakes panoramic rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of sovereignty-through-transparency emerges via mica layers and light-paths, never sermonized. “Willowglass hope” is dramatized in Chen’s “delicate as spun glass” line—fragile but present. No tidy moral; the image of fractal maps as escape routes reweights the premise. Avoids thematic echo; insight stays implicit.</comment>

<question>6</question><<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person close keeps psychic distance steady; perceptual signature is crystalline—“phantom light trail,” “fold into themselves”—matching artist-PoV. Syntax flexes under pressure: clauses fragment as Mara traces patterns. Dialogue sparse, natural, carries subtext of affectionate doubt. No head-hopping; voice remains singular.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes—long sentences for studio calm, shorter pulses at “There… tangle.” Information density high: “luminous trails that seemed to fold into themselves with impossible precision” does triple duty (visual, concept, foreshadowing). One near-loop: “fractally precise” appears twice within 60 words; minor. Clean grammar, vivid verbs, no scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusing electro-telepathy with light-painting is fresh; using long-exposure photography to capture neural pathways is a non-obvious synthesis. Muscovite as cognitive Faraday cage grows from grandmother talisman to operational tool. Risk-taking—lyric scientific extrapolation—pays off without violating internal logic. Could swap shock origin with another trigger, so not quite inevitable.</comment>
