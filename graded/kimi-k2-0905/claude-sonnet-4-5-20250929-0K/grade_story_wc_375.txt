<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elena’s contradictory impulses—clinical recall vs. volcanic creation—are dramatized in the charcoal smears on stone; the final act of drawing until her fingers bleed pays the cost her mother evaded, earning the shift from suppression to transmutation. Interiority stays concrete (“gray crescents that marked her”) and avoids label-speak. The only minor slip is the single-sentence summary “Memory wasn’t meant to be a prison,” which momentarily abstracts what the images have already shown.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the cave becomes a living gallery, the broken lock in pocket signals foregone secrecy, and Elena’s bleeding fingers make the cost visible. Causal chain holds—dream summons → finds mother’s hidden true portrait → draws over stone → emerges transformed. Orientation is clean within 120 words. One micro-softness: the “hours passed” ellipsis could have carried a beat of fatigue to sharpen cost, but it doesn’t break the lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The quartz-refraction of Elena’s drawings turns the entire cavern into an active collaborator; the crystals’ light literally amplifies her strokes, making setting constrain and enable the climax. Sensory triage is POV-true—she notices pigment glow and stone texture, not tourist trivia. Spatial choreography stays coherent from easel to wall to final dawn exit. The environment passes the 9+ gate by charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncork creativity or remain mummified by perfect recall—tightens when the hidden screaming self-portrait forces Elena to choose: duplicate mother’s erasure or overwrite it. The decisive escalation is the moment she pulls charcoal and attacks the limestone, narrowing options irreversibly. Cost is legible in bleeding fingers and sacrificed anonymity. Pressure is coherent under the Accumulative/Textural lens; one meaningful intensification suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: perfect recall is only a prison if feeling is denied; art must transmute memory into shared wonder. The reweighting occurs when the same subway faces reappear as mythic figures—reader feels the conceptual repricing without moralizing. No thematic echo sentence mars the ending. Ambiguity lingers: the cave will survive, but Elena’s future compliance with daylight society is unsettled, inviting reflection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Elena’s perceptual filter—“charcoal-fingered,” “mnemonically gifted” diction belongs to her idiom. Rhythm swells from hesitant arrival to frantic cadence matching chalk scratches, then exhales at dawn. No head-hopping or filter-verb clutter. One minor tic: “auroral sorrow” is lovely but slightly writerly for the POV; it passes because the phrase is immediately grounded in refracted light she sees.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “quartz formations caught what little light remained, throwing auroral sorrow” does double atmospheric and emotional work. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors stay physically coherent—hair into wings, flowers from nurse’s hair—no mixed vehicles. A single over-adjectived phrase (“beautiful and melancholic”) is forgivable and doesn’t dull the final line’s clean release.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The inherited curse of hyperthymesia fused to maternal silencing feels fresh; the subway-sketcher turned cave-creator is a specific vocation rarely dramatized. Turning the tourist cave into a palimpsest that rewrites maternal suppression is an inevitable-yet-surprising reconfiguration. Risky choice to climax off-stage (closed cave, no witnesses) is justified by the refracted light gallery—internal stakes externalized without spectacle cliché.</comment>
