<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Kael’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her fingers “found the harp,” the tooth “flare hot”—and her micro-choice to laugh at the frosting absurdity is a credible, character-specific response that alters the ghost’s stance. The flaw: “modestly fearless” is asserted once but never tested or complicated; she never hesitates, so the trait feels declarative rather than dramatized. Still, the laugh-cry contradiction and the earned fade-out give her a visible cost and a reconfiguration of identity as healer, not mere extractor.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the ghost’s integration is legible, the gorge’s echo transformed from guilt to shared laughter, and Kael’s tear-streaked face shows felt cost. Causality is lyric-accumulative: each warped harp note thickens the texture until the absurd memory breaks the loop. The lens holds; no causal contradictions. Minor waiver: orientation is complete by line 5, no penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The gorge is not backdrop but acoustic crucible: its limestone walls return laughter re-weighted, forcing Kael’s tactic shift. Micro-setting objects—the warped harp frame and the heating tooth—constrain tuning choices and signal proximity to soul. Spatial choreography is clean: switchbacks, outcropping, narrowest point track without drift. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: dawn light, fog, stone memory, then sound as working medium.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—free the ghost or leave him looping—is signaled in paragraph 3. One meaningful tightening: the moment Kael pivots from extraction to laughter, foreclosing the guild-approved method; price is the tear-tracked smile and the tooth’s burn. Escalation is textural—each echo layers guilt until the harmonic break—sufficient under Accumulative lens. Cost is visible on page, no reversal inflation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the ironic collision of tragedy and birthday frosting; no authorial thesis states “laughter heals.” The final image—Kael descending toward “the next luminous ache”—reweights the premise: healing is ongoing, never boxed. Subtext operates in gesture (the harp’s wrong note) and silence (the gorge’s caesura after integration). Resists moral formula; ambiguity lingers about guild censure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is distilled and lyric, with controlled compression: “swallowing every sound and returning it transformed” teaches the acoustic pattern early. Diction stays within Kael’s perceptual lexicon—she notices frequencies, harmonics, predator heat. Rhythm modulates: longer sentence for confession spill, staccato pluck-pluck for harp beats. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens under stress. Experimental elision (“three centuries”) is taught and paid off by gorge memory.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Line-level density is high: “pale threads” does triple duty for light, sound, fragility. No loops or scaffold; metaphor vehicles stay coherent (sound = texture, tooth = predator instinct). Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; paragraph cuts carry emotional charge. Filter verbs minimal and motivated. Only micro-slip: “modestly fearless” is abstract, but isolated.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Freshest inflection is the misaligned harp as therapeutic tool—an instrument whose defect becomes virtue, transforming collector protocol. Ghost-counseling via shared absurdity (birthday cake) is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Tropes of soul-collector and echo-gorge are re-specific through acoustic physics and laughter frequency. Risk pays off: the harmonic break could have read gimmicky, but grounding in frosting slip makes it feel discovered, not contrived.</comment>
