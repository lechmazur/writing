<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira’s grief-torn interiority is vivid—embodied trembling, salt-crusted porthole, trembling card—but her final “thread that hurt least” choice is declared, not dramatized; we feel the ache yet never see the specific memory she seizes or forfeits, so the cost is atmospheric rather than earned in a visible beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each mirrored shard and shifting word (“The garden remembers…”) deepens the same stake—can Mira keep her self intact? Closure lands with Conceptual Repricing: by “pulling” one thread she accepts permanent cognitive entanglement; the fleet of ghost ships externalizes that cost, crystallizing a new, undeniable rule—she will drift forever among plural selves.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Saltdust, rust, peeling paint, and mirror-variations give tactile specificity; the emerald card micro-setting constrains every move and reappears in the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial track is clean—porthole → ticket booth → descending to mirrors—yet “listing slightly to starboard” is the only vestige of a ship that supposedly drifts; we get no felt motion or nautical detail to ground the promised bay/ocean threshold.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserve a coherent self against Soren’s invasive memories—tightens each time the card shifts hue or mirrors fork her image; the final act of “pulling” the least-hurt thread narrows possibility to one endured delusion, paying a felt price. Pressure is coherent but single-arc; no external antagonist or additional reversal escalates beyond the initial threat of psychic merger.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival as after-life of identity emerges without exposition, culminating in the fleet image that reweights every earlier mirror: selfhood is a flotilla of discarded hulls. Theme accrues through sensory particulars rather than thesis, inviting reflection on grieving as selective amnesia; the refusal to declare which thread Mira chooses keeps ambiguity honest and resonant.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person psychic prose carries a consistent, lyric-mournful cadence; diction stays within Mira’s perceptual range (“phantom music,” “erasing fingers”). Filter verbs are minimal, rhythm flexes from long fog-rolls to fragmentary mirror beats, and no head-hopping occurs. Voice modulates with stress—final paragraph shortens sentences as decision crystallizes—earning high-band control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Sentences are dense yet transparent; metaphors (fog as “erasing fingers”) serve momentary perception without crowding. One paraphrase loop—“trapped and free, caught between what was and what might have been”—is redundant; trimming would sharpen. Otherwise clean, varied syntax, strong verbs, no scaffolding artifacts near closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Conceptual blend of genetic chimeraism with unstable narrative reality feels fresh; carnival-ship-as-limbo freshens the familiar “haunted funhouse.” Specificity—emerald card hue tied to temporal lobe tumor riddles—grounds abstraction. Risk in nonlinear memory collage pays off; however, the “garden of forgotten names” echoes prior literary after-life gardens, slightly dampening surprise.</comment>
