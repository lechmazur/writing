<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira’s interior contradiction—hunger for novelty vs protocol loyalty—surfaces early and powers the pivot to “tune for silence,” yet the embodied cost (hand resonance) is stated more than felt; still, the renunciation of old method cleanly forecloses her former path and scales to length.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the gorge flips from grave to canvas, crystal whispers “silence = origin canvas,” cost legible in her altered listening stance; causal chain holds—mentor clue → assumption discard → crystal retrieval → re-tuned array—under an Accumulative/Textural lens that tightens imagery rather than plot reversals.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>City-suspension, broken-glass moonshafts, and the shard’s frozen-light veins are vividly selective, all filtered through Mira’s professional eye; the micro-setting of the gutted transmitter cavity physically constrains the final reach and discovery, meeting the 9+ gate for object-as-setting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find a non-hollow translation”—is signaled early; the single meaningful tightening occurs when she pivots to “absence rather than presence,” narrowing interpretive options; cost is conceptual (old method abandoned) rather than viscerally paid, so ceiling is mid-8s.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: endings are beginnings in disguise; no moralizing, only image-driven re-pricing of silence as canvas; the motif of transformation (phoenix song, chrysalis city) recurs with accruing pressure, charging the final line without overt statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-close lyric voice maintains consistent perceptual signature—celestial technician’s diction of frequencies, arrays, perigee—without filter-verb bloat; compression (“serenely electric energy”) is pattern-taught early and paid off in the shard’s pulse, legitimizing the stylized cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Generally propulsive, but small loops repeat (“like a forgotten promise… like iron prayers”) and mixed metaphors jostle (“throat of darkness” + “iron prayers”); density is high yet a few adjective stacks dull peak beats. No artifacts touch the closure image, so stays above 7.5.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Ingenious inversion—astronomical Hollywood star, silence-as-signal, city as chrysalis—feels inevitable after setup; speculative frame is fully committed, not hedged. Risk in lyric tonal compression heightens resonance without obscuring causality, earning the +0.4 within-band lift.</comment>
