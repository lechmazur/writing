<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Margot’s contradictory impulses—clinging to Roland’s absence while cutting the wood that embodies him—play out in real time at the workbench; the final imperfect bowl is a credible renunciation that costs her the fantasy of perfect preservation. Interiority stays concrete, anchored in tactile wood grain and rain. The only drag is a brief lurch into self-diagnosis (“loss had taught her something else”) that momentarily abstracts the embodied epiphany.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the uneven bowl crystallizes the reconfiguration—she can now “hold what remains” instead of freezing what’s gone—cost is the visible bark patch and the relinquished illusion of permanence. Accumulative lens holds: each wood ring adds density until the final cut reweights meaning. Orientation is swift; causality intact; no late convenience.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The loft’s rain-drummed skylight and ash block function as micro-setting: weather and grain steer every beat—droplets lens the light that guides her first cut, growth rings map years of marriage/drought. Final image of palm-shadow through translucent wood is environment-as-tool constraining perception. Spatial choreography clean; no white-room lapse.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—how to house absence without being consumed—tightens once: from paralysis over first cut to acceptance of imperfection. Escalation is accretive: each shaved ring narrows options until the uneven rim forecloses perfection. Cost is legible in the retained bark and the kettle’s scream that marks irreversible completion.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges via wood grammar: preservation versus transformation. Subtext lives in tool-marks left visible—artistry that admits flaw. Final image reweights “here and gone” from loss to vessel, no moralizing. One soft spot: “harvest the lessons from loss” flirts with abstraction mid-story.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains tight psychic distance; perceptual signature filters world through wood grain, rain refraction, circus dust. Rhythm modulates—long sentences for memory, staccato for knife work. No head-hop, no filter-verb clutter. Diction stays within widowed circus artisan lexicon; final paragraph’s lyric lift is earned.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “rain drummed constantly… each droplet a small lens” does double sensory work. No synonym loops, no scaffold. One mixed metaphor—“aquarium of gray light”—but it’s brief and doesn’t taint closure. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with escalation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: circus widow + unstarted woodblock + rain-as-hourglass yields a quiet anti-monument. Risk lies in refusing figurative carving—no lion emerges—yet payoff justifies choice. Could swap Roland for any absent artist, slightly lowering inevitability, but specificity of circus journals and whip-scarred chairs grounds it.</comment>
