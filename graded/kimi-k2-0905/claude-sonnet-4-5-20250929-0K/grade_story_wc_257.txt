<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s grief is embodied through tactile craft and micro-choices (climbing stairs, folding cranes, writing coordinates). The contradiction between authentic grief and “staged memorial” is held in scene, not stated. Senna’s arc is credibly paced: trembling hands → steady work → finished brooch that windows her mother. Final “quiet return to possibility” is earned by prior因果链 of shared labor and star-watching.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each shard adds density to the idea of artificial-made-authentic. Closure is a Charged Poise—observatory door left open, crane with coordinates placed for the next drowning stranger; cost is the perpetual reopening of Mara’s wound. Pattern taught early: “genuinely artificial keepsakes” → final crane is itself an artificial star-map that becomes genuinely hopeful. One transition (cellar→dome) is legible; no causal break.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Observatory functions as micro-setting: brass eyepiece, green dome, spiral stairs constrain pacing and metaphor. Tactile metalwork details (oxidized copper, resin tears) ground grief in weight and temperature. “Outside time” rule is consistent and pays off in final crane-drop that folds past and future together. Sensory hierarchy biased to touch and starlight—exactly what a grieving craftsperson would cling to.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can mourning be transformed without betrayal? Pressure tightens when Senna’s shaky hands literalize the risk of failure. Final brooch’s tiny windows foreclose anonymity—Mara must now practice the illumination she preaches. Cost is legible: each crane left in the city re-exposes Mara’s grief, a voluntary reopening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through recurrence of “genuinely artificial”: jewelry, stars, paper cranes—all fake things made true by use. No moralizing; final image lets the reader feel the paradox. Subtext in silence: Senna never names her loss, yet the brooch speaks. “Subdued ardor” avoids sentimentality by keeping joy quiet and star-scaled.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Mara’s perceptual filter: “fingers blackened,” “telescope became her confessional.” Syntax mirrors craft precision: short clauses for jewelry work, longer lyrical sweeps for star-gazing. No head-hop; Senna’s interior is read through Mara’s watching. Register remains within Mara’s artisan lexicon—“oxidized copper,” “tattoo stencil on vellum”—never drifts to academic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences fold time (“Six months had passed…”) and layer metaphor (“stars…genuinely artificial in their own way”). No scaffold loops; each crane mention advances either geography or grief. Metaphors stay coherent—curtains, windows, bloom—without mixed vehicles. Final line achieves cadence release after controlled build.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: astronomical observatory + Victorian mourning jewelry + origami city breadcrumb trail. “Curtains of intention” as tattoo stencil is a concrete, non-obvious metaphor that_reweights_ at closure. Risk taken: stationary, low-action premise relies on accumulative imagery; payoff is resonant reconfiguration rather than plot twist. Avoids grief-trope defaults by keeping daughter unnamed and death off-page.</comment>
