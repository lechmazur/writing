<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Naja’s insurgent past and secret plant-telepathy are vivid, embodied, and drive every micro-choice; the final acceptance of golden spores crystallizes a lifetime of refusal. Interiority stays concrete—no label-speak—and the contradiction between hiding her gift and needing to share it tightens the beat. Cost is felt: she forfeits anonymity and steps into unknown mentorship. Only the thirty-year insurgency is asserted, not dramatized, keeping her just outside the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: kite script → decoding → cavern → embryo → spores → new symbiosis, each step a because/therefore. Closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost: her body becomes the bridge, foreclosing isolation. Orientation is anchored within 60 words; no lens ambiguity. The kite’s prior owner remains off-stage, a hairline gap that keeps the score sub-9.5.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Volcanic minerals, bioluminescent fungi, and sulfurous steam are filtered through Naja’s skin and mission; the hot-spring geography constrains access and hides the cavern. The kite-tail reappears at the end, recharged as signal and spent tool. One micro-gap: the Authority’s “unstable geology” is asserted, not tested, so environment never actively threatens her descent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—evolve tradition or lose it—tightens when decoding the kite forecloses secrecy and the embryo offers irreversible fusion. Agency drives every turn: she chooses dawn descent, chooses to speak the hybrid blessing, chooses to absorb spores. Cost is on-page: “golden spores… sank into her skin,” a price that can’t be refunded. Pressure plateaus once inside the safe cavern; no rising geological or human threat inside the chamber keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of symbiotic evolution emerges from amber, script, and spores—never stated. Final image of golden blood and green whispers reweights all prior resistance into collaborative future. No moralizing; the kite’s spent flutter is silent corroboration. Complexity remains: the Authority still looms, the land still poisoned, the gift unproven.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-limited stays welded to Naja’s perceptual signature—mineral taste, root-voices, pruned fingers. Syntax breathes with geothermal steam: long pools of clauses under low urgency, then tight verb bursts at dissolution. No head-hop; kite-script diction stays archaic without authorial intrusion. One clause drifts toward editorial summary: “she would ensure…” which slightly lifts the lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry triple duty—world, body, myth—without scaffold or synonym loops. Figurative language is sparse, geothermal, and coherent: “amber grown rather than mined.” Rhythm modulates from meditative soak to single-beat release. Zero mixed metaphors, zero filter stacks. A lone intensifier—“immediately”—could be cut, the hairline slip that blocks 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Plant-telepathy plus insurgent grandmother plus grown-amber embryo synthesizes into fresh mythic biopunk. The kite-as-map device is ancient yet here retooled for genetic destiny. Risk is high—symbiosis could read as eco-magic cliché—but grounded in Naja’s lived war scars and mineral breath. Transformation feels inevitable yet un-predicted, the 9-band threshold.</comment>
