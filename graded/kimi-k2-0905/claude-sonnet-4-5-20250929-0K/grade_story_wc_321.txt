<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Mateo’s “resiliently positive” trait is shown through calm micro-actions—polishing the hourglass, steadying passengers—but the interior contradiction never surfaces in scene; his diagnostic clarity (“I understand immediately”) strips pressure. No visible cost attaches to his choice to merge timelines; the grin at the end feels unearned because the story never lets his optimism falter or imperil him.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the ferry now sails a fused timeline, the hourglass flows sideways—cost is felt in the permanent loss of the old paradoxical state. Causal chain is clean: empty hourglass → phasing → grotto map → confluence merge. Orientation is nailed by word 70; lens holds as Causal throughout. Slight slack: the retroactive rule that the hourglass ever measured “tension between what was and what might be” arrives late and untelegraphed, softening the final reprice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The spectral grotto’s starlight is not postcard scenery—it literally inscribes the pattern-map onto the hourglass, constraining the confluence maneuver. Spatial choreography is tight: stern rail vanishes first, passengers relocated to bow, whirlpool ceiling opens on cue. Selective sensory triage under pressure—visual angles of starlight, brass warmth—keeps momentum. Micro-setting (hourglass as lens) charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—ferry’s existential cohesion—signals by paragraph 2 and tightens once: phasing forces the merge choice. Agency is clear: Mateo decides to “follow the patterns” and steers the confluence; Torres obeys. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral—the ferry’s perpetual transience is foreclosed—but the price is visible in the sideways sand. No secondary loss (injury, social credit) dramatizes the trade-off, keeping the escalation just shy of the 8.8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: paradox as vessel, transit as identity, and the cost of collapsing uncertainty into singular reality. No character sermonizes; the final sideways sand image reweights the earlier “clocks run sideways” motif without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers—was merger salvation or violation—but complexity is embraced, not flattened. Previous hourglass dialogue (“tension between what was and what might be”) is the sole faint echo of thematic echo; it escapes heavy penalty by arriving mid-story, not in the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited clings to Mateo’s calibrated perception—starlight “at impossible angles,” brass warm under polish—creating a distinct nautical-uncanny texture. Syntax stays crisp under pressure: “The ferry shuddered, solidified, then seemed to exist in multiple states simultaneously.” Dialogue is sparse but differentiated: Torres’ gravelly brevity versus Mateo’s buoyant certainty. No POV leakage or filter-verb bloat; rhythmic control heightens the merge beat without obscuring causality.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, high-density: “starlight pooled in underground chambers” does three jobs (visual, tactile, mythic). No paraphrase loops or template cadence; sentence openings vary naturally. Figurative language is selective—one sustained hourglass-through-starlight metaphor—avoiding purple clutter. Minor stretch: “pattern collision” is sci-fi jargon, but the grotto teaches the concept before the phrase appears, preserving clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The vanishing-ferry conceit is familiar genre terrain, yet the story freshens it by making the vessel’s paradoxical status the very engine of salvation: merger instead of rescue. Sideways-flowing sand as closure image is a precise, non-obvious reconfiguration of the prompt’s “clocks run sideways.” Risk is taken—conceptual stakes, not bodily peril—and coherence holds. The previous-deckhand gift backstory is the only soft echo of trope; it’s quickly subordinated to the pattern-map reveal.</comment>
