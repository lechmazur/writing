<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is concrete—she “sweeps” papery petals, “measures” the gauge tooth, “adjusts” mirrors—each micro-choice reveals her father-haunted need to unlock light for others. The flaw is safety-hedging: she never risks failure or real opposition, so her growth is only incremental recognition rather than costly renunciation. Still, the embodied metaphor of locksmith-turned-gardener keeps her singular and credible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: mounting the gauge tooth beside the mirror crystallizes her inherited vocation—light not locks—and the cost is the bare rosebush she must keep tending. Causality is accumulative/textural: mirrored gardens tighten pattern until the neighbor’s seedlings prove the system’s reach. One transition (street→fire-escape loop) is legible; orientation anchors by line 5. No meaningful tightening mid-piece keeps it just shy of exceptional.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Harbor moonlight, rusted grating, and the “fragment of reflected moonlight” in a coffee-can form a micro-setting that literally guides watering angles and mirror placement. The gauge tooth functions as mobile setting-as-tool, constraining the final memorial decision. Selective sensory triage—papery petals, oar-rhythm water—keeps economy tight while rooting every garden in tactile iron and salt air.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can imposed light make life sprout in permanent dusk—signals early and deepens when a neighbor covertly joins. Yet pressure plateaus: each fire-escape visit restates success rather than testing it with drought, vandalism, or mirror theft; escalation is additive, not consequential. The final image reweights possibility but no option is foreclosed, so cost feels prospective, not paid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through mirrored refraction rather than statement: protection-through-vulnerability, locksmith logic translated to horticulture. The gauge tooth’s re-purposing as garden talisman reconfigures “opening” from security to exposure. Final paragraph’s “stubborn and green” avoids moralizing, letting image resonate. Ambiguity lingers—will the rose return?—inviting reflection without tidy closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Mira’s locksmith-trained perception: she “measures” light angles, “recognizes” gauge depths, hears harbor “rhythm of oars.” Syntax lengthens under contemplation, shortens during climb—“She watered it carefully, then adjusted the mirror”—mirroring effort. No head-hopping; diction remains within her taciturn, tool-fluent lexicon. Distinctive, consistent, and modulated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: long moonlit sentences breathe, clipped horticultural verbs propel. Figurative control high—“papery lightness of ending” condenses grief and texture. One scaffold loop: “reflected moonlight” echoed thrice in 30 lines without new pressure. Otherwise dense, specific, clean; no mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks. Final mounting beat lands clear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Turning a bitting gauge into a gardener’s talisman is fresh synthesis of locksmith and cultivator worlds; mirrored-light gardening in alley dusk feels specific to this harbor slum. Risk is quiet—no villain, no failure—so ingenuity is conceptual rather than dramatic. Still, the vocational hand-off from father to daughter reframes “unlocking” as nurture, a non-obvious re-pricing that lingers.</comment>
