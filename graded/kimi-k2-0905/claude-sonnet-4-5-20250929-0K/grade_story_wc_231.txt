<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Magnus’s interiority is rich—his habit of “noticing absence” defines every beat, and the Edelweiss pin is a credible micro-choice that externalizes his calling. The memory-of-memory device lets his past feed present stakes without summary overload, and his decision to pin the flower on himself crystallizes earned cost. Flaw: we never feel him contradict himself in-scene; the arc is linear rather than crucible-hot. Still, the final stance carries palpable forfeiture of anonymity, enough to satisfy 8.8- gate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Magnus’s pinning of the flower reweights “borrowed memories” from abstract theme to lived obligation, cost visible in the last line. Causal linkage holds: key arrives → coordinates discovered → dawn plan forged; no retro patches. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of absence-teasing builds to cadence shift at nautical twilight; no contradiction. Meets 9+ quick test: persistent constraint (keeper duty) shapes tactics, and cost is unmistakable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>“Opal dock in mist” is not backdrop—it narrows visibility, hides footprints, forces the gap-seeing method. Lighthouse beam as tool recurs and charges the final image, satisfying 9+ gate. Sensory economy is extreme yet vivid: salt-killed flower, brass key’s hollow shaft. Spatial choreography flawless—no floating bodies or teleporting props.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode stranger’s gesture—communicated by paragraph 2. Escalation is textural: each absent detail (no boat, no footprints, Alpine flower) tightens the puzzle until coordinates convert mystery into tomorrow’s dive. Cost is knowledge-burden: Magnus accepts lifelong custodianship of someone else’s war secret. One meaningful tightening suffices; no reversal needed for this lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges inductively from recurring absence motif rather than thesis statement. Final pinning reconfigures memory as stewardship, not nostalgia—resonant without moral. No final-paragraph “meaning” sentence; image does the work. Edelweiss lyric reprise is earned, not token, lifting score into high band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close sustains keeper’s perceptual signature—measured arcs, salt logic, lantern grammar. Diction stays within plausible lexicon; no elevated register creep. Rhythm mirrors fog-pace: long sentences swell, then tighten at reveal. No head-hop; psychic distance stable. Pattern of hyphenated metaphor (“mist like a question mark”) is taught early and paid off in closure image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Information density high; most sentences do double duty (e.g., “salt killed everything delicate” salts setting + stakes). One paraphrase loop: “no footprints… no wallet… no boat” lists absence without new pressure; minor. Metaphor vehicles coherent—opal, question mark, ghostly glow—no mixed logic. Read-aloud rhythm varied; no template cadence. Artifacts do not touch closure; within 9- tolerance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Wartime-resistance memory-Key-to-Edelweiss linkage feels fresh; not a trope template. Absence-as-detection method inverts whodunit logic. Risk: lyrical stillness over plot kinetics, but coherence justifies choice. Synthesis of Alpine flower, Geneva key, and lighthouse signal is specific to this voice; removal would collapse premise.</comment>
