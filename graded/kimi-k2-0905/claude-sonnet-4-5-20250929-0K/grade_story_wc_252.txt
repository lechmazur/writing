<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mira’s balletic dockwork and Kael’s pirate-longing are sharply embodied; their joined-hand decision carries visible cost. Interiority stays concrete—“phantom weight of obligations” rather than labels—and the final choice is credibly earned. Minor over-articulation of “brutal tenderness” twice edges toward label-speak, but contradictory impulses remain live in-scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: scrimshaw find → shared longing → whale call → joint detachment. Closure is a Charged Poise on the dock: options rewritten, cost felt in the loosening “dock’s grip.” Orientation anchored by line 8; no lens ambiguity. One micro-turn—Mira finishing Kael’s sentence—tightens intimacy without resetting stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sublittoral fringe is more than postcard: salt-stink, copper dawn, whale-song through pilings constrain bodies and mood. Whalebone map functions as micro-setting, its grooves dictating tilt and shared gaze. Final image fuses body/tool/horizon—“dance toward different horizons”—charging closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—escape versus anchored duty—tightens once: shared touch on bone forecloses solitary flight. Escalation is relational deepening, not external peril; cost legible in Mira’s felt “phantom weight.” Agency mutual; coincidence (whale call) complicates, does not rescue.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of self-detachment emerges through dock/bone/sea particulars; no final moralizing. “Com-bative tenderness” modulates from mockery to shared vulnerability, re-weighted in final hand-squeeze. Ambiguity remains—will the island surface?—but emotional reconfiguration is complete.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person omniscient hovers just above Mira, dipping into her calloused sensorium: “salt-bitter morning” aligns with dock-worker bias. Syntax glides between lyrical compression and muscular verb choice, mirroring dance/labor duality. No head-hop; Kael’s interior accessed only through Mira’s reading of his face and voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm, varied sentence lengths; information dense—“yellowed with age and etched with a map no cartographer would recognize” does three jobs. One mixed metaphor: “dawn painted the sublittoral fringe in shades of copper and pearl” slightly layers paint-on-water, but clarifies immediately. No scaffold loops or filter stacks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Familiar trope dyad—dock worker + pirate heir + mythical island—redeemed by sensory specificity and mutual escape rather than hetero-romance default. Whale-call as detachment trigger feels fresh; disappearing island only symbol, not set-piece. Risk taken in quiet, joint renunciation rather than voyage spectacle.</comment>
