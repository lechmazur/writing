<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara’s grief-tinged vigilance is vivid—her drumming tic embodies inherited obsession—but the interior contradiction between scientific detachment and sudden code epiphany is asserted rather than dramatized; the final “listening” stance costs her nothing we see and feels like thematic punctuation, not earned renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the ocean’s mnemonic testimony reweights human history with undeniable culpability; the lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern density (tapping, vanished routes, ghost currents) tightens until the Morse reveal reconfigures meaning; cost is conceptual but legible in the bleached-reef image; one minor scaffold: “She began to type her report” is pure utilitarian transition that slightly dulls the final cadence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Station, atlas page, and reef skeleton function as micro-setting; the groaning cables and salt-stiff paper constrain gesture and attention; the atlas page is handled twice (tapping, palm-press) and returns to charge the final image; sensory selection skews visual but the swaying floorboards and radio crackle keep embodiment live; no environmental detail breaks physics or POV filter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode the ocean’s disappearing paths—signaled early; pressure escalates via pattern accumulation: each data fragment tightens the mystery until the 17-year-early current forces real-time action; agency is intellectual (drop sensors) not existential, so cost is conceptual rather than tactical; sufficient for this length and lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the convergence of personal heirloom and planetary archive: human commerce literally carved memory into water, now playback indicts; subtext lives in the grandfather’s idle rhythm, not exposition; final image of “listening” reweights prior material without moralizing; avoids tidy eco-aphorism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Mara’s perceptual bias—she notices temperature decimals, ignores crew faces; diction is scientist-lean but not jargon-drunk; rhythmic repetition of tapping and “remembered” creates accumulative cadence; no head-hopping or register drift; dialogue snippet is utilitarian but voice-consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm, varied sentence length; high density—single sentences splice data, memory, and sensory cue; no mixed metaphors or scaffold loops; minor filter verb cluster “she found herself doing” could be crisper; closing paragraph avoids explain-everything trap, ends on image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Core synthesis—ocean as thermal hard-drive of shipping lanes—is fresh yet inevitable once revealed; inherited nervous tic encoding Morse provides intimate portal into planetary-scale memory; avoids climate-fiction clichés by focusing on archival testimony rather than disaster spectacle; risk taken in conceptual stakes pays off in resonant final image.</comment>
