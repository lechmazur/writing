<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Marlow’s interior contradiction—needing answers yet refusing to break the clasp—remains vivid and embodied; the micro-choice to speak into the microphone at the exact frequency of forgiveness is earned and costly. The final renunciation (closing the diary unread) crystallizes a hierarchy of values: witness over possession. Hairline slip: “theatrical sincerity” twice edges toward performed self-diagnosis, not quite embodied under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the clasp clicks open yet Marlow shuts the diary—an Earned Stasis that reweights empathy from extraction to accompaniment. Causal linkage holds: each frequency layer is a because/therefore step toward the audible click; the refusal to read now carries conceptual cost. Lens (Causal) is stable; no orientation debt. Final line recharges the opening silence trope with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<comment>Collapsed roof and starlight function as micro-setting: the open sky is the literal channel through which transmitted frequencies travel, constraining success. The brass clasp’s incremental tremor tracks spatially across the bench; fireworks’ first scream marks causal time. Tool-as-setting (modified radio) directly enables the climax. Slight over-pack of color metaphors (amber hum, burgundy resonance) nicks full 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—recovering the sister’s voice without violence—tightens when Marlow realizes the clasp is a conversation frozen in metal; the price is her own silence afterward. Agency drives every beat: tuning, speaking, renouncing. Cost is visible: she forfeits immediate knowledge and bears the diary’s weight unopened. Escalation is single-crescendo rather than iterative, adequate at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of empathy-as-frequency emerges through concrete image (clasp vibration, fireworks thunder) rather than assertion. Final reconfiguration—empathy is listening without decoding—offers resonant non-literal answer. The diary’s unopened pages keep thematic ambiguity fertile. No moralizing, no thesis line; silence is repriced as active choice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric maintains perceptual signature: auditory synesthesia (“silver scratch of arguments”) stays character-bound. Rhythm modulates: long cadences for cataloguing silences, staccato for clasp tremor. No head-hopping; psychic distance contracts to body-level at click. Minor loop—“silence of…” repeated—dulls final third microscopically.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence layers time, tool, and emotional hue (“the amber hum of childhood summers…”). Metaphors stay coherent within radio/sonic logic. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with beats. Paraphrase loop on “silence of” costs −0.4; otherwise near-pristine. Closure line is clean propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: lock-picking via empathy frequencies; silence catalogued like endangered dialects. Risk—radio transmitter inside ruined workshop—heightens stakes without gimmick. Premise transformation: the diary is not Pandora’s box but a tuning fork. Inevitable in hindsight, yet non-obvious at entry.</comment>
