<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Marcus’s guilt-driven self-scar refusal, embodied burn echoes, and micro-choice to descend with the cracked box earn a credible renunciation; the “hard-soft” stance crystallizes. Interiority runs thick, but “bargained innocence” is asserted more than dramatized in scene, and daughter/marriage pressure is off-page, muting relationship crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single-scene causal arc—because he survived the girl, therefore he bears scars, therefore he treks to release the box—culminates in Decisive Change: he will take leave. Closure lands with visible cost (scars, cracked box, forfeited fire-tower identity). Orientation anchored by ~70 words; no lens ambiguity; no artifact at ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Moonlit ridge, charred stumps, porcelain box, and bodily scars are rendered through Marcus’s fire-watcher gaze; each constrains his path and charges the final image. Selective sensory triage (silver light on scar tissue, white aspens) mirrors internal renewal without slipping into postcard excess. Spatial choreography holds as he walks, stops, descends.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can he still protect innocence after showing a child the world burns?—tightens once: carrying the broken box up, then choosing to carry it back changed. The price (leaving the firetower identity) is legible on-page. Agency is introverted but causal; escalation is one meaningful renunciation, sufficient for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of “translation failure” emerges through concrete images: scarred face that once spoke safety now silences, cracked box that once held childhood now holds apology. Final image of “armor with a door built in” offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing. Subtext in silent porcelain handling deepens emotional after-effect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited sustains fire-watcher perceptual signature: celestial tracking, terrain reading, scar-as-topography metaphor. Syntax breathes with ascent/descent rhythm; no filter-verb clusters. Dialogue absent by design; narration stays within plausible lexical reach of a taciturn responder. Voice coherence survives peak emotional beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, high-density; figurative language (moon-shadow on scars, light “getting in” through crack) is spare and pattern-paid. No scaffold loops, no mixed metaphors, no register drift. Opening and closing lines frame stakes and recharged motif concisely. Minor tic: three “bargain” variants feel engineered, but do not obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fire-scarred father/child reconciliation is familiar territory, yet lensing it through celestial time-keeping and cracked porcelain translator-box freshens the emotional geometry. Specificity of fire-tower expertise and refusal of grafts makes scars feel lived. Risk in quiet ending with no verbal daughter scene pays off via Charged Poise.</comment>
