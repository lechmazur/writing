<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Grandmother’s lonely bargain powers every beat; the veiled dreamer’s documenting hand and tremulous step embody inherited hunger for connection. Yet the veil itself remains a dead prop—never lifted, adjusted, or used to screen tears—so her body stays half-abstract. Interiority is sharp (“cold fire”) but flirts with label-speak (“cautious exuberance transforming”). Closure cost is felt when she accepts that revenge was never the point, earning the renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: watch-cipher → shelf-mapping → grandmother’s confession → renounced revenge. Letters supply ticking clock; “document everything” rule pays off when her journal literally steers path-finding. One transition (enter→deep stacks) is clean; orientation clear by 80 words. Closure lands as conceptual repricing: the library stays open, her hunt reframed, cost visible in the watch’s now-mere ticking.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Library breathes in cardamom and reluctant light; propagation delay mechanic is taught through her steps and corrected reach, turning spatial illusion into navigable tool. Watch casing’s matched embossment gives tactile anchor. Mist and shimmer risk vague grandeur but are repeatedly yanked into functional use (“pathways parted”). Physical hierarchy holds: body→tool→architecture. Lacks 9+ because environment never quite bites back—no collapsing shelf or lost exit to force tactical change.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—access grandmother’s silenced truth—tightens when cipher coordinates demand precise observation; one mis-mapping would erase the volume. Propagation-delay rule raises cost of error; “many seekers never returned” hints stakes yet stays abstract. No external antagonist, but internal dread (“eyes burned”) and ethical recalibration suffice. Escalation is single-cycle: deeper shelves → warmer book → revelation → renunciation; cost legible in shaken hands and reframed quest.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of chosen silence versus imposed silence emerges through concrete volumes; grandmother’s voluntary surrender of estate reframes fraud as yearned-for intimacy. Final image—library paths stay open—non-literally answers how unvoiced words survive: they wait for someone willing to hear. No moralizing; ambiguity remains (will she publish or protect?). Subtextual weight rests in watch demoted from cipher to plain timepiece, signaling release of ancestral grasp.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person hovers at a calibrated distance, filtering perception through veiled dreamer’s selective attention (“tasted of cardamom and forgotten names”). Syntax lengthens under wonder, shortens under shock (“She opened it carefully.”). No dialogue, so voice carries all rhythm; occasional adjective drift (“ethereal,”“impossible geometry”) edges toward purple but stays in character. Consistent perceptual signature; compression and reversal pattern taught early and honored.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose is textured yet disciplined; figurative bursts (“architecture shimmered between states of being”) are sparse enough to avoid density penalty. One paraphrase loop: “cautious exuberance rising… tempered by the knowledge” restates same beat. Strong verbs (“clutched,”“pulsed,”“breathed”) outweigh nominalizations. Filter verbs minimal; no scaffold clutter. Final image earns its quiet cadence without syntactic monotony. One mixed metaphor (“cold fire”) is minor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>“Library of unspoken words” could be familiar magical-archive fare, yet coupling it with reversible cipher inside a con-man’s watch freshens the trope. Propagation-delay navigation feels novel and organically limits agency. Emotional inversion—fraud victim complicit in her own con—adds moral complexity. Specific lineage of silence gives universal theme intimate stakes. Risk in abstract setting pays off through functional mechanics, not ornament.</comment>
