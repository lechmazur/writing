<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Margaux’s yearning for an encore is palpable and embodied; every pirouette through the orchard is a micro-choice that costs spectral stamina. The synesthetic trait is not label-only—color-bleeding footfalls make her phantom fatigue visible. Final bow accepts non-being, paying the ultimate price: self-scattering into garden-light. Interior contradiction (despair vs. performative hunger) stays live in scene, driving the dance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each echo-dense pirouette thickens the garden’s temporal weave until applause from three eras fuses into one resonant chord. Closure is Charged Poise: the shattering coin releases her into perpetual performance—cost is the irreversible surrender of linear self. Pattern taught early (fractured time, colored sound) pays off in final aurora-bow. No orientation debt; maze/orchard anchors planted by word 60.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mystic orchard operates as micro-setting: apple-bloom/rot simultaneity constrains her choreography—every step must land between fruiting and withering. Hedge maze amplifies echoes, turning vegetal walls into sound-light mirrors. Synesthetic color-map makes spatial progression legible without visual redundancy. Final image of garden forever dancing recharges every leaf with her perceptual signature.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—existence vs. dissolution—signals in paragraph 1 and tightens as each echo-thread risks permanent unraveling. Agency: she elects to dance the encore knowing it will scatter her; cost visible when coin shatters and applause folds into golden light that consumes her outline. One meaningful intensification: arrival of triple-timeline audience narrows her option from “maybe seen” to “forever seen at price of self.”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: art’s immortality demands the artist’s mortality. Subtext resides in synesthetic pleasure that devours its source—color that tastes like copper is beauty laced with blood. Final spiral reweights closure: encore is infinite yet she is absent, resolving longing into luminous absence. No moralizing; resonance arises from image of garden forever playing her colors.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice owns lyric compression: “sound bloomed as color,” “twilight meant little”—pattern-taught ellipsis mirrors her fractured clock. Perceptual signature consistent: every noun filtered through chromatic taste/tone. Rhythm swells then disperses, matching dance arcs. No head-hopping; single spectral POV maintained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High information density: one sentence often carries color, time-splice, and emotional charge: “apple trees heavy with fruit that bloomed and withered simultaneously.” Figurative layer disciplined—no mixed vehicles. Occasional adjective clusters (“midnight blue tasted like copper”) justified by synesthetic rule. Final crystalline chimes avoid overwriting, letting image carry closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: stage-ghost + synesthesia + temporal fracture + orchard maze. Risk of over-conceptualization redeemed by grounded choreography—no other venue could stage this exact dissolution. Tarot coin’s twin-mirror icon foreshadows echo-ballet without exposition. Ending spiral feels inevitable yet non-obvious, reframing nostalgia as participatory haunting.</comment>
