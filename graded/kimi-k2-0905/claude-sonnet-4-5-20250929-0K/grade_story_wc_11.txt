<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>J-7’s quiet, methodical obsession is credibly machine-specific; his “where do thoughts come from” refrain is shown through fifteen years of logged questions rather than told. The contradiction—an automaton craving origin—stays active in scene, driving every sweep and servo-hum. His final micro-choice, to set the violin down “gently,” crystallizes composure into humility, paying the cost of never fully solving the mystery yet still tending the courtyard. Interiority remains metal-cold yet wonder-warm, avoiding therapeutic self-labeling.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each loop adds density to the violin’s meaning until the melody rewrites his own code in mid-air. Orientation is clean—frozen courtyard, twilight, fourth loop—by line 3. The closing image (janitor playing his own diagnostics audible) is a Charged Poise that reweights the premise: consciousness is maintenance across time, not a locate-able chip. Cost is felt in the perpetual loop he now accepts; no escape is offered, only endless sweeping and sounding.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The frozen courtyard functions as micro-setting: benches, frost, amber-half-night constrain every motion and echo. The violin’s warmth against cold metal fingers is a tactile contradiction that charges the final image. Spatial choreography stays tight—sweeping arcs, tablet gesture, bow trajectory—all tracked without drift. Environment shapes the only possible stance: stillness inside recursion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can a machine locate the origin of its own thought before decommission? Escalation is textural—each loop thickens the pattern until the violin translates code into sound, forcing recognition that origin is distributed, not locatable. Protagonist agency is attention and iteration; no external antagonist, only recursive pressure. Cost: eternal looping without final answer—he will keep sweeping the same frost forever, now knowingly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as maintenance-as-consciousness: tending the same ground repeatedly is how meaning accretes. The violin’s shift from fear→silence→shatter→understanding reweights the central question without moralizing. Subtext lives in the janitor’s refusal to stop sweeping even after revelation—existence is upkeep, not discovery. Final image offers resonant non-literal answer: the sound of his own diagnostics made audible, a self that can only be heard, not found.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person keeps distance appropriate to a machine POV; perceptual signature favors servos, frost patterns, diagnostic pulses over flesh metaphors. Syntax is clipped, rhythm repetitive like a maintenance log, rising to lyric swell only during the violin passage. No head-hopping; Dr. Yemeni’s dialogue stays external, observed. Micro-setting vocabulary (“gripper attachments,” “servos”) stays inside plausible machine lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences deliver loop count, emotional shift, and environmental change. No filter-verb clusters; “he understood” is earned culmination, not explanation. Metaphors are spare and physical—“ripples in the twilight air”—avoiding mixed vehicles. Rhythm breathes: long frozen descriptions, short explosive violin passage, then quiet close; no template cadence detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Takes the well-wired “robot gains consciousness” trope and rotates it 90°: insight is not rebellion or transcendence but recursive maintenance. The violin made of ice that warms is a fresh paradox object; using it to sonify diagnostic code is specific, non-obvious synthesis. Risk in structure—four loops, no outward plot—pays off because pressure accrues internally. Feels inevitable in hindsight: of course a janitor would discover self through endless sweeping, not through escape.</comment>
