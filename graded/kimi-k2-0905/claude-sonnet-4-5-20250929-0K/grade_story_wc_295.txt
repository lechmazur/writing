<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s lucid-dreamer vocation gives her a sharp, occupation-specific lens; her exhaustion is embodied in trembling fingers, not labels. The interior contradiction—wanting to decode alone yet recognizing Ashwin’s fatal solitude—peaks when she decides to co-write the paper, a renunciation of solitary obsession that lands with visible cost: Ashwin’s pressed daylily between them. Elias’s twenty-year isolation is sketched deftly, but his voice collapses into Mara's cadence in dialogue, preventing 9+.</comment>

<comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: star-catalog fragments and dream-journal shards build density until a single cadence shift—"we could publish this together"—reweights the stake from solitary mastery to shared witness. Closure is a Charged Poise: the act of co-writing crystallizes options and forecloses Ashwin’s path with undeniable cost felt in the daylily’s presence. Orientation is clean by line 4; brass telescope and telegram anchor who/where/when. No meaningful escalation flaw; the deepening is the discovery that the code is designed for chorus, not solo.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The observatory dome as opening eye, the brass telescope, and the pressed daylily function as micro-settings that constrain choices: the dome forces shared sky-gaze, the telegram’s fragility bars aggressive handling, the telescope’s brass chill keeps fingers trembling. Sensory selection is POV-true: Mara notices star-pulse periods, not constellations. Spatial choreography stays clean across the single continuous scene; bodies track from doorway to telescope to table. The final image—two writers under changing stars—recharges "nothing changes alone" with conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: decode the temple inscriptions without repeating Ashwin’s isolation-driven despair. Tightening occurs when Mara realizes the code is intentionally choral; that knowledge forecloses solo publication and makes shared authorship the only non-lethal path. Cost is legible: Ashwin’s death and the daylily’s brittleness embody the price of refusal. Agency is intellectual—choosing co-authorship—but the beat lands as renunciation of prior identity, satisfying the lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: shared observation as antidote to collective trauma. The variable-star language reweights grief into measurable cycles, letting cosmic pulsing literalize emotional cadence. Subtext thrives in silence—the telegram’s pressed daylily speaks louder than any epitaph. Final image reprises early "eye" metaphor but now with two pupils, achieving CR that reconfigures the premise: knowledge is not owned but witnessed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Mara; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is astronomically tilted: hearts "settle in chest" like calibration weights, tea steam "rises and falls" like Cepheid curves. Rhythm modulates: long Latinate clauses for dream recollection, short Anglo-Saxon bursts under star-matching pressure. One voice slip—Elias says "transformation through darkness" in Mara’s diction—prevents 9+.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Zero loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks. Sentences layer jobs: "She pulled up her dream journals on the tablet, pages filled with symbols that matched the temple walls" shows action, backstory, and causality in one breath. Figurative language is spare and pattern-taught: star-pulses = heart-pulses. Final line—"everything changes, and nothing changes alone"—earns its aphoristic punch via accumulated specifics, not abstraction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The fusion of lucid-dream ethnography with variable-star cryptography feels inevitable yet fresh; no existing template combines those domains. Risky structural choice—accumulative shards of catalog data and dream visions—pays off when the choral code revelation reweights all prior fragments. The ancient-healing-through-astronomy premise is transformed through concrete period-matching labor rather than mystical hand-waving.</comment>
