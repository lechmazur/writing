<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Solène’s interior contradiction—scientist vs. lover of presence—drives every micro-choice; the nautilus-touch, sphere-dripping, and final gifting are embodied, not labeled. Mira functions as pressure, not prop, forcing the confession that revalues the whole venture. The cost is felt when Solène admits she must “return differently,” foreclosing the safe Academy path. No stock phrases; every emotional beat is filtered through tactile detail (shell, twilight, warm sphere).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the last sphere crystallizes “testimony” rather than commodity light, with conceptual cost legible in Mira’s closed palm. Causal lens holds: because Solène etches the spiral formula → therefore she can birth witness-light → therefore she must leave the old order. Orientation anchored by word 50; no lens drift. Setup (Academy exile) pays off in the final refusal to power cities.</comment>

<comment>Twilight ember nexus is not backdrop but resource—its copper glow seeds the sphere’s chromatic recipe and constrains the visible spectrum she can harvest. The shell’s columella curl acts as micro-setting ruler, determining drop-size and sphere-geometry; remove it and the science collapses. Spatial choreography is immaculate: doorway shadow falls across notes, sphere passes palm-to-palm, distances track. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV—scientist notices refractive indices before emotional temperature.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can presence be bottled—signals early and tightens when Mira whispers “Are you truly leaving?” forcing Solène to test the new sphere under witness gaze. One meaningful deepening: the sphere must hold “texture of this twilight,” not mere lumens, raising ontological cost. Agency remains hers; no coincidence resolves. Price is palpable: the finished sphere glows with “amber suspension” of their own faces—once given, it cannot serve Academy profit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from spiral geometry = growth = memory; no character sermonizes. Subtext lives in gesture: Mira’s shadow across the notes ≈ Academy’s shadow over Solène’s art. Final image reweights “light” from utility to testimony without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers—will the Academy crush her or be transformed?—yet cost is undeniable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Solène’s perceptual signature—“scientist’s precision and lover’s reverence”—syntax mirrors spiral cadence with clause-embedded qualifiers. No head-hop; Mira’s interior is guessed at through voice-softening and shadow. Diction stays within alchemist lexicon: “columella,” “refractive indices,” “ontological weight.” Rhythm accelerates during drip-sequence, then breathes out in the palm-transfer beat. Filter verbs serve voice: “she saw how she’d etched” = scientist cataloguing her own trace.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud ear: varied sentence openings, no template cadence. Information-dense lines—“each chamber a precise measurement of growth, each curve a mathematical poem”—do triple duty (science, beauty, theme). Zero paraphrase loops; no scaffold. One micro-awkwardness: “density of presence” appears twice in adjacent clauses; flag −0.2 but does not touch closure. Metaphor coherence pristine: nautilus = cosmology = memory, never violated.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fusion of hard-science alchemy with romantic phenomenology feels fresh; “pocket-sun” trope is inverted from utility to witness. Nautilus-as-ruler is non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Risk: 750-word story leans lyric, yet pressure remains coherent. Conceptual integrity absolute—never retreats to generic fantasy.</comment>
