<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mara’s guilt is palpable and embodied—her trembling fingers, nightly panic, nightly shore rituals—giving us a living contradiction between professional pride and self-loathing. The choice to dismantle her empire is telegraphed early, but the climactic micro-choice to let Elias walk away without self-defense crystallizes a visible cost. Interior monologue avoids therapy-speak; instead, driftwood and watch hand act as extensions of her body. The only drag is Elias’s off-stage arrival, which lessens the relationship-as-crucible pressure in the final beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the watch hand and driftwood reweight meaning in the final image, forcing Mara’s renunciation with undeniable conceptual cost. Causality is intact—every fabricated genealogy leads to the parents’ deaths and Elias’s confrontation. Orientation is anchored by word 60; terrace, shore, dusk are spatially stable. One shard only, so default scope is met. The slight deduction comes because Elias’s entrance relies on off-stage legwork rather than a causal trigger within the scene.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cobalt terrace at dusk functions as micro-setting: its railing and salt-sand shore constrain Mara’s nightly penance ritual and supply the driftwood that becomes her surrogate confessional. Color and tide mirror her shame without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography holds as Mara descends, kneels, rises—Elias remains twenty feet away, distance preserved. The terrace reappears as looming judgment in the final line, recharging the opening image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—guilt versus atonement—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens when Elias appears, foreclosing the option to keep silent. Cost is visible: Mara’s “soul” is priced at the empire she vows to dismantle. Agency sits with Mara; Elias’s arrival complicates but does not resolve. No reversal, but the single deepening is sufficient for 700-word scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the driftwood-to-watch-hand axis: truth as something carved by storm rather than manufactured. Subtext operates in gesture—Mara offers both driftwood-child-hand and watch hand to Elias, a mute confession no dialogue can equal. Final image of terrace “looming” reconfigures the premise: accountability is endless tidal return, not single act. No moralizing sentence mars the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays strictly inside Mara’s perceptual filter: “sieved hush” is her idiom, not author thesis. Rhythm modulates—long cadence for memory, staccato for Elias’s arrival. Filter verbs are minimal; “she knew” appears once and is justified. Dialogue is sparse but distinct: Elias’s tempered regret contrasts with Mara’s clipped whisper. No head-hop.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and image-dense; sentences open with varied syntactic shapes. Only one paraphrase loop detected (“weight of unspoken words” echoed two sentences later) but it is brief. Metaphors stay coherent—driftwood as broken promises, watch hand as stopped time—without purple strain. Final paragraph breathes correctly after high-pressure beat. No typos or tense drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise of black-market memory-smithing feels fresh, grounded in genealogical rather than sci-fi tech. Driftwood-shore penance ritual is a specific invention that would fail if relocated. Watch hand as synecdoche for murdered time is non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. The story commits fully to ethical horror without flinching. Risky quiet ending pays off.</comment>
