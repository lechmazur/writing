<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The frugal astronomer’s drive is palpable and embodied through patched trousers, borrowed gear, and her last-savings desert trek. Interiority stays concrete: her “spiritual kinship” surfaces while cross-referencing by lamplight, not in abstract self-analysis. The covenant motive tightens across beats—she photographs, sketches, and finally weeps—yet the shift from scholarly curiosity to filial emotion is slightly abrupt, blunting the cost scale. Still, her micro-choices (kneeling, tracing, digging with hands) keep her idiosyncratic and credible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>A single causal chain carries discovery → decoding → alignment dig; each step grows from the last with no lucky rescues. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the treatise’s unearthing reweights her frugality into intellectual lineage, felt cost legible in her exhausted weeping. Orientation is clear by word 70 (“palace ruins at dusk”), easily inside the 120-word allowance. Only minor slack: the second tile’s resonance is forecasted rather than foreshadowed, so the final beat feels slightly convenient.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dusk’s fading light and shadow angles are not mood paint but functional instruments, driving the twilight reveal beat. The brass compass, camera, and clay tablets act as micro-settings that constrain method and class. Palace corridors, observatory chamber, and desert coordinates are cleanly tracked without spatial drift. Sensory economy matches the POV—she notes “fading light” and “ground resonated” while guards approach, not tourist vistas.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—decoding the tile before guards return—tightens once when shadows reveal terrestrial coordinates, foreclosing any alternative interpretation path. Cost is visible: she spends last savings, risks arrest, exhausts herself digging by hand. Tension scales sentence-level (“footsteps echoed”) yet the off-stage “alignment in three days” functions as a ticking clock rather than an on-page threat, muting pressure. Escalation is coherent but single-cycle; no secondary reversal tests her resolve again.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Knowledge-as-devotion emerges organically from the tile, treatise, and her willingness to impecuniously dig, never lectured. The alignment’s 4000-year echo reprises “dusky harmony,” reweighting solitude into trans-millennial companionship without moralizing. The theme tolerates plausible counter-readings: is she a pilgrim or predator of the past? Final image—her packing tablets while planning translations—offers a quiet, non-literal answer to the covenant question.</comment>

<comment>Third-person close keeps perceptual signature astronomically precise: “star positions from a night four thousand years past.” Syntax tightens under pressure—“Working quickly… she pulled schematic representations”—then relaxes into lyric cadence at the dig. No dialogue to distort voice; internal diction stays within a field scientist’s lexicon. Filter verbs appear only twice and serve rhythmic breath, not distancing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, high-density: each sentence advances knowledge, tool, or atmosphere; no paraphrase loops detected. Figurative language is sparse and accurate (“dusky harmony,” “bridge across millennia”). Opening and closing lines anchor and resolve via image, not abstraction. Minor scaffold: the phrase “encrypted devotion” is repeated twice; while purposeful, it edges toward template cadence but does not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Magic-square-as-star-map is a fresh twist on archaeo-astronomy tales; coupling it with poverty-struck modern observer deepens irony. The Babylonian observatory reimagined as underfunded museum grounds the speculative frame in geopolitical reality. Risk is moderate—lyric historiography rather than thriller—but the payoff justifies the choice. Concept feels particular, not a reskinned template; removal would collapse the entire arc.</comment>
