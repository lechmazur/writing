<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Kael’s “serene anger” is embodied in micro-choices—halting the drone, letting ink patterns finish before cuffing Vera—so the trait drives visible trade-offs. The interior contradiction between justice and curiosity is dramatized, not labeled, and the final endurance (taking her in while still seeing the patterns) costs him the clean moral exit he could have claimed. Flaw: we never learn why the albino condition matters beyond sun glare; a single sentence of practical constraint would push this to 8+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each breadcrumb of ink tightens Kael’s options until the cave standoff. The closure is a Charged Poise—he radios “target acquired” but only after paying the price of watching the ephemeral map complete—so the rule-set is repriced: justice now includes the knowledge Vera gave him. No orientation debt; place-time-anchor arrives by line 3. Minor slack: the thesis line “Time fractures where attention crystallizes” is the only overt statement; if it had been buried in gesture this would hit 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Wind-carved sandstone and drone-metal glints are filtered through Kael’s predator eye; the environment literally lets Vera carve her message and lets Kael read it, so setting constrains tactics. Micro-setting win: the half-faded ink on stone is a clock and a map simultaneously. The cave’s air current that finishes the spiral is the same current that will erase it—an environmental lever that charges the final image. Sunlight as judgment is slightly overt; one more tactile stab of heat on albino skin would edge this to 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—bring in the killer—tightens when Kael chooses to let the ink pattern complete before arresting her; that micro-delay is the visible price under causal lens. Escalation is ink-driven: each dissolving message deletes an escape route for both hunter and quarry. No external coincidence; pressure is internal—his expanding consciousness is the very thing that prevents a clean collar. Cost is legible: he delivers Vera but carries her temporal insight forward, foreclosing his former absolutism.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through pattern, not lecture: ephemeral ink = ephemeral perception = the price of full attention. Final image reweights the chase: justice is no longer a binary delivery but a moment stretched until it hurts. Avoids moral arithmetic; Kael neither forgives nor absolves, he simply sees more now. The refrain “time slows in crisis” could feel slogan-ish, but it’s earned because the story has literally enacted it in the reader’s elapsed reading time.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-limited stays tightly chained to Kael’s predator sensorium; drone’s metallic whir, ink’s wet mineral smell, sandstone’s dust on tongue. Syntax lengthens during the spiral gaze, compressing again when he speaks into comm—rhythmic mimicry of stretch/contract. No head-hop; Vera’s interior is inferred only through Kael’s reading of her stillness. One register slip: “temporal perception during crisis moments” sounds white-paper; swap for Kael’s lived idiom to touch 8+.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentences carry double duty: “wind had carved elaborate patterns into scattered sand” simultaneously anchors setting and foreshadows ink technique. No paraphrase loops; each descriptive stroke advances either map or mood. Metaphor density peaks only in the final cave spiral where it is justified by the concept. Proofing clean; pronoun chain never snags across Kael/drone/Vera triangulation. Final line—“both of them disappearing into the wind-carved landscape”—threads the diction back to opening, giving circular muscle without template cadence.</comment>

<comment>Fugitive physicist using vanishing ink to teach expanded consciousness via a sun-allergic tracker is fresh synthesis, not stock cyber-western. Risk: turning “time slows in crisis” from cliché into dramatized experience succeeds; reader feels elongation through ink-decoder process. Drone-as-hummingbird avoids gadget porn by being overruled by human perception. Could push further if albino trait had bled into metaphor—skin that burns in daylight chasing woman who burns daylight onto stone.</comment>
