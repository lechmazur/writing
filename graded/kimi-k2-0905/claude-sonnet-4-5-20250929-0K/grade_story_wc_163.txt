<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Senna’s longing for “the rhythm of belonging” is stated early and re-iterated, but the interior contradiction between exile-as-home and scientific detachment is asserted rather than dramatized in micro-choice until the final suit-diagnostics beat. The burnt-feather cue supplies a tactile obsession, yet her emotional reaction stays at a single register of wonder, never complicating under rising pressure. The closing decision to exit the dome is credible, but the cost (career, safety, identity) is named only as abstract “transformation,” not felt in body or future consequence.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the city is alive and conversation is possible, re-weighting the entire research premise. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern recognition thickens until the “fireflies” image crystallizes the new frame. Causality is soft (no hard sequence from data to proof) but coherent under the lyric-drive contract established by the singed-feather omen. Cost is present but diffuse: the unwritten rule that to “join” means evacuation from objective study is implied, not sharpened on the page.</comment>

<comment>The curved water of the dome, eddying feather, and breathing spires create a tactile, viscous environment that constrains vision and movement; the facility’s “pressurized warren” later justifies the donning of suits. Sensory selection favors visual luminosity, but the omission of sound or pressure on skin under-utilizes the underwater premise at key beats. Spatial choreography is clean: feather, window, monitors, doorway, suits track without drift. The final image of swimming fireflies re-uses the water medium to charge the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prove the city’s responsiveness before shutdown—arrives late but governs the last two-thirds. Escalation is textural: each new glow or gravitational-wave insight thickens pattern density rather than narrowing external options. The sunrise deadline supplies a live clock, but the protagonists’ tactics (more data, then suit-up) do not visibly foreclose safer alternatives; risk is asserted, not dramatized. Cost is conceptual—abandoning observer safety—yet remains off-page, lowering top-band eligibility.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of belonging-through-immersion emerges organically from the city’s dialogic architecture and Senna’s surface exile; no explicit thesis is declared. The burnt feather and bioluminescent “fireflies” form a quiet motif of fragile messengers, re-weighted when the researchers choose to answer rather than record. Final image invites reflection on scientific objectivity versus participatory knowledge without moralizing. Ambiguity is purposeful: we do not know if the city welcomes or consumes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Third-limited stays tightly anchored to Senna’s perceptual filter: astronomical lexicon, landscape-astrologer metaphors, and a measured, slightly elegiac cadence. No head-hopping; Mara’s interior is withheld, status legible through gesture and dialogue indirection. Syntax lengthens under wonder, shortens during diagnostics, mirroring emotional tempo. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing,” “gravitational waves”) fits the POV’s academic background without drifting into jargon for its own sake.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, with high information density: one sentence often delivers setting, character beat, and world rule. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; metaphors stay coherent (“city… learning to dance”). Minor over-packaging in places (“shadowseam wonder,” “communion ending”) but artifacts do not obscure causality or dull the final image. Dialogue tags and attribution are clean; paragraphing breathes with scene rhythm.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The drowned city that anticipates starlight via gravitational waves feels fresh, marrying astrophysics with bioluminescent urban organism. The burnt-feather omen and thumb-sized translucent citizens are specific, not generic oceanic tropes. Risk is taken with the lyric, accumulative structure rather than a thriller arc; the wager pays off in a resonant closing image. Slight deduction for the “research station shutdown for impractical research” device, a near-stock science-fiction trigger.</comment>
