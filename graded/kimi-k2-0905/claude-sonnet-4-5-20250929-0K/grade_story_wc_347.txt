<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maren’s reluctant-caretaker motive is vivid early (“duty she’d never wanted”) and her micro-choices under bird-threat show credible endurance. Interiority clings to orchard imagery, but the decisive turn—accepting the gift—relies on a single lyrical line rather than a dramatized cost. Still, the hierarchy of values (strangers’ lives > her freedom) is legible and earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: spatial orientation (“gnarled tree… cliffside labyrinth”) is anchored within 40 words; causality is pattern-assembly rather than event-chain. Closure is a Charged Poise—the nut held to stars—reweighting inheritance from curse to gift; the price (perpetual service) is felt without exposition. One transition (sunset-to-frost) is clean; no retroactive knowledge.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The orchard’s compass-trees, bronze birds, and frost-crystal environment directly constrain every tactical move; the nut’s shadow-angle literally chooses the exit path. Sensory hierarchy obeys Maren’s trained eye—she sees 47.3° before dusk—keeping description purposive. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from canyon rim to cliff-edge exit.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“guide strangers before frost/birds kill them”—tightens via visible frost creep and audible wing-beats. One meaningful deepening: the second nut drops mid-flight, forcing recalculation under literal countdown. Price is legible: perpetual bond to the orchard, accepted in the final image.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges as inheritance transformed into chosen service; “graceless beauty” reframes from oxymoron to ethic. Subtext sits in the engineer’s failure vs. Maren’s success, but the uncle’s motives remain off-page, muting full irony. Final image avoids moralizing, letting nut-star alignment resonate.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays inside Maren’s perceptual filter—she deciphers bark-as-compass while others panic. Diction is lean, orchard-poetic (“rough as grief”) without purple drift; rhythm accelerates under bird-clicks and frost-creep. No head-hopping; dialogue is minimal but goal-driven (“Follow me”).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Varied sentence lengths mirror maze switchbacks; no template cadence or synonym loops. Metaphors stay physical—“mechanisms clicking like bones” sharpens threat. One near-filter stack (“She heard voices then, distant and panicked”) is voice-motivated urgency, not scaffold. Clean proofing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Familiar tropes—cursed inheritance, clockwork predators—are re-engineered via living cartography: trees planted as blueprint. The nut-as-key concept feels inevitable yet fresh, integrating navigation, memory, and legacy. Risk-taking (no antagonist beyond environment) is justified by coherent closure.</comment>
