<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Chen’s interior contradiction—scientist vs witness—peaks when he places the sand grain among the flowers; the embodied tremor and tear-streaked shutter-click give visible cost. Motivation stays rooted in inherited custodial duty, but the epiphany (“what we witness, we carry forward”) is spoon-fed via microscopic text rather than dramatized choice, blunting full earn. Still, the renunciation of pure documentation for memorial testimony cleanly forecloses his prior detachment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: hourglass grain → revealed inscription → re-framed goal → chemical timer → simultaneous collapse/photo. Closure (Charged Poise) lands in the crystallized frame where grain + flowers + dust are super-imposed; cost is legible in the irreversible loss of mountain and species. Orientation clean by line 3; single transition (safe-zone retreat) is legible. Minor slack: ninety-minute countdown declared but not exploited to tighten beats.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Summit crater micro-setting constrains every move—tripod placement, vial angles, retreat route. Moonlit pallor and windless silence are filtered through Chen’s mineralogical eye; luminescent blooms provide tactile contrast that charges the final photochemical burn. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from crater center to safe ridge. Environment literally collapses into the image, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve final living image—tightens once: from detached documentation to sacrificial witness. The irreversible demolition clock provides coherent external pressure; internal pressure spikes when inscription reframes his role. Cost is visible in the extinction of flowers and the sand grain’s surrender to dust. Could use one intermediate complication (tool failure?) to push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges inductively from the triad: scars, blooms, and microscopic testament—no overt thesis. Final image reweights “progress” as an unpayable debt carried forward by the viewer, not the corporation. Avoids sentimental ecology sermon; ambiguity lingers in who will actually see the photo. Insight feels earned because it grows from Chen’s tactile arranging of vials and grain, not abstract assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays strictly inside Chen’s perceptual band—geological diction, chemical precision, tremor in palms. Rhythm breathes with scene: long clauses for calm setup, staccato pre-detonation. No dialogue, so voice must carry scientific melancholy alone; it does. Filter verbs appear but are voice-motivated (“he noticed,” “he read”) and paid off by immediate micro-choice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>High information density: each sentence layers technical detail, memory, and emotional charge. Figurative “cathedral of stone” and “phantom breeze” are sparing, appropriate to lyric mode. One template cadence (“Chen…Chen…Chen…”) in final paragraph flirts with monotony but aligns with countdown tension. Zero paraphrase loops; closure line lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Fusion of photochemical timer + extinct moonflowers + heirloom sand grain gives fresh inflection to eco-elegy trope. Concept of “testimony through chemistry” is novel and integral to climax. Risk-taking modest but coherent; no gimmicks. Could push further if corporate antagonist or colonial valley history were complicit on-page rather than backdrop.</comment>
