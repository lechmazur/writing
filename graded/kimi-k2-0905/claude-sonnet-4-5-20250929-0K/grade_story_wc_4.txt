<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Margot’s calm curator persona is consistent, yet her interior contradiction—belief in communal healing vs. private solitude—never sharpens into a scene-level choice that costs her anything; she facilitates but is not tested. The townspeople remain typed by loss (widow, bankrupt, anxious teen) rather than given individual micro-conflicts that collide under pressure. Because no one’s flaw complicates the drawing exercise, the “earned” collective shift feels administered, not struggled through.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the completed arcs become a communal archive whose cost is the visible surrender of private grief to shared imagination—“reluctant to leave this place where broken things bloomed.” The causal chain is thin—Margot’s invitation directly causes the drawing—but the accumulative pattern (each layered sketch tightens the stake) holds. Orientation is clear by word 80; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The lavender/metal juxtaposition is tactile and purposeful: purple scent softens rusted edges, guiding the townspeople’s willingness to stay. The factory door-table and vines-as-arches evolve from backdrop to active symbol, constraining where they can draw and what can be built. Micro-setting (dove-gray case, photographs) functions as portable altar, charging the final archival act.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can grief be turned into shared future images?—is signaled early. Pressure escalates accumulatively: each added sketch narrows the possibility of private retreat, but no individual faces a fork where completion costs them a concrete forfeiture. The tightening is collective, not personal; hence cost is diffuse, legible but not acute.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the arc-completions: communal imagination reclaims ruin without denying it. Subtext resides in silence—no one names the factory accident, yet it haunts every bridge drawn. Final image of “purple dusk” reweights the opening rust into possibility without moralizing. Avoids explicit thesis, though “human hearts deserve patient reclamation” flirts with statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-limited stays locked to Margot; perceptual signature filters world through curatorial metaphors—“like a prayer,” “archivist of subtle puzzles.” Syntax is controlled, rhythmic, slightly elevated, matching her vocation. No head-hopping; dialogue minimal but distinct in hesitancy vs. her inviting cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical yet propulsive; figurative layering (lavender sea, broken teeth) is selective, never clogging a single beat. One scaffold loop: “arcs” reiterated in adjacent sentences mid-story. No mixed metaphors; tense stable. Final paragraph breathes, mirroring release.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Healing-through-incomplete-photographs is fresh, avoiding workshop cliché. The rusted factory reclaimed by lavender supplies a specific, non-portable setting that roots the concept. Risk is quiet—no villain, no twist—yet specificity of communal sketching keeps it from generic “art saves” template.</comment>
