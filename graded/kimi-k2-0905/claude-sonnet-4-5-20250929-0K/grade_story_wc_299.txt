<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Marcus’s contradictory impulses—technical fact-drill vs. gut feel—are dramatized in the bottle-test micro-choice; the renunciation of “confidently uncertain” lands as earned cost. Interiority stays concrete (“hands trembled,” “glass showed irregular bubbles”) and avoids label-speak. Flaw drives mistake and later tactics; the grille-cloth emblem carries his blind-spot without overt symbolic nudging. Sarah functions mainly as prompt-delivery, so relationship crucible is thin; single-POV depth is strong.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: Marcus abandons fact-armor for felt judgment, cost visible in “might sustain him through the silence ahead.” Causal linkage holds: Ming mis-ID → reputation collapse → bottle doubt → stance flip. Orientation anchored by word 80; no teleporting props. One reflective block (~18%) is tethered to present objects and alters immediate tactic, satisfying BRR. No lens ambiguity; situational pressure tightens to crystallization.</comment>

<comment>Quarry trailer, limestone dust, and rust-holed cloth create micro-setting that constrains the final stance—he’s literally inside the ruins of certitude. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: acoustic memories attuned to “roar after applause,” tactile glass bubbles. Spatial choreography is tight: crate on desk, cloth above, draft moves cloth during decision beat. Objects (crate, bottles, cloth) evolve states and charge the closing image; environment earns 9-band gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—recovering epistemic authority—surfaces early and tightens through bottle test; the Ming failure supplies persistent constraint shaping tactics (refuse quick guess). Escalation is one meaningful deepening: shift from factual recital to felt verdict; pressure coherent under situational lens. Cost is legible: he forsakes former identity shield, embracing risk of being wrong again. No reversible reversals, but single turn suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of “after-applause” solitude emerges through image chain—cloth as prayer flag, silence of roadie labor—never sermonized. Subtext in Sarah’s impatient foot-tap and Marcus’s glass-tilt conveys stakes without theme labels. Final image reweights earlier motif: grille-cloth sway now signals quiet persistence, not lost glory. Avoids tidy moral; ambiguity lingers on future failure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-close focalization maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is audiophile-tinged (“feedback loops,” “soldering cable”). Free indirect slides cleanly into “confidently uncertain” coinage without register drift. Sentence rhythm mirrors emotional cadence—long reflective sentences broken by tactile micro-beats. No dialogue contamination; Sarah’s terse legalese contrasts Marcus’s interior sonics. Patterned elision (absent crowd, absent stage) taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; no template cadence or synonym loops. Information density high: single sentence packs saw-mark dating, nail alloy, emotional tremor. Metaphors (“prayer flag for everything he’d lost”) are sparse, precise, non-contradictory. No scaffold; paragraph cut test passes—removing any graph erodes knowledge or charge. Minor filter verbs (“he began”) are voice-motivated and spaced.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—ex-roadie antiques expert—offers fresh occupational hybrid; detail feels lived-in (stack blow-out, Stuttgart flea). Transformation test fails if relocated to generic career-change; specificity of rock tech meets appraisal science gives lift. Risk taken in quiet lyric ending rather than plot twist; payoff coherent. Could use one more non-obvious inflection to breach 8.5.</comment>
