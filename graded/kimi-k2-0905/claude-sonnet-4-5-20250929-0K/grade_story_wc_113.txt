<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Marta’s interior contradictions (curiosity vs. fear of trespass) are alive in every micro-choice—wading deeper, photographing the program, whispering “I heard you.” The endurance of staying night after night in chest-deep water shows visible cost. No other character exerts pressure, so status crucible is N/A; the solo arc is tight and earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Marta’s whisper and the lanterns’ calm dimming crystallize her new, irreversible role as Constance’s witness. Causal chain holds—each musical note tests the ghost, the program’s stains literally lift into the word TELL, forcing the photo and the vow. One minor scaffold: “water-damaged program showed a pattern” is summary; a 0.1 dock keeps it sub-9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Flooded pit, waist-deep water, lantern-lit balconies are re-used, not catalogued—each new mention tightens acoustics, footing, or visibility. The cello’s C-string resonance through water is a micro-setting tool that constrains tempo and signals the ghost. Final image—the program flat on the stage with water-written text—reweights the object and the house. Spatial choreography is flawless; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—justice for Constance—is signaled by the second paragraph and tightens when Moretti’s name surfaces. Marta’s agency drives every beat: play-note, photograph, stage-placement; no coincidence resolves. Cost is visible: she stands in soaked clothes, publicly risks ridicule tomorrow, and accepts the ghost’s charge. One tightening is sufficient; no escalation slip.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the duet of sound and silence—music as testimony for the drowned voice. Subtext lives in lantern grammar: flicker = doubt, steady = verdict. No moralizing; the final “I heard you” is action, not thesis. The code-as-music motif reweights at closure when notes become legal evidence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays pinned to Marta’s perceptions: acoustics through water, ink blooming like rests, her cold knees. Syntax lengthens during bow strokes, tightens into fragments when she spots Moretti. No dialogue; therefore voice contamination risk is zero. The perceptual signature—sound as legal testimony—carries to the last sentence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes: long sentence for Pachelbel, staccato fragments for the reveal. No mixed metaphors; “lanterns…orchestra of light” is single sustained image. One paraphrase loop—“water lapping at the third rung…water lapping at her waist” (adjacent paragraphs) −0.2. Otherwise high density; every clause adds sensory or causal data.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Ghost-as-forensic-musician is fresh; the flood becomes acoustic darkroom for 70-year-old evidence. Conductor-portrait trope is inverted—celebrated maestro = murderer. Risk in merging legal thriller with lyric ghost story pays off because causality is musical, not bureaucratic. Specificity of opera-house acoustics keeps it from feeling grafted.</comment>
