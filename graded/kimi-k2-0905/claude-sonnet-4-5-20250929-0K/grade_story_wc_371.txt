<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira’s interior contradiction—grief for the erased city versus her hunger to keep witnessing—drives every beat; the pocketed seeds embody a renunciation that costs her the safety of pure observer. The old woman’s gentleness is shown via the tea ritual, not labeled, and her archival loss is anchored to present action (the bread she recognizes). Micro-choices—handing over the loaf, accepting seeds—reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Only the closing “absolution” line drifts toward diagnostic summary, a hairline slip that keeps it from 9.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the piece layers vanishings and guerrilla gardens until the final image reweights the premise: remembering can be an act of planting. Closure is a Charged Poise—seeds in pocket, city still forgetting—whose conceptual cost (she must now risk failure in public acts) is undeniable. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3 and hold. Causality is lyric rather than plot-driven, permissible under the chosen lens; each new garden is a because/therefore response to loss.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The tea house itself—glass walls, mismatched cups—constrains the negotiation of memory versus transformation; its liminal architecture forces intimacy and confession. The overgrown courtyard supplies the living proof of the old woman’s philosophy, charging Mira’s final choice. Sensory hierarchy stays tight: warm bread scent in November, goldfinches improbably present, wisteria shoulder-high—each detail filtered through Mira’s skeptical botanist eye. Spatial choreography is clean; the women never occupy impossible positions relative to table, doors, or birds.</comment>
<question>4</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—how to respond to a city that deletes itself—tightens when Mira realizes documentation alone is complicit stasis. The sunflower seeds foreclose that option, forcing her toward public, vulnerable action. Cost is legible: she leaves the sanctuary of secrecy and accepts the risk that her plantings may be paved over or ignored. Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the pattern break (from recording to cultivating) is the requisite intensification.</comment>
<question>5</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the concrete paradox: absence can seed presence if someone risks planting. Subtext lives in gestures—bread broken, tea poured—rather than exposition. The ending’s resonant answer is the image of seeds in a pocket, not a moral; it reweights every prior vanishing as potential ground. No thematic echo sentence mars the finale; the insight stays embodied.</comment>
<question>6</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited clings tightly to Mira’s perceptual signature: she catalogs plants, notices contradictions, distrusts easy gentleness. Syntax mirrors her halt-and-start mindset—short clauses when confronting loss, longer lyrical flows when imagining growth. No head-hopping; the old woman’s interior is accessed only through external cues. The prose’s rhythmic control peaks in the final paragraph where sentence length mirrors the forward-motion of walking back into the forgetting city.</comment>
<question>7</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or synonym churn; each image advances either atmosphere or causality. Figurative language is spare and precise—“vines claiming marble columns like patient conquerors” grounds the political in the botanical. High information density: a single sentence slips time (“impossibly present after migration”), stakes, and sensory hit. No filter-verb stacks; verbs stay strong (“pushed,” “broke,” “pocketed”) and keep momentum through the closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The vanished-city premise is familiar, but the inverse response—guerrilla gardening as memory—feels fresh and non-obvious. Risk is taken: the quiet ending refuses a set-piece confrontation, trusting image over plot twist. Specificity of plant species and bakery nostalgia roots the concept in lived detail rather than abstract dystopia. Transformation test passes: swap botanist for any other observer and the whole emotional calculus collapses.</comment>
