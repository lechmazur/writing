<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mara’s isolation and “perpetually surprised” brows read as a lived tic; her reflex drone-launch shows embodied competence. The pilgrim is sketched only as reverent courier, so relationship crucible is thin. Closure choice—“She would bring it home”—is earned by her prior pattern of outsider-scanning, cost felt in the solitary night ahead.</comment>

<comment>Causal chain is crisp: pilgrim arrives → chip handed → star-trails map → drones launched → closure vow. Orientation clean by line 50. Closure is a Charged Poise: mission crystallizes with implied lifelong cost of global scavenger hunt. Lens holds as Causal; no late ambiguity.</comment>

<comment>Observatory dome cracks and amber sunset provide immediate tactile anchor; drone console and brass chip handled with tactile specificity. Micro-setting of the chip-as-constellation cleverly fuses body/tool/environment. Final image of pulsing star trails reuses dome aperture, charging closure. Could use one non-visual sense to hit 8.5+.</comment>

<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“will she ever belong?”—is signaled early and tightened when chip reveals her life’s quest is now literal roadmap. Escalation occurs once: abstract loneliness becomes concrete seventeen-site quest. Cost legible: open-ended exile prolonged, sleep sacrificed tonight. Agency is accept/launch, not yet a hard irreversible loss, so peak pressure modest.</comment>

<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of fragmented belonging emerges through chip cartography and star trails, never sloganized. Pilgrim’s line “people feared connection more than isolation” could feel explain-y but is brief and motivates split. Final image reweights earlier isolation as purposeful exile in service of reassembly—earned resonance without moralizing.</comment>

<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Third-close hovers at intimate distance; perceptual signature sharp—Mara notices light spectra, electromagnetic pings, micro-gestures. Diction stays technical yet wistful (“frequency of belonging”). No head-hop; pilgrim’s speech idiomatically spare. Rhythm modulates: longer lyrical sentences at twilight, clipped tech phrases when drones launch. Minor filter-verb cluster (“she realized with a start”) but not in peak beat.</comment>

<comment>Prose is lean, high-density; metaphors are controlled (“circuit pathways etched…like constellations”) and paid off. No synonym loops or template cadence. Sentence rhythm varies; opening and closing lines carry punch. One small scaffold: “But this one had been modified…” adds little new data. Otherwise clean, propulsive, read-aloud ready.</comment>

<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Core premise—seventeen scattered typographic chips encode cosmic belonging frequency—is fresh graft of analog craft onto SF pastoral. Star-trail drone navigation feels novel and specific to Mara’s skillset. Less transformative: lone seeker handed map by mysterious pilgrim is familiar quest frame. Still, synthesis of print heritage + cyber-astral cartography gives distinct cultural scent.</comment>
