<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Marcus’s lock-trained fingers and “question that needed answering” give a crisp, idiosyncratic drive; his solitary fixation stays credibly obsessive, and the final choice to share the echo-harvest costs him his outsider status. Interiority is concrete (“pulse quicken,” “muttered, adjusting a hairspring”) rather than diagnostic. The only thinning is that the blight and survivor politics are felt off-page—his isolation is asserted more than tested—so the felt cost is aesthetic rather than visceral. Still, within the lyric design his renunciation of practicality for wonder reads as earned stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the timer’s first tick reconfigures the group’s emotional options and crystallises Marcus’s purpose. Causal chain is tight—angle-study → gear-rebuild → public reveal—each step because/therefore. Orientation is clean by line 5 (“marble cavern,” “eastern passage”) and the lens (Causal) holds to the final image. Cost is palpable in the moment the survivors’ faces light up: Marcus gifts away his private obsession, foreclosing lone ownership of meaning.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marble is handled as both mirror and archive: its “polished finish” guides Marcus’s measuring ritual and ultimately supplies the reflective canvas for the climax. Sensory selection is urgent—torch smoke, brass corrosion, moonlit channels—never tourist catalog. Micro-setting (the cavern’s geometric centre) literally dictates where the timer must be placed for the echo-bloom, so environment constrains tactics. One slip: the “underground streams still run clean” is told once and never used again, a missed opportunity to let water reflection double the motif.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will wonder survive the winter?”—is signalled early and tightens when Marcus decides to spend scarce metal and hours on “impractical work.” Agency is continuous: every mapping session and filed gear narrows his margin of error and risks community scorn. The single reversal is the public reveal: he trades private mastery for collective hope, paying with loss of sole authorship. Cost is visible but low-grade (no hunger or injury), keeping the score shy of 9.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</question><grade><comment>Theme emerges from the timer’s resurrection: memory as communal resource against despair. No moral is stated; the final image of light on strangers’ faces re-prices the premise that utility is the only currency of survival. Subtext hums in gesture—Marcus wiping brass grime before calling the others shows he already knows the cost. The piece risks but avoids sentimentality by keeping the survivors silent, their wet eyes speaking the theme without articulating it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person voice keeps a calm, slightly archaic cadence (“wounded season,” “temporal echoes”) that suits the mythic register without purple swell. Perceptual signature is lock-smith precise: gears “frozen mid-rotation,” springs “burst from corrosion.” Compression is purposeful—elided weeks collapse into ritual beats. No dialogue means no voice convergence risk; narrative diction stays consistent and propulsive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rhythmic control is excellent: long sentences for lull, staccato “ticked. Clicked. Began.” for climax. Information density high—one sentence often layers motive, sensory detail, and world rule (“Using scraps…teaching himself the language of springs”). No loops or mixed metaphors; figurative language is spare (“reflections bloomed like flowers”) and immediately grounded in physical logic. Minor scaffolding in repeated “he saw” anaphora during echo roll-call, but it serves ceremonial cadence rather than clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The “harvest of echoes” concept transforms the familiar “survivors-in-cave” template into a metaphysical engineering problem; the timer-as-memory-thresher feels inevitable yet fresh. Specificity of locksmith craft and astronomical reflection angles anchors the wonder in verifiable detail. Risk is taken and paid off: the story bets everything on a quiet luminous reveal rather than peril action. The synthesis of horology, archaeology, and communal psychology is non-obvious and memorable.</comment>
