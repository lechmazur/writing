<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is vivid—“knot in her chest” and the imperative to “keep building” dramatize her motive under pressure. Contradictory impulses (grief vs. making) stay entwined in-scene, visible in micro-choices: selecting perishable hemp, placing the moth wing, accepting the tower’s collapse. No second character means no status crucible, but that default is waived. Closure—her benediction touch—costs her a foreclosed future of building, earned by prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the final monarch landing on her shoulder reweights the rule-set—ephemeral witness is enough. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of butterflies + dissolving tower make the cost legible without exposition. Persistent constraint (season-long lifespan) shapes every knot. Orientation anchors by line 4; no teleporting props; one legible transition (sunset → darkness).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is micro-constraint: altitude-defiant grotto dictates perishable bamboo and catches the monarch updraft. Tower, moth wing, and body function as tools whose physical limits shape tactics. Selective sensory triad—silver scales, blushing light, cool air—economy without checklist. Spatial choreography stays clean as Mira “adjusts another joint” while butterflies spiral in.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—bear witness to ending migrations—signals early and tightens when the last monarchs arrive. One meaningful deepening: arrival shifts her from solitary builder to acknowledged witness; options narrow—no future migrations to honor. Agency is attention/renunciation rather than external victory; cost is the tower’s scheduled death. No artificial coincidences; luck complicates by bringing butterflies but does not resolve tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from pattern: temporary structures = ethical refusal to own memory. Subtext lives in gestures (touching glass = benediction) rather than thesis lines. Final image reweights premise: vanishing is the monument. No moralizing, only charged ambiguity—some truths “live best in structures designed to vanish.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Mira’s perceptual filter—“esoteric realist” diction never leaks into writerly over-explanation. Syntax mirrors ascent: elongated sentences climb, then fracture into single-line breaths under butterfly arrival. No dialogue, so voice carries all subtext. Purposeful repetition (“someone noticed…someone remembered”) taught early and paid off in final benediction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is artifact-free: no loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. “Blushing stillness” compresses color + silence into one charged noun phrase; “question mark” tower balances whimsy and threat without overwriting. Sentence rhythm accelerates at arrival, then settles into hush—propulsion matches emotional curve. High density: single clauses often handle image, motion, and theme simultaneously.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise—ephemeral monuments for overlooked extinctions—is fresh synthesis; execution grounds it in tactile knot-tying and butterfly weight. Risky choice to make climax a quiet resting scene pays off via Conceptual Repricing. “Interrupted cadence” musical metaphor becomes structural DNA rather than ornament. Specificity (Actias luna, hemp rope math) blocks generic swap-out.</comment>
