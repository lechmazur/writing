<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is concrete—her deliberate stop-listening habit, the trembling hand with the pen—but the final shift into “language beyond sound” is asserted, not dramatized with visible cost; the embrace feels frictionless. Dmitri stays largely off-page, so the relationship crucible is one-sided; his doodles are effective proxies for desire, yet the earned mutuality lands as a soft given rather than a staked choice. Still, her micro-choice to slide the ticket under the door is specific and irreversible, carrying enough charge to clear the 8-band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the lens set aside, hands taken, silence chosen—cost is the foreclosed safety of cryptic distance. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each doodle, overheard shard, and prismatic refraction layers density until the final image reweights the premise. The single-scene orientation is anchored by line 3; no orientation debt. One minor scaffold: “the resonant hush” is used twice in the last paragraph—does not blur the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The crystal forecourt is not postcard scenery—its acoustic leakiness literally feeds the plot by delivering Dmitri’s confession to Mira. Rain, lamplight, and wet stone return as tactile gauges of emotional exposure. The projector lens acts as micro-setting: handled, rotated, magnified, then set aside—its final refusal charges the closing image. Spatial choreography is immaculate; bodies and objects stay tracked across the forecourt, archives, and booth threshold.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will Mira keep listening from safety or step into reciprocal risk—surfaces early and tightens once: the ticket she draws is a visible forfeiture of her anonymity. Pressure is textural: each overheard sentence and refracted doodle adds weight rather than new turns; the lens’s heaviest moment is sufficient escalation. Cost is legible: the loss of her invisibility cloak (she can no longer claim accidental ignorance). No coincidence resolves; the final hand-taking is agency-based.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the impossibility of remaining a neutral registrar of other people’s emotions—transparency becomes a mutual obligation. Subtext operates in the doodle-images and in the parenthetical heart-equation, never translated into moral. The closing silence reconfigures the opening “whispering” motif: secrets cease when ownership is shared. One soft spot: the “language beyond sound” tag edges toward thesis-statement, slightly diluting the resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Mira’s perceptual filter: rainbows caught in glass, the unexpected weight of a circle of glass, the sudden clarity that the doodles are addressed to her. Syntax flexes with pressure—short clauses when she recognizes the voice, longer sinuous lines during reflection. No head-hopping; Dmitri’s interiority is inferred only through speech and gesture, preserving distance. The final “resonant hush” line risks poetic overlay but is earned by the acoustic motif established in paragraph 1.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical; no filler verbs or paraphrase loops. Figurative language is sparse and precise—“cage unlocking,” “door opening onto stars”—each metaphor pairs with a concrete action. Sentence rhythm modulates: staccato when she slides the ticket, open cadence for the final image. One microscopic scaffold: “the resonant hush of shared understanding” repeats the noun phrase from earlier; trimming one instance would sharpen the cadence yet does not mar the closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The overheard-confession-acoustic-wonder premise is fresh, but the doodle-code device owes obvious debt to epistolary romance; the transformation lies in the projection-lens magnification beat, which justifies the reuse. Specificity of the concert-hall graveyard shift and the parenthetical heart equation lifts the piece above generic shy-lover trope. The crystalline whispering forecourt feels invented rather than borrowed, anchoring originality. Risk is moderate; reward is a quiet but memorable inversion of eavesdropping into mutual disclosure.</comment>
