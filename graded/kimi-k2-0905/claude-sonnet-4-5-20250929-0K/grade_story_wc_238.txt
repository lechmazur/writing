<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Margot’s contrition is embodied (gloved hand trembling on the perfume bottle) and her micro-choice to delete the article in real time gives the apology teeth; the because/therefore chain from cruel columnist → ghost-haunted → orchard exorcist is tight. Interior contradiction is alive when she admits she “meant it in her bones, not just her practiced voice.” Vivienne’s absence on-page keeps relationship crucible off the table, but the paper-vortex poltergeist supplies credible externalized pressure. Final endurance—choosing to carry the corrected story outward—costs her social rebirth, satisfying Earned Stasis.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the orchard’s out-of-season bloom reweights “imperfect miracles” with visible ecological cost under an Accumulative lens. Pattern is taught early—music sheets as emotional barometer—and the final image of petals “like forgiveness” crystallizes the reconfiguration. Causality holds: because Margot deletes and rewrites, the archive quiets and the orchard answers. Time compression (single night) is coherent; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sheet-archive micro-setting constrains every tactic: the scattered Chopin score becomes the weapon, the music stand the altar, the perfume bottle the conduit—objects wielded, not backdrop. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—Margot notices dust motes only when they catch the vortex’s light. Spatial choreography is clean: bottle placed → draft → pages lift → orchard visible through open door. Final image of white petals on grass re-uses the archive’s “white” motif, charging the outside world with inside meaning.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—deliver a lived apology—tightens when the vortex escalates from cold draft to paper storm; the cost (Margot’s public confession via phone deletion) is legible on page. One meaningful deepening: the shift from verbal apology to embodied rewriting. No external antagonist needed; Vivienne’s spectral pressure suffices. Luck never rescues; the orchard’s bloom is framed as response, not reward.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: archived art vs. living growth, cruelty vs. cultivation. Subtext lives in the perfume bottle—first a prop, then a conduit, finally an emptied relic—its jasmine trace implying forgiveness more than any apology could. Final image answers the core question: can words once frozen bloom again?—answered by literal blossoms. No sermonizing; the orchard sings instead of explaining.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet grounded in Margot’s ex-journalist perceptual signature—metaphors are precise (“emotional electricity, grief made tangible”). Syntax tightens under pressure: clauses shorten as the vortex rises. No dialogue, so register mismatch impossible. Free indirect style stays clean: “she’d learned to work through induced currents” is filtered via lived experience, not exposition. Final sentence—“Tonight, the orchard sang”—earns its poetic leap via prior music motif.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: long sentence opens, fragments spike during vortex. No loops; “paper” recurs but each use shifts state (dusty → airborne → shelved). Metaphors are coherent—river ice mirrors frozen reputation—without clutter. Opening line anchors voice and stakes in one breath. Final line is a taut cadence that re-prices “song” from metaphor to environmental fact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: gossip-exorcist who weaponizes metaphor, haunted sheet-archive as confessional, orchard execution as bloom-response. Risk of magical realism paid off by tight internal logic. Specificity—“Brahms mixed with Billie Holiday” chaos—prevents generic haunt. The overdue apology genre is inverted: the victim is absent, the archive is proxy, the restitution is public deletion plus natural miracle. Conceptual integrity holds: no retreat into safe realism.</comment>
