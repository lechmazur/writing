<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Mira’s vocational identity (fortunes) and her re-framing of it drive every beat; the “hollow ache,” mapped memories, and final transcription all manifest in concrete gestures. Interiority stays particular—no stock therapy-speak, yet the “chronological homesickness” label is kept too neat to breach 7.0. The renunciation (stop predicting, start translating) is legible but the felt physical cost is soft—no cramp, cold, or fatigue actually alters her next move. Still, contradictory impulses (duty to strangers vs hunger for cosmic listening) coil inside every spiral image, earning the high 6s.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: mirrored horizon → nautilus → invented notation; each layer adds density rather than causal turn, culminating in Charged Poise—she departs “ready to write fortunes that sang,” options re-priced, cost legible. Orientation clean by ¶3; one seamless timespan; no prop drift. The tightening is single but decisive: translation replaces prediction, foreclosing the old commercial self. Could top 8.5 if a sharper physical price (hand blood on page? ice burn?) had been foregrounded at the close.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Glass-spire observatory, frozen lake, pre-dawn color shifts, and nautilus tactile ridges all filter through Granddaughter-Mira’s ear-pressed childhood habit—details are selective, never scenic tourism. The mirrored horizon is not just spectacle; its dissolution triggers her conceptual shift, so setting actively charges closure. Spatial choreography holds across spiral staircase, uppermost chamber, window press. Micro-setting (shell segment as “score”) doubles as tool and motif, satisfying 9-gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake: restore meaning to her vocation. Pressure escalates texturally—each recalled star-song layer intensifies the ache until the mirrored horizon offers the pattern break. No external antagonist; the risk is lifelong emptiness, a high conceptual cost made visceral through sensory accumulation. Agency is present (she chooses transcription, descends to re-enter the world) but physical stakes stay mild; hence short of 8+ bands where a sharper forfeiture would be required.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</question><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: translation vs prediction, listening vs telling. No explicit sermon; the final “fortunes that sang” reweights prior reject pile without moralizing. Childhood star-music and spiral geometry provide concrete particulars; cosmic loneliness as vocational illness feels fresh. Ambiguity lingers—will cookie buyers actually hear songs?—inviting reflection. Slight softness: “chronological homesickness” is the one thematic echo that feels label-driven.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited clings tightly to Mira’s perceptual filter: wind frequency, glass cold, nautilus ridges. Diction stays within her lived lexicon—no academic register slips. Rhythm modulates: long accumulative sentences swell toward dawn mirror, then shorten into transcription frenzy. No dialogue, so voice distinctness judged via interior cadence and metaphor; the repeated spiral/echo imagery reads intentional, not monotonous template. Filter verbs appear but align with sensory noticing, not distancing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density: “translating cosmic radiation into musical notation” does world-building and character backstory in one stroke. Metaphors stay coherent (spire as finger, nautilus as score) and don’t clog the climax. Minor scaffold: “she remembered… she remembered” anaphora is purposeful, not loop. Clause variation good; no synonym churn. Copy clean. Final line lands by image, not explanation. No artifact touches closure; eligible for low 8s, not 9+, because two adjacent metaphors (“visual symphony,” “mathematical rhythm”) could have been pruned for even tighter cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fusing fortune-cookie hack work with cosmic listening is a fresh angle; transforming rejected fortunes into musical notation feels non-obvious and inevitable after the nautilus reveal. Grandfather-observatory backstory could be derivative but here is particularized through star-sheet manuscripts and child ear-to-glass. Mirrored horizon trope is familiar, yet its timed dissolution becomes the pattern break that spurs re-invention, so it earns its keep. Risk is emotional, not structural; originality lies in vocational metaphysics rather than plot surprise.</comment>
