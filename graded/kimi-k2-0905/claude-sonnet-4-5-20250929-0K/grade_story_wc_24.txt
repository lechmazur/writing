<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Maren’s interior contradiction—obedient technician vs. boundary-breaker—surfaces in the tactile decision to turn the key backward; the blood on the brass is a visible cost. Her competence and flaw (over-curiosity) are shown through micro-choices, not labels. The final Earned Stasis—she will keep pretending the world’s edge is fixed—carries credible psychological price. Only the absence of a second character keeps relationship crucible and status dynamics from testing her further.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: three seconds deleted/created, horizon re-sewn, Maren’s blood the tariff. Causal chain (clock lag → key turn → horizon flex → silence) holds; the mantle clock’s thirty-year wind is the single tolerated impossibility taught early. Orientation is clean within 120 words; no lens ambiguity. The missing −0.3 to reach 9.0: the deleted seconds’ social consequence is implied, not shown, so cost is felt but not yet persistent in tactics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The horizon scope, brass key, and mercury tubes function as micro-setting that literally constrain choice: the key’s razor teeth force blood, the mercury’s impossible climb proves time negotiable. Sensory hierarchy is filtered through Maren’s cartographer gaze—visual precision, chill metal, hammered-steel fjord—never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is immaculate: key out, turn, blood, horizon ripples. The station’s isolation and the fjord’s breath-hold charge the final image of the re-sewn seam.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve or breach temporal certainty—is signaled at the lag discovery. One meaningful tightening: counting backward narrows options to “delete seconds or stay ignorant.” The reversal is her active choice; luck only complicates via pre-existing clock anomaly. Cost is visible (blood, vanished seconds) but external stakes (Service logs, world order) remain off-page, capping escalation just below 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges: time is a negotiated seam, not a river. The reweighted horizon-as-seam reprises the opening “line so precise it could cut,” now read as mutable fabric. No moralizing; the silence after the bend carries conceptual cost. Subtext in the unmoving fjord and unused whistle implies complicity between shepherd and cosmos. Only the slight abstraction of “humanity’s desperate agreement” keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Maren’s perceptual signature—mercury levels, curvature math, razor teeth. Syntax lengthens under calm, shortens under stress (“Forty-seven, forty-six…”). No head-hopping; diction remains within cartographic lexicon. The final quiet sentence mirrors the opening cadence, proving rhythmic control. One hairline slip: “therapy-speak” echo in “she understood now why…” is mild enough to leave 9-band intact.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Figurative language is sparse, precise—“line so precise it could cut,” “hammered steel”—and never muddled. Information density high: one sentence often does setting, motion, and metaphor. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold. The single passive (“time could be shepherded”) is voice-motivated. Closure image remains crystal.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The hydraulic-clock-horizon seam is a fresh speculative frame; the backward-count as temporal negotiation feels non-obvious yet inevitable. Risk—rewinding time with a literal key—is committed to without safety hedging. Specificity of mercury climbing upward roots the concept in tactile consequence. No close genre echoes; the fusion of cartography and metaphysics is memorable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Setup: first paragraph establishes Maren as shepherd. Development: her decision to turn the key backward is the single decisive act. Payoff: final paragraph shows her continuing to shepherd the re-sewn seam. Cost: blood, erased seconds. Removing her occupation collapses the entire logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>9.5</grade>
<comment>Key appears early, bites on first touch, returns in the backward turn that deletes time, and ends stained with blood—charged reprise. Razor teeth enforce physical cost; keyhole orientation enables the reversal. Story fails without this exact object.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Razor edges first describe the horizon line, then manifest on the key’s teeth, finally reappear as the re-sewn seam—each iteration raises stakes. The concept shapes tactics: sharpness demands blood payment and signals time’s cut-ability.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Eminently peculiar is declared early, embodied in mercury defying gravity and a 30-year wind, and justifies Maren’s solitary post. Trait enables her to attempt the taboo reversal without external check. Slight abstraction keeps it from 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Squinting triggers the first anomaly notice and recurs at the end when she sees the seam; it is the perceptual cue that the horizon has bent. Action is small but irreplaceable—no squint, no discovery.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Counting backward is signaled at midpoint, executed beat-by-beat, and produces the vanished seconds—mechanic and consequence are inseparable. Method shapes pacing and mercury flow; removing it deletes the climax.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Station’s edge location supplies the horizon scope and isolation that permits the breach; mercury tubes and whistle are tools that enable the reversal. Setting constraints directly enable the central negotiation with time.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Blowing the whistle at noon sets the lag discovery in motion; the missing three seconds are measured against this signal. Timeframe tightens the story to one afternoon, but whistle itself does not recur to shape final tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Desire to “truly comprehend” is declared early, tested through the backward count, and paid for with blood and erased time. Motivation drives every subsequent choice; without it, no turn occurs.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Fjord quiet starts as atmospheric stasis, intensifies to breath-hold during the reversal, and settles into complicit silence at the end. Tone modulates with pressure and charges the final seam image.</comment>
