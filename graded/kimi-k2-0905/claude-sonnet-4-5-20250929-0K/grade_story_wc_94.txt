<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—angry yet still, silenced yet screaming—surfaces in embodied micro-choices (winding the timer, folding the poem). The renunciation of public voice for clandestine archive is earned; cost is felt when she seals the envelope destined for the timetable. Flaw is active: she risks capture with every drop. Voice stays idiosyncratic, never drifts into diagnostic jargon.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each 20-minute cycle layers density until the final poem-in-envelope crystallizes Charged Poise. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by line 4; transitions clear. Closure reweights silence into testimony with undeniable cost—“the archive they couldn’t erase.” One scaffold loop: “twenty minutes of…” trio teeters on template cadence but is pattern-taught early and pays off in final cadence, so waived.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Copper dome catching lightning, cloud-gap revealing the broken-promised city, timer’s metallic tick—each detail is filtered through Mara’s censored, altitude-seeking gaze. The storm constrains her ritual (writes only in flashes) and supplies the final image that recharges earlier lightning motif. Setting doubles as micro-tool: envelope slid into timetable becomes literal city map. No spatial float; bodies/props tracked cleanly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can testimony survive erasure—signals early and tightens as each vigil converts private rage into smuggled archive. Agency visible: she chooses to wedge poem despite risk; vigil rhythm itself is tactic under pressure. Cost accrues: each 20-minute interval forgoes sleep/safety. No coincidence; storm complicates but does not resolve. Escalation is accumulative deepening rather than causal reversal—sufficient for this lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: censored words = landmarks, disappeared people = canyons, protests = mountain ranges. Final image reweights silence itself into testimony without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture (folding poem) and object (timer as metronome of resistance). Ambiguity preserved: no guarantee the network will survive, yet the archive now exists with felt cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyric, compressed diction—“electrical veins split the sky,” “altitude and clarity”—matches poet-perceiver. Perceptual signature consistent: she reads silence like sailors read stars. No head-hops; single POV stable. Minor elevation toward closure (“storm-kissed wonder”) is earned by prior metaphor chain. Pattern-taught repetition of “twenty minutes” functions as liturgical cadence, not monotony.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High density: “censored poet learns to read silence the way sailors read stars” compresses backstory and metaphor in one stroke. Rhythm modulates—long sentences for cloud vistas, staccato fragments during lightning flashes. No synonym churn; “vigil,” “timer,” “archive” recur with purpose. One mixed metaphor: “cartography of scars” is abstract but rescued by concrete map/landmark extensions. Closure line crisp: “keeping vigil over the spaces between what was said and what was true.”</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Takes familiar dissident-poet trope but particularizes via timer ritual, stormlit observatory, and bus-timetable dead-drop. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight: altitude = rarefied truth, lightning = illumination under censorship. Risk in lyric accumulative structure pays off with coherent Charged Poise ending. Detail (“UNRELIABLE stamped across her face”) is fresh documentary touch. No derivative echo of famous resistance texts.</comment>
