<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Malik’s curator identity and twelve-year archive labor credibly anchor his leap to descend alone; the micro-choice to kneel and accept the lagoon’s visions shows embodied cost. Interiority stays concrete (“weight of every archive”) without therapy-speak. The shared-witness pact is earned because his entire vocation foreshadows it. Sarai’s flat diction (“Am I?”) and sudden full exposition slightly undercut her lived erosion, keeping this just below elite tier.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: Malik’s decision to look charges the ending with irrevocable cost—“he would not look away” crystallizes the covenant under Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation lands by ~100 words (zeppelin, dunes, diary). Causality is tight—diary → coordinates → descent → parley → transfer of memory burden. Only nudge: Sarai’s survival reveal is mildly convenient, not prefigured, but it complicates rather than solves, so lens holds.</comment>

<comment>Obsidian lagoon as micro-setting directly constrains the final choice—its black non-rippling surface is the literal medium of memory transfer. Zeppelin library offers charged specificity (“copper clouds,” “gondola weighted with volumes”) that mirrors archive theme. Idiom stays consistent, no anachronisms. Spatial choreography is crystal: rope ladder, dune crest, water’s edge, driftwood messages—every move tracked.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—truth vs. eternal entrapment—signaled in diary cipher and tightened when Sarai demands witness exchange. Agency rests in Malik’s kneel/look; it narrows his future to messenger fate and frees no one, visible cost on page. Pressure escalates accumulatively: each new artifact (driftwood words, bone fragments) thickens moral density rather than causal chain, fitting the lens. No reversal beyond the single parley, but that suffices for 600-word scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of bearing witness emerges through image and silence, never sermon: lagoon as mirror of memory, debris spelling WITNESS, final covenant without verbal summation. Subtext in Sarai’s bitter smile and Malik’s trembling hands carries the moral load. No late thesis statement; last line is imagistic. Complexity acknowledged—someone must stay, someone must speak—resisting tidy equivalence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Narrative voice carries curator precision—“cataloging testimonies of the silenced”—while sensory diction stays tactile (“sun-bleached bone,” “black waters”). Perceptual signature is consistent: Malik notices history-etched surfaces. Dialogue minimal but differentiated; Sarai’s clipped bitter lines contrast Malik’s hushed awe. No head-hopping; distance stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured: “zeppelin’s shadow sprawled across ribbed sand” performs three jobs—visual, tactile, symbolic. Rhythm accelerates into short sentences at the lagoon reveal, matching breathless dread. No loops, no mixed metaphors; each image extends the memory-mirror concept. Opening and closing lines are resonant bookends.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Memory-trap lagoon as mass-grave mirror feels fresh; combination of zeppelin archive + retrocognitive snare is unexpected yet internally logical. Debris-messaging device particularizes the premise. Familiar “journalist vanished” trope is reweighted by her voluntary anchor as guardian. Risky descent to desert lagoon pays off in charged closure image.</comment>
