<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The pianist’s interior contradiction—ritual grief versus the covert insurgency of splicing film—drives every beat; the twenty-year wound is embodied in the cracked keys and the nightly winding of the dead clock. Her micro-choices (threading the projector, hiding frames of her wedding inside celluloid) are precise, character-specific, and escalate stakes without tidy epiphany. The final smile and “song about arrival” crystallize Earned Stasis: she forecloses perpetual mourning with visible cost—the ticking clock now alive behind her, compasses re-anchored to love rather than north. Hairline slip: “strategically creative” is named once in narration; the dramatized splice-work already proves it, so the label feels redundant (−0.2).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the clock’s backward lurch and the husband’s cloud-born return reweight the terminal’s suspended now. Causal chain holds—because she splices lived memory into film, the magnetic fog re-orients, compasses lock, and temporality buckles. Cost is palpable: twenty lost years stay lost; the clock ticks forward only by retracing its frozen moment, a permanent scar in the mechanism. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) taught early via recurring twilight, ivory cracks, and clock ritual; final image deepens the pattern rather than explains it.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>“Tidal arbor above the clouds” is never tourist exposition; the glass floor’s rolling vapor and useless compasses constrain every departure and splice decision. The broken anniversary clock functions as micro-setting—its frozen hands dictate her nightly ritual and the exact tempo she later hijacks. Sensory hierarchy is POV-loyal: she notices ivory cracks before passenger faces, smells projector ozone before cloud damp. Final image—starlight reflected in the glass floor beneath reunited feet—recharges the sky-as-sea motif with emotional cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can she re-open a sealed farewell—tightens when the compass spin signals temporal distortion, forcing her to risk the covert splice. One meaningful deepening: the moment she realizes compasses aren’t broken but triangulating across time, her tactic shifts from elegy to engineering. Price is visible: the clock’s resurrection consumes the twenty-year stasis itself; the reunited couple ages before us. Agency is hers alone; coincidence complicates (the dirigible route vanished) but does not resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: art as private navigation system that can renegotiate time when official maps fail. The splice-hidden map between film frames literalizes memory as compass, reweighting the “directionless” terminal into a place where longing itself becomes cardinal north. Final image refuses moral—she plays arrival, but the cost is the decades they can’t retrieve, letting ambiguity linger. Motif recurrence (ivory cracks, spinning needles, clock face) constrains choice rather than decorates, culminating in the backward ticking that makes the thematic cost audible.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate stays locked to her perceptual signature: “fingers had long ago memorized the cracks,” “station master whispered,” never straying into passenger minds. Syntax lengthens and compresses with musical phrasing—elongated clauses under twilight hush, staccato fragments during splice. Diction stays within her lexicon: “dirigible,” “celluloid,” “compass rose” are tools she touched nightly. No dialogue needed; the voice carries subtext through rhythmic breath and image, converging only at the whispered “Play something else,” a line that feels earned after twenty silent years.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Near-zero scaffolding: every sentence performs at least two jobs (e.g., “She played wistfully each evening in the tidal arbor terminal, suspended above clouds that rolled like ocean waves beneath the glass floor” sets scene, stakes, metaphor, and tone). Rhythm modulates like sheet music—crescendoing polysyndeton during cloud churn, clipped dashes during splice. Figurative logic stays coherent: compasses triangulate memory, not magnetic poles; mixed metaphor is avoided. One hairline filter verb cluster (“She realized…”) mid-climax costs −0.1; otherwise propulsion is immaculate.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—lovers reunited by splicing private memory into public film inside a directionless sky-port—is non-obvious, yet grows inevitable from the first ivory crack. Risk: using hidden film frames as time-map could read as gimmick, but the story grounds the mechanic in her nightly handling of projector reels, making the splice tactile. Fresh inflection: the compass error is not malfunction but poly-temporal triangulation, turning a cliché of lost love into a bidirectional needle. Transformation test fails—only this pianist, this clock, this arbor could produce this reunion; specificity immunizes against generic transplant.</comment>
