<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus’s interiority is concrete—he “traces his finger along the maintenance map,” “pocketed his folded map,” and “could hear three distinct gaits”—each micro-choice reveals a hierarchy of values (listening > shouting). The final renunciation of “shouting his presence” is earned by the prior pattern of auditory attention; cost is felt when he realizes the labyrinth was “never about finding the way out.” Minor slip: the woman’s dialogue ventriloquizes the thesis (“You proved it…”) which momentarily flattens the embodied arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds throughout: storm → wall-shift → auditory tactic → coin-as-key → door opens. Orientation is anchored within 120 words (Port Cervantes, geomagnetic storm, maintenance map). Closure is a Charged Poise: Marcus’s tapping his own walk-pattern into the keyhole crystallizes the stakes and reconfigures his identity from “worker” to “keeper” with visible cost—he forfeits the old orientation system. Persistent constraint: the whisper-method now governs his future navigation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The corrugated containers, electromagnetic hum, and “poisonous green” aurora are filtered through Marcus’s technician ear; every sensory note either enables or constrains his auditory tactic. The keyhole welded into “faded customs stamps” is a micro-setting object that literally gates entry; the folded-map room recharges the premise at closure. Spatial choreography is clean: we track his boots, the echoing gaits, the woman’s emergence from behind a container. No static catalogue—each detail is handled under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove mastery of the labyrinth—tightens when the storm triggers wall-shifts that only the auditory method can survive. One meaningful deepening: the coin is revealed as a sonic key, not a token, forcing Marcus to translate his gait into rhythm—this narrows options and raises cost. Coincidence (woman appears) complicates rather than rescues; his prior ear-work earns the pass. Price is legible: he abandons visual map-dependence for the riskier whisper-path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: knowledge through attentive silence versus blundering visibility. The folded-map motif evolves from tool to metaphor—maps become “layers of the labyrinth’s evolution,” reweighting the premise at closure. Subtext in the woman’s first line—“You’re listening”—carries double meaning: surveillance and initiation. Final image of aurora painting “mystery and promise” offers a non-literal answer: mystery is the new orientation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-limited stays locked to Marcus; perceptual signature is auditory—he “identifies people by their walks,” hears “hydraulic groans” as cues. Syntax tightens under pressure: “He didn’t panic. He’d learned that whispers travel farther…” mirrors the calm he preaches. Woman’s dialogue is spare, technician-terse, distinct from Marcus’s reflective cadence. No head-hopping; every metaphor (“steel canyons,” “poisonous green”) is filtered through his sensory bias.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences fold map lore, storm physics, and personal history (“He’d worked maintenance… electromagnetic pulses”). No scaffold; each paragraph advances choice or atmosphere. Metaphors are precise—”ribbons of poisonous green” couples beauty and threat; no mixed vehicles. Rhythm accelerates into the final door-click, then relaxes into the aurora coda. Zero paraphrase loops; “folded maps” recurs with shifting function, not repetition.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: geomagnetic container-maze navigated by sonic gait-recognition. Trope of secret society is grounded in blue-collar maintenance culture; the coin-key that responds to personal rhythm transforms familiar quest object. Auditory navigation as plot engine is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risk—quiet climax of listening over heroic escape—pays off via Charged Poise. Could not swap names/places without breaking the port-worker idiom and acoustic logic.</comment>
