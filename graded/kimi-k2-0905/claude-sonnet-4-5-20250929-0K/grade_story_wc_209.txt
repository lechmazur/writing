<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is concrete—her stalled art, inherited postcards, and the cathedral conversation all feel particular. Yet the decisive shift (she “finally knew what to paint”) is declared, not dramatized; we see no micro-choice that proves the cost of that knowledge. Father Benedict’s presence is functional but thin; his “quietly driven” trait never constrains an on-page action. The arc lands, but the emotional price is summarized, not embodied.</comment>

<comment>The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the moon-rooted postcard reweights the premise, giving Mara a conceptual repaint with felt cost—her prior murals are now “wrong.” Causality is accumulative-textural; the layered glass metaphor and accumulating dusk images tighten the stake without a single reversal. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no penalties. The lens holds, but the final beat is one beat short of a visible micro-choice that would push this to 8+.</comment>

<comment>Amber pavilion panels act as a micro-setting: their shifting colors literalize the “hidden layers” metaphor and constrain Mara’s perception—she sees color the way the flower sees moonlight. Autumn dusk provides a live clock, darkening the glass and cueing the final insight. Sensory detail is selective (catching light like captured fire) and filtered through an artist’s eye. The postcard stack is handled, re-sorted, and re-weighted; it charges the closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—“why beauty would choose darkness”—is signaled early and compressed elegantly. Pressure escalates only once: the priest reframes darkness as the flower’s sun, collapsing Mara’s opposition. No visible price is dramatized on the page; the cost is conceptual (her old murals invalidated) but not tactile. One meaningful deepening is enough for this length, yet the absence of a micro-forfeit keeps the score sub-7.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through recurrence of layered transparency (glass, postcards, petals) rather than statement. The final image—flowers opening to “their rightful sun”—re-prices night itself, avoiding moralizing. Subtext is carried in gesture: the slow gathering of postcards into a new pattern mirrors the internal reordering. The insight feels earned because it is tied to specific sensory objects, not abstractions.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Free indirect style stays clean; perceptual signature is painterly—“petals like small cups raised to receive a gentler star.” Syntax modulates: longer clauses for contemplation, tight fragments for epiphany. No head-hopping; Father Benedict’s voice is external, filtered through Mara’s attention. Dialogue is minimal but carries subtext; the priest’s lines pursue Mara’s conversion to a new seeing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally; information is multiplexed (“yellowed… but the flowers… remained luminous”). No loops or scaffold. Metaphors stay coherent—glass layers = perceptual filters = moonlight. One mixed image (“dawning hush” at dusk) is minor. Opening and closing lines are image-driven, advancing stakes and resonance. Clean copy; no typos or tense drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>The moon-rooted flower trope is familiar, yet the inversion—darkness as the flower’s true sun—feels fresh because it is tethered to an artist’s craft and layered glass mechanics. Specificity of inherited postcards from different decades adds archival texture unavailable in generic night-flower stories. Risk is moderate; no structural experiment, but the accumulative texture is confidently executed. The synthesis is memorable rather than startling.</comment>
