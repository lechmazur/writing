<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sera’s interior contradiction—needing to quantify mercy while her body screams against the metric—plays out in every tactile beat; the final “teach me” is earned because her prior micro-choices (clipping the mask, planting) visibly foreclose retreat. The old man functions less as a second character than as a mirror, so status dynamics are thin, but her embodied trauma arithmetic is specific and unbalancing.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the mask laid down and the word “plant” crystallize a new rule-set—measure growth, not breakage—while the ultraviolet forest persists as a felt cost. Causal linkage holds: because she survived quantified pain, therefore she can now choose to quantify healing; the lens stays accumulative/textural and the final image reweights all prior Fibonacci counts.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The forest’s harmonic ratios are not backdrop but prosthetic: the 120-degree tree angles literally dampen her augmented nerve pain, forcing her to stay. The pewter mask strap micro-shifts from interrogation scar to gardening tool, charging the final image when both masks lie together in the loam.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will she keep calculating cruelty or switch to calculating mercy—tightens once: the clearing’s geometry offers a single live option, “plant,” that forecloses endless measurement of suffering. Cost is visible: she gives up the only artifact that proved she survived, trading proof for growth.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through pattern shift: Fibonacci spirals first map torture, then map seedlings; the refrain “mathematics of mercy” is never answered with a formula, only with the non-verbal act of planting. The ending’s conceptual repricing—mercy has no equation, only cultivation—lands without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate stays locked to Sera’s augmented sensorium; every verb is filtered through prosthetic nerves (“sing,” “brace,” “map”). Syntax lengthens under sensory overload, then shortens when the old man speaks, creating rhythmic relief that mirrors her lowered defenses.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density—each sentence carries sensory, emotional, and conceptual payload—yet no mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks. The single scaffold phrase “mathematics of mercy” is intentionally iterative, not accidental loop, and pays off in the final reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: bioluminescent PTSD forest as neural prosthesis turns standard trauma-survivor trope into living interface. The ultraviolet penance concept feels inevitable yet unseen before; risk is high but clarity never sacrificed.</comment>
