<comment>Lyra’s “prism-minded” trait is shown through her sensory refraction of numeric fireflies and her compulsive focus on margins; internal contradiction is lightly dramatized when awe collides with stomach-lurching terror. Embodied emotion is acute—“stomach performed impossible gymnastics,” fingers tremble—anchoring her scholarly desire inside visceral stakes. The closing vow to seed new marginalia crystallizes a cost: she now bears the weight of centuries of hidden keys, foreclosing a normal archivist’s life. Voice never drifts into label-speak; even “threshold effects” is filtered through her tactile discovery.</comment>

<comment>The doodle→grotte→stone causal chain is tight: each step is motivated by manuscript direction and pays off in gravity-reversed discovery. Orientation is swift—who, where, when locked by line 3; no penalty. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: gravity’s snap-back burns the combinations into her memory, an irreversible cognitive implant that reweights her future. Cost is unmistakable in the final line—“she would tend it carefully, clandestinely”—a charged poise that forecloses anonymity.</comment>

<comment>The serpentine grotto is not backdrop but tool: its tightening spiral literally channels the inversion and forces Lyra to crawl along what is now ceiling, constraining every move. Mist thickens into numeric fireflies—setting becomes interface, mirroring her prism perception. The carved stone’s three-dimensional doodle anchors the payoff, recharging the margin-sketch from the opening. Spatial choreography is flawless: dust rises, stomach flips, passages coil tighter, all tracked without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—harvest the seeds of vigilance before gravity rights itself—is signaled early and tightened by the live one-hour clock. Agency is continuous: she grips, pulls, moves deeper, touches the stone, each act narrowing physical and cognitive options. The inversion’s physics supply escalating pressure rather than external antagonist; cost is the irreversible cognitive burn she carries out. No coincidence resolves the conflict—her final stance is earned endurance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from marginalia itself—knowledge hidden in liminal spaces—mirrored by the grotto’s liminal gravity. No explicit thesis is stated; instead the final image of Lyra planting new doodles reconfigures the meaning of “margins” from passive to activist. The numeric fireflies act as charged motif, returning in altered form as the blazing seeds she now carries. Ambiguity lingers: will dissemination liberate or further bury truth? Complexity is embraced, not tidied.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Lyra’s perceptual lattice: “prism-minded,” “clandestinely luminous,” “latent blaze” all belong to her cognitive idiom. Rhythm modulates with pressure—long, coiling sentences during mist immersion; clipped fragments at gravity snap. No filter-verb stacks; diction stays within an archivist’s lexicon without lapsing into catalogue-speak. Voice remains singular and internally coherent, never editorial.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry triple duty—e.g., “Mist coiled … like smoke through corridors” advances setting, stakes, and metaphor in one sweep. No paraphrase loops; each metaphor extends the spiral motif without contradiction. Read-aloud rhythm alternates between sinuous pre-inversion cadence and staccato lurch at gravity flip. Line-level density is high yet transparent; zero scaffolding detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Inverting gravity as a monthly archival harvest is a fresh synthesis of fantasy & epistemological thriller; the numeric seeds literalize “hidden data” in a way genre has not staged. The prism-minded trait transforms a trope—genius detective—into a perceptual disorder that doubles as method. Risk is high: physics violation could have read as gimmick, but causal integration keeps it earned. Specificity of marginal doodle → 3-D stone makes the central device unforgettable.</comment>
