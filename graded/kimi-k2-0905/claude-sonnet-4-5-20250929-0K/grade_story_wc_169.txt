<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority stays anchored in tactile detail—shells, glass, the gauge’s needle—and her contradictory impulses (precision vs. wonder) dramatize each micro-choice. The final gesture of surrendering the gauge earns its cost because every prior beat has rehearsed the act of measuring as identity. No therapy-speak, no label-only emotion; even “hope” is reframed as a pattern she must physically weave. The only bar to 9.0 is that the grandmother’s last words arrive as quoted aphorism rather than embodied memory, slightly diluting the personal flaw that drives the renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure mounts through mirrored pattern-making across timelines until the final overlay collapses divergence into Charged Poise. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the gauge’s freed needle reweights “fall” as “flight,” with undeniable conceptual cost (she abandons the instrument that defined her). Causality is maintained because each decorative placement is a micro-test whose failure accumulates into the final insight; no late rule changes. Orientation is clean—grotto, tide, night locked by word 80—and the mosaic of three shards is taught early and paid off in the harmonic collapse.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The tide-polished grotto functions as micro-setting: every shell/glass shard constrains where the next can be placed, and the gauge’s calcite hook literally limits her reach until she unhooks it. Bioluminescent algae and brass gleam provide sensory hierarchy filtered through Mira’s engineer-poet gaze. Spatial choreography is immaculate—needle, tide, pattern tableaux tracked without drift. The 9.0 gate is missed only because the environ-body-tool fusion is so complete it borders on symbolic convenience; still, the gauge’s final re-pricing is inseparable from its physical perch.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“can divergence be beautiful?”—is signaled early and tightens through each failed decorative alignment. Escalation is textural: each mirrored attempt increases density until the only remaining option is to abandon measurement itself. Cost is legible—she forfeits the gauge, her last tether to grandmother’s deterministic worldview. The minus comes because the external world (tide, timelines) supplies the final pressure surge more than a reversible choice she dramatizes in real time.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the accretion of shells/glass: pattern as mercy, not solution. Subtext resides in the gauge’s silence for five years—its first chime is the story’s seismic shift. Final image offers a non-literal answer: translucent walls showing self-versions woven together, reweighting “failure” as tapestry. One echo of prompt-language (“equation doesn’t need to prevent divergence…”) is spoken by the triad, not the narrator, so it feels ritual rather than thesis, but still keeps the score just under 9.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyric third-person hovers at mid-distance, compressing tech vocabulary (“calcite formation,” “altitude gauge”) with tidal metaphor without register drift. Rhythmic control peaks in the choral line where three voices overlap, syntax fragmenting into wave-pulse. No head-hop; POV stays fixed on Mira-C even while sensing counterparts. The only hairline slip is “serene upheaval” itself appearing verbatim—an allowable thematic echo, but it momentarily surfaces the prompt.</comment>

<comment>Zero loops, zero scaffold; each sentence advances pattern, pressure, or image. Figurative vehicles (tide=time, gauge=destiny) stay mutually consistent and physically grounded. Information density is high—“spiral met the circle” encodes both math and emotion. A single mixed metaphor (“sound like wind through canvas, like her grandmother’s balloon”) is earned by the ballooning backstory, so no deduction touches the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The multi-timeline decorative collapse feels inevitable yet fresh—no stock “quantum self-help” arc, but a material ritual that rewrites failure as aesthetic. Brass gauge repurposed from height to possibility is a specific, non-obvious synthesis. Risky lyric structure (three shards, choral payoff) heightens coherence without obscuring causality. If the grandmother’s last aphorism had been dramatized rather than quoted, this would pierce the 9.5 ceiling; still, the piece lands in the top decile.</comment>
