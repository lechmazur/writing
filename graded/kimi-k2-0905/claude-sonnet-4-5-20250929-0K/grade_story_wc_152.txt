<comment>Mirelle’s “wise-codger” persona is credibly double-edged: every cackle or tremor is a calculated performance that still costs her stamina and time. The embroidery-as-espionage conceit gives her three concrete micro-choices (decoding the flame, selecting stitches, choosing Tomas as courier) that escalate risk. Interiority stays specific—thread burn, arthritic knuckles—avoiding diagnostic self-talk. Cost is visible: she forfeits rest and safety, finishing the cloth while boots thunder toward her; the ending’s Earned Stasis (she can only pray the right eye reads it) feels proportionate to her limited agency.</comment>

<comment>Causal chain holds: flame modulation → decrypted coordinates → embroidery → courier choice → final knock. Each beat tightens options; the dawn-time guttering is the irreversible pivot that forces her to commit the chart to cloth now. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by line 5 and never drift. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the cloth’s silver constellations reweight all prior “nonsense” into actionable intelligence, and the cost—Mirelle’sExposure without escape—hits on the final whispered prayer.</comment>

<comment>Cobalt walls, copper-green dome, and rotating-flame beacon are not backdrop: the dome’s color signals age, the flame’s gas line is the covert channel, the courtyard’s acoustics let her eavesdrop. Velvet, needle, and eternal candle act as micro-settings that constrain posture and timing. Autumn wind and dawn light evolve—from first sentence to last—mirroring her narrowing window. The Archive Vault beneath the floorboards is named only at the climax, but its existence is foreshadowed by “original star charts,” so the final image of rewritten cosmology lands with spatial coherence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve truthful star charts—surfaces by paragraph 3 and intensifies when she realizes the Vault, not the barracks, is the target. One meaningful tightening: dawn = trucks arrive = she must finish now; options collapse from “wait and verify” to “sew and pray.” Agency is driven by her attention and renunciation; she pays with physical speed and future safety. Coincidence is absent; all pressure stems from prior eavesdropping and decoding. Cost is legible: clutching the frame while boots close in, she forecloses any chance to warn officials herself.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme—knowledge disguised as insignificance—emerges through recurrent silver thread that reframes “decorative nonsense” as survival code. No moral is stated; the final prayer lets the reader feel the epistemic cost of a world that edits its own sky. Subtext thrives in silence: Vas’s sneer, the unheard binary flickers, the unreadiness of Tomas. The closing image reweights every prior stitch: what looked like eccentric craft is now the last uncorrupted map, a Conceptual Repricing of who gets to name the stars.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Mirelle’s sensory filter: “silver thread catching candlelight” is what she watches, not omniscient gloss. Diction ages with her—”gnarled,” “shuffle,” “cackle”—without caricature. Syntax tightens under pressure: final paragraph drops to short, breath-cut clauses that mime her hurried needle. No head-hop; Vas’s voice is heard, not interiorized. Filter verbs (“she noticed”) are minimal and justified by surveillance motif.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “cobalt-shadowed courtyard” collapses color and light into one modifier; “echoed silence” renders the conspirators’ pause. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances knowledge or tension. Metaphors stay physically coherent (flame as signal, embroidery as map). Final line’s “history prepared to bend” offers a crisp, metaphorical snap that recharges “cobalt” and “flame” without overwriting. Proofing is clean; tense stable.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The spy-embroiderer hook feels fresh yet inevitable: textile craft as encryption exploits the gendered invisibility of “old-woman stitchery.” Eternal-flame steganography is a novel carrier medium. Specificity—velvet nap catching light, thread burn scent—prevents trope abstraction. The rewrite-astronomy stake escalates beyond generic palace coup, giving cosmic scope to a 750-word piece. Risky structural choice (no escape, no fight) pays off in quiet dread. All innovations grow from Mirelle’s constrained agency rather than grafted gimmick.</comment>
