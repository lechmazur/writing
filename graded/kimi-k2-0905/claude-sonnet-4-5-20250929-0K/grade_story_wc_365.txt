<comment>Kael’s interiority is sensorially concrete—temperature gradients “blooming like flowers,” the shard’s edges “bite her palm”—and every micro-choice (touching the bulkhead, lifting the glass) is tethered to her map-making curse. The final decision to set the shard down is earned: she has tasted the cost of “love measured against existence” through the seventeen-minute cycle and the sister’s confession. One hairline slip: the line “weight of a withheld truth, heavy as collapsed stars” drifts into abstract grandiosity that momentarily blurs embodied emotion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure mounts through iterative sensory returns (17-min cycle, taste-shifts) rather than causal chains. Closure is a Charged Poise crystallized in the final sentence “The space between worlds tasted like goodbye”—a conceptual repricing that reweights every prior fold. The cost is unmistakable: Kael forecloses reunion to preserve infinite Mira-variations. No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) are fixed by line 3.</comment>

<comment>The repair bay is rendered through micro-setting: rust-ozone scent, pulsing emergency light, cold bulkhead—all filtered through Kael’s synesthetic bias. The shard functions as portable setting: its hum alters temperature and taste, literally changing the air. Spatial choreography is clean: eastern airlock is revisited twice, each time with altered sensory weight. One minor over-pack: “cathedral of metal ribs” is gorgeous but slightly generic; still, it’s paid off by the final spiritual silence.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—retrieve Mira vs. preserve multiverse—arrives at 25% mark. Escalation is iterative: each 17-min cycle tightens the perceptual vise (copper → honey → ash) until the final conversation collapses the rescue option. The price is dramatized: Kael’s palm bleeds, her map expands “one final time,” and she renounces the shard. Agency is present in the renunciation; luck never intervenes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the inverse of rescue: love is letting go of the singular beloved to save uncountable strangers. No thesis statements—only the final taste of “goodbye” reweights every earlier fold. The shard’s green glass originally promised reunion; by the end it is the instrument of surrender, a conceptual re-pricing that feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Kael’s perceptual signature is synesthetic and compressed: “vibrations singing their history,” “taste of air molecules.” Rhythm accelerates with clause stacks during inter-dimensional transit, then exhales into the stark final line. No head-hopping; Mira’s voice is filtered through static and distance, preserving Kael’s POV sovereignty. Register stays inside Kael’s sensorial lexicon; no academic drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances map, memory, or fold. Figurative density is high but patterned—every metaphor is sensory (flowers, translucent pages) and paid off. No mixed metaphors; “collapsed stars” is the only near-strain but is saved by its placement in Mira’s voice-over, not Kael’s embodied perception. Final line is a monosyllabic brake that earns its cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The multiverse-as-sibling-sacrifice angle is fresh; the 17-min cyclical stutter feels like a natural law rather than a gimmick. Risk: sensory cartography could have slid into boutique super-power, but it is grounded in bodily cost (bleeding palm, lung-full of ash). The abandoned spaceport is a familiar SF stage, yet the synesthetic mapping re-colors it from within. The shard’s final inversion—from key to relinquished icon—gives a non-obvious reconfiguration.</comment>
