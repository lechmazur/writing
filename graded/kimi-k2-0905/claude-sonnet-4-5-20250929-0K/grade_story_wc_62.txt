<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and character-specific; the carver’s grief is embodied through tactile handling of ribbon and tools. Contradictory impulses surface when she both seeks closure and resists it, though the shift from isolated to collective grief is more declared than dramatized. Final addition of her own poem is earned, but the cost feels intellectual rather than visceral. Voice remains coherent and singular throughout.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the ribbon re-weighted from family heirloom to instruction manual for communal mourning. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of poems accrues until it reconfigures her professional creed. Cost is legible in her pledge to carve “gardens of collective memory,” forsaking solitary stones. Transitions are clean; orientation anchored by line 15. Causality holds under accumulative logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Greenhouse glass, copper light, and monarch wings create a consistent chromatic filter that mirrors internal shift from rusted isolation to migratory cohesion. Ribbon functions as micro-setting: handled in every beat, its inscribed verses steer choices. Dusk timing narrows usable daylight, pressuring the final teaching session. Final image—her pen on the ribbon—charges the whole space as workshop of shared grief.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</question><grade>comment>Dominant stake—transform private grief into communal architecture—tightens when spectral Marcus reveals the ribbon’s pedagogic purpose. One meaningful deepening: “You were looking in the wrong place,” reframes her stone-carving mission. Cost is conceptual rather than tangible—she forfeits the safety of individual commissions for an open-ended communal practice. Escalation is textural; pressure accrues through poem layering until stance crystallizes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges inductively: poems as grief-survival tools, stones as waypoints in migratory sorrow. Subtext in Marcus’s translucent gesture toward the ribbon shifts meaning from elegy to instruction manual. Final image reweights earlier motifs—monarch migration and grass-over-graves alike—without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo; insight stays implicit in her new poem’s first line.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is tactile and chromatic—“limestone for its willingness to hold fine detail,” “pools of copper light.” Syntax tightens under emotional pressure: fragment “Because you’re carrying more than mine” mirrors ghostly breathlessness. No dialogue clutter; spectral lines carry subtext through indirection. Free indirect style stays clean; diction never exceeds carver’s artisanal lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence layers grief architecture or color filtration. No synonym loops; “migration” and “monarch” recur with accrued meaning. Metaphors stay coherent (glass/copper/tomato vines form one palette). Final line acts as both cadence and thesis without over-explanation. Minor filter verbs appear but are voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Familial poem-ribbon as grief-inheritance map feels fresh; spectral mentorship reframes artisan craft as communal ritual rather than solitary commerce. Monarch migration overlay on graveyard imagery synthesizes natural and cultural memory without forced symbolism. Risk taken: accumulative lyric structure over causal plot; payoff is resonant reconfiguration at close. Could edge higher if cost were more visceral than conceptual.</comment>
