<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mei’s grief is palpable in her body—trembling hands, silk polish, crease-by-crease folding—and her refusal to stop at 853 remaining cranes is a credible, costly endurance. The interior contradiction between scientific craft and desperate faith is dramatized, not declared. No second character on stage, so relationship crucible is N/A; the story keeps its focus on a single, fully realized will. The final renunciation (she simply returns to the next gem) lands as Earned Stasis with the cost of perpetual, infinite labour visible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each crane adds density, the count-down number reweights the stake, and the final image of “another lantern flickered to life” crystallizes the pattern without forcing a causal twist. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (lantern maker, Vesper Isle, now). Closure is a Charged Poise: the cycle is unfinished but the cost—endless repetition—is legible, no off-stage rescue. Persistent constraint (853 left) shapes every tactic; the craft is the plot.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The inverted island (roots in clouds, cranes that fall upward) is not scenery—it enables the only release mechanism Mei has. Basilica glass, lantern mirrors, gem cavity folds are tactile tools that constrain how she can act. The tea garden at dusk narrows sensory field to reflected amber and flicker, mirroring her exhausted attention. Final image of lantern light released from stored sun literalizes the larger rule: nothing is lost, only transformed.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—retrieve / re-integrate Lin’s shadow—signalled in para 1. Escalation is accretive: each crane subtracts one from 1000, a visible tightening. No external antagonist; pressure is the mountain of remaining labour. Cost is felt on every page (time, money, stamina already spent; 853 still to go) and the final image promises no end—only perpetual payment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from iterated images of inversion—roots above, cranes that fall up, light stored by day and released at night—asking what it means to “hold” loss. No character names the theme; the reader must fold it. The ending refuses catharsis, insisting that grief is not solved but transformed into continuous craft. Ambiguity is meaningful: reunion is neither promised nor denied, only pursued.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person intimate stays locked to Mei’s sensory field: silk warmth, crease tension, amber flicker. Diction (“luminous torment,” “quantum space,” “descending while ascending”) is precise, never purple, and matches her technician-poet hybrid worldview. No dialogue, so voice cohesion is carried by syntax; the clipped, mostly paratactic sentences mirror repetitive labour. Pattern of release / return is taught early and paid off in the final sentence cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops, no scaffold, high density: one sentence often delivers world rule, emotional state, and physical action (“She folded each recorded dream into paper cranes, the gems embedded in their hearts, then released them…”). Metaphors stay coherent to light and folding; no mixed vehicles. Rhythm accelerates during folding, slows on release, matching breath of task. Opening and closing lines are mirror-bookends of craft, not exposition.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Floating island + dream-mining + origami quantum postal system is a fresh synthesis; each axis follows its internal logic without late cheats. The speculative premise is inseparable from maternal grief—remove any part and the story collapses. Risk of sentimentality is dodged by mechanical specificity and the open-ended closure. Inevitable in hindsight: of course light-craft would be the only language a lantern maker could use to speak to a shadow.</comment>
