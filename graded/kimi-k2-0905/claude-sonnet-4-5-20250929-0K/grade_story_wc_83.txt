<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is vivid—her palm on the frost-rimed glass, the bleak exhilaration she names—yet the “unfiltered awakening” is asserted more than dramatized. The micro-choice to adjust thrusters is present but lightweight; we don’t feel a fork in her path, only a continuation of the hunt. Still, the contradiction between scientific detachment and grief-driven obsession is embodied convincingly. Earned stasis is hinted but not fully paid in visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The accumulative/textural lens holds: each image—geode, aurora, circuit hiss—adds density until the final Charged Poise where Mira keeps searching, foreclosing closure with felt cost. Orientation is clean by line 3; transitions are seamless. The only slack is the late introduction of “unfiltered awakening” as label rather than event. Closure reweights the premise: the hunt itself is the irreversible choice, the station’s drift mirroring her refusal to land.</comment>

<comment>The floating observatory is no backdrop: its creaking hull, cooling relays, and aurora-lit windows constrain every move and charge the final image. Frost, hiss, and magnetometer readings are filtered through Mira’s professional eye, never touristy. The geode doubles as micro-setting, its purple chambers literally handled under the desk lamp, refracting the theme back into her gaze. Sensory hierarchy is exact: pressure narrows to crystal, screen, window—objects that reweight meaning at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominate stake—locating wasted potential—tightens once when the standing wave appears, forcing thruster adjustment. Cost is conceptual: she chooses endless drift over healing, paying with perpetual unrest; the price is legible but not viscerally felt. One meaningful deepening suffices and lands, yet the escalation is more atmospheric than tactical. Agency is present yet abstract—she “continues searching” rather than stakes a new risk.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the geode’s crystallization metaphor: potential locked until pressure, then beauty equals loss. Subtext lives in silence—Dr. Vahedi’s coffee steam, the unanswered question of whether the wave is real or projected grief. No moral is declared; the final image of auroras dancing like burning veils reweights the wedding-veil memory without naming it. Resonance is concrete: the reader leaves sensing that unlived lives vibrate in the magnetosphere.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is scientifically lyric, its diction fused to Mira’s training: “probability clouds,” “magnetometer readings,” yet auroras “writhe like wedding veils catching fire.” Syntax lengthens under reflection, fragments under data pings, mirroring cooling cycles. No dialogue contamination; the single spoken line is dry, Vahedi-true. Perceptual signature is unmistakable: she sees the world as waveforms and amethyst chambers, never generic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and concept without scaffold. Metaphors are mixed but coherent—aurora as burning veil, geode as future coffin—supporting the accumulative design. No loops or synonym churn; “bleak exhilaration” is repeated once, intentionally. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line crystallizes the refusal to land, recharging “drift” as moral stance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: grief-tracking via magnetospheric standing waves, wedding veils transmuted into auroras, geode as quantum tomb. The concept of “hunting unused potential” could feel abstract, but here it is grounded in instrument readings and physical handling of stone. Risk is taken—quiet ending, no bodily peril—yet coherence holds. The angle is non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight: of course loss pools in the ionosphere if energy never dies.</comment>
