<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marina’s motivation—protect the poor while safeguarding her siblings’ only income—is clear and personal; the mirror and grandmother legacy anchor her interiority. The guardian’s ‘spiralingly calm’ trait is shown through precise, wordless craftsmanship, not label. Both characters endure visible cost: Marina risks exposure, the guardian spends an hour of covert labor. Interior contradiction (guild loyalty vs moral duty) is active in-scene, though the sibling stake is named, not dramatized. No genuine flaw complicates her tactics; she never hesitates or mis-steps, muting struggle and keeping the score just shy of top band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal chain is tight: discovery of canal-fill plan → silent mirror signaling → shutter-map that will expose the guild. The ending delivers Conceptual Repricing: dawn will make the city see, cost is Marina’s continued secrecy. Anchor (who/where/when) lands by line 3; orientation waived as disorientation is never invoked. One meaningful escalation beat—her realization that the guardian knows—narrows options and is legible under Causal lens. Closure cost is visible in the final line: she walks home still gagged by the half-spoken secret.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>“Cobalt dock gleamed after rain” instantly colors place and weather; body-as-micro-setting appears when Marina’s hand angles the mirror. Spatial choreography is clean: dock → water → bridge → warehouse row, distances track. Tool (mirror) constrains every tactic; environment (angled shutter shadows) becomes the message medium, satisfying 9+ gate. Sensory economy favors reflected light and wet wood—selective, urgent, never museum-tour.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save canals without losing job—signaled paragraph two and tightens once the shutter-map becomes the irreversible protest. Agency is continuous: she decides to signal, decides to stay, decides to walk home still silent. One visible price: she forfeits the chance to testify openly, accepting permanent internal gag. Escalation is linear but sufficient for 750 words; coincidence absent; pressure peaks when the pattern is complete and cannot be undone.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from image pattern: silent empathy > spoken testimony. Subtext sits in the mirror flashes and constellation code—never translated into moral. Final image reweights “teach darkness the value of stars” without stating it. No echoic epiphany; the after-effect is the city waking to stellar eviction map. Ambiguity remains: will the map win?—a plausible counter-reading that keeps the score below 8.5.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Free-indirect third stays close to Marina; no head-hop. Perceptual signature is optically precise: bruised light, angled reflections, star symbolism—mirrors dominate metaphor bank. Syntax lengthens under calm, shortens during signal flares—rhythm modulates with pressure. Filter verbs minimal; diction stays within educated working-class lexicon. Final para’s drum-beat “Tomorrow…” is intentional cadence, not artifact.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is clean, vivid, mostly dual-job: “weathered hands adjusting the wooden shutters” shows age and action. One scaffold: “she realized” appears twice in 50 words. Mixed metaphor risk—“bruised light” beside “stillwater tension”—but both sustain aquatic/evening palette, so coherence holds. No typo, no simultaneity error; paragraph cuts are crisp. Density high enough for short form; minor repetitions keep it shy of 8.5.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Familiar trope—silent ally helps whistleblower—is refreshed by wordless shutter-code and dental-mirror Morse. Constellation-map payoff feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Specificity of canal district, guild politics, and optical tool makes the frame non-transferable. No bold structural risk, hence no bonus, but transformation through micro-inventions lifts it above median originality.</comment>
