<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Earns a credible internal arc—he moves from paralyzed withdrawal to chosen motion—but the “strings” revelation is told more than dramatized, muting the cost. Micro-choices (removing armor, murmuring a self-authored oath) are present yet compressed; we see only one beat of actual dancing, so the bodily stakes feel sketched. Interiority is lyric but abstract (“shivering bliss”), limiting contradictions-in-scene. Still, the knight’s flaw (refusal to finish the oath) directly shapes the climax, satisfying earned stasis.</comment>

<comment>Closure succeeds as Resonant Reconfiguration: the knight accepts the strings by dancing beneath them, a visible renunciation of exile. Causal chain holds—program appears → remembered failure → patterned dance → armor dropped → strings felt—each step because-of the last. One minor causality fray: how a decades-old theatre flyer materializes inside a gauntlet he “checked obsessively” is brushed aside; at this length we accept the surreal premise. Orientation is clean by 120 words; perpetual-night greenhouse taught early and paid off in final lit stage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Selective sensory triangulation—silver-singing apples, humming gold, gauntlet-warm paper—keeps description lean yet speculative. Alchemical rules (“factually mystical… documented in ledgers”) anchor world logic without expo dump. Setting actively guides choice: darkness forces strange fruit, the orchard reshapes into amphitheater, branches become stage wings. Spatial choreography stays crisp even during reality-shifts; distances and body positions track.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake is crystallized early: finish the abandoned oath or remain string-fearing exile. Pressure tightens once as trees form the amphitheater and strings hover—one meaningful escalation under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Agency is present—he chooses to dance and speak a personal oath—yet cost is more symbolic than tactile; we don’t feel bodily consequence of attachment. Still, the price is legible: permanent visibility of one’s puppetry, foreclosing anonymous withdrawal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: freedom is not cutting strings but choreographing them. Subtext operates through stage imagery—armor as curtain-drop, apples as footlights—avoiding thesis statements. Final image offers non-literal answer: dancing in darkness beneath accepted strings. Complexity intact: no moral that Order = evil, only that denial costs more.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Voice carries lyrical, slightly archaic cadence suited to a knight recalling canticles, but diction stays within plausible lexicon. Perceptual signature strong—he notices metallic harmonics in fruit, counts armor pieces, feels paper warmth. No dialogue to contaminate texture; internal monologue avoids filter verbs. One minor register wobble: “printer’s press” feels modern against otherwise timeless idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies; paragraph cuts clean. However, figuration clusters heavily in the final beat (“shivering bliss”, “cosmic force”, “infinite patience”)—purple-tinged overwriting that slightly dulls closure image. Occasional scaffold: “he’d seen the strings… He’d fled… He’d begun” triple-anaphora could tighten. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn elsewhere; props tracked cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Fusion of puppet-theatre + alchemical orchard + chivalric oath feels fresh; not a template I’ve seen. Risk lies in abstract choreography rather than concrete fight, but specificity of glowing fruit and armor shedding keeps it grounded. Could swap gauntlet-forged flyer with hallucination and plot still works, limiting upper band. Still, the synthesis of cosmic marionette imagery with Order bureaucracy lingers.</comment>
