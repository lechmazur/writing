<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied (“fingers turned to translucent quartz…like frost on winter glass”). Micro-choices (knocking, whispering, tracing) enact internal conflict and literally reverse crystallization, showing contradiction in scene. Motive progression—from erasure to story-transform—drives every beat; final stance crystallizes with felt cost. Grandmother voice cue is the only near-generic echo, a hairline slip.

</question>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: rune-written skin becomes “a manuscript written in flesh,” re-weighting scars with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal lens holds: each small magic causes reversal of paralysis, enabling next rune; final image of steady hands pays off opening terror. Persistent constraint (stress-crystallization) shapes every tactical micro-choice. Cost legible in “thunder rolled…she was no longer afraid”—weather externalizes paid price.

</question>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Floating rock platform constrains every move—one misstep equals death; tea-ink bridge ritual is tactile and specific. Selective sensory hierarchy (“chains so old their iron had turned silver”) filters through rune-scholar eye. Spatial choreography is flawless: quill, table, chasm, chain-path track cleanly. Weather shift from saturated hush to thunder externalizes internal reconfiguration, charging final image.

</question>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will fear petrify her before she can inscribe meaning onto scars—tightens as crystallization spreads, then loosens via reclaimed agency. One meaningful deepening: scars shift from shame to readable text, foreclosing erasure option. Cost is visible in translucent fingers and in final storm she now confronts unshielded. No reversal overload; single escalation sufficient under Accumulative lens.

</question>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete ritual: transformative inscription > abstract erasure. “Small magics” motif reweights from dismissed superstition to life-saving praxis; tea-ink literalizes bridge between memory and flesh. Final image offers non-literal answer: she becomes “a living text,” resisting moral tag. No late thesis statement—resonance arises from scar-rune overlay.

</question>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Third-person limited stays anchored in Mira’s perceptual filter; no head-hopping. Syntax grows lean under stress (“She whispered to the wind: ‘I am not my fear.’”) while maintaining runic cadence. Crow-quill and tea-ink diction stay within scholar-ceremonial lexicon; no corporate register drift. Distinct rhythmic signature repeats in triple taps, triple phrases, paid off in thunder roll.

</question>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>High information density: one sentence often fuses sensory detail, world rule, and emotional pressure (“tea ceremony…liquid serving as bridge”). Mixed metaphors avoided; crystallization metaphor kept coherent. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances story or atmosphere. Final line “she was no longer afraid of storms” compresses payoff without overwriting.

</question>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Fresh synthesis: stress-crystallization physiology + ceremonial rune tattooing + anti-consumptive tea rite fused into one plausible ritual. Transformation of grandmother “small magics” from folklore to survival tech feels inevitable. Stakes stay intimate—one woman’s scar memoir—yet resonate universally. Risk taken with lyric escalative structure rather than plot reversals; coherence maintained.

</question>
<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Scholar identity shapes every perception (“three years at the Archives”) and gives expertise to attempt rune inscription; failure would break logic. Early signal, mid-beat application (chooses ink, interprets symbols), closure linkage (she “read itself”)—all gates hit. Cost: academic knowledge alone nearly fails until paired with folk ritual.

</question>
<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</question><comment>Quill used twice: dipping tea-ink, tracing runes; charged reprise as mother’s keeper-of-stories legacy. Irreplaceable—brush or pen would contradict inkless ritual. Removal would collapse ceremonial logic and maternal through-line.

</question>
<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</question><comment>Phrase bookends story, signals pre-ritual tension, but concept does not tighten options—storm timing feels circumstantial rather than causal. Still, tonal glue holds; deletion would weaken atmospheric arc.

</question>
<question>9 D</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Crystallization trait visible in opening, disables her hands mid-task, reversed by folk ritual—directly enables climax. Cost shown: near-fatal fall risk if hands stay stone. Story fails without this obstacle.

</question>
<question>9 E</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>Verb “shed” titles and propels entire ritual; each rune literally sheds shame while keeping scar. Could swap for “release” or “scribe,” but resonance would drop. Present in setup, development, closure.

</question>
<question>9 F</question><grade>7.7</question><comment>Revisiting superstitions (knock, whisper, circle) taught as childish now saves her life; mechanics shown (knock→echo→pause crystallization). Without it, transformation ritual impossible.

</question>
<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</question><comment>Altitude and chain exposure pressure every motion; isolation prevents outside rescue, forcing self-reliance. Tea platform is micro-setting that supplies tea-ink medium. Failure to use setting would erase rune mechanics.

</question>
<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</question><comment>“Held breath” is lyrical time marker, not tracked clock; storm arrival gives external cadence but does not alter tactical choices beyond signaling closure. Atmospheric more than causal.

</question>
<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Motive voiced early, conflicted by fear of pain vs desire for narrative ownership; every rune decision weighs pain against meaning. Closure shows cost paid—she walks into storm owning stories.

</question>
<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</question><comment>Saturated hush tone seeded early, modulates into thunder release; coherence maintained. Not indispensable—other quiet-to-storm arcs possible—but deletion would flatten resonance curve.
