<comment>Maya’s desperation and generational memory feel lived-in; the charm-as-key and lung-burning clock give embodied stakes. Interiority stays specific to her training—she tests resonance, counts pockmarks, budgets breath—never drifting into editorial gloss. The final choice to map scars instead of cure the sea is a credible renunciation that costs her the fairy-tale ending she (and we) hoped for.</comment>

<comment>Causal lens: every beat is a therefore/because linkage—mentor’s death → Maya’s turn; charm fit → golden vein; map revealed → breath-by-breath campaign. Orientation anchored by line 4; the 30-second air debt is the tightening metronome that narrows options until the final surfacing. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the sea is not healed, but meaning is re-priced—scars become constellations—with the felt cost of perpetual dives and certain death still ahead.</comment>

<comment>Acid-eaten rigging, brass railing, sulfur stench—details are filtered through a diver-alchemist’s priorities of corrosion and tactility. The workshop’s tilt and the jellyfish ropes of dissolved rigs constrain movement and time, charging every micro-choice. The statue’s pockmarks double as micro-setting and future map, directly shaping the final tactic; without them the story logic collapses.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—transmute loss before drowning—tightens via the literal oxygen clock; each attempted charm-fit burns precious seconds, escalating felt cost. The mid-scene reversal (click → golden light) forecloses the “instant cure” fantasy and replaces it with generational repair, paid for by Maya’s surrender of an easy victory. Persistent constraint: the acid sea remains lethal; the victory is cognitive, not environmental, keeping pressure alive past the last line.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Kintsugi reframed as planetary surgery emerges through action, not lecture: every golden vein is a literal deposit of memory-quilted intention. The final image—scars as map—reweights prior damage into utility, offering a non-literal answer to “how do we live with ruin?” Theme stays implicit; no moralizing caps the piece.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Maya’s sensory bandwidth—sulfur, grinding gears, limestone grit under gloves—without POV leakage. Diction (“quilting together memories,” “luminous scar”) belongs to an alchemical lexicon salted by urgency; rhythm shortens under oxygen debt, then elongates during the golden bloom. No dialogue present; therefore dialogue bullets ignored.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often delivers world rule, tactile detail, and ticking clock (“The workshop groaned…her lungs already burning”). Metaphors stay coherent—gears, star chart, jellyfish rigging—all acid-sea consistent. No filter-verb stacks, no paraphrase loops; final line is propulsive closure image, not exposition.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Acid-sea kintsugi is a fresh synthesis; the trope of “fix the broken world” is inverted—repair is cartographic, not curative. Risky choice to make victory intellectual rather than environmental pays off because the golden map is foreshadowed by every earlier crater-test. If relocated to another planet or plague, the arc breaks; specificity is irreversible.</comment>
