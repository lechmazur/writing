<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mal’s interiority is vivid—her “irreverent awe” is embodied in the way she handles the kaleidoscope and the arrow tip—but the promised flaw/limits never manifest; she glides from beat to beat without error or sacrifice, so the final choice feels unearned. The “steadily curious” trait drives the build, yet no contradictory impulse or visible cost complicates it, so the arc is linear rather than crucible-tested. Single-POV keeps choreography clean; still, the absence of genuine struggle undercuts the high-band entry gate for 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The closure is a crisp Conceptual Repricing: the bell tower made of light and longing re-weights the premise, and the cost is felt—Mal sails toward an impossible future, leaving safe mooring. Causal links hold: kaleidoscope upgrade → coherent coordinates → final image; no teleporting props. Orientation is anchored inside 120 w (“The workshop bobbed…acid sea”). One minor lens wobble: the bell’s responsive frequency is declared rather than demonstrated, but the final image redeems the abstraction, so the Lens ambiguity cap is waived.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Acid-spray geography is tactile and immediate; the grinding gears, prismatic haze, and tilting platform constrain every micro-choice. Micro-setting triumph: the kaleidoscope’s mirrors and the arrow tip literally refract the stakes into the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—Mal notices what a cart-glider would. Only nit: no smell/taste of acid, but the visual-mechanical density is so complete the omission is forgivable.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“hear the bell no one hears”—is signaled early and tightens once: the new pattern locks coordinates, foreclosing retreat. Escalation is accumulative: each kaleidoscope tweak thickens the sensory density until the bell materializes; the price is opportunity cost (she abandons safe scrap-island trade routes). Agency is present but friction-light; no tangible loss or tool breakage occurs, keeping the score sub-8.8. Still, the irreversible launch supplies a felt cost under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the fusion of yearning and invention: the bell exists because a machine to desire it was built. The arrow tip’s reprise—pointing forward in the final line—re-weights ancient longing into post-human tech, avoiding any moral summary. Subtext in the mentor’s dissolve (“dissolved into the sea spray”) hints that desire costs flesh, yet the story resists stating the equation aloud. The closing image crystallizes the theme without sermon, meeting the 9- resonance threshold.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is rhythmically controlled, vocab within glider lexicon (“rusted gears,” “canvas sails”). Perceptual signature is strong: Mal sees the world as currents, trajectories, refractions. No dialogue, so no convergence risk. One template cadence cluster—“every time she recalibrated…every time she tweaked”—but it is pattern-taught and pays off in the final tightening, so the high-band gate is met.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence lengths contract during the kaleidoscope breakthrough. Information density is high—each line couples sensory data to emotional computation. One paraphrase loop: “impossible longing…mechanical hope” restates the same abstraction within three lines, −0.2. Metaphors stay coherent (acid sea, gear-bobbing) and do not intrude on closure. Overall, line-level craft is clean with minor hairline.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of cart-gliding, acid-sea salvage, and a kaleidoscope-powered yearning algorithm is fresh; no genre template contains this triad. The bell tower made of “pure mathematics” reconfigures familiar post-apocalyptic longing into conceptual-fantasy without breaking the world’s rusted logic. The hunter’s arrow tip reappears as both compass and ancestral echo—an inevitable object in hindsight. Risk is taken and paid off: the story commits to the metaphoric bell as literal destination, achieving singular vision.</comment>
