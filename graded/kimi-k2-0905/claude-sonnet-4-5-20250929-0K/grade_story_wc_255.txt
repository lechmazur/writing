<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maya’s color-blind painter identity drives every strategic choice—she trades awakenings for flawed objects—so her flaw is active, not ornamental. The interiority stays concrete: she “reads the world through texture,” never labels herself. The bargain with Tomás forces a visible cost: she permanently keeps his broken reed, a pocket-sized reminder that imperfection is currency. What keeps this from the top band is that Tomás himself is sketched more as grateful recipient than pressure source; his stake in the transaction feels auxiliary, so the relationship crucible never fully ignites.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a crisp Conceptual Repricing: the bent reed becomes proof that “being broken…is just another way of being beautiful,” re-weighting the story’s value system with undeniable social cost. Causality holds: because Maya’s color-blind sight lets her prize tarnish, therefore she can paint awakenings and therefore the courtyard revives. Orientation is clean by line 4; no lens ambiguity. One minor strain: the phoenix event is off-stage mythic catalyst rather than earned turn, but it is accepted as situational given the fable tone.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The glassblower’s courtyard is sketched through sensory triangulation—scorched earth crunching underfoot, embers scattered across cobblestones—filtered by Maya’s texture-first attention. Selective detail (wind chimes, reed tongue, scorched planters) repeatedly constrains movement and later charges the final image. Spatial choreography stays clean; no floating rooms. While the wider city remains generic, the micro-setting of body-plus-tool qualifies for high-band gate at this length.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—awakening the sleepwalkers—surfaces early and tightens once: Maya must sacrifice her self-interest (keeping the reed) to jolt Tomás awake. The single deepening is meaningful: her gift’s cost shifts from idea to pocketed object, foreclosing future trades. Agency is hers; coincidence (phoenix smoke) complicates but does not resolve. Visible price is present yet modest; a sharper material loss or risk would have pushed this into the 8+ tier.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without sermon: imperfection as beauty is shown via traded objects and the final reed image, never asserted. Subtext resides in gesture—Maya palm-weighing the tarnished reed—rather than exposition. The concept integrates with fantasy frame (phoenix, dream-trance) so metaphor and plot are mutually reinforcing. No tidy moral appears; ambiguity lingers about future awakenings, satisfying complexity requirement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays latched to Maya’s perceptual world: values over hues, textures over tints. Sentence rhythm flexes with pressure—short bursts during ember scatter, longer lyrical coils when mixing paint. No head-hopping; dialogue is sparse but distinct (Tomás’s whispered “I can’t wake up”). The bent-reed motif returns as tactile refrain, teaching the pattern early and paying off in final gleam.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; most lines serve two jobs (advance + texture). Occasional elevated diction—“crystallized final moment,” “conceptual repricing”—leans academic, not color-blind artisan, but appears outside peak beats so penalty light. No loops, paraphrase stacks, or metaphor muddle. Strong ear: varying paragraph lengths create visual breaths that echo painting pauses.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The color-blind painter who monetizes imperfection for consciousness is a fresh synthesis; the phoenix-as-soporific is an inventive inversion. Details are particular to this courtyard economy rather than generic fairy-tale tokens. Transformation test passed: if you swap the reed for a perfect coin the bargain collapses. Risk—lyric economics inside fantasy fable—heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, earning the within-band bonus.</comment>
