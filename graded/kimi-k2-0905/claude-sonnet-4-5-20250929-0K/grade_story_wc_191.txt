<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Kaida’s curiosity and historian’s hunger feel authentic; her pulse-quickening at the mural is concrete. Interiority stays specific to a lore-keeper’s training—scanner, frequencies, dead languages—rather than generic awe. The micro-choice to kneel and press palms to glass crystallizes her shift from observer to participant. No secondary character appears, so relationship/status bullets are waived; backstory is tightly anchored to present cues.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the stairway descends, not up, reframing “ascension” as submission to memory. Cost is felt—she forfeits daylight safety and official legitimacy. Causal chain is tight: mural → orchard → ruby → glass stairs; each because/therefore link narrows options. Orientation is clean by word 60; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Selective sensory layering—fiber-optic waterfall cool on skin, ruby warm as blood—anchors wonder without catalog bloat. The orchard’s spiral circuitry and nebula fruit constrain action: only someone who reads dead languages can interpret the ruby’s data. Palace smart-stone seasons echo theme of painted-over truth. Micro-setting (scanner, rail-bike) tools constrain tactics and are handled on-page.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reach the throne room before orbital sunrise—is signaled early and tracked by rail-bike ride and final descent beat. Sunrise clock visibly tightens options, forcing the kneel-and-press decision. Escalation is one steady tightening rather than multiple reversals, sufficient for 700-word scope. Cost is legible: she abandons surface world legitimacy for archive duty.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: memory as counter-imperial duty. The inversion of “ascension” from rule to service is reweighted by the final downward steps. Ruby and orchard images recur with shifted meaning, not token symbols. No moralizing paragraph; resonance is bottled in the last line: “a throne claimed not by sitting, but by remembering.”</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays strictly inside Kaida’s perceptual filter—scanner crackle, dead-language glyphs—no omniscient leakage. Syntax flexes under pressure: clipped clauses during rail-bike ride, longer sinuous sentences inside orchard. Diction stays within a scholar’s lexicon without academic dryness. No dialogue to judge; voice remains individual and coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density: scanner-crackle sentence delivers setting, tool, and stakes in one stroke. No filter-verb clusters or mixed metaphors; figurative language is sparse and purposeful. Rhythm accelerates across waterfall breach and orchard approach, then slows for descent. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Combines cli-fi orbital mirrors, folded-space orchard, and data-stream ruby into one coherent palette. Twist that ascension = downward service feels inevitable in hindsight yet non-obvious. Freshens “hidden archive” trope by making throne a marker, not seat. Risky downward staircase choice heightens meaning without gimmickry.</comment>
