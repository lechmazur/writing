<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira’s “persistently curious” drive is shown only in job description and generic action (“fingers flew across her tablet”), never tested by a micro-choice that costs her anything. Lily’s arrival delivers a visible bruise, but Mira’s interiority stays static; no contradictory impulse surfaces in scene. The final “began making calls” is summary, not an embodied decision with on-page cost, so the change is declared, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands: Lily crosses the threshold, Mira’s assurance reframes the stake from eerie signal to lived rescue, and the grandmother’s pulse achieves its goal—earned Resonant Reconfiguration. Causality holds: hearing-aid pulse → Mira maps pattern → Lily appears, each step because/therefore. Cost is conceptual but felt: “You’re being protected. Even from beyond.” No orientation debt; twilight/ferns/headphones anchor by line 3. One minor loop: “refusing to let a signal fade into silence” repeats the prior paragraph’s gist.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium is more than postcard; the rolling mist literally blurs exits, forcing the two women to stand together under the ferns while the signal completes. The corroded hearing aid is micro-setting-as-tool: its crackle times the beats and its silence marks closure. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—Mira notices static hiss and spider-web shadows first, never a generic catalog. One slip: “reeling hush” is used twice in near-repetition without added charge.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rescue Lily from unseen abuser—is signaled by line 4 (“isolated, manipulated”). Escalation is a single deepening: spectral warning → live bruise; options narrow from “track signal” to “shelter Lily now.” Cost is conceptual but legible: Lily’s bruise and whispered “I thought I was going crazy” make the danger undeniable. Agency sits with Mira’s assurance that reframes the threat, yet the external abuser remains off-stage, slightly softening visceral pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the spectral pulse motif: love keeps broadcasting after death, demanding audience. Subtext lives in gesture—Lily’s hand trembling around the photograph says more than exposition about coercive control. Final image of two women beneath ferns while the aid falls silent offers resonant non-literal answer: protection can outlast mortality. One soft moral line: “That was the thing about hearts…” edges toward thesis but is saved by its placement mid-story, not in last paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Narrative distance stays tight in Mira’s technician lens: “electromagnetic signatures of emotional resonance” is precise, not decorative. Rhythm modulates—long, liquid twilight sentences collapse into staccato tablet taps. Filter verbs are minimal; perception is direct (“fronds casting spiderweb shadows”). Dialogue is sparse yet subtextual: Lily’s whisper “I heard her…” carries shame and relief in three words. Voice never lapses into generic spooky-poetic; it remains forensic, which sharpens the ghostly effect.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Read-aloud ear: cadence breathes with scene temperature—ink-spill twilight sentences lengthen, then tighten at the crackle reveal. Figurative language is selective: “twilight poured…like spilled ink” is fresh; “edges like broken glass” is stock but rescued by context. No paraphrase loops; each paragraph advances knowledge or image. One register drift: “textbook” twice in four lines feels lecture-room amid lyric mist; a hair’s breadth over the line.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>“Contact tracer for hearts” reframes ghost-whispering as data forensics—fresh, non-obvious synthesis. Premise commits fully: emotional frequencies stored in a hearing aid treated like cold-case evidence. Risk doubles the spectral with domestic-abuse realism; both tracks converge without gimmick. Specific detail—“corroded battery compartment open like a mouth”—makes the tech tactile. Transformation test fails if moved to another city or device; the hearing aid’s particular fragility is irreplaceable.</comment>
