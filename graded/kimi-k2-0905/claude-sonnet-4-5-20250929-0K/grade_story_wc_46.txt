<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren’s grief-rooted pivot from astronomer to glass-smith is vivid and embodied; her tactile polishing sessions double as micro-choices that re-channel loss into sharing light with children. Interiority stays concrete—thumb-testing glass smoothness, arranging shards for optimal dawn angles—never slipping into abstract self-diagnosis. The only slack is the off-stage accident summarized in one paragraph; because Elena never appears or speaks, the relationship crucible is implied rather than dramatized, slightly thinning the motivational texture at the hinge moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Maren renounces celestial fire for gentled terrestrial light, the cost legible in “amber glass…safe for small hands.” Causality is accumulative/textural—each polished shard layers density until the final gallery reweights meaning; pattern taught early via “bring their light down.” Mist/grotto anchors who-where-when by line 4; no orientation debt. Transitions are absent (single-scene default), yet the lens holds without ambiguity through the last crystallized image.</comment>

<comment>The grotto’s serpentine mist, tide-smoothed stone table, and light-catch angles actively constrain how glass must be placed—setting is tool, not backdrop. Micro-setting rule met: sea-glass shards function as portable celestial surrogates, their curved surfaces dictating where dawn beams can land. Sensory hierarchy filters through Maren’s astronomer eye—she notices refraction indices and color temperature, not tourist geography. Final amber piece placement is spatially tracked and charged, passing the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—transmit starlight without fire—signals in paragraph two and tightens when each polished shard must succeed before children arrive. Accumulative pressure: every failed refraction risks retraumatizing the loss; successful light-dance affirms Elena’s question “why stars couldn’t paint the ground.” No external antagonist; tension is knowledge-versus-acceptance, resolved in the crystallized gallery stance. Cost is conceptual—Maren forever exchanges telescopes for lapidary wheels—visible on page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from iterative light-transformation: broken fragments become vessels of continuity, grief converted to communal wonder without moralizing. The colored-shadow motif (Elena’s cathedral joy) reprises in the final dappled grotto wall, reweighting prior material. Subtext sits in silence: Maren never names the fire to the children, letting colored beams carry the unsayable. Ending image resists tidy comfort—sharing light still requires daily polishing labor, acknowledging persistent cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate stays locked to Maren’s astronomer percept—she calculates angles, weighs light by hue, hears ocean as cosmic backdrop. Syntax lengthens during polishing calm, shortens when memory flare intrudes, matching emotional cadence. Figurative layer blends celestial and marine lexicons—“pearl of stillness,” “zephyr bloom”—without register drift. No dialogue present; therefore voice distinctiveness rests on diction and rhythm, both consistently achieved.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is loop-free, scaffold-free; each sentence either advances setting, memory trigger, or polishing action. Mixed-metaphor risk in “frozen river” grotto is saved by sustained water/ice imagery that coheres. Information density high—one line can place glass, reveal tool source, and foreshadow child audience. Final line “little girl smiled at colored light” acts as charged callback, re-energizing “colored shadows” motif without sentimentality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: astronomer-turned-lapidary repurposes stellar spectroscopy for sea-glass optics, turning cliff grotto into low-power planetarium. Risk in quiet accumulative structure pays off—no external plot twist, yet pattern of iterative polishing reframes grief into communal pedagogy. Could edge higher if accident backstory were similarly particularized instead of summarized, but the concept remains non-obvious and thematically integrated.</comment>
