<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is sharp—her contradictory need to quantify nostalgia while surrendering to it is shown through her muddy boot-prints and the amber she palms like a rosary. The final micro-choice—accepting Quorum as walking companion—pays for her earlier clinical detachment with visible cost: footprints about to be erased by rain. Status shift with Quorum is subtle but legible: from interrogator to fellow pilgrim. Voice convergence at closure is acceptable because her internal cadence stays distinct.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the invitation to walk tomorrow crystallizes the impossibility of return while making the attempt irresistible. Cost is felt in the rain washing away footprints—time’s erasure made visible. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each dawn walk layers density until the final image reweights “convergence” as perpetual loss. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The rain-slick spiral stair and overgrown sculpture garden are not backdrop but gyroscope: every step Elara takes is mediated by wet stone, moss, and the tower’s echo. The fly amber micro-setting constrains her tactile ritual—she turns it “like a rosary,” binding thought to flesh. Weather evolves causally: first rain enables mud prints, second rain will erase them, charging the final image. Bronze-quiet tone is sustained through sensory selectivity—wet stone, bell-like voice—never drifting into postcard lushness.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can nostalgia be measured without destroying it?—tightens when Elara admits her data has become longing. One meaningful deepening: “Each journey both deepens and erases the one before” raises the cost of continued returns. Agency remains hers: she chooses tomorrow’s walk knowing footprints will vanish. No external antagonist needed; the pressure is temporal erosion, perfectly coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from iterated action rather than thesis: homecoming is the chemistry of repeated erasure. Subtext lives in unspoken recognition that Quorum’s inability to bend backward makes it a perfect mirror for human folly. Final image—rain washing fresh prints—offers non-literal answer: the sacred is the walking, not the arrival. No moralizing; complexity intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person hovers at intimate distance, filtering description through Elara’s scientist-poet synapses: “wet stone and new leaves” collapses geology and botany into felt sense. Rhythmic control peaks in the final paragraph where clause-stacking mimics breathless ascent toward acceptance. Quorum’s bell-wind voice is alien yet never exposition-laden; subtext carried in gesture toward amber. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or knowledge. Figurative language is spare but precise: “voice like wind through bronze bells” teaches timbre without purple drift. Information density high—“fossilized resin containing a perfectly preserved insect from an epoch before humanity learned to look upward” does triple world-building duty. No register drift; scientific diction stays inside Elara’s lexicon.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fusion of alien-contact frame with phenomenology of nostalgia feels inevitable yet fresh. Pilgrimage recast as data set that mutates into lived religion is a non-obvious synthesis. Risk of anthropomorphic alien is avoided by making Quorum’s limitation—no backward trajectory—the thematic engine. Amber, footprints, and tower are not quirky ornaments but irreplaceable constraints.</comment>
