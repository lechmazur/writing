<question>1</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Interiority is vivid—“shape of home” refracted through mercury-glass skin—and the final micro-choice to embed the stone burns with embodied cost. Yet the arc is almost entirely reflective; no contradictory impulse is staged in scene, so the turn feels fore-ordained rather than wrestled. Still, the earned stasis lands cleanly and the reflective form justifies the lyric mode.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the bookstore re-shelves itself once she accepts the stone, refracting sunrise into nameless colors—undeniable conceptual cost under an accumulative lens. Orientation is immediate; place and POV are anchored by word 50. Causality is interior-pattern rather than event-sequence, taught early and held to last line.</comment>

<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The mountain bookstore breathes paper and ink; candlelight spirals through hollow corridors, guiding micro-choices (three-level descent to Philosophy wing). The mercury-glass body itself becomes micro-setting, refracting dawn into new spectra that charge the final image. One persistent object—the stone—constrains the climax by burning into her chest, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“will she let the stone make her remember?”—tightens once, when heat forces the burn/implant choice; option to keep hiding is foreclosed with visible cost. Pressure is coherent under accumulative lens: each sensory return (feather, stone, thunder) intensifies density until refraction reweights meaning. No external antagonist needed; internal stakes carry sufficient heat.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of belonging emerges through the refracted image of home—not a house but a self-refracting lattice. Subtext lies in tactile detail: feather barbs = suppressed memories; stone burn = price of re-integration. Final image offers charged poise without moralizing, letting the nameless colors reconfigure earlier motifs. Ambiguity lingers yet feels earned.</comment>

<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric-ornate but disciplined: cadenced parallelism (“This too was a kind of vision. / This too was a kind of truth.”) mirrors mercury’s ripple. Diction stays within seer’s mythic lexicon; no filter-verb clutter. Perceptual signature is distinct—she reads steam, shadows, feather ridges—and holds to the last refraction. Minor risk: occasional elevated phrase (“exquisite—remembering always was”) flirts with purple, yet pattern justifies intensity.</comment>

<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or synonym loops. Metaphors are coherent—mercury, glass, feather, thunder—without mixed vehicles. Information density high: each sentence advances memory, object, or setting. One scaffold paraphrase (“She had been trying to understand…”) is forgivable at 750 words. Clean copy, strong rhythm, no artifacts near closure.</comment>

<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Mercury-glass seer in living mountain bookstore is fresh synthesis; transfigured skin as mirror-of-world deepens the buried-talent trope. Refraction-as-epiphany feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk taken with lyric accumulative structure pays off in final spectral image. Could edge higher with sharper external obstacle, but concept is memorable.</comment>
