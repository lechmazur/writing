<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Keiko’s caretaker impulse is embodied in the rice-offering ritual and the monthly climb; the grotto scenes dramatize contradictory impulses—duty vs. restlessness—through micro-choices like the slow arrangement of bamboo-wrapped cakes. Her interiority stays concrete (“grief still carved hollows”) and avoids label-speak. The final acceptance of the hairpin crystallizes a renunciation that costs her the fantasy of a single “source” of peace, satisfying the 9+ quick test for earned, visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the hairpin transfer reweights the entire quest, making “the seeking itself” the new, un-closeable source. Causality under an Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each cloud-grotto visit layers density until the mother-face reveal breaks the pattern with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“summit of the oldest cedar”) and again at the descent, so no penalty applies. One scaffold loop—“like a secret held between sky and heaven… like a promise, like the next breath”—is decorative but does not touch the final beat, so only a −0.1 line-level nick is routed here.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The cedar summit, clay bottles, and lacquered phoenix hairpin are tactile, choice-guiding objects; the grotto’s misty mouth literally shapes access—one mis-step would plunge Keiko into cloud. Sensory economy favors touch and breath over visual catalogues. The hairpin’s final reposition in Keiko’s palm charges the closing image, satisfying the 9+ constraint test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding the “source of contentment”—is signaled early and tightens when the woman’s unveiled face collapses the possibility of external resolution. Escalation is textural: each monthly ascent adds rhetorical layers (“vineyard hush,” “antique hairpin”) until the reveal forces a stance crystallization. The cost is conceptual but legible: Keiko must abandon the hope that forgiveness will finish her grief. No causal reversals are required under the Accumulative lens; one deepening is sufficient.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the repeating image of ascent–descent and the hairpin’s migration: contentment is practice, not destination. Subtext resides in gesture—the silent rice offering says more than any apology scene. The final line’s “endless, contented cycle” offers a non-literal, resonant answer without moralizing, meeting the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person close stays tightly filtered through Keiko’s perceptual quirks—clouds “forming and reforming, never the same shape twice.” Syntax mirrors her recursive doubt via comma-joined ruminations that breathe but never bog. Dialogue is minimal yet distinct: the woman’s vineyard hush versus Keiko’s clipped admissions. No head-hop; distance modulates only with the final zoom onto the heartbeat-like phoenix.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</question>
<comment>Read-aloud cadence is controlled; sentence lengths swell and contract with altitude. Single scaffold loop noted in Q2 is the only repeat; no synonym churn or mixed metaphors. Information density is high—“scallop the bay’s edges” compresses an entire livelihood into one verb. The final image is uncluttered, satisfying the 9+ zero-artifact test despite the earlier cosmetic loop.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The cloud-summit grotto as grief-therapy space feels fresh, and the mother-face reveal reframes the hairpin from mere prop to cyclical totem. Risky lyric compression (“vineyard hush”) pays off by charging the final beat. The premise could drift toward self-help, but specificity of cedar climb and rice-wrapping keeps it idiosyncratic. Transformation test: names could not swap without destroying the cultural texture, earning the upper-band mark.</comment>
