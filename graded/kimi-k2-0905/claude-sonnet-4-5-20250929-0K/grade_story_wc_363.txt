<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mariko’s interiority is concrete—hair-thread, cold-numbed fingers, amber pulse—showing a hierarchy of values (brother > self) that escalates to the willing self-trade. The contradiction between stoic diligence and trembling fear is embodied, not labeled. No secondary character on page, so status/relationship bullets N/A. Final renunciation is fully earned by the loom-pattern causality and grandmother’s forewarning.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Decisive Change: she crosses the jigsaw frame, trading places with Kenji. Cost is visible—“the raveling silence welcomed her home.” Causal lens holds: loom pattern → jigsaw frame → crossing. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) nailed by line 3. One soft spot: “time moved differently there” is told, not demonstrated, just before the final beat, a hairline slip that keeps it under 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Forgotten orchard, bamboo mist, and the loom as micro-setting constrain every motion; the jigsaw pieces physically frame the threshold she must cross. Sensory economy is high—cold, sap-warmth, shuttle-click—mirroring internal stakes without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography clean: loom → jigsaw frame → threshold. Environment supplies both tool and portal, qualifying for 9+ gate, but slight over-reliance on visual mist/bamboo tropes keeps it at 8.5.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—retrieve Kenji—signaled in paragraph 4. One meaningful tightening: final thread locks the pattern, forcing the sacrifice. Cost is legible in the crossing and amber pulse. Pressure is accumulative/textural: each shuttle pass adds weight until the fabric itself humes with consequence. No false coincidence; escalation is steady under the loom’s rhythm.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of reciprocal rescue emerges from concrete acts (weaving, crossing) rather than statement. Final image reweights “home” as liminal space—Conceptual Repricing. Subtext runs through silence: Kenji’s breathed name vs. the loom’s click. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity remains—will she return whole? Emotional aftereffect lingers without tidy lesson.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays firmly inside Mariko’s perceptual filter: jigsaw edges “worn smooth by countless hands” is a spinner’s tactile notice. Syntax lengthens during weaving, shortens at crossing—rhythmic control under pressure. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets waived. Diction consistent—no register drift. Voice distinct without ornamental quirks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, high-density: “Each pass of the shuttle carried her intention” does three jobs in nine words. One paraphrase loop—“she caught fragments: her name, a question, sometimes just the sound of breathing”—slips into list cadence, a minor artifact. No metaphor muddle; figuratives are spare and apt. Enough control for 8.2, but the late list keeps it beneath 8.5.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: jigsaw pieces as cartography of absence, loom as time-machine, amber bead as heart—elements fused into an inevitable whole. Risky liminal-sacrifice ending is fully committed to, not hedged. Transformation test fails: this exact emotional logic could only exist with these objects. No trope recycling; quiet subgenre of textile-magic gains new inflection.</comment>
