<comment>Mara’s interiority is concrete and character-specific; the contradictory impulses (cling vs. run) are dramatized in the leash-snapped moment and re-lived in confession. The guides function less as characters than as lyrical chorus; their muted status keeps the crucible squarely on Mara, but their cryptic serenity risks near-magical convenience. The final renunciation—running without leash—is causally seeded by the ticket-punch visions and her own admission of “lighter,” so the cost is legible. Flaw: reliance on symbolic guides whose motives stay oceanic and off-stage; they nudge but never resist, so secondary-pressure value is thin.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the star-shaped aperture reframes the broken leash into a portal, re-weighting safety as cage; cost is the implicit forfeiture of her small life. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—each punch-through adds density until the twilight image crystallizes choice; no causal reversals required, pattern taught early. Orientation is secured by word 40 (ferry guides, ridgeway, dusk). Persistent constraint: the guides’ decree “without a leash” forecloses any halfway return, shaping the final sprint.</comment>

<comment>Setting is micro-anchored in ticket punch, leash, ridgeway mist; these objects act as portable stage sets that constrain every stop (must punch leaf, must abandon leash). Veiled ridgeway charges the final image—its obscurity literalizes the un-mapped life she finally enters. Sensory hierarchy favors touch (warm brass, snapped leather) over vista, matching POV bias toward tethered intimacy. Spatial choreography is tight: three gapped halts on rising slope, no geography drift.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—retrieve dog vs. retrieve self—tightens at each indirect ascent; micro-choice to punch foliage escalates by replacing search with self-interrogation. One meaningful deepening: when she confesses “also lighter,” the want/fear axis flips, foreclosing safe refusal. Guides’ insistence on “without a leash” is the visible price that alters tactics for the final run. Coincidence is absent; escalation is accumulative under textural lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: tether as life-contract, punch-hole as consent aperture. No explicit thesis; the shoreline-lullaby tone lulls then reconfigures safety as stagnation. Final image of running into dark offers resonant non-literal answer—freedom is unlit, not found but entered. Ambiguity lingers: courage or mere loss? Complexity upheld.</comment>

<comment>Third-person lyric bears distinct salt-air cadence, syntactic parallelism (“smooth and salt-silvered,” “gentle and persistent”) that teaches its incantatory pattern early. Perceptual signature is tactile/auditory rather than visual, suiting a character who anchors by feel. Register stays within Mara's plausible lexicon; no滤镜-verb bloat. Dialogue minimal, appropriately oracular; no convergence under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: “ticket punch grew warm” does triple duty—sensory, causality (next use), metaphor. Varied rhythm; paragraph cut test passed—each graph advances knowledge or emotional charge. Minor scaffold: “about the... about the...” confession list telescopes time but reads intentional as breathless spill. No mixed metaphors; no artifact in closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Ferry-guide spiritual trek trope is refreshed by making the dog the true guide and the punch the compass; inversion feels inevitable after “she ran—not away... but toward something.” Specificity of salt-silvered driftwood aging, star-shaped twilight fragment root the cosmic in the tactile. Risk: quiet ending, but coherence holds. Not radically new, yet synthesis is local and earned.</comment>
