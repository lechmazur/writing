<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Vera’s chronically-curious folklorist core is dramatized through micro-choices: tasting sediment, hesitating before plucking, the mesh-bag ascent. The vanishing-memories flaw drives every beat and the final renunciation costs her the safety of detached documentation. Interiority stays concrete (“soil-stained and sure” hands) and avoids label-speak. Only the absence of a second on-page character keeps this from full 9-band crucible pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/lyric lens holds: each added layer (broken glass, constellation echo, shipwreck circle) reweights the same stake—how to keep memory alive. Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the moment she bags the mushrooms, memory stops being hoarded archive and becomes live digestion. Cost is legible: “Not preserved. Living.” anchors the before/after shift. Orientation taught early (“purple dusk,” headlamp beam) waives any anchor penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The sunken greenhouse ribs, phosphorescent spores, and ring of wrecks are never scenic postcard; each re-enters as tactical object (she climbs whale-bone ribs, bags glowing caps, feels wrecks’ magnetic drag). Micro-setting succeeds: the mesh bag’s luminescence becomes the final lantern that recharges “crisp as autumn air.” Sensory hierarchy obeys Vera’s academic gaze—she tastes, measures, names—so detail stays purposive. Only the single-scene scope keeps it from the 9-band gate that demands environment physically constrain the final motion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“can she keep her memories?”—tightens through accumulation, not causal reversals: each recovered sensory shard raises the cost of hoarding them. The single decisive turn is the pluck: it narrows her option from extraction to ingestion, foreclosing detached documentation. Price is on-page: fungal network surges, memories re-inhabit her body with “sharp-sweet cider” taste. Under lyric/accumulative lens this one intensification is sufficient, but a second visible forfeiture (e.g., damaged research notes) would have nudged into 9+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: memory is food, not artifact. Subtext coils through reversed preservation logic—canning kills, digesting keeps alive. Final image of glowing bag ascending past “sleeping guardians” reweights earlier shipwreck pattern as completed ritual, not scenery. No tidy moral; the cost is felt in her relinquishing archival control.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice carries a scientist-poet hybrid: precise diction (“luminescent spores,” “Ophiuchus”) braided with sensory lyric (“whale bones,” “autumn air”). Perceptual signature is Vera’s—she catalogs, tastes, measures—so every metaphor reads as her tool, not authorial flourish. No filter-verb bloat; syntax tightens into fragments under pressure (“Not preserved. Living.”). Distance stays steady; no experimental slippage, hence no bonus but no faults.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphor; each sentence advances layer or stakes. Opening line anchors voice and metaphor (“whale bones”) in one stroke. Final line cadence mirrors first, sealing the ascent arc. High density with no purple overlay keeps momentum underwater and above.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The “memory as mycorrhizal network” synthesis is fresh yet inevitable: 40-year drowned commune, broken constellation, shipwreck Ophiuchus—each element cross-pollinates the next. Risk lies in lyric accumulation rather than plot twists; payoff is the reconfiguration of preservation itself. No trope templates; even “fairy ring” is re-coded as scientific-mythic hybrid. Specificity throughout (cider press, headlamp beam on silt) prevents conceptual tale from drifting abstract.</comment>
