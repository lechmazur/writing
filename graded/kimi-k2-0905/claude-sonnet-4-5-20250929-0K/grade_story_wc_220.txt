<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mercy the bloodhound is vivid—her graying ears, her sleeping under the bench, her sudden re-activation by scent—but Calder remains slightly generic: we get his occupation and one preserved leaf, yet no contradictory interior pulse or visible flaw under pressure. His final pivot from resignation to cartographer-of-hope is rapid but grounded in the cylinder’s concrete instructions, so the change is credible if not deeply textured. The pair’s shared history (her corpse-tracking, his voice-excavating) is economically sketched and motivates the closure beat. Interiority stays modest and occupational; no diagnostic self-help speak, but also no moment where Calder’s body betrays him or his thought contradicts itself under stress, so the crucible never quite chars him.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: Mercy’s nose → bunker → anomalous cylinder → night-long decoding → dawn coordinates → communal exodus. Orientation is anchored within 120 words (wasteland scrapyard, Calder, Mercy, post-war timeframe). Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the leaf clipped to the pack re-weights “distance” from abstract lament to navigable map, cost felt in the weeping and the scratched-steel messages that can’t be unsent. One minor warp: the bunker’s sudden appearance is coincidence, but the story frames it as Mercy’s agency, so lens holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>“Iron cancer” and “metal bones” give tactile rust and steam; the waxed leaf is a micro-setting that constrains Calder’s nostalgia and later seeds the closure image. Spatial choreography is flawless—three-mile walk, bench underside, shelf placement, clipped-to-pack finale. Sensory hierarchy favors smell and metallic taste, true to bloodhound and scrapper. No world-rule contradiction; phonograph cylinders and bunkers feel consistent with salvage culture. Setting pressure is light but present—distance measured in footsteps across rust—so just shy of 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: translate isolation into connection; signaled early via Calder’s “distance killed us” line. Escalation is single, meaningful: cylinder converts despair into six reachable caches, narrowing options from stasis to communal march. Cost is conceptual but legible—Calder’s tears and the irrevitable broadcast of coordinates—so agency and price cohere. No external antagonist or second reversal, but one tightening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges without moralizing: distance as fear-made-measure, silence as map. The leaf’s vein-roads and the cylinder’s inter-word silences reweight the same motif at closure, achieving resonance by image rather than statement. No tidy moral; the ending invites the reader to walk into the cracked morning, leaving ambiguity alive. Subtext operates in gesture—Mercy’s nose, Calder’s trembling hands—avoiding explanatory monologue.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited clings to Calder’s perceptual filter; no head-hop. Diction—“iron cancer,” “phonograph cylinders,” “wild hush”—is specific and consistent, never drifting into academic register. Rhythm modulates: longer reflective sentences early, clipped coordinates at the end mirroring the community’s new purpose. No dialogue to judge; voice remains distinct and anchored.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and image-dense; no filler verbs or paraphrase loops. Mixed metaphors (“iron cancer” beside “metal bones”) stay coherent within salvage ontology. Opening line anchors stakes and voice; final line recharges “distance” and “grooves” without repeating words. One near-overwrite: “tinted revelations poured from his speaker in waves of static and voice”—“tinted” is slightly decorative, but the synesthesia fits the cylinder’s altered medium and doesn’t blur causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Familiar post-apocalypse salvage is refreshed through phonograph-cylinder cartography and a bloodhound archivist; the cylinder-map hidden in inter-word silence feels genuinely new. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulation rather than twist—but the synthesis is specific to this voice and stakes. Proximity check: no close echoes of famous scenes; the leaf-as-compass is an organic callback, not borrowed icon. Conceptual integrity holds—no late rule inventions.</comment>
