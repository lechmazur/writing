<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Maya’s contradictory impulses—her drift toward erasure vs. her hunger to reconstruct—are kept live in every beat; the notebook micro-choices under the harbormaster’s gaze externalize a visible cost that has been accruing since the first container. Interiority never abstracts into label-speak; even “ghost among the living” is filtered through rust streaks and garment-bag plastic. The final renunciation of the archive to Chen’s son is earned: her earlier refusal to keep fighting paperwork flips only after she has physically mapped the erasure and felt its texture. Flaw: the “filter reality differently” trait is asserted more than dramatized in early beats, but the closing image retroactively charges it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout: each container fragment layers density until the poison label breaks the pattern and re-weights the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise—Maya hands over the notebook, foreclosing her nameless refuge while the tide literally laps at the metal; the cost is the relinquishment of the only identity that still fit her. No causal cheats: the clerical error is off-stage, but its after-image is relentlessly tracked on-page. Orientation is anchored by word 40 (“port city’s forgotten edge”); disorientation is taught early and pays off in the final container-gaps purple light.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Container labyrinth functions as both macro-setting and mind-map: rust streaks, spray-painted numbers, and tide-soaked bases constrain where Maya can squat and what she can touch. The poison label micro-setting—wedged between two lower-tier containers where tide reaches—literally infects her perception and triggers the notebook project. Sensory hierarchy obeys her new survival filter: smell of mildewed satin before color of wedding dresses. Final image of rising water against metal reuses the tidal rhythm first taught in paragraph two, now re-weighted as clock she must obey to re-enter the named world.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to exist when officially erased—tightens once: poison label forces shift from passive collection to active reconstruction of erased neighborhood. Escalation is textural: each overheard fragment adds palimpsest pressure until the notebook becomes too heavy to keep. Cost is visible—she surrenders the archive, accepting bureaucratic re-entry she earlier refused. No coincidence resolves; the harbormaster’s arrival is prepared by shared surname and rose memory.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of systematic erasure emerges from concrete particulars (arsenic roses, garment bags, coffee-cart memories) without abstract sermon. Subtextual answer: preservation requires letting go of the private archive; memory’s texture is loss. No character articulates a thesis; the closest—“the roses had been worth it”—is rendered as sensory justification, not moral. Final image re-prices the poison: domesticated death was always the price of beauty, just as namelessness was the price of seeing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person POV stays tightly latched to Maya’s perceptual filter; diction is concrete-lyric (“filtered reality differently,” “texture of memories”) without drifting into academic register. Rhythm compresses under pressure: long sentences for container catalogues, staccato fragments when she fingers the skull label. Dialogue is minimal but voice-distinct: harbormaster’s “She died three months ago” carries dock-floor bluntness against her elliptical interiority. No head-hop; Chen’s interior is inferred only through gesture and gift of notebook.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances archive, atmosphere, or causal linkage. Metaphors stay physically loyal—“layers of replacement” mirrors actual container stacking. High-density beats: “toys still wrapped in manufacturer’s plastic” collapses origin, abandonment, and Maya’s own shrink-wrapped identity in one line. Final line cadence mirrors tide inhalation, releasing reader on lifted metal breath. Minor slip: “systematic erasure of what had been” leans abstract, but immediately grounded by next container detail.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Premise of bureaucratic death/error turned into lyric archaeology of container palimpsest feels inevitable yet unexampled. Risk of nameless protagonist in nameless zone fully committed; no retreat to easy redemption. Fresh inflection: poison label domesticated for roses becomes emblem of beauty that literally kills—metaphor no other story could swap without rewriting entire container cosmology. Transformation test fails: plot collapses if roses/arsenic/stacking/tides replaced.</comment>
