<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira’s desire to “reawaken beauty” is legible and embodied through the violin; the locust shell choice charges the climax. Interiority stays concrete (“old rhythm in her chest”). Yet the turn from passive observer to active transformer is compressed into a single musical beat—more micro-choice scaffolding in the orchard or on the bridge would have earned a higher band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the city’s mechanical certainties are re-weighted when golden tears feed new shoots. Causal chain (shell→resonance→statues crack→roots drink) holds. Orientation is swift; only mild ellipsis between orchard theft and twilight song, but pattern teaches itself. Cost is felt in the splintered violin and the open-ended “continuous becoming,” keeping lens stable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Sky-bridge height, clockwork hum, and marble statues are sketched with cinematic economy; each detail filters through Mira’s bodily tension. The orchard is rendered through sensory loss—gray creaking branches—so the single golden apple pops. Micro-setting rule satisfied: the locust shell against spruce wood alters acoustics and therefore tactics. Spatial movement (city→orchard→bridge) tracks cleanly in two shards.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—rekindle wonder—faces mechanical order; tightening occurs when the statues physically react, narrowing Mira’s safety. Escalation is textural/accumulative: each resonant note layers risk until the violin fractures. Agency remains hers, but the cost (instrument destroyed, statues mobilised) is legible on-page. One further intermediate obstacle or consequence beat would have pushed higher.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of metamorphosis emerges through iterated hollows: locust shell, emptied statues, split tree trunk. Final image—“eternal space between chrysalis and wing”—re-weights earlier motifs without moralising. Subtext operates in silence: factory whistles stop, clouds slow. Ambiguity is productive; no tidy restoration of full magic keeps complexity alive.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-limited lingers in Mira’s sensory filter: “music remembered what they had forgotten.” Syntax lengthens during the crescendo, then fractures with the violin. No head-hopping; crowd reactions remain externally observed. Distinctive cadence taught early (“impossible colours…starlight”) and paid off in golden sap. Minor register lift in “Conceptual Repricing” meta-diction is sanctioned by final beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Strong rhythmic control: varying sentence length mirrors musical swell. Dense doubling—e.g., “uprooting…literally and figuratively”—works because it is brief and thematic. No loops or mixed metaphors; verbs stay muscular (“crumbled,” “shuddered”). One filter-verb cluster (“seemed to slow”) is forgivable in speculative mode. Proofing clean; opening and closing lines ear-tested.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Familiar “artist vs. mechanised world” frame is refreshed by cardiac signal mechanics and golden ichor tears. Transformational object (locust shell) feels specific, not token. Risk taken in lyric escalatio rather than direct confrontation, and it coheres. Could edge higher with one more idiosyncratic world detail that constrains Mira’s tactics.</comment>
