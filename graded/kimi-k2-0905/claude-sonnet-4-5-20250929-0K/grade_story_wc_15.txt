<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The weaver’s motivation—transform ruin into reverence—remains legible and consistent; her nightly sleepwalking stitches are micro-choices that visibly cost her (missing fingers, dawn exhaustion). Interiority stays concrete and occupational: net-mending muscle memory transposes to silk bridges. The earned renunciation at the end (she walks away, work finished) carries felt cost: red dust under nails, dreams still wandering. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the quick test for 9+ is narrowly missed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens declared and held: each night’s overlay of thread thickens meaning until the final sunrise image reweights the whole. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—“broken precedents became new traditions”—with undeniable social cost: the monks’ rule is publicly voided. The illustration plate acts as taught pattern early and returns charged at the end, satisfying the payoff requirement. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3; no penalty applied.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Red canyon walls, copper needle, and waxed-cloth plate are tactile, bias-filtered through weaver’s maritime eye (“veins of precious metal”). The labyrinth’s cracked stone and dawn light constrain logistics: thread visibility depends on angle of sun, forcing dawn work. Micro-setting qualifies: the needle and silk-wrapped stones act as portable geography that alters later travelers’ paths. Final image—threads turning stone to rose gold—charges closure under the inferred lens.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—transform abandonment into sacred space—tightens through nightly accumulative overlays; each knot forecloses the monks’ original prohibition. Visible prices accumulate: blistered fingertips, dream-disorientation, final departure from the canyon. Agency is sustained: every silk bridge is an intentional (if somnambulant) act that invites future pilgrims. One meaningful deepening occurs when overlapping paths make retreat impossible without trampling earlier art.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Theme emerges from pattern rather than statement: repetition as reverence, not failure. The plate’s idealized map and the weaver’s lived threads reweight each other by the end, offering orchid-solace resonance without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture—burying violet-wrapped stones is a quiet offering to the lost. The refusal to solve the labyrinth yet forever tend it crystallizes an earned, non-binary wisdom.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Voice is lyric-accumulative: long breathy sentences mirror weaving rhythm, then tighten into single-word clauses at sunrise. Perceptual signature is maritime—threads “like fishing nets,” “dawn light like salt.” No head-hopping; POV stays inside the weaver’s coastal idiom. Compression such as “orchid solace” is taught early and repaid in the final image, satisfying patterned-elision rules.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</question>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: anaphoric “where…” clauses build loom-like repetition, then break into spare “she left.” Information density high: one sentence often sets scene, advances metaphor, and foreshadows closure. No mixed metaphors; canyon/needle/thread logic stays coherent. Minor scaffold: “red canyon walls” appears twice in same paragraph—−0.2, not touching closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</question>
<comment>Risk-taking structural choice—sleepwalking as plot engine—pays off: irrational path-making becomes rational sacred text. Fresh synthesis of textile craft, disused monastery, and storybook map feels inevitable in hindsight. Elemental specificity (copper needle, indigo cord, waxed cloth) could not swap with generic tools without collapse. Conceptual integrity: follows the monks’ abandonment to its logical reverse—maintenance instead of solution.</comment>
