<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Eliana’s guilt and need to atone are palpable in her trembling hands and immediate recalibration of the heart; the grandfather’s letter triggers a credible interior reversal that explains her prior refusal without excusing it. Marcus functions more as catalyst than crucible—his bearing witness is consistent but low-pressure, so the relationship beat feels thin. The cost lands cleanly: she accepts months of unpaid labor to restore a dead man’s heart, a penance that forecloses profit and pride.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The causal chain is lean and legible: letter reveals prior misjudgment → acceptance of restoration → donation to prison program; each beat tightens options and makes the apology material. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the heart will beat again as social witness, a cost felt in irrevocable time and public exposure. Orientation is nailed by line 5; no lens ambiguity. One scaffold trace: “she already understood” is轻微的提前总结 but does not break immediacy.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The shop’s “vibrant hush” of ticking gears is both atmosphere and moral engine—timepieces literally measure penance. Light through storm clouds is returned at the end as a charged reprise that reweights the apology. The clockwork heart itself acts as micro-setting: its frozen valves dictate every choice Eliana makes. Spatial grounding stays clean; only nit is that “behind the counter” plus loupe plus letter hand-off could crowd the bench, but choreography remains trackable.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is Eliana’s need to redeem a lethal misjudgment; the tightening occurs when the grandfather’s letter collapses her certainty and forces a public, unpaid restoration. Cost is visible: months of artisan labor donated to the prison that once held Samuel. Pressure is accumulative/textural—each gear she lifts reweights her prior arrogance—rather than external antagonism, fitting the quiet lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</theme><comment>Theme emerges through the metaphor of repairable hearts versus irreversible deaths; no character verbalizes “second chances.” The final image of the heart beating inside a prison program reconfigures the premise without moralizing. Subtext in Marcus’s smile carries the quiet indictment that institutions, not mechanisms, failed. Ambiguity is preserved: the restored heart cannot resurrect Samuel, only testify.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-limited stays locked to Eliana; no head-hop. Perceptual signature is artisan-sighted: “magnifying loupe,” “mainspring repairs,” “verdigris and rust”—filtered through her professional guilt. Syntax tightens under pressure: “She saw now what she’d missed before—” uses em-dash compression to mimic a lens snapping into focus. Marcus’s dialogue is sparse, priestly, and goal-driven; Eliana’s replies fragment as shame rises.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with scene pace—longer sentences during reflection, clipped fragments at the reveal. No filler-verb stacks; “felt something crack in her chest” is embodied, not diagnostic. One minor loop: “the heart had seemed hopeless… she’d rendered judgment swiftly, definitively” restates the same idea; trims –0.1. Figurative language is restrained and accurate: “velvet grave” is fresh yet mechanically apt. Clean grammar and tense.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The clockwork heart as literal organ rather than metaphor is the fresh inflection; it turns a sentimental trope into material stakes. Grandfather’s letter functions as retroactive rule-teaching that feels inevitable once revealed. Risk is taken in the quiet ending—no public confrontation—paid off by the conceptual cost of placing the beating heart inside the prison. Could edge higher if the shop’s clientele or era were more specifically anchored, but the core synthesis is non-obvious.</comment>
