<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Kael’s muscle-memory choreography and the embodied ritual of chant–spin–walk give us a lived-in interiority; the burn-scarred woman’s first gesture (unwrapping the knot) immediately pressures him, so his choice to spin unlit is earned. The “smoke of hopelessness” is the only near-label, but it is quickly grounded in the festival accident flashback. The ending renunciation—spinning without fire yet feeling wonder—pays the cost of identity re-definition. Secondary characters remain functional archetypes rather than full individuals, limiting upper band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The causal spine—“note in mosaic → arrival → revelation of failed artists → unlit spin → tear-streaked laughter”—tightens cleanly; each beat advances knowledge or option. Orientation (who/where/when) is secured within the first 90 words. Closure is a Charged Poise: the unlit knot crystallizes the new stance and the lanterns re-weight failure into communal light. The “ambient awareness” rule is declared late and remains slightly abstract, a hairline slip that keeps it under 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Evening primrose catching “last amber light” and the mosaic-instruction fragments give tactile, POV-filtered specificity; the fortress itself functions as pressure—its walls force circular walking and public witness. The kerosene rag is successfully treated as micro-setting: its familiar weight alters Kael’s gait and triggers memory. Spatial tracking stays clean across the spiral path and lantern sequence. Environment could have constrained tactics even more (wind, wall height), but what is shown is vivid and selective.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—recover art-identity after maiming a child—is signaled by line 6. Escalation is internal: first sight of rag → unlit rehearsal → tear-laughter release; each step re-prices the fear of fire. The tightening choice is accepting to spin without combustion, narrowing future options (he can never return to old pyrotechnic glory). Cost is felt but could have been sharpened by an explicit forfeit (reputation letter burns, etc.).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of “beauty filtered through damage” emerges through the mosaic instructions and the un-lit spin; no character sermonizes the thesis. The primrose closing while lanterns burn offers a resonant, non-literal repricing: failure becomes medium. Subtext in the woman’s burn-scarred hands and Kael’s chant speaks louder than exposition. Final image avoids moralizing; wonder is shown, not asserted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited clings tightly to Kael’s perceptual filter—sound of chant, weight of knot, light on mosaics. Rhythm mimics fuse-count: “Three beats rise…” repetition teaches the pattern and pays off when laughter breaks the count. No head-hop; the woman’s interior is only guessed. Compressed syntax under spin-motion heightens immediacy; occasional elevated diction (“serious playfulness”) is diegetic, uttered by character, so forgiven.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud cadence varies; short chant fragments punctuate longer descriptive sentences. Information multi-tasking: primrose petals also signal time-of-day and emotional soften. No scaffold loops; “spinning…spinning” repetition is intentional pattern, not churn. Metaphors stay coherent (light/dark, bloom/close). Tense stable, pronouns clean. Final line is trim and image-driven.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The “fortress of failed artists” premise reframes disability-as-new-medium rather than triumph-over-tragedy, fresh at this length. Mosaic instructions as permanent technique-glyphs is a lovely, specific device that fuses setting and theme. Risky choice to keep fire absent from climax pays off emotionally. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight yet not borrowed from familiar pop-culture arcs.</comment>
