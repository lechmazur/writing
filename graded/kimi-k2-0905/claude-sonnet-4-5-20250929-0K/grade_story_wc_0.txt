<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Helena’s scientist-habit of “preprocessing” is credibly dramatized: she spreadsheets grief and now sifts wing dust instead of mourning butterflies. The micro-choices—collecting, photographing, labeling—externalize her need for order while the quiet realization that “light could linger after its source had moved on” lands as earned, costly renunciation of that need. Interiority stays concrete and body-specific (“hands finally steady, her mind quiet”). Only minor slip: the ex-husband tag is backstory glue, not on-page pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: Helena locks the greenhouse while holding a slide of scales that reframes her life’s metric from billion-ton stars to “tiny mirrors” of lost flight. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—dust density, pattern recognition, cadence shift—rather than causal reversal; the final image reweights the stake without tidy epiphany. Cost is legible: she accepts next spring’s restart knowing it too can drown. Mosaic shard count is within Track B; transitions are legible, pattern taught by 25 %.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Shattered glass, mud slicks, and microscope light are economically filtered through an astrophysicist’s eye (“microscopic mirrors,” “rotational energy”). The greenhouse’s wreckage constrains her posture—kneeling, crouching—and supplies the only tool she uses, the portable scope, which becomes the staging ground for her shift. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating props. Micro-setting suffices: the bench island inside the ruin mirrors her internal ordering. Slight over-reliance on visual; scent of wet earth arrives late but helps.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can she absorb loss without converting it to data?—is signaled early. Escalation is textural: each scale type discovered tightens the emotional screw until the final slide glows as “stars.” No antagonist or reversal is needed; the pressure is accretive pattern versus emotional permeability. Felt cost is present—she forecloses the safety of pure observation—but could be sharper; the “humility” is asserted more than dramatized in the final beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges via dual metaphor: neutron-star decay ↔ butterfly-scale residue—both leave quiet evidence of transmuted cataclysm. Subtext is carried by gesture (labeling dust, locking door) rather than statement; no moral is preached. The final slide held to dusk offers a resonant non-literal answer: understanding is reflection, not possession. Avoids overt allegiance to either science or sentiment; complexity is honored.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person close maintains a scientist’s diction—“overlapping shingles of chitin,” “decay curves”—yet modulates into lyrical compression at pressure points (“light could linger…”). Rhythm mirrors process: longer periodic sentences for cataloguing, clipped fragments for realization. No dialogue, so voice distinctiveness rests on perceptual signature; it holds. Filter verbs minimal; “she understood” once, but justified by final conceptual shift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often fuses physics, biology, and emotion (“Neutron stars were themselves evidence of catastrophe…”). Figurative layer is disciplined—no mixed metaphors; “tiny mirrors,” “perfect decay” extend the same optic metaphor. Occasional scaffold: “she had always preprocessed reality…” repeats the tag line; minor. Final third is artifact-free, cadence slows to match dusk light. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Central synthesis—astrophysics griefwork via butterfly scales—is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risk lies in quiet accumulative structure rather than dramatic turn; the payoff is conceptual re-pricing, not plot twist. Specificity of scale types and pulsar names keeps the frame fresh. Could edge higher if the decay metaphor were even more intricately threaded through earlier beats, but transformation is clear.</comment>
