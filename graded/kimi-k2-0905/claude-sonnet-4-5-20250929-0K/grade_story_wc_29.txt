<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is visceral and embodied—“fillings ache,” charts move under her palm—so her competence and dread feel lived-in. The contradiction between her overnight-DJ shrug and cosmic-messenger burden is present but stated more than dramatized; we’re told she’s “cautiously hopeful” rather than shown micro-choices that risk that hope. Her decision to embed a mathematical signature in the subsonic track is a clear, stakes-laden choice that forecloses passive observation, earning the ending’s spiral reversal. Still, the story keeps her at arm’s length from any second character, so status/relationship pressure is absent and the cost, while conceptual, is not interpersonal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The causal spine is clean: subsonic bait → trickster attention redirected → campus chaos recedes, all legible under a Causal lens. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—the spiral withdrawal and warm laughter are the felt cost of Mara’s gamble, confirmed when colors fade and equipment stops self-repairing. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (overnight DJ, WKRU, present semester timeline) and stays coherent; no orientation debt. The only slack is the off-stage “emergency meeting” beat, summarized rather than scened, slightly blunting the tightening just before the climax.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The station itself—transmitter pulse, metal casing, flickering lights—functions as micro-setting that constrains her tactic (she must broadcast from here or lose the game). Sensory hierarchy favors tactile and sonic detail over visual catalog, matching a DJ’s trained ear. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly: palm on transmitter, charts lift, headphones adjusted, no floating props. The “impossible colors” and rearranged circuits verge on world-rule exposition, but each instance is tethered to a character’s report, preserving plausibility. The radio tower as conduit for cosmic frequencies is specific and memorable; removing it collapses the premise.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent city-wide division via hijacked airwaves—is signaled early and tightened when Mara realizes the tricksters are “converging on the radio tower.” One meaningful turn suffices: she flips their game from chaos to pattern-solving by baiting them with her own encoded harmonics, a choice that visibly costs her calm (“she exhaled carefully”). Escalation is causal, not static; each new campus anomaly (colors, circuits, editorial) is a beat that raises stakes until she acts. Cost is conceptual but legible: she trades her anonymity for guardianship, accepting perpetual attention from entities that can bend reality.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete: entertainment vs. empathy, ancient boredom vs. human pattern-making. No character articulates a thesis; the final laughter that is “warmer, intrigued” reweights the opening fear into uneasy coexistence. Subtext resides in silence—no overt human gratitude, only fading colors—so the reader feels the loneliness of stewardship. The refusal to moralize keeps ambiguity alive; the closing image of updated charts shows maintenance, not victory, resisting tidy closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Mara’s perceptual signature—subsonic frequencies felt in dental work, vision “blur at the edges”—is idiosyncratic and consistent. Syntax stays concise, with purposeful repetition (“always slightly off-camera, always just beyond proof”) that mimics radio static. No dialogue, so no head-hopping; POV distance remains tight-third with no filter-verb bloat. Lexicon stays within a STEM-savvy night owl’s range; “celestial frequencies,” “ionosphere,” and “mathematical proof” feel earned, not showing off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</question>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: long sentences for cosmic scale, clipped fragments for sensor readings. Information density is high—“circuits rearranging themselves into patterns that resembled laughter” does world, stakes, and metaphor in one stroke. No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors; “ethereal grit” is the only slightly abstract pairing, but it is motif-linked and paid off. Proofing is clean; homophone-free, tense stable, pronouns unambiguous. Occasional adjective stacking (“vast and playful”) is minimal and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of campus-politics satire with cosmic trickster myth feels fresh; the radio tower as both literal college infrastructure and interdimensional game-board is a non-obvious angle. Tropes—supernatural DJ, bored aliens—are re-rooted in tactile specifics (dental fillings, station logs). The inversion of “message of peace” into “invitation to a different game” avoids moral cliché. Risk in low-word-count cosmic stakes pays off because the cost is kept local and sensory; the piece commits fully to its premise without winking at the reader.</comment>
