<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Mira’s “quietly determined” interiority is lived-in: trembling hands yet measured strikes, silk strip as tactile memory, the mine-crawl as embodied risk. Contradictory impulses—fear of failure vs refusal to evacuate—collide inside every hammer blow, not in abstract narration. The final stance (forge onward alone) is foreclosed by the spent silk and the first green bud: cost is visible, earned. Only capping at 8.8 because the magician’s dialogue momentarily “explains” her trait rather than letting the forge act speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Causal lens holds: each discovery (sap veins → silk memory → conduit forge) is a because/therefore linkage that narrows options toward the final insertion of crystal roots. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the spent silk and lifting branch reweight the premise—resilience over exodus—with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation clean by line 5; no prop teleporting; magician arrival is motivated by the silk set-up. The price (exhaustion, spent memory, solitary future) is legible in the last two sentences.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Floating stone arches, crumbling soil, crystallized sap veins—each environmental element is filtered through Mira’s smith-sight and constrains her tactics: the arches’ shadows dictate workshop placement; the sap’s hardness drives forge temperature choices; the shafts’ map determines conduit layout. Sensory hierarchy is metal-weight: clang, heat, dust, then the sudden blue scent of budding leaves. The final image of arches framing hope is a literal reconfiguration of their prior shadow-threat. Micro-setting (hammer, anvil, silk) handled as tools that change state and choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—planet-death vs staying to heal—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightened when the council debate is rejected in favour of subterranean conduits. One meaningful escalation: the magician’s memory extraction converts unknown root geometry into actionable forge plan, narrowing options from “try something” to “thread exact channels.” Cost accumulates: stamina, social credit (others think her mad), the silk’s spent magic. Closure crystallizes the stake: first bud proves viability, but the scale of remaining work keeps pressure alive.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of quiet resilience emerges through the forge metaphor—metal and crystal fused to make ruin fertile—never stated as thesis. The silk’s “memory” subtextually asks what traditions we trade away to survive; the answer is paid when the strip fades and the magician leaves, implying future debts. Final image refuses triumphalism: thousands more trees still need saving, resonance without moral. Only minor deduction for the magician’s line “You’re not meek at all,” a faint echo of thematic echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Mira’s perceptual signature: clang tempo governs clause rhythm; colour palette narrows to forge-red and sap-amber until the azure bud breakthrough. Compression is purposeful—“between understanding and confusion” teaches the reader to accept liminal summary. No head-hop; magician’s interior is inferred only through gesture and dialogue. Diction remains within a smith’s lexicon; no filter-verb clusters.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm alternates between hammer-fall declaratives and longer, sap-slow clauses that mimic liquid cooling. No scaffold; each paragraph advances forge progress or spiritual cost. Metaphors (sleeping giants, frozen rivers) are sparse, taught early, and payoff in the final azure inversion. Clean grammar, precise verb choice (“thread,” “swell,” “foreclose”) and zero paraphrase loops.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Combines dying orchard planet + mine-forged root graft + memory-laden silk into a synthesis that feels inevitable yet fresh. The “bartered awakenings” concept is inverted: Mira trades the silk’s memory not for personal enlightenment but for planetary resuscitation, a repricing of the trope. Quiet defiance as tone and crystallized sap as world logic are non-obvious choices that could not swap into another tale. Risky structural compression (single night of work) is earned by the accumulative pressure design.</comment>
