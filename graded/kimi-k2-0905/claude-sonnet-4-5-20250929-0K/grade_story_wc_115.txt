<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Marcus’s interiority is vivid—his “religiously skeptical” lens colors every perception, and the compulsion to decode call-in confessions feels lived-in. The contradictory pull between empirical curiosity and creeping dread is embodied in the “drowsy alertness” that recurs like a pulse. Micro-choices—turning each beaded valve while recording shadows—escalate risk and stake. Only the late-summary epiphany (“ghost shift = collective guilt”) slightly blunts the cost; the moment of renunciation is implicit, not viscerally tasted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final rush of water and “shift change” audibly lifts decades of compressed guilt, cost felt in the audible emptying of the tunnel. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each beaded wheel and radio call layers density until the ambient ghost-shift becomes the moral payload. Causality remains intact: Marcus’s turns → audible release. One hairline slip: the psychic-caller conduit is explained post-fact, not motivated early; barely grazes the beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Textile-mill throat, rotting ties, and bead-textured valve wheels are tactile, never catalogued; sensory hierarchy skews auditory—the echo of lunch-pails and water-hammer overrides visual. The tunnel itself acts as a constraining pipe: every step forward narrows exit options, physicalizing the moral choke. Weathered beads evolve from décor to rosary surrogates, charging the final image when water roars through them. Setting is inseparable from instrument; remove the tunnel and the confession acoustics collapse.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find the weight of swallowed truth”—is signaled early and tightens with each new caller confession. Turning the final valve is the decisive, irreversible act that converts ambient guilt into audible release, narrowing Marcus’s options from observer to accomplice-catalyst. Cost is conceptual but legible: the ghost shift clocks out, yet Marcus must carry the knowledge that private griefs were mined for his private quest. No coincidence; escalation is purely accumulative pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges without dictation: collective silence calcifies into industrial haunting; confession—even outsourced to late-night radio—can erode that calcification. The beaded wheels’ rosary logic fuses Catholic guilt with blue-collar machinery, letting guilt look both sacred and systemic. Final image reframes prior motifs: water (baptismal) flushing pipes (industrial) while shadows clock off. No moral sermon, only reweighted machinery: truth’s weight is transferable but never vanishes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Marcus’s perceptual filter: every noticed detail is tool, threat, or data. Syntax stretches and compresses with his drowsy-alert pulse—long sentences for tunnel suffocation, staccato clauses when flashlight flickers. Diction is skeptical, lean, metal-specific (“water-hammer,” “production quotas”) without glossary condescension. No head-hopping; psychic’s voice is mediated through phone static, preserving POV discipline.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; sentences carry double duty—e.g., “beads clicked...worn smooth by decades of phantom workers” fuses sound, touch, and backstory. No loops or filler; modifiers are scarce, nouns and verbs concrete. Metaphors stay mechanical-religious (“rosary prayers”) and never mixed. One tiny scaffold: “the truth has weight” is接近抽象摘要 but immediately anchored to stomach-stone image, so momentum recovers.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusion of industrial archaeology with call-in psychic confessions feels fresh; the ghost shift reframed as community-wide PTSD is an insight, not a twist. Beaded valve wheels as worker-prayer counters transform standard ruin-porn décor into moral ledger. Risk is taken: climax is atmospheric release, not corpse-found, and it pays off because prior beads+calls earned the reconfiguration. Could shave 0.2 if Tommy Reeves subplot echoed less familiar eco-whodunnit template, but local detail particularizes enough.</comment>
