<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Mira’s contradictory impulses—gentleness toward roses vs. quiet defiance of her father—are alive in scene, not summary. The moment she offers Kael the cutting while refusing to abandon the farm crystallizes her hierarchy of values with tangible cost. Kael’s micro-choice to sheath the blade is credible because the script has shown him touch it twice before under stress. Only the father’s interior remains slightly generic; the daughter’s arc is fully earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The ending beat—“Tea sounds good”—is a Charged Poise: the blade stays sheathed, the farm remains, and the father’s tactical life is foreclosed with a single phrase. Causal chain holds: ballast-scrap roses → Mira’s refusal → offer of cutting → Kael’s renunciation. No orientation debt; dome, quarter, season are anchored by word 50. The dust-thinning light is the conceptual re-pricing that makes the cost social, not only personal.</comment>

<comment>The dome’s scratched glass and amber light are not backdrop; they filter every decision and literally color the final image. Ballast canvas, compass shards, and coral petals are micro-settings that constrain how the plants—and people—grow. Spatial choreography is clean: eastern airlock, western beds, entrance row tracked without drift. The environment charges the closure when the first clean light breaches the glass, proving the dome’s continuance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—continue the farm vs. surrender it—tightens once: magistrate threat revealed, then Kael’s real desire exposed. Mira’s agency drives the turn; she offers the cutting, not the father. Cost is legible: Kael’s sheathing = acceptance of daughter’s path and loss of his own. Escalation is single but sufficient for 700-word scale; no reversal is required.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Continuity-through-chaos emerges from grafted canvas and remembered petals, never from overt thesis. The final image of clean light reweights “engraved quiet” from abstract ideal to lived, costly reality. Father’s blade and daughter’s sheathed refusal create dramatic irony: reader sees the bounty hunter disarm himself with a teacup. Theme stays complex—pacifism is not triumphant but fragile, still needing protection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: roses “catching amber light,” sand “sifting from coat,” blade “sliding home” echo the same granular texture. Syntax modulates: longer reflective sentences for Mira, clipped fragments for Kael. Filter verbs are voice-motivated (“she caught the scent”) not intrusive. No head-hopping; interiority stays strictly with Mira until Kael’s single exterior gesture closes the story.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene pace: winding openings for planting, staccato when Kael enters. Information density high—single sentence slips hydraulics, paternal trade, and emotional distance. One mixed metaphor (“wind rose to a tranquil blaze”) is forgiven because it fuses tone and weather. No loops, no scaffold; every paragraph advances knowledge, stakes, or image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The pacifist-daughter vs. bounty-hunter-father dyad is fresh, yet here deepened by botanic alchemy: teaching roses ballast-balance. Tower-collapse dust as chronic weather re-frames apocalypse into slow ecological grief. Sheathing a blade with a teacup invitation is a risk-image that pays off without gimmickry. Specific detail (compass-roses turning north) makes the magic feel discovered, not pasted on.</comment>
