<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Senna’s interiority is concrete—she studies “spaces between sentences” and kneels to pour sand—but her contradictory impulses (preservation vs. the risk of scrutiny) stay verbal rather than enacted in a single visible micro-choice. The consecration beat is ritual, not personally costly; we feel no body-level stake as she “adjusts her half-mask.” Still, her perceptual signature (peripheral vision as tool) is specific and the Earned Stasis of accepting maintenance burden is legible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the whisperfield calm resettles with undeniable social cost—people must “keep noticing” or lose the clearings. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; density increases through repeated “pockets” until the final re-consecration reweights meaning. The cost is conceptual but unmistakable in the last image of “snow.” Orientation is clean by line 3 (“three days… beneath the dunes”). No causal contradiction.</comment>

<comment>The kinetic parapet’s metallic adjustments underfoot constrain Senna’s descent and later supply the sand used in the consecration circle—setting-as-tool. The murmuring pavilion breathes, guiding her to listen to pauses, not words. Sensory hierarchy is filtered through a line-walker’s peripheral discipline; world rules stay consistent without exposition. Micro-setting (granite stone) becomes the altar where meaning crystallizes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve the prophet’s clearings—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening: Senna’s recognition that direct scrutiny collapses the spaces forces her to act through sideways attention, a tactical narrowing. Cost is conceptual (eternal maintenance vigil) rather than visceral; the price is legible but not felt in body or resource loss, keeping it shy of 8.5.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: communal spaces exist only when collectively, peripherally believed in. The final image of “snow” quietly reweights the opening “dunes” into a shared white fragility—no moral stated. Subtext lives in gesture: people murmur softer after consecration, implying consent to lifelong partial blindness. No pseudo-profundity; insight is earned through tactile ritual.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly lensed to Senna’s sensory bias—she never “sees” a clearing straight on. Diction is controlled, poetic but precise (“wind through reeds,” “moth’s wing”). Rhythm modulates: long sentences for hushed pavilion, clipped fragments during the circle pour. No head-hopping; unreliability is not attempted, so distance remains stable. Voice feels singular and atmospheric.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or pressure. Figurative language is sparse, pattern-taught early (“spaces that appeared between thoughts”) and paid off at closure. Opening and closing lines are image-driven, propulsive. One mixed-metor danger—“snow” over desert—is rescued by conceptual repricing: fragility universalized. No register drift or filler stacks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The conjured-clearing premise feels fresh, yet its maintenance via peripheral attention is a clever inflection of observer-effect tropes. Prophet-less community forced into distributed faith is a social spec-fic angle rarely voiced at this scale. Risk taken: quiet ending without spectacle, but coherence holds. Specificity of kinetic sand and whisperfield fabric keeps it from abstract anywhere-land.</comment>
