<comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses—her need to “notice” versus her dread of being the only one who sees—are dramatized in the moment she pockets the orris root, not summarized. Interiority stays concrete and sensorial (“smelled of violets and earth”) rather than diagnostic. The final act of leaving without verbal prayer shows earned renunciation; the cost is the solitude she accepts as the price of witness. Micro-choices (handling the root, placing objects, touching the frame) reveal a hierarchy of values: attention > belonging > explanation.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the house “exhales,” reweighting the entire premise—houses need witness, not occupants. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern (displaced objects → life) is taught by 25 % and pays off in the hush-cadence shift. Causal chain holds: orris root pocketed → altar arranged → house exhales → Mara walks away, each step irreversible. Cost is legible in the final image: she “touched the door frame gently,” a quiet forfeiture of ever living inside.</comment>

<comment>The tideline, Kettering porch, and bay streetlights are not backdrop; they constrain access (she can only place, not enter) and supply the orris root and hush-shard that charge the ending. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven: Mara’s nose finds violets, her eyes catch “deliberate patterns” in weeds—details others dismiss. Weather/environment evolve causally: dusk hush literalizes into the shard that cuts the constant noise. Micro-setting of the windowsill becomes the altar where meaning crystallizes; remove it and the exhalation has no stage.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can attention alone resurrect abandoned space?—tightens once: the house’s exhale forecloses her fantasy of ever being welcomed inside. Agency is attention itself; no antagonist is needed. Escalation is textural: density of noticed details (root, marble, glass) accumulates until the hush-drop reweights the stake. Cost is the solitude she double-downs on when she walks back to the tideline, leaving the altar behind.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without labels: displacement seeks return, witness is a form of love, attention is architecture’s true load-bearing wall. Subtext lives in gesture—her fingertip on the door-frame is benediction without theology. The bay’s “breath held at dusk” returns as the house’s exhale, reconfiguring both world and reader. No moral is stated; the final image of steady streetlight on water offers a quiet, non-literal answer: light itself is enough payment.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is razor-sharp: Mara notices “six inches closer hedges” and “more greeting cards than medicine,” idiosyncratic catalogues that no other narrator would inventory. Syntax mirrors her creeping rhythm—long, tide-pull sentences that pause at commas like breaths. No head-hopping; distance stays mid-close, allowing “she realized” once without filter-verb bloat. Final cadence—“finally, gratefully alive”—modulates tone from hush to quiet benediction without voice slip.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances. “The bay held its breath” is an earned metaphor that pays off literally when the hush falls. Information density high: “bottle caps, smoothed glass, a waterlogged paperback” compresses consumer flotsam and human stories into one line. No mixed metaphors; “shard of hush” extends the glass-shard motif without violating physical logic. Read-aloud rhythm in final paragraph—three anaphoric “through” clauses—creates processional closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: architectural theory + marine salvage + scent chemistry + lyric elegy. Risk of personifying houses is fully committed to, not hedged; the world’s rule (attention = life) is cued early and followed through. Orris root as love-token for forgotten structures is non-obvious and specific to this voice. Transformation test fails—swap bay for prairie and the rooted scent vanishes, proving irreplaceability.</comment>
