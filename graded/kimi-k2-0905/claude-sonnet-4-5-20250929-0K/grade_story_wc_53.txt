<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Mira’s contradictory impulses—clinging to fragments while yearning for wholeness—surface in embodied beats (camera wheel spin, hand reaching). The final acceptance is earned because the text has shown her accumulating masks until none fit; the ghost’s hand is the first intact thing she grasps. Cost is legible: she drops the wheel, forfeiting her archive of borrowed selves. Interiority stays concrete, though “therapy-speak” creeps in once (“transformation without direction was just disintegration”).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the lagoon stills, Mira merges with her ghost, and the music she thought lost re-enters—undeniable conceptual cost under Accumulative lens. Causality is lyric but traceable: each scavenged fragment tightens the stakes until acceptance becomes the only unbroken motion. Orientation is taught by deliberate disorientation (carousel time, floating droplets) that pays off in the final stillness. One scaffold sentence (“Ambitions that would never—”) is trimmed by the drop of the wheel, keeping the beat intact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon is not backdrop; its upward spirals mirror Mira’s suspended want and finally grant purchase for the ghost’s walk—environment constrains the climax. Crystal platform, broken camera teeth, and cloud-stairs are tactile, re-used anchors. Sensory selection narrows to touch (wheel teeth catch skin) and hearing (music returns) at the exact beat of merger, charging the final image. No physics drift; world rules remain internally consistent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake: will Mira keep assembling borrowed purposes or risk the void of her own? Pressure escalates by accretion: each overheard fragment tightens the noose of borrowed identity until the ghost offers the first native memory. The tightening is single but decisive—acceptance forecloses the archive. Cost is visible: the camera wheel—her last external prop—falls.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges: identity cannot be cartographed from external scraps; it must be accepted as an internal ghost. Subtext operates in the lagoon’s impossible physics—stillness that moves—mirroring Mira’s stasis-in-search. No moralizing; the final whisper (“You were never meant to go back”) reweights every prior fragment without dictating meaning. Ambiguity lingers: is the returning music triumph or delusion?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Mira’s perceptual filter: “broken teeth catching on skin” is felt, not observed. Rhythm modulates—long spiral sentences during drift, staccato fragments at recognition. No head-hop; ghost’s whisper is heard through Mira’s nerve. Register remains within her lexicon; no corporate intrusion. The final line’s brevity lands as earned poise.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “water spiral upward in defiance of gravity” does triple duty (image, rule, mood). One paraphrase loop (“moving and frozen”) is forgiven because it names the paradox the ending resolves. No mixed metaphors; lagoon physics stays coherent. The drop of the wheel replaces exposition with tactile punctuation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Carousel-as-time-engine and scavenger-of-overheard-stories synthesize into a fresh angle on identity loss. The ghost is not a twist but the inevitable externalization of accrued fragments. Risk is taken: physics bends yet emotional logic holds. Could not swap lagoon for desert without breaking the mirror-between-water-and-memory mechanism.</comment>
