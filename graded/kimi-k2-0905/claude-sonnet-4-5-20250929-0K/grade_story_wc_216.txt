<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mira’s vocation and nightly mission are vividly particular, but her interior contradiction—guarding linear time while living in a world that has renounced it—stays declared rather than dramatized in scene; the moment she lifts the urn shard to the stars is the only beat where embodied emotion and micro-choice fuse under pressure, so the renunciation feels earned yet narrowly isolated.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each relic adds density until the final circle crystallizes a Charged Poise where “suddenly timeless hearts” carry literal fragments of fixed time; the urn shard’s return with reweighted meaning supplies visible, felt cost, so closure lands cleanly even though no causal turn narrows options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The emerald glass silo, the auction-code toaster, and the numeric-less night sky are sketched with selective sensory strokes that filter through Mira’s yearning; the tower itself becomes a micro-setting that constrains her nightly ritual and is charged in the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes—preserve measurable time vs. surrender to fluidity—are signaled early and tighten once when seven strangers respond to the coded ad; the deepening is textural rather than causal, but the urn fragment’s passage around the circle visibly raises the emotional price under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The theme of what is lost when measurement dissolves emerges from the tactile handling of relics, not lecture; the final image of “suddenly timeless hearts” carrying literal shards of fixed time offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a cool, elegiac distance that matches Mira’s archival temperament; diction stays within her plausible lexicon while rhythmic variation heightens the final stargazing beat, and no filter-verb clusters dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and image-dense, every sentence advancing atmosphere or stake; only one soft paraphrase loop (“fragments of fixed time… fragments of the old world”) keeps it from 9+ perfection, but the closing line’s cadence is flawless.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The “post-Shift” temporality concept feels fresh because it is grounded in garage-sale subterfuge and ceramic shards rather than abstract exposition; the risk of a quiet, accumulative ending pays off when the urn shard re-enters as a literal piece of lost chronology, making the synthesis feel inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
