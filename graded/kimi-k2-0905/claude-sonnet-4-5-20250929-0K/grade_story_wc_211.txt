<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Madame Verity’s muteness and Marcus’s twenty-year language quest give credible interior contradiction; the hand-immersion beat crystallizes their bond with embodied cost. Yet the leap from child to archivist is summarized, not dramatized, so the adult Marcus’s motives feel inherited rather than freshly earned. Still, the oath ledger refusal at the end lands as Earned Stasis with visible weight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The accumulative design teaches its pattern early—wax shavings as emotional fossils—and holds to the finale. Orientation is clean by word 100; the twenty-year ellipsis is a single authorized transition. Closure is a Charged Poise: Marcus accepts the ledger, foghorn permanently silenced, cost legible in the weight of dead tongues he must now carry.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The rooftop orchard, phonograph pavilion, and vials of coiled wax function as micro-setting—every prop is handled, never merely viewed. Apple blossoms falling without wind reweight the prophecy beat, making the garden an active participant. Spatial choreography is flawless across the two time shards.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—who curates the city’s emotional memory—tightens when the foghorn’s final silence triggers the ledger’s opening. Marcus’s agency is delayed until adulthood, but the childhood immersion seeds the decisive future choice; the cost is the lifetime spent learning extinct languages to honor that moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through the image of grooves cut twice—once in wax, once in destiny—without editorial commentary. The final line’s imperative “teach others” reframes the entire orchard as a quiet academy of grief. No moral is stated; the ledger itself is the embodied thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyrical omni stays tightly filtered through Marcus’s evolving perceptions; perceptual signature is consistent—“words that tasted of honey and ash” could belong to no other voice. Compression like “five-thousand-year-old apple trees in grafted soil forty stories above the street” teaches the reader to accept elision. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from short percussive shards to looping chant-like clauses, mirroring the wax spirals themselves. No scaffold, loops, or mixed metaphors; each image advances knowledge or atmosphere. “Velvet disquiet” and “golden curl, translucent and impossibly thin” are precise, not purple.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The notion of archiving not facts but the emotional grooves left by extinct recordings is a fresh synthesis of memory studies and retro-tech. Risky time-swap structure pays off when adult Marcus’s linguistic obsession retroactively charges the childhood scene. The prophecy mechanism—accidental because three unrelated silences align—avoids contrived fate.</comment>
