<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elora’s interiority is textured—“the weight of forgetting threatened to crack her open like winter ice”—and her endurance under pressure is credible. Yet the story never tests her limits; the weaving succeeds without visible misstep or internal contradiction, so the promised flaw never complicates the final choice. She remembers, she sings, she wins—no blind spot exacts cost. Motivation is clear, but the absence of a fissure under pressure keeps her shy of high-band complexity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the woven dawns ignite a shared awakening with conceptual cost—“the realm she had labored to rekindle stirred at last.” Orientation anchors within 120 words; the inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of luminous fruit + song → density shift → reweighting. Escalation is present but gentle; no live option is foreclosed for Elora, so the tightening feels observational rather than decisive. Causality holds, yet the beat remains a one-way triumph; the absence of a reversible stake or persistent price caps the score.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The alchemical greenhouse, mica window, and star-fruit constrain every move; light is literally harvested and braided. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—Elora notices hum of foreign memories, warmth of dawn-essence, oak roots that exist in both worlds. Spatial choreography is tight: crushed fruit → copper basin → ribbon wraps around oak → light streams outward. The final image recharges the setting itself as the environment becomes the deliverer of dawn, satisfying the 9+ gate for environment charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reignite a realm—is signaled early and deepened by communal song-pressure. One meaningful intensification occurs when ribbons tighten around the oak and darkness thins to pearl; options for the world, not Elora, are reweighted. Cost is present—her exhaustion crack in voice—but the price is aesthetic, not tactical; no resource is lost or path closed for her personally. Escalation remains lyrical and diffuse, adequate for Accumulative lens but lacking a visible trade-off that would push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: collective memory as living currency, dawn as communal craft. Subtext lives in gesture—pressing palm to mica, crushing fruit—never in abstract lecture. Final image of thousands blooming with recognition offers a resonant, non-literal answer: shared remembrance is the sunrise. No tidy moral; the ambiguity of what the awakened realm will do lingers, earning the high band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric POV remains stable, focalization filtered through Elora’s sensorium—“hum of memories that didn’t belong to her.” Diction stays within plausible alchemical lexicon; no filter-verb stacks. Rhythm swells with song, contracts with tactile verbs—“crushed them carefully”—mirroring emotional arc. Voice is distinctive, sustained, and paid off in the final communal chorus without slippage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Sentence variety is strong; no template cadence or synonym loops. Occasional elevated phrasing—“accumulated hope of thousands, braided together”—is earned by lyric register. Mixed metaphors are avoided; aurora ribbons extend prior light imagery. One minor scaffold: “she would attempt the weaving” announces rather than enacts intention, but it is early and does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Great Reversal + mirror-world orchard of memory-fruit is a fresh synthesis; inversion of day/night is genre-familiar but re-cast through communal loom-of-dawn logic. Risk is taken with accumulative rather than causal plot, and it pays off in a charged poise ending. Specific detail—“each apple containing the essence of a dawn that had never broken”—prevents generic abstraction. Not quite 9+ because premise scaffolding (mirror world rules) is assumed rather than discovered, but transformation is evident.</comment>
