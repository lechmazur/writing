<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mei’s interiority is vivid—her haunted memory of drowning while clutching the jade is visceral—but her “search for unused love” is stated more than embodied, and the pilgrim remains symbolic furniture. The final release of the pendant feels earned because the camera-obscura inversion has dramatized her shift, yet the cost is poetic rather than personal. Dialogue is minimal, so relationship/status dynamics are N/A. A stronger gut-level stake (beyond metaphysical) would push this into 8+ territory.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the camera’s inverted image reveals the golden threads of “unused love” braided into the world, re-weighting the premise with conceptual cost (she relinquishes the heirloom). Causality is accumulative/textural: each bloom and spark adds density until the reconfiguration crystallizes. Orientation is immediate (twilight viaduct by line 3). No lens ambiguity; the final image repackages earlier motifs rather than explaining them.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The wisteria-veiled viaduct is sensuously anchored—scent, sway, phosphorescent footfalls—yet never clogs momentum. The camera obscura itself functions as micro-setting: its inversion literally reframes Mei’s perception and cues the closure. Spatial choreography is clean; pilgrim’s rail-walk is impossible but signaled as mythic, so physics waiver applies. Environment constrains the final gesture—she hangs the pendant on the vine that earlier received the love-threads.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“where did my unspoken love go?”—is declared early; pressure escalates texturally via accumulating gold threads revealed through breathing/ lens. Agency is contemplative: her steady exhale and eventual relinquishment tighten the meaning rather than options. Cost is conceptual (she gives away the inherited tear) rather than visceral; a sharper tangible loss would deepen the punch. Coincidence is absent; the pilgrim appears as mythic catalyst, not resolver.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: unexpressed emotion doesn’t vanish—it transmutes into the world’s beauty. No explicit moralizing; the pilgrim’s aphorism is embedded in ritual action. Subtext operates through倒置影像 (inverted image) and lantern-like blossoms—love made visible yet ungraspable. Final image re-prices the premise: relinquishing the jade is not loss but completion, resonant without sentimentality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-limited stays tightly fused to Mei’s perceptions; diction—“foggy lucidity,” “prayers made visible”—is lyrical yet consistent with an artist who sees metaphorically. Rhythm breathes with scene temps: longer sentences at twilight bloom, clipped exchanges with the pilgrim. No dialogue clutter; when he speaks, syntax is oracular, suiting mythic status. Compression (“three months ago...”) is strategic and anchored to present stimuli.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is image-dense but purposeful; only brief scaffold (“she felt it again—”) that could be trimmed. Metaphors stay coherent (water, threads, lanterns) and payoff in closure. No synonym loops or register drift. Final paragraph achieves charged poise via parallel cadence without drumbeat monotony. Proofing clean; one hyphen tweak needed.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fusion of camera-obscura optics with transmigration memory feels fresh; trope of “love become landscape” is re-seen through literal inversion. Risk resides in near-allegorical pilgrim, but his spark-trail is grounded in sensory consequence. Specificity of Kwan-yin tear + wisteria + viaduct anchors the concept; swapping any element would fracture the crystallized final image. Not quite paradigm-shift level, but memorable.</comment>
