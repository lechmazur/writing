<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Maren’s fifteen-year custodianship and the quiet ache of “failure” are rendered as embodied tension—hands tremble, memory reverberates—so contradictions act in scene. The decisive turn from keeper to crosser is earned: every prior ritual now reprices the flute as door, not artifact. Cost is visible when driftwood burns and silence breaks; the choice to vanish forecloses return. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels, but the arc leans on one micro-choice—play once more—rather than a full hierarchy of values under live pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the fold opens, Maren steps through, thunder returns—Decisive Change with conceptual cost (world-loss). Causal chain holds: because guardianship failed here, therefore passage becomes possible. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern taught early via “avalanchingly quiet” and flute-as-silence, then reweighted when silence breaks. No orientation debt; who/where anchored by word 80. One scaffold loop—“the first note… the second note…”—dulls cadence but does not touch the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Thunder-Echo Range as micro-setting: the canyon’s withheld storm and bleached driftwood directly constrain ritual layout and later sonic resonance. Body-as-setting surfaces in “hands tremble,” linking emotional state to physical environment. The gilded flute’s warmth and light-scatter serve as portable environment that charges the final fold. Spatial choreography stays clean—canyon mouth, slope, center—no impossible driftwood reposition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—harvest meaning from fifteen-year failure—tightens when silence literally folds. Escalation is textural: quiet deepens from absence to presence, then ruptures. Agency is renunciation/endurance: she forfeits monastery return by stepping through. Cost is legible—driftwood consumed, canyon hush broken, world left behind—but only one tightening beat; flute’s second use merely extends, not complicates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as “failure is the tuition for transcendence.” Subtext carried in the hollow reed itself—empty tube becomes conduit. Final image reweights earlier “beautiful cage for silence” into “door opening between forever.” No moral stated; resonance arises from specific inversion of custodial duty, not abstract maxim.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is austere, geologic, sonic—“avalanchingly quiet” compresses scale and danger into adverb. Rhythm modulates: long sentences for monastery memory, staccato for note-release. No head-hopping; single POV holds. Filter verbs serve voice—“watched it crease like fabric”—rather than dull immediacy. Diction stays within monk-lean lexicon; “fox-fire,” “junction” feel idiosyncratic yet earned.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Strong information density: one sentence often layers time, sensory, and symbolic work—“Thunder never came here anymore, only its memory reverberating through stone corridors.” One paraphrase loop noted above; no mixed metaphors. Opening and final lines anchor stakes and reverb. Minor scaffold: “she had… she had…” anaphora twice in para 1; pattern not taught, but low pressure zone so −0.2 only.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: custodial failure as portal key, silence as tangible material. Reed-flute-as-needle trope is re-seen via dimensional weaving rather than music-of-the-spheres cliché. Risk—quiet story hinges on metaphoric fold—paid off when fold becomes physical, charged. Thunder-echo range name could drift toward fantasy gloss, but grounded by glacial specificity and embodied cost.</comment>
