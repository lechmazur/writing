<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Aldric’s quiet competence and the micro-choice to trust the forget-me-not as lie-detector give him texture; the interior contradiction between mechanical perfection and moral rot is felt, but his final stance is more stated than performed—no visible cost on the page beyond closing the lid.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the gold-shift of the stone fragment reweights the world rule-set with undeniable light-return. Causal chain (stone → rust-covenant → reversal) is clear; one tightening beat suffices, but the cost is conceptual, not embodied in Aldric’s future—he leaves unscarred.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Resonance chamber functions as micro-setting: its acoustic properties actively supply the interference pattern that lets Aldric reverse the transmutation. Spatial choreography stays clean; “sound folded back upon itself” is vivid and purposeful, anchoring the climax.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—reclaim stolen light—signals early; escalation is the audible wilting of the flower then the visible gold shift. Agency is cerebral: tuning-fork counter-sound + dawn-oil. One meaningful tightening qualifies; cost is conceptual (light restored) rather than a lost option for Aldric.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without label: the ethics of mending what was never mechanically broken. Final image—echoes singing below—reconfigures meaning: small repairs can re-balance cosmic scales. Resists moralizing; ambiguity lingers on who planted the stone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise; diction stays within a tinkerer’s lexicon (“jeweler’s loupe,” “tinkersong wonder”). Rhythmic control under pressure: long sentences for echoing resonance, crisp fragments at climax. No head-hopping; perceptual signature consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>High information density lines (“sound folded back upon itself in endless, shimmering echoes”). One template cadence run (“He… then he…”) but outside peak beat. Metaphors stay coherent; no mixed vehicles. Minor scaffold in “mahogany case gleaming dully” but does not obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fusion of alchemical philosophy with music-box miniaturism feels fresh; “covenant of rust” as metaphor for moral oxidation is non-obvious. Risk: quiet cerebral resolution, but coherence holds. Could swap Paris for opera-house, so freshness is concept-level, not locale.</comment>
