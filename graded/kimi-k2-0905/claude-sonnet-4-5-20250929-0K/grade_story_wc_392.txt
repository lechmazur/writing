<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elena’s interiority is sharp—her “watchfully calm” stance is embodied when she radios Reeves while photographing evidence. The contradiction between habitual obedience and the moment she uploads to encrypted storage is vivid, but the turn is compressed into a single clause; we don’t feel her body rebel or the acid taste of risk, so the cost is declared, not endured. Malcolm stays a memory outline, never tested in scene, so his remembered motives don’t ripple back to pressure Elena’s choice. Still, her micro-choice to lie on-air is cleanly causal and specific to her training.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Causal chain is tight: lantern → hidden chamber → Malcolm’s notes → Elena’s decision to expose Reeves. The Orientation Test is met within 120 words (who/where/when anchored in tunnel flood). Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the lanterns’ historical “safe passage” flips to modern whistle-blowing, with visible cost—Elena’s career is now forfeit, signaled by her upload to journalists. One minor scuff: the drought-to-flood timeline is told twice in adjacent sentences, a small loop that dulls the propulsion just before the squeeze-through beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The tunnel is more than backdrop—water depth constrains movement, brick gap supplies the hidden chamber, lantern light literally guides Elena’s gaze to the wall carvings. Sensory hierarchy is POV-filtered: corroded brass, cold water ankle-level, radio crackle all reflect a utilities investigator’s priorities. Micro-setting (the lantern) constrains the final image—she holds it up to cast shadows, linking past fugitives to present escape. No weather clichés; the drought’s end is causal, not decorative.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake (justice for Malcolm vs. career survival) is signaled by line 7. Pressure tightens when Elena spots fresh symbols matching Malcolm’s apartment—this micro-turn forecloses the “accident” theory and forces her to choose complicity or exposure. Cost is visible: she uploads files to journalists before leaving the tunnel, trading seven years of patronage for moral clarity. The escalation is linear, not deepened, but at 750 words one meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme of historical vs. present corruption emerges organically; no character states “history repeats.” Lanterns migrate from artifact → evidence → moral compass without authorial nudge. Final image reweights “safe passage” from 1858 fugitives to 2023 whistle-blower, a Conceptual Repricing that invites reflection on what freedom costs. Subtext in Elena’s radio silence carries the real rebellion, not speech.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited stays strictly inside Elena; no filter-verb bloat. Perceptual signature is investigator-cold: “cataloging evidence,” “empirical observation,” metal corrosion read as dating code. Radio dialogue is terse, bureaucratic, distinct from interior syntax. One minor register drift—“fortified vulnerability” is interpretive rather than embodied—but the phrase occurs only once and is earned by context.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Clarity and density are high: “lantern’s brass surface had corroded green” fuses visual, material, and historical data in one clause. Rhythm modulates—long sentence for chamber discovery, staccato for radio exchange. No mixed metaphors or looped paraphrase. Proofing clean; punctuation precise. Final sentence achieves lyrical lift without purple: “Some paths, she thought, get walked more than once.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Combines Underground Railroad relics with subway infrastructure fraud—a fresh synthesis rather than trope recycle. The lanterns’ reuse as both evidence and moral mirror feels inevitable after setup. Risk is moderate (institutional corruption is familiar ground), but specificity of 1858 brick behind 1970s concrete keeps it from sliding into generic whistle-blower template. Transformation test fails if relocated to prairie town, proving locale is integral.</comment>
