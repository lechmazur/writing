<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mara’s shifting selves are shown through distinct micro-choices—reciting doggerel, shelving in silence, planting with September’s “sharp-edged” grin—each tied to a visible cost (memory loss, emotional whiplash). The friendship with Kai dramatizes a believable crucible: shared Tuesdays that keep both alive post-incarceration. Only the “molting” mechanism is asserted more than demonstrated; we’re told August wept but not shown why that self mattered. Still, the ending renunciation—planting futures she won’t recognize—pays the price of identity flux on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: moonlit planting accretes meaning until the final image reweights the stakes. Closure is a Charged Poise: the library floor becomes a garden she’ll never see bloom, crystallizing cost. Causality is lyric rather than strict—seed cache hidden before evacuation → moonlit sowing → futures unmoored from any single self—yet pattern is taught early and holds. One hairline slip: the “blooming resistance” macro-narrative is referenced but never tested on-page; it doesn’t rupture closure, yet keeps the score sub-9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Corrugated metal “peeled back like a sardine can,” moonlight “liquid silver” spilling through—setting is tactile, specific, and filters through September’s bias toward fracture and neglect. The library itself constrains choice: only here can seeds survive heat, only under peeled roof can moonflowers root. Spatial choreography clean: Kai digs where dust is deepest; Mara sorts while crouched. Environment mirrors interior state without overt symbolism—roof hole = identity hole—yet never stalls action. Meets 9+ gate: the roof-gash recurs in final image, charging the blooming act.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—beauty from anarchy—signals early and tightens through accumulative beats: each seed planted is a renunciation of future memory. Agency is lyrical but legible: September chooses to plant what October won’t remember, narrowing her own options. Cost is felt: she pays with erasure. Secondary stake—friendship survival—applies quiet pressure; Kai’s laughter anchors her momentarily. No reversal is needed; deepening occurs as moon climbs and each trowel-cut forecloses tomorrow’s recognition. Escalation stays under Accumulative lens; cost is visible in final “futures we won’t recognize.”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: seeds that thrive in darkness, selves that shed monthly, library roof torn open—all refract the question of what can grow from ruin. Subtext lives in gesture: Kai tamping soil while recalling her August silence says more than any manifesto. Final penny poem is knowingly terrible, resisting didacticism; the sting is that art’s worth is only a penny yet still worth making. Ambiguity lingers—will flowers or forgetting win?—without moral tag. Slight over-articulation of “forge beauty from anarchy” costs the final tenth.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person close stays locked to September’s perceptual signature: angles of thought, borrowed smiles, metallic tastes of fracture. Rhythm modulates—long cadence for lunar spill, staccato for seed packets slapped on warped table—mirroring interior flux. Dialogue distills difference: Kai’s clipped “You’re different again” vs. her improvised doggerel; voices diverge under pressure yet converge in shared laughter, effect intentional. No head-hop; diction stays within desert-poet lexicon. Compression (“molting started years ago”) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty: “moon cleared the skyline, bright and merciless” paints scene and foreshadows cost. No paraphrase loops; each image advances. Metaphors stay coherent—sardine-can roof, liquid-silver light—without mixed vehicles. Filter verbs minimal; perception rendered direct: “hands move differently.” Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line recharges motif of unrecognizable futures. One scaffold trace: “someone had scattered wildflower seeds…” could compress, but occurs early enough not to dull closure.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusion of post-prison seed-bombing with dissociative identity is fresh; trope of vagrant prophet reclothed as botanist of the self. Specificity—wax-paper seed packets inside coffee tin—grounds premise in tactile detail. Lyric structure risks gimmick yet pays off: forgetting becomes necessary fertilizer. Risk heightens stakes: reader must accept monthly amnesia as gift, not pathology. Transformation test passes: story collapses if Mara stays one self. Slight proximity to eco-resistance meme keeps it sub-9, but angle feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
