<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—obsessive caretaker vs. centuries-weary witness—stays active in every ectoplasmic micro-choice (ringing the bell, kneeling with chalk). Embodied emotion is precise: “chalk felt strange in her ectoplasmic fingers—simultaneously there and not there.” Final renunciation of solitude (“she wasn’t doing it alone”) is earned by the因果链 of nightly messages that literally cost her solitary identity. No label-speak; ghostly limitation stays consistent and flawed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: each dawn chalk-message tightens the settlers’ interdependence, pattern visible by midpoint. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Mara’s fading into light crystallizes her exclusion from the very community she restored; cost is the visible erasure of her hand. Persistent constraint (she can only manifest enough to grip brass) shapes every tactic. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored in first 60 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Floating rock arches and perpetual twilight are not postcard fluff—they cast literal shadows that dictate where chalk can be read at dawn. Brass bell recurs as handled object, its chime re-weighted in closure when Kessa rings it twice, now voicing communal agency instead of ghostly summons. Micro-setting (abandoned sidewalks from prior colony) supplies the only writable surface, constraining Mara’s strategy. Sensory economy: silver-leaf blight is tasted as ash, not seen as colour.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can a ghost prevent social fracture—is signaled in para 1. One meaningful tightening: chalk messages move from barter prompts (“Who has water?”) to mandatory convocation (“Meet at the third arch Tuesday dawn”), forcing physical convergence under floating arch. Cost is legible: settlers relinquish hoarded scraps; Mara relinquishes anonymity. Escalation is accumulative, not causal-reversal, but pattern break at week two reweights stakes cleanly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without thesis lines: collective survival is built not on abstract unity but on iterative, low-stakes trades that rewire trust. Final image of nebula above arch conceptually re-prices “respite” as process, not place—stars forming from prior collapse. No sermon; Kessa’s double bell-ring is gesture-only subtext that community now speaks for itself. Ambiguity remains: ghosts can’t enter the future they enable, a cost left resonant rather than resolved.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person omniscient stays locked to Mara’s perceptual signature: orchard planet light is “perpetual twilight,” chalk is “strange…simultaneously there and not there,” nebula is “cosmic cloud where new stars are born.” Syntax mirrors ghostly drift—long, comma-ward sentences that float like she does. Dialogue sparse but distinct: Joren’s brambled hope vs Elissa’s pragmatic touch. No head-hop; settlers’ voices filtered through Mara’s ear.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is near-flawless: zero paraphrase loops, no filter-verb stacks, strong verb/noun pairings (“gnarled fruit trees sprawled,” “serpentine shadows,” “brambled hope”). Figurative language is spare and precise—one metaphor per beat, never stacked. Rhythm breathes with pressure: short sentences for dawn Manifestation, longer drifting cadences for twilight fades. No misplaced modifiers or tense slips; “ectoplasmic fingers” is exact neologism that stays within POV lexicon.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Premise—ghost community-organizer on orchard exoplanet—is fresh synthesis of familiar tropes. Risk taken: no villain, no single reversal, yet stakes feel large because collective effort is dramatized in miniature trades. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped—chalk on abandoned sidewalks requires failed colony history + floating arches to justify writable surface. Final nebula reprise is non-obvious payoff seeded early. Minor deduction: “refugees from a dozen dying worlds” is thumbnail backstory.</comment>
