<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The researcher’s reverse-aging is a striking premise, but her interior contradiction—teaching what she will forget—stays declarative (“I already have”) rather than embodied in a micro-choice during the lesson. The student’s trembling arrival is the only visible cost; neither character pays a new price on-page at closure, so the arc feels observationally static.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure is a quiet Conceptual Repricing: the teacher knowingly gifts knowledge she will lose, creating a forward/backward paradox with felt conceptual cost. Causal lattice holds—each prior image (stone, ripples, grotto) recurs in the final paragraph as charged echo—so Accumulative/Textural lens is coherent. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Magnetic grotto, floating platform, and pond micro-setting are re-used as tactile teaching tools; platform descent in the final beat physically enacts the “passing forward” idea, charging closure. Starlight-on-magnetism rule stays consistent and is learned through action rather than exposition. Sensory selection skews visual, but the returning ripples supply the required auditory/temporal layering.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—imparting the art of vanishing—remains abstract; the only tightening is the student’s half-trance glimpse of “still points,” but no live option is foreclosed and no visible price (fatigue, risk) is paid. Escalation is tonal rather than tactical; pressure plateaus after the first ripple demonstration.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of transitive memory emerges organically from the paradox of teaching what one will forget; final image reweights earlier ripples as metaphor for knowledge waves the teacher will never ride. Avoids overt thesis statement, letting resonance accrue through image. Minor slack: “sycamore hush” is named twice rather than shown through new sensory evidence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a consistent autumnal hush; syntax elongates in trance passage, then contracts at descent, mirroring altered time sense. Perceptual signature—“quality of sycamore hush”—is character-specific and not generic. No dialogue contamination; single POV remains modest and stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is selective rather than overbearing. One scaffold loop: “through the patterns…” clause is repeated verbatim, dulling immediacy. No mixed metaphors; closure sentence is crisp and image-driven.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Reverse-aging mentor + magnetic starlight grotto + ripple-as-cosmic-notation is a fresh synthesis; premise feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk is conceptual rather than plot-twist, but it fully commits. Slight deduction for near-echo of familiar “teacher who forgets” trope, though inversion of time direction complicates it.</comment>
