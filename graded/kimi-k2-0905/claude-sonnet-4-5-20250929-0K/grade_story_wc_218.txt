<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Maren’s “brazen calm” is shown through steady, embodied labor rather than abstract self-talk; the diary-guided micro-choices (wrapping copper, chiseling limestone) externalize her motivation and track a credible arc from caretaker to participatory architect of interspecies dialogue. Interior contradiction is light—she never doubts the task—so the arc is more steady revelation than wrenching change, but the cost is legible in her final exhaustion. The reflective blocks stay anchored to present tactile cues and alter her next move, satisfying BRR. A hair more contradiction or risk of failure would lift this into 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: Maren’s last breath joins the orchard’s “ancient dialogue,” reconfiguring the stakes from human survival to collaborative continuation; the cost is the irreversible forfeiture of her remaining time and life. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—each copper wrap and fungal transplant thickens the texture until meaning crystallizes in the final image. Causality holds: diary → remodel → orchard awakens → her death as gift. The Orientation Test is satisfied by line 3; no debt. A tiny lift: the six-month prognosis is declared but never visibly narrows her calendar or choices, so urgency is conceptual rather than tactical.</comment>

<comment>The temple orchard is not backdrop but active co-protagonist: porous limestone breathes, copper veins conduct, fungal lines map communication—every remodel beat rewrites the setting’s capabilities. Micro-setting inside the diary’s margins (fading ink, loose stone) and the copper wire itself function as handled tools that constrain action and charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy is caretaker-specific: she smells mineral breath, notes iron blooms, hears birds arrive—never tourist-catalog. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no impossible positions or prop drift. Environment, tool, and recurring diary converge to enable the ending’s conceptual reprice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: prove collaborative architecture before death. Pressure escalates via accumulative deepening—each copper wrap and pillar reopened enlarges the living network, making her finite breath the visible currency. No external antagonist is needed; time is the compressive force, though it stays abstract (no calendar markers). The final tightening is the fox beneath the altar—an undeniable index that the network now overrides territorial old rules, forcing her to accept her own obsolescence as caretaker. Cost is legible: her last morning is “too weak to walk,” a direct bodily price for the remodel.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without slogan: respect = architecture, not tolerance. The diary’s marginalia and Maren’s bodily labor argue the thesis in concrete particulars; the fox and humming pillars reweight “respect” from moral stance to measurable ecological shift. Final image reprises the opening fog-calm but flips it outward: her exhalation joins the orchard’s breath—Earned Stasis that forecloses any human-centered afterlife. Subtext is in silence: no dialogue, only gesture and fungal lines. The conceptual reprice lands clean: collaboration outlives the individual, but the cost is her extinction—a nuanced, non-tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Maren’s perceptual filter: copper “gleamed like veins carrying intention rather than blood” is caretaker-metaphor, not omniscient flourish. Rhythm modulates—long horticultural sentences for pruning, staccato “she rewired seventeen oak branches” for compulsion. No filter-verb clusters; every noticing is action-anchored. Diction stays within her lexicon: “mycorrhizal,” “fruiting bodies” are terms she’d inherit from the diary. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. The final compression into a single exhalation satisfies poetic closure without syntactic monotony. A hair more idiosyncratic speech in her diary addendum would perfect it.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured: “limestone that breathed moisture and harbored entire ecosystems” fuses geology and biology in one stroke. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances either remodel progress or sensory re-calibration. Metaphors are consistent—copper as veins, orchard as translation device—no mixed vehicles. Opening line anchors voice and stakes simultaneously; final line resolves by image (“added her final breath to that ancient dialogue”) that recharges “brazen calm.” Minor register lift in “conceptual repricing” is earned by prior material. Proofing clean; no typos or tense slips. Artifact-free in final third, so 9-band remains open.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses eco-architecture with terminal-caregiver narrative—fresh synthesis rather than stock dystopia or memoir. The copper-wired, fungus-linked temple is a specific invention that would collapse if transplanted to another setting; transformation test passed. Risk is taken by refusing sentimental death-bed conversion; instead Maren’s extinction becomes the orchard’s activation signal. Diary-as-device could feel contrived, but its faded ink and shaking final entry ground it in material history. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable yet non-obvious in hindsight: death as collaborative patch. Specificity of “porous limestone breathing” versus generic “sacred grove” elevates freshness.</comment>
