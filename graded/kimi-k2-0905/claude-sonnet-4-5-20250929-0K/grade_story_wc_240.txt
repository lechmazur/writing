<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid and profession-specific; the compulsion to map every human moment as a breach is dramatized through bodily insomnia and the hour she keeps. The laser-pointer button becomes a tactile micro-choice that externalizes her contradiction—clutching vs. releasing—so the final “delete his number” feels earned rather than therapeutic declaration. Chen is sketched only as catalytic stranger, but since relationship crucible isn’t required for single-POV, the absence of his interiority is acceptable. What keeps this from 8+ is that the self-forgiveness beat is slightly abstract; we see the decision but not the immediate visceral cost (no tremor, no aftershock of emptiness) so the Earned Stasis is present yet under-embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the button’s release enacts the physics metaphor and reweights her future options with undeniable, quiet cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—each fungal glow and network talk adds density until the final cadence shift (“quiet wildfire of her understanding”) crystallizes the stance. Orientation is anchored by word 80 (warehouse, pre-dawn, observation deck) and no props teleport. The single soft spot: the ex-partner is never given even a shard of on-page memory, so the “before” is more inferred than felt; this nudges cost legibility down a hair but does not rupture the lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The mushroom beds function as both environment and metaphor machine: their permeable mycelium literally guides Chen’s nutrient-mapping choice and gives Mara the conceptual breakthrough. Sensory selection is POV-filtered—she clocks “climate-controlled beds” and “blue-green frequency” because they mirror data flows she can’t stop seeing. Spatial choreography is exact: metal stairs, railing, tablet sketching, button exchange—all track without drift. The setting charges the final image: the glowing rows remain after she decides, quietly repricing what “network” now means to her.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can she stop treating attachment as a security breach?—is signaled early and tightens once: the button micro-act forces the trade-off between continued analysis and release. Agency is present; no coincidence resolves anything. Cost is legible but modest—she forfeits nightly rumination and deletes the number; because the story frames this as sufficient renunciation under its own quiet register, the price feels scaled to 700-word Accumulative design even if not viscerally wrenching.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: permeability as life practice vs. intrusion-proofing as life prison. The mushrooms’ wordless glow reconfigures “network” from vulnerability to nourishment, a Conceptual Repricing that lands in the final paragraph. No moral is preached; the reader is left to feel the paradox that security expertise became her own jail. Subtext lives in gesture—handing over the disemboweled button says “I trust you with my broken mechanism” louder than any confessional dialogue.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person tight stays locked to Mara’s perceptual filter; no head-hop. Syntax is controlled and slightly technical—nouns like “substrate connections” and “frequency” mirror her professional lexis without jargon overload. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for fungal description, abrupt fragments when she admits “I see networks,” mirroring hyper-focused attention. The final “quiet wildfire” risks poetic overkill but reads as intentional cadence shift to mark closure, so allowed.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, high-density; no paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks. Figurative language is sparse and coherent—“glowed in waves like slow breaths” is the only simile, justified by bioluminescence. Sentence openings vary; paragraphs trim fat. One microscopic repeat: “quiet wildfire of understanding” appears twice; because the second is the resonant final line, the echo feels purposeful rather than scaffold. No artifacts touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The cyber-security / mycelium nexus is fresh; merging digital intrusion with fungal permeability yields a non-obvious thematic angle. Risk is modest—quiet character epiphany piece rather than structural experiment—so no bonus bump. Familiar “can’t sleep, goes to quirky place, meets catalytic stranger” frame is common, but the specific occupation and biological metaphor transform it enough to escape template charge. Ending reprises the opening fungal image with reweighted meaning, satisfying inevitability test.</comment>
