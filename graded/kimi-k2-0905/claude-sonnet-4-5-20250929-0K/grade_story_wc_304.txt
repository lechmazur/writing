<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyra’s vocation fuses beautician-mortician in every gesture; the oils, pigments, and thermal math are visible micro-choices that cost her calm and time. Contradictory impulses—feral scientific precision vs. tender grief midwifery—co-exist in-scene, not in summary. The emerald-chip beat on the girl’s forehead crystallizes her hierarchy: transcendence over personal safety. Only the “five-year” backstory chunk (≈12% of text) is pure reflection without present tilt, keeping her just outside 9-band. </comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the mirrors, chip, and aurora converge to reconfigure meaning—“endings could still hold light”—with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal linkage holds: because Lyra guards the thermal threshold, therefore the body stays workable; because she positions the mirrors, therefore the aurora multiplies; because the emerald chip is placed, therefore the pulse syncs and the moment charges. Orientation is anchored by word 40. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of rising luminosity and stillness tightens once with visible stakes. No penalty. </comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Skyborne grotto, carved-ice walls, and steam vents literally constrain every move—too much heat and the corpse slumps, too little and the skin refuses pigment. The aurora is not backdrop but active resource: its pulses dictate pacing, color choice, and final mirror angles. Body-as-micro-setting rules: temple temperature governs tool efficacy and emotional tempo. One hairline slip: “three miles above” is asserted twice; otherwise spatial choreography is tracked flawlessly. </comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—snatch last spark before dawn—signals early and tightens once when aurora peaks and mirrors must be angled now. Agency is renunciation/endurance: Lyra never abandons her thermal knife-edge; cost is the steady drain of vigilance and the knowledge the beauty will vanish at sunrise. No false escalation; pressure is accumulative luminosity rather than causal reversals. Could use one tactile loss (stiff fingers, cracked oil jar) to push into high-band. </comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: beauty as defiance of obliteration, not stated but enacted through pigment, light, and thermal calculus. Aurora-as-pattern and emerald chip reweight from pretty backdrop to cosmic Morse code in the final image—pure Conceptual Repricing. No authorial thesis, only particularized ritual. The “radiant hush” tonally mirrors theme without announcing it. </comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyric-scientific: “threshold of stillness,” “lucidly watchful,” solar-wind vocabulary all filtered through a woman who has memorized thermals and grief. Syntax flexes—long breathless clauses for aurora swells, staccato fragments for tool movements—yet stays legible. No dialogue, so no convergence risk. One microscopic filter-verb hiccup: “She had learned long ago…” could compress to “She learned…” but does not contaminate peak beats. </comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm toggles between glacial melt and quicksilver tool flicks; no template cadence. Figurative language is sparse, precise: “emerald chip blazed like a tiny star” is earned, not piled. Information density high—each sentence layers temperature, color, emotional calculus. Minor scaffold: “She had...” past-perfect opens three sentences in 40 words; stays under −0.3 threshold and never touches closure beat. </comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Frozen mortuary-airship at aurora altitude is a daring, fresh crucible; vocational splice of beautician-mortician feels inevitable once witnessed. Conceptual risk—stillness as active verb—pays off in final image without gimmick. No derivative echoes; ritual specifics (arctic-flower oils, whale-oil rouge) are ungoogleable. Transformation test fails if moved to terrestrial parlor, proving originality is baked into world physics. </comment>
