<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Mara’s obsession with manual intuition over algorithms is shown through tactile rope beats and the decisive override switch; the internal contradiction between scientific training and folk sensing is never stated, only enacted. Her seven-year vigil is embodied in calloused hands and the rope’s worn fibers, not back-story labels. The final choice to keep ringing until the stone cracks visibly costs her physical safety and institutional standing, satisfying Earned Stasis. No secondary character on page; headcount waiver applies.</comment>

<comment>Causal lens holds: because Mara trusts rope vibration over sensors, therefore she overrides the board’s system, therefore the valley hears a human-tuned alarm before the freak storm. Closure is a Decisive Change—she pulls manual control, foreclosing her career path with felt cost as stone splinters. Orientation anchored by word 65; no penalty. The only micro-turn (instruments finally catch up) tightens rather than resets pressure. Persistent constraint: the rope’s older sensing technology shapes every tactic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The rope itself acts as micro-setting: its hemp strands, smooth patches, and vibration under palm pressure constrain Mara’s choices and charge the final image. Wind velocities, stone buttresses, and two-mile altitude are filtered through her meteorologist’s priorities, never tourist-catalogued. Spatial choreography is clean—rope, bell, console, cracked stone—across the single continuous scene. Environment evolution (storm hits, stone cracks) directly alters her physical stance and confirms cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—lives versus credibility—signaled in paragraph four. One meaningful tightening: the rope thrums minutes before instruments register drop, forcing the manual-or-automatic choice that narrows her options to irreversible override. Cost is visible: stone buttresses crack, her professional future fractures with them. Coincidence complicates (storm arrival) but does not resolve; resolution comes solely from her sustained ringing under catastrophic pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the concrete conflict: embodied craft versus data supremacy, articulated through rope texture against silicon boards. Subtextual silence of “solstice hush” mirrors the tension between listening and broadcasting. Final bell strokes reweight the premise—old tech vindicated—without sermon. No late symbolic graft; rope meaning accretes through use, not allegory.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Mara’s sensory bandwidth; no head-hop. Perceptual signature is tactile-acoustic: “braided hemp fibers bleached white,” “deep thrumming traveled up,” diction precise yet mountain-pragmatic. Rhythm accelerates into staccato clauses as storm hits, mirroring bell cadence. No dialogue, hence no voice convergence risk.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentence variety tracks pressure: calm long sentences narrow to fragments during peak wind. Clean grammar; no synonym churn or filter-verb stacks. Information dual-loaded: “the rope wasn’t decoration—it was technology” advances both world rule and character credo. Only micro-loop: “stone chambers into the rock itself” could compress, but it occurs early and doesn’t dull closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: cathedral bell rope re-imagined as an atmospheric pressure instrument predating digital sensors. Storm-siren tester is an uncommon occupation, grounding speculative tech in believable maintenance ritual. Transformation test fails if moved to non-alpine setting—altitude-specific wind convergence is essential. Risk in privileging hemp over algorithm pays off; vindication feels earned, not nostalgic fetish.</comment>
