<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Marianne’s contradictory impulses—scientific skepticism vs. parental hunger—are dramatized in the warm tooth scene; the final “Teach me” choice is earned by prior interior fractures and carries visible cost (foreclosure of certainty). Interiority is concrete, bias-specific, avoids therapy-speak. The ten-year grief gap is sketched efficiently; flaw drives mistake (burying the false body). No status/relationship crucible on page aside from mother-daughter reunion, but that dyad is sufficient at this length.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the pulsing tooth reweights the rules with undeniable conceptual cost—Marianne accepts permanent liminality. Causal linkage holds: straw-body failure → garden reveals → Iris offers alliance → mother steps into cleft. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) is cleanly established by word 60. No lens ambiguity; Situational pressure crystallizes stance. Persistent constraint—“live in the cleft forever”—shapes tactics and final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Hedge maze geography is sketched sparsely but tracks; secret garden’s impossible flora (roses “colors that had no names”) functions as micro-setting that constrains choice—Marianne must accept unnatural rules to proceed. Atmosphere of copper-honey air and warm tooth grounds tension in body. Weather not relevant; omission harmless. Idiom consistent with rural-English vibe. Setting details integrated through action (following instructions, tasting air, picking up tooth).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—retrieve/grieve Iris—signaled in opening line. Single meaningful tightening: warm tooth proves substitution, collapses certainty and forces stance shift. Cost is conceptual—Marianne must relinquish epistemological safety; price is legible on page. Agency resides in decision to accept liminality, not physical combat; sufficient under situational lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from specific imagery (tooth, straw body, roses) rather than spelled-out thesis. Final reconfiguration: “make light from fractures” offers non-literal answer to how grief transforms. No overt moral; ambiguity remains (readers must decide if Iris is real or faerie construct). Subtext carried by tooth’s warmth and garden’s wrongness; avoids thematic echo penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly tied to Marianne’s medical perception and rural idiom. Prose rhythm modulates: longer reflective sentences early, shorter fragments at tooth reveal. Free indirect style clean (“She’d missed the biggest deception… hadn’t she?”). No dialogue until Iris speaks; single line carries subtext and advances plot. Voice distinct from authorial overlay; perceptual signature—clinical yet yearning—persists under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm; sentence openings vary; no template cadence detected. Occasional elevated phrase (“epistemological safety”) fits doctor POV; not drift. Metaphors consistent (light from fractures, bone setting). One paraphrase loop mild (“cleft now… lived in the cleft”) but does not obscure causality. Information density high; each paragraph advances knowledge, image, or stakes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fairy-changeling trope is refreshed through forensic skeptic’s POV and “bone-setting” metaphor for inter-world repair. Specific detail—warm baby tooth as living proof—feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk taken in quiet stance crystallization rather than rescue chase; coherence maintained. Synthesis of grief memoir + eco-fantasy + medical procedural yields fresh angle without gimmickry.</comment>
