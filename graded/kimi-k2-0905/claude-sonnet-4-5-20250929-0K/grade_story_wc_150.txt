<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Miriam’s interiority is concrete—her feet “choose directions while her mind sifted,” a lovely embodied contradiction—but the moment she decides to stay is delivered as abstract summary (“She would stay, she decided”) rather than dramatized choice with visible cost. The grandmother’s absence keeps relationship-as-crucible off-stage; villagers function as warm chorus, never applying individual pressure that would force Miriam to test or betray her hierarchy of values. Micro-choices inside the tomb are evocative (pressing blossom like “offering”), yet the beat that actually forecloses exile-versus-return is elided, so the renunciation feels assumed, not earned under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: Earned Stasis—Miriam renounces departure and commits to tending the inter-rooted dead/living bridge. Cost is visible in the final image (apple blossom pressed between palms, sacramental gesture that accepts perpetual caretaking). Causal chain holds: sundial base → tomb discovery → grandmother’s pattern learned → adoption of that pattern. One soft spot: the decisive “I will stay” beat occurs off-page between sunset walk and blossom ritual; had it been folded into the final image the tightening would have carried sharper punctuation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The catacomb ceiling roots “seeking the bones below” act as both literal ceiling and metaphysical constraint, guiding Miriam’s decision to preserve rather than extract. Apple blossom pressed at the end recharges every white petal seen earlier, turning floral snow into sacramental currency. Spatial choreography is flawless: sundial base size matches pedestal, pruning shears reappear as action tool, lamp borrowed/returned, all tracked without drift. Environment charges final image; without the orchard-into-bones logic the renunciation would lose its transworld resonance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restore vs. abandon ancestral ground—tightens once: discovery of tomb + sundial inscription converts vague pilgrimage into explicit custodial contract. Price is legible: weeks of labor, nights emerging “with dirt still under fingernails,” and final acceptance of lifelong rootedness. Agency is present but diffuse; the decisive “I will stay” is summarized, not dramatized under fresh pressure, muting the final turn’s snap. Still, the accumulated weight of roots-through-bones imagery makes refusal of exile feel inevitable rather than coincidental.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: living grafted onto dead, exile reversed by tending rather than reclaiming. No thesis statements; the sundial inscription “Time breaks all journeys…” reweights earlier exile trauma into cyclical return. Final blossom pressed like “offering” crystallizes the motif without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence—villagers bring tea, never demand, enacting the restored trust that words could not secure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays consistently tethered to Miriam’s perceptual filter: she half-recognizes prayer language, feels roots “like careful fingers,” notices petal-snow first through bodily surprise. Compression is lyric yet purposeful: “six weeks ago” collapses elapsed labor without expositional bulge. Syntax modulates—long reflective sentences in orchard, shorter clauses inside tomb when light fractures. No dialogue means voice must carry all texture; it does, with tactile specificity replacing spoken subtext.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary length and opening; no template cadence detected. Figurative language (“roots coiled around skulls like careful fingers”) is sparse, apt, never piled into purple. Information density high: one sentence often does two jobs—“She lifted it carefully, dirt cascading from its hollow center” reveals object, action, and sensory fallout. Only micro-loop: “She would stay, she decided” is immediate paraphrase of prior clause; a −0.2 nudge, not closure-touching.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Orchard-over-catacomb is fresh but not gimmicky; the inversion of burial into nourishment grows logically from grandmother’s letters and Miriam’s diaspora return. Sundial as diaspora clock—measuring shadow of exile—offers subtle conceptual twist. Risk is moderate: slow atmospheric excavation could have slid into gothic cliché, but restraint keeps awe authentic. Final blossom reprise feels inevitable rather than ornamental, synthesizing earlier white-petal snow into sacramental gesture.</comment>
