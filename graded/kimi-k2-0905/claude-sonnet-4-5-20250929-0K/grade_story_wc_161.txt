<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clara’s contradictory impulses—urge to flee vs. need to stay—are alive in the dust-mote mapping and in her decision to place the meteorite on the sill; the final endurance costs her the safety of perpetual reinvention. Interiority is concrete, biased, and bird-handler specific (“tracking how they rose on warm currents”). Only minor slippage: the phrase “learning to become” edges toward therapeutic abstraction, not quite embodied under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Clara’s placing the meteorite reweights her rule-set—she forecloses flight, accepts seasonal withering. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; the dust/meteorite pattern intensifies until the final image charges earlier motifs with cost. One micro-loop—“she continued her work, balancing…”—repeats the balancing image without new pressure, a hairline drag.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Attic air-currents, skylight beam, and dust galaxies function as micro-setting that literally steers her attention and supplies the mapping method that reframes identity. Spatial choreography is flawless; the meteorite’s placement on the sill is a tactile, lived-in navigation of the same beams. Environment thus constrains the final choice, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—trust vs. reinvention—tightens when cataloguing honest paper trails replaces burning them; the dust-mapping beat is the visible price of staying. Escalation is textural: each catalogued cylinder adds density, narrowing her exit routes. Cost is legible but slightly diffuse; no single moment forces a trade-off with sharp sting.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the dust–meteorite polarity: visibility demands opposition (dust needs dark beam, self needs fixed anchor). No explicit thesis; final image reweights “paper trails” from erasure to inscription without moralizing. Minor sentimentality in “trust was a pigeon released into storm clouds” is earned by prior bird-work specificity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is stable: synesthetic motion (“dust motes swirled like a miniature galaxy”) and pigeon-handler idiom filter every notice. Free-indirect diction stays within Clara’s lexicon; no head-hop. Rhythm modulates—short declaratives under pressure, longer cadences for memory—without drumbeat monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often layers dust physics, memory trigger, and emotional charge. Zero paraphrase loops; only one scaffold phrase (“she continued her work”) could be cut. Figurative control holds to final line; no mixed metaphors.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: pigeon navigation + phonograph cylinders + meteorite anchor yields a quiet but non-generic arc about identity preservation. Risk—lyric accumulative structure—pays off in charged final image. Could not swap dust-mapping for any random ritual; specificity is baked.</comment>
