<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Meris’s interior contradiction—rational engineer vs. marrow-level caretaker—acts in every beat; the key’s warming against her palm literalizes the stakes inside her body. Micro-choices (climbing three steps at a time, striking the fork) visibly foreclose paths with cost, culminating in the irreversible fusion of her heartbeat to the chamber’s lock. No diagnostic labels; emotion is bone-resonant, not abstract. The earned stasis—she will vibrate forever with strangers’ guilt—pays the price in lived pulse.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: key discovery → frequency recognition → intruder threat → re-tuning → self-sacrifice; each beat narrows exit ramps. Closure is the decisive reconfiguration: her heartbeat becomes the new cipher, a living DRM key. Cost is legible in the final line—“the lighthouse sang on” at the price of her ongoing bodily subscription. Persistent constraint established: the frequency can now only be replicated if someone duplicates her living heart.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina is not backdrop but active antagonist: its groans dictate timing, its resonant shelf limits footstep tempo, the hum bars intruders. Micro-setting—the resonance chamber’s fork, the copper sound-baffles—becomes the surgical theater where the final choice is physically performed. Weather and architecture constrain every tactical move; the golden sunset is not color but countdown timer compressing decisions. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no impossible positions or teleporting props.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—protect absolution chamber—tightens through three causal ratchets: key found, outsiders silent-approaching, re-tuning must happen before last light. Agency is continuous: Meris engineers the solution with embodied tools under real clock. Cost is visible: lifelong somatic guardianship; the option of walking away is foreclosed the instant she strikes the fork. No coincidence; escalation is because/therefore linkage under Causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through sonic metaphor: memory as crystallized vibration, guilt as transmissible frequency. No thesis statements; the final image of a lighthouse singing through one woman’s pulse reweights earlier “sonic absolution” from folklore to lived bodily debt. Subtext in dialogue—Crane’s “you feel it too”—carries legacy guilt without exposition. Conceptual repricing lands: mercy becomes indenture, absolution becomes burden.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person POV remains tightly interior to Meris; no head-hops. Perceptual signature is engineer-auditory: she measures wavelengths, calibrates forks, feels harmonics in glove-fabric. Syntax grows clipped under pressure—“she climbed…three at a time”—mirroring tempo of ticking light. Crane’s idiom is weathered-maritime, distinct from her precise technical lexis; differentiation holds under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Concision is extreme: every sentence carries physics, emotion, and forward motion—“the key’s iron teeth were etched with wavelength patterns that made her engineer’s heart race.” No filler, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. Rhythm accelerates in resonance chamber paragraph to match ticking sunset, then settles into slow final hum. Opening line anchors voice and stakes simultaneously; final line resolves via image that re-cues “twilight song.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Combines lighthouse gothic, cli-fi ice harbor, and speculative acoustics into a fresh synthesis; “sonic absolution” is not generic magic but physics-of-bone. Guardian becomes encryption key—her living heart the one-time pad—an ingenuity that feels inevitable after set-up. Risk in high-concept mechanics pays off without exposition dump because every term is demonstrated through tool-use. Specificity of copper baffles, frequency-matching forks, and sunset countdown prevents theme from floating into abstraction.</comment>
