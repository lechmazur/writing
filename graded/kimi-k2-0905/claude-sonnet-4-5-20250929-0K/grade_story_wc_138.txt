<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Cassius’s millennia-fatigue and Naia’s half-life resentment are sharply embodied; their final exchange crystallizes a mutual cost. Interiority stays particular—Cassius tastes “the ghost of fear he’d thought long extinct”—and the choice to tear reality again feels earned by that prior ache. The only drag: Naia’s ritual knowledge arrives as given backstory rather than a prior dramatized micro-choice, blunting the fullest sting of her agency.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Earned Stasis: Cassius’s vow to reopen the wound he just witnessed carries undeniable relational cost under the Causal lens. Each beat obeys because/therefore logic—fragment arrives → dimensional mutiny detected → Naia reveals her plan → storm peak offers gap → she steps through → he decides to follow. Spatial anchors (prismatic escondite, obsidian desk, window) are in place by line 60; no orientation debt. One minor slack: “ritual that works even on half-immortals” is off-stage granted, not causally seeded in scene.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The prismatic escondite, magnetic fields, and cursed fragment form a micro-setting triad that actively constrains every move: walls bend light and admit the storm, fields become the door Naia uses, fragment is the key that must be bodily absorbed. Sensory triage—visual spectra, magnetic writhing, crystalline touch—mirrors Cassius’s dimensional synesthesia without slowing momentum. Final image of “threads of light…woven into the magnetic currents” lets environment, tool, and body collapse into one charged reconfiguration, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can Naia achieve a true death and can Cassius bear final unknowability—is signaled early and tightens once: when she sinks the fragment into her sternum, the option to stop her is foreclosed. Pressure escalates under Causal lens: storm peaks → dimensions refuse alignment → gap opens → she steps; Cassius’s last decision is a direct cost of that narrowing. Price is visible—her body unravels, his future is solitary plotting—but the beat is single-turn; a second complication or forfeiture mid-scene would have pushed higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme—immortality as endless waiting versus the right to a finite goodbye—emerges through concrete particulars (boredom as “most faithful companion,” the fragment pulsing with impossible rhythm). Subtext lives in gesture: Naia’s fragmented shadow through the wall prefigures her later unraveling; Cassius’s palm on stone is already mourning. Final image reweights the premise without moralizing: “he began plotting how to tear the dimensions apart again” turns his prior boredom into a newly costly obsession. No thematic echo or tidy maxim intrudes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person POV stays snug to Cassius’s synesthetic perception—magnetic fields “writhe like serpents,” auroras “hurt to perceive”—yet diction remains measured, fitting an immortal scholar. Naia’s dialogue carries hushed thunder timbre: declarative, weathered, fatalistic, distinct from Cassius’s analytical cadence. No filter-verb clutter; psychic distance compresses under peak stress (“something unfamiliar coiling in his chest”). One micro-slip: “understanding blooming like poison” edges toward metaphor inflation amid a high-stakes beat, but the rhythm recovers immediately.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: sentence length modulates, openings vary, no scaffold loops. Figurative language is selective—three extended metaphors total—each tied to POV bias (serpent fields, paper-fold reality, poison bloom). No mixed metaphors or register drift; technical phrases (“spatial coordinates keep shifting”) stay within Cassius’s lexicon. A single paraphrase echo (“dimensions are revolting…refusing their ordained positions”) costs a hair of propulsion, but it occurs early and does not recur near closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The synthesis—bored immortal meets suicidal half-immortal via dimension-rending jewelry—feels inevitable yet fresh, avoiding stock vampire ennui by anchoring despair in cosmological physics. Magnetic-field suicide door literalizes “afterlife as between-space,” a concept not previously templated. Risk is high: letting the POV witness but not follow could deflate tension, yet the choice to stay with Cassius turns novelty into emotional cost. Only the amulet-as-key trope is familiar, but its bodily absorption and geometrical storm warp transform it sufficiently.</comment>
