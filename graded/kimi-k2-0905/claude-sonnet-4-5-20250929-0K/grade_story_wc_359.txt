<comment>Mira’s synesthetic gift is shown in embodied, specific ways (“tasted sound as copper… whispers as violet threads”) and drives every perception; her seventeen-year prism-song vocation and the Council threat give a clear external want and internal need. The micro-choice to carry the amber sheet into the cavern and later to strike the ice column with her bell-hammer both reveal value hierarchy and advance the plot. The final renunciation—she realizes the bells never created wonder—carries credible conceptual cost, earning her quiet victory. No contradictory interiority; pressure distorts perception credibly (“colors swirled faster”).</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the sculpted hush unfetters, proving beauty’s utility via measurable frequencies the Council must accept; the cost is the loss of Mira’s illusion that bells manufacture wonder. Causal chain holds: Council threat → descent → aurora moment → cavern response → data recording → vote reversal. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“entrance… beneath the glacier”). One minor scaffold: “the exact instant…” sentence is pure setup, not dramatized, but it pays off in the cavern’s synchronous reveal, so waiver applies.</comment>

<comment>Ice cavern functions as micro-setting: its organ-pipe columns and aurora-bent light constrain acoustics and enable the decisive hammer strike that records frequencies. Synesthetic filter makes every detail character-particular (“tasted… copper… violet threads”). Spatial choreography is clean—she enters, lifts sheet, strikes column, exits; distances track. The amber sheet’s fossil memory and the aurora’s color conduit are tactile, lived-in tools. Final image of bells scattering “aurora-colored notes” recharges setting as home-definition.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—prove wonder essential—signaled in paragraph 2; pressure tightens when Council votes to melt bells. The aurora-chisel moment is the meaningful turn: it triggers the cavern response, narrowing options to “record proof or fail.” Cost is legible: Mira risks freezing, forfeits her belief that bells create wonder, and carries data whose authority she can’t control. Escalation is coherent under causal lens; coincidence (chisel strike) complicates, does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the reversal: beauty survives not by being defended but by being recognized as already sustaining life. Subtext lives in gestures—lifting the amber sheet becomes an act of faith, striking ice an act of science. No explicit moralizing; final sentence reweights stakes without sermon. The “sculpted hush” motif re-appears with shifted meaning: from myth to measurable silence that contains all songs. Conceptual Repricing at end makes cost social and existential, not sentimental.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Mira’s synesthetic perceptions; no head-hop. Voice texture is lyric yet precise—“throat of stars,” “crystalline absence”—syntax lengthens under awe, shortens when she acts (“She pulled… touched”). Diction stays within her sensory lexicon; no academic register drift. Rhythm modulates: aurora passage uses cascading clauses; hammer strike delivers a single clipped sentence. No dialogue, so voice must carry subtext—achieved through color-taste cross-talk.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence can anchor time, reveal synesthetic perception, and foreshadow (“amber music sheet trembling in frost-numbed fingers”). Figurative language is selective and pattern-taught (color = sound) so doesn’t swamp beats. One scaffold loop: “the way… the way…” anaphora in paragraph 9 is deliberate cadence echo, not artifact. No mixed metaphors; vehicles stay ice/light/sound. Occasional adjective stack (“green fire and crimson waves and violet curtains”) is earned by aurora spectacle. Final line crisp.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise fresh: synesthetic bell-ringer vs. utilitarian council is new, yet stakes universal. Sculpted hush as negative-space silence crystallized into form is an inventive conceptual object. Aurora as both light source and data conduit fuses magic with hard proof. Risky lyric accumulative structure pays off: pattern of color-sound synesthesia taught early, reprises at closure. If names/places swapped, core still works, but synesthetic-acoustic specificity and aurora-ice physics are irreducibly tied to this Arctic setting, satisfying transformation test.</comment>
