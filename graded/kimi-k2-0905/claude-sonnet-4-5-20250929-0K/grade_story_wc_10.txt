<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—voiceless yet “singing” through heat—grounds every choice; the moment she presses the fork to her chest and Chen photographs the pink dawn of hope across her throat, we see embodied, costly change. The only minor slip is the compressed leap from isolation to public installation; one more beat showing her risking exposure would have locked 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each fork-strike layers thermal pattern upon pattern until the final book of maps becomes a Conceptual Repricing—silence literally framed as music. Causality is lyric rather than plotted, but the because/therefore is felt: “she struck / color bloomed / visitors wept,” a tightening cadence that forecloses the option of ever reclaiming her old voice. Cost is indelible: the ocean keeps what it took, yet the closing image of the fork pressed to her heart reweights survival itself as a new frequency.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The shattered winterglass and the single unbroken tuning fork act as micro-setting: every surface Mara touches becomes a resonant plate, constraining her only available “instrument” to glass, ice, or skin. The conservatory’s fractured prisms refract both light and emotion, charging the final thermal bloom that visitors witness. Spatial choreography is clean: we track her path from ruined hall to frozen fountain to heat-sensitive panels without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translate silence into music—tightens through each fork-strike; the meaningful turn arrives when she decides to expose her thermal body to strangers, trading private grief for public resonance. Cost is visible: the pink hope on her temples is purchased by reliving the ferry horn in memory. One slight lift missing: a beat where the installation could still fail would have pushed the band to 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: music is not sound but the heat of surviving what cannot be spoken. The thermal maps reprice “voice” as bodily honesty—no moral, only the final image of the leather-bound atlas of her changing colors. The refrain of the unbroken fork quietly reweights from anomaly to instrument of survival, earning resonance without statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Mara’s perceptual signature: fractured light, internal roar, the feel of vibration through bone. Syntax lengthens and contracts with the cadence of fork-strikes, mirroring the accumulating patterns. No head-hopping; Chen remains a shadowy facilitator, his notebook line (“Sound isn’t the only language…”) the sole intrusion of external voice, perfectly timed.</comment>

<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density: “fractured into a thousand prisms by the ice storm” does world, weather, and metaphor in one stroke. Figurative language is selective—no mixed metaphors, no filler. A single scaffold echo (“the ocean had taken… the ocean keeps”) is purposeful refrain, not loop. Final line lands clean, recharging “frequency” as both sonic and existential.</comment>

<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The heat-mapping of grief into visible color patterns is a fresh synthesis that feels inevitable once introduced; the tuning fork as silent metronome repurposes a clichéd object into a survival tool. Risk-taking—making a music story without sound—heightens stakes without gimmickry. The premise would collapse if transplanted wholesale; its originality is welded to Mara’s specific, irreparable loss.</comment>
