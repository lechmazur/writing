<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lena’s curiosity and “desperate optimism” are concrete and embodied; the brass sextant fragment becomes an extension of her tactile drive. The interior contradiction—duty to demolish vs impulse to resurrect—plays out in real choices (tracing stains, drafting the proposal). The final gesture of pocketing the sextant and “already seeing green” crystallizes a credible, cost-burdened shift. Only minor shortfall: supervisor rejection is anticipated rather than dramatized, so the external cost is still hypothetical, muting the final sting.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the terminal’s fate is reframed from demolition to metamorphosis, with the emailed proposal as visible wager. Causal chain holds—each discovery (stains → flow map → overnight draft) is a because/therefore step. Orientation is clean within 120 words; single-scene arc with one time-skip (“By dawn”) keeps structure tight. Cost is felt—she risks professional ridicule—but because the supervisor’s “no” is off-stage, the price is slightly less than undeniable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Cracked dome starlight, cotton-candy ghosts, and shelf-mushrooms are selective, sense-rich details filtered through an engineer’s gaze. The terminal’s evolving “shadow infrastructure” is both metaphor and literal constraint that shapes her hydroponic plan. Micro-setting (sextant in her palm, condensation on blueprints) repeatedly guides choice. Final image of refracted light on crystalline windows charges the closing beat, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—save the terminal or let it die—is signaled early and tightens when she chooses to map the water flows instead of cataloguing cracks. One meaningful reversal: the same decay that dooms the building becomes the energy source for its rebirth. Pressure is coherent under causal lens; each new leak she traces narrows her options toward the overnight gamble. Cost is present (career risk, sleepless night) but could be sharper if a live rejection or structural collapse threatened immediately.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of reclamation-through-decay emerges from concrete pattern—water stains → flow map → living architecture—never sermonized. Subtext in the carnival’s pink spirals suggests brief resurrection without purpose, contrasting her engineered, lasting one. Final image of “voices where there was only echo” reweights earlier silence without moralizing. Ambiguity remains: the board may still refuse, letting hope stay costly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly lashed to Lena’s perceptual hierarchy: water stains, thermal deltas, brass arc. Syntax is controlled, rhythmic, with engineer-precision diction—“calibrated markings,” “micro-climates”—that never drifts into technical swagger. No dialogue, so voice distinction is carried through interiority and tactile action. Compression in the dawn-draft paragraph accelerates pace without losing clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—description seeds future action (“mineral deposits… refracting light” becomes the art-installation plan). Metaphors are sparse, consistent, and physically coherent; no mixed vehicles. One minor loop: “maze of intentions” appears twice with identical phrasing; a micro-rephrase would tighten. Otherwise clean, propulsive, and free of scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Post-industrial resurrection is familiar, but the engineer’s use of unintended hydrology as blueprint feels fresh and specific. Sextant shard repurposed as moral compass literalizes the theme without contrivance. Risk is taken by siding with decay rather than fighting it—an inversion that grows logically from the setting. Could push further into peculiarity, but remains memorable and non-derivative.</comment>
