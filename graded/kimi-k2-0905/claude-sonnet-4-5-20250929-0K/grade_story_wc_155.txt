<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—her need to make luminous murals that feel genuine versus the hollowness she can’t fake—drives every micro-choice from unwrapping the fragment to painting the studio wall. Embodied emotion is vivid: the laugh that surprises her, the softening vision, the midnight wall “blazing.” The final renunciation (she will paint the district itself in light) is earned by the因果 chain of studying the fragment and costs her the safety of generic cheer. No second character on page, so relationship bullets waived; solo-portrait depth is strong enough for 8+.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory layer of fog, phosphorescent paint, and fragment-glow adds density until the climax reweights joy as medium not message. Orientation anchor (“Mara lived…”) arrives by line 5; no penalty. Closure is a Charged Poise: the studio wall blazing crystallizes her new stance and forecloses the old hollow style; the cost is the irrevocable exposure of her new vision to the neighbors. Persistent constraint—perpetual fog—shapes every tactic; lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>

<comment>The ruined orchard district is not postcard backdrop; its fog governs what pigments Mara must use, what light she can harvest, and therefore how she can rediscover joy. Micro-setting objects—cracked plaster, phosphorescent jars, the studio wall—literally constrain her next brushstroke. Spatial choreography is clean: fragment propped, wall painted, glow reflected back onto fragment. Final image of ancient dancer seeming to leap again is charged by the very environment she has created.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can she paint authentic joy—tightens once she sees the fragment’s indirect method; options narrow from “paint happy figures” to “paint light itself.” Escalation is textural: each luminous layer increases the felt cost of failure. No antagonist needed; fog and her own standards supply coherent pressure. Visible price: she stays up until midnight, exhausting herself before the public mural deadline—legible cost under accretive lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: joy is not content but luminance within fog—shown, not sermonized. Subtext in the dancer’s “negative space” and Mara’s phosphorescent spirals reconfigures meaning without lecture. Final image reweights prior motifs (fragment, fog, glow) into a coherent non-literal answer. No thematic echo or moralizing paragraph; ambiguity lingers over whether neighbors will truly see themselves in her light.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly glued to Mara’s perceptual filter: she notices light angles, paint viscosity, fog weight. Diction—“phosphorescent blues,” “gray moisture,” “silver shimmer”—is specific to her artist lexicon. Rhythm accelerates during the midnight painting sprint, then exhales in the final reflective line. No head-hop, no filter-verb clusters; one spell of three “she painted” anaphora is purposeful pattern, not template cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Zero paraphrase loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances image, motive, or atmosphere. Mixed metaphors avoided; “light dancing across cracked plaster like exposed film” is single extended vehicle. High information density: one sentence can layer pigment type, emotional state, and spatial relation. Occasional elevated phrase—“crystallized final moment”—reads earned by pensive tone; no artifact touches closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Fresco-as-mentor and fog-as-studio-constraint synthesize familiar tropes (artist-block, ruined city) into a fresh angle: joy = medium not subject. Specificity of phosphorescent paint chemistry and “knowledge network” scavengers grounds the concept. Transformation test passes—story collapses without fog-forcing-luminous-method. Risk is moderate; originality lies in internalized inversion rather than structural daring.</comment>
