<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sera’s interiority is sensorially rich and embodied, but her contradictory impulses (grief vs. cartographic mastery) are stated rather than dramatized in-scene; the final renunciation is earned yet arrives in a single reflective paragraph, softening cost visibility.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each ultrasonic fragment layers until the sister’s melody reframes grief as home; closure is a Charged Poise—kneeling palms-down—where mapping loss becomes the new compass; cost is the lifelong labor of charting absence, felt on-page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Forest-as-instrument is tactile and specific; titanium rods and platinum ring act as micro-setting that constrain direction choices; the final image of palms-to-earth charges the stillpoint with bodily grounding, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Dominant stake—map her own grief—tightens when foreign melody reroutes her forward path inward; ultrasonic trail is coherent pressure under Accumulative lens; price (she must eternally chart loss) is visible, though escalation is single-turn, not compounded.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Theme emerges from concrete reversal: grief is not void but familiar territory; no moralizing, only image of palms pressed to earth reweights prior maps; ambiguity lingers—will the map console or reopen wounds—creating honest resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question><answer>Voice is lyric, textured, and consistent; perceptual signature (“languages bloom across clavicle”) is unique; minor poetic overlap (“quiet blaze” twice) but rhythm modulates with discovery; no head-hopping, distance stable.</answer>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varied, strong verbs, no filler; one mixed metaphor (“vowels and consonants on skin”) but figurative control holds under pressure; final line lands clean; no loops or scaffold detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Premise—blind cartographer of ultrasonic grief—is non-obvious; bat-grammar and titanium dowsing rods particularize; transformation test fails if moved to generic forest, ensuring freshness; risk (+0.3) in lyric structure heightens resonance without gimmickry.</comment>
