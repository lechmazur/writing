<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interiority is sensorily anchored (“thrumbed in her bones”) and the lantern glass choice is embodied; the final renunciation of hardening is foreshadowed by her wheel-life. Micro-choice hierarchy is visible—she wraps the glass before walking back. Still, the beekeeper’s flicker-existence lets her off a full interpersonal crucible; cost is more conceptual than interpersonal, capping at high-strong.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each kindness image layers density until the final chord tightens meaning. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise of lantern glow reframing her craft; the conceptual cost (“carry it forward”) is legible. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by line 3; timeline shards are taught early through lantern-glass rule. One shard, zero causality breaks; no meaningful orientation or lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The scorched-wasteland/oasis contrast is economically sketched through orange sky, distant smoke, and sun-pattern navigation; spatial choreography stays consistent. The lantern glass serves as micro-setting that literally reframes perception and drives the final image. Sensory hierarchy favors visual/tactile—appropriate to a potter’s sight-and-touch bias. Environment does not physically constrain tactics, so misses 9+ gate by a whisker.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“why some places resist change”—is signaled early. Escalation is textural: kindness fragments accumulate until the beekeeper’s speech crystallizes the trade-off. Agency is cognitive (understanding, witnessing) rather than a tactical reversal; cost is conceptual, felt in the final lantern-glow chord. Sufficient tightening for length, though lacking a visible resource loss keeps it sub-exceptional.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges inductively from honeycomb imagery, vessel metaphors, and phototropic kindness; no explicit moralizing. Final image reweights prior material by fusing pottery patience with beekeeping gentleness—earned CR. Ambiguity lingers: will she spread oasis-praxis or simply endure? Complexity embraced; no false equivalence. One abstract noun (“kindness”) is spoken aloud, but framed as potter’s realization, softening echo penalty to hairline.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to potter’s perceptual signature—sun angles, clay tactility, wheel-thrum vocabulary. Syntax mirrors her slow-wheel rhythm: longer sentences for meditation, fragments when glass visions fracture. No dialogue to test character distinction; internal diction stays within artisan lexicon. Patterned elision (“then flickered, then solidified”) is taught early and paid off at closure; zero head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density: one sentence often layers sensory detail, metaphor, and causality (“Through it, she could see…”). Rhythm modulates—lyric elongation vs. stark frag-lines—supporting pressure. Figurative language is disciplined; no mixed metaphors. Minor scaffold: two adjacent “she could see” clauses create micro-loop (−0.1). No artifacts in closure third; propulsion stays intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fusion of beekeeping, pottery, and temporal fracture feels fresh; each domain informs the other without gimmickry. Kindness-as-photosynthetic-anchor is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Vessel/void metaphor reversed into preservation trope. Risk of gentle dystopian lyric pays off. Could edge higher with a sharper external obstacle, but originality within flash length is exemplary.</comment>
