<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Cosima’s interiority is vivid—“ink-stained fingers,” “feral loft,” “salt and wild roses” all filter through her sensory bias. Her contradictory drives—obsessive collector vs. penniless outcast—surface in micro-choices (repairing the box, gifting it). The final renunciation of the box to Mrs. Chen costs her a tangible talisman, earned by prior beats; flaw (exile) becomes tactic. Voice remains singular; no head-count clutter.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each jarred sound thickens the pattern until the lullaby break reweights meaning. Orientation locked by line 4. Closure is Charged Poise: Cosima hands over the music box—conceptual cost is the surrender of her private archive, felt in the “heart jingling” line. Persistent constraint: poverty that forces barter of poems for lessons; price shapes tactics throughout.</comment>

<comment>“Salt and wild roses threading through floorboards” is selective, not catalog. The loft’s broken furniture and drift-treasures constrain her movements—she must crawl from blanket-nest, cart jars downstairs. Music box’s tarnish and mechanism mirror internal corrosion; final glow in jar charges image. Spatial choreography clean—dunes, boardwalk, town—no floating rooms.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: salvage vanishing sound-memory. Tightening occurs when the box’s lullaby emerges—knowledge that the song can be returned to townspeople narrows her option to hoard. Agency: she chooses to gift the box, paying social/story cost. Price visible: surrender of artifact and exposure of her hidden craft.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from pattern: fragments → bridge → communal restoration. No explicit thesis; final image of “heart jingling with purpose” reweights prior silence into song. Subtext in gesture: pressing box into Mrs. Chen’s hands = wordless apology for years of scorn. Complexity preserved—she remains vagrant, redemption is gleaned, not possessive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Lyrical, patterned diction taught early—“wind through dunes made music against broken glass”—and held. Perceptual signature consistent: Cosima sees corrosion yet senses tenderness. Rhythm modulates: long feverish sentences for jar-ritual, short clauses at box repair climax. No head-hop; POV distance stable. Dialogue minimal but natural when present.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: “she’d spent months learning to repair… trading poems for lessons” compresses time without scaffold. Mixed metaphors avoided; vehicles stay physical—storm-cloud silver, wax seal. One paraphrase loop: “she wondered whose hands… whose ears…” adjacent lines; minor −0.2. Final image crisp, no artifact touch. Read-aloud rhythm varied.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Sound-in-jars concept is fresh synthesis of memory-preservation trope, grounded in tactile ritual. Transformation test: story fails if swapped to “photographs” instead of sound. Risk: lyric accumulative structure rather than causal plot, paid off by resonant closure. Specificity—“baker’s daughter who drowned”—creates non-generic ache. No pop-culture echoes.</comment>
