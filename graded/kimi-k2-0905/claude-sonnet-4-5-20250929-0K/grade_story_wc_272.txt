<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical and specific (“luminescent ache,” “genuine struggle”); micro-choices track under pressure. Motivation drifts: initial “world no longer wanted her work” is strong, but later shift to “fragmentation was the human condition” feels imported rather than earned in-scene. Final renunciation lacks a visible cost—she simply “would paint differently,” no tangible forfeiture—so the change reads conceptual, not crucible-tested. Still, embodied emotion and perceptual signature keep her from slipping to mid-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the spiral burn reweights reality’s structure with undeniable cost (“truths remained… on her retinas”). Lens is Accumulative/Textural—density and pattern break rather than causal chain—held cleanly to end. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) arrives by line 5, well within 120-word window; no penalty. One soft spot: the walls’ reversal feels like an external toggle rather than consequence of her agency, blurring the because/therefore linkage under this lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: tarot cards, salt-stained windows, and compressing shelves function as active agents, not backdrop. Lighthouse beam recurs as heartbeat timer, constraining her rhythm and charging the final ignition. Spatial choreography is crystal—books track inward with glacier patience, no floating geography. Meets 9+ gate: the broken box reappears in the last image, now glowing, reweighting meaning.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—artist’s need to salvage purpose after serial rejections—signals early and tightens when walls literally close. One meaningful deepening: spiral card-layout triggers spatial contraction, forcing faster, riskier choices. Price is conceptual not corporeal: loss of prior aesthetic mode (“would paint differently”) is legible but less visceral than a forfeited object or relationship. Agency is present yet slightly diluted—walls stop because pattern completes, not because she gambles a concrete sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: rejected portraits → fragmented reality → acceptance of fracture as truth. No explicit moral, final image reconfigures premise with quiet fire. Recurrent lighthouse beam and tarot faces build accretive meaning without forced motif-checklist. One hairline slip: “Isn’t art supposed to comfort…” drifts toward editorial question;所幸被下文的燃烧意象迅速抵消。</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice carries painterly perceptual signature—“geometric shards,” “ink and prophecy,” “salt-crusted windows”—distinctive, rhythmic, compressed. Syntax tightens under pressure: fragments and em-dashes mirror collapsing space. No head-hopping; lyrical elision taught early (“reality itself had cracked”) and paid off in final flare. Within striking distance of 9+ but for a single over-explicit rhetorical question mid-text.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>High density: most sentences advance image or pressure; scaffold minimal. Metaphor vehicles consistent—light=heartbeat, cards=keys—no mixed logic. Loops absent; no synonym churn or template cadence detected. One clause of slight register drift: “conceptual repricing” level of abstraction appears in interior thought, but remains in character lexicon of philosophical painter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise feels fresh: rejected portraits transmuted into threshold tarot inside a closing lighthouse library. Fragmented-reality concept committed to end; no retreat to easy solace. Risk of spatial surrealism is taken yet causally legible under Accumulative lens. Could edge 9+ with a more visceral, irreversible cost on the protagonist.</comment>
