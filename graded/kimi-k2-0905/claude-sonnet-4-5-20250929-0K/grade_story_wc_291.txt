<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elena’s face-blindness and artistic method are dramatized through embodied action (charcoal choices, tactile paper-clips) and a single, costly renunciation: she surrenders the ribbon fragment to the portrait, sealing her inability to ever “see” Catherine yet giving Catherine back to others. The internal contradiction—painting what she cannot recognize—drives every beat; the final silence with Morrison carries felt cost. Secondary pressure is off-page (witnesses, detective), but Elena’s micro-choices remain the causal engine. Flaw: “diagnostic label-speak” moment (“she understood dormancy”) is brief and immediately paid with embodied cold, so stays within tolerance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final image of the ribbon in Elena’s hand reweights the premise—empathy itself becomes the recognized portrait. Causal chain holds: ribbon ➜ interviews ➜ ambiguous portrait ➜ witnesses ➜ Elena’s unknowing triumph. Orientation anchored by word 50 (“Elena stood at its edge”). One minor ellipsis—how exactly the portrait triggers three witnesses same day—is within motivated compression for 700-word scope. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern taught by recurring “furrowed hush” cadence; final silence crystallizes cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Quarry-as-body: limestone walls narrow Elena’s options (she must descend to paint), mist clings like memory, ribbon fragment weighted beside her acts as micro-setting that constrains the act of portraiture. Sensory hierarchy biased to Elena’s tactile compensation for facial absence—charcoal dust, paper clip pressure, cold stone under boots. Weather (mist) evolves with plot, swallowing light then releasing witnesses. Spatial choreography clean: descent, arrangement, ascent track without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—awaken dormant empathy to reopen the case—tightens once: the portrait’s completion forecloses Elena’s chance to ever “see” Catherine, trading her private blindness for public recognition. Cost is legible in the final ribbon hand-back and Morrison’s voice-breaking gratitude. Agency is attention and endurance, not confrontation; sufficient for Accumulative lens. No external antagonist needed; pressure is internal-ethical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: empathy is a portrait no one face can capture, only feel. Final image of ribbon returned to Elena reweights the motif—“dormant empathy” becomes the active artifact. No moralizing; resonance arises from concrete paradox of a face-blind artist painting recognition. Subtext in Morrison’s grief-tinged voice and Elena’s unknowing silence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person intimate stays inside Elena’s perceptual limits: faces blur, voices carry identity. Syntax grows clipped under quarry pressure—“methodical, measured”—then widens during interviews to mirror accumulating voices. No dialogue on page, so voice contamination risk avoided. Diction remains within Elena’s artistic lexicon; no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Strong information density: single sentences carry double duty (“mist clung…like memory itself”). One paraphrase loop detected (“furrowed hush” echoed twice in closing paragraph) but serves cadence, not scaffold. Metaphor coherence high; no mixed vehicles. Rhythm breaths with descent/ascent motion. Minor filter-verb cluster in interview summary is brief and does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: face-blind portraitist solving cold case via empathy-portrait is non-obvious and fully committed. Quarry doubles as metaphoric wound/memory cavity without overt allegory. Risk taken in refusing to show Catherine’s face even to reader; payoff lands in final resonance. Could swap city name, but conceptual core—empathy as portrait—remains inseparable from Elena’s condition.</comment>
