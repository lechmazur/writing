<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Marcus’s elevator-ghost gift gives him a credible, job-honed perceptual lens; the promise to Celeste crystallizes a single, costly renunciation that forecloses his original mercenary intent. Interiority stays concrete (“weightless burden…prayer”) and avoids label-speak. The daughter memory is the only telegraphed emotion, but it is anchored in a present tactile cue (looking up) so the beat still earns its place. No secondary character on page, so status/relationship bullets correctly skipped; micro-choice hierarchy visible when he pockets the barrel instead of the cash he came for.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: Marcus’s public promise repackages his lifelong “ceiling” obsession into ethical stewardship, felt cost in the quiet shift from demolition fee to guardian duty. Causal chain holds: ghost gesture → dust clue → box discovery → promise → fade; each step tightens options under the Causal lens. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) hit before word 90, well inside the 120-word guardrail. No teleporting props or retroactive knowledge; the mainspring’s inscription is new data, not a patch.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ticket office is sketched with sensory economy (“warped counter…exhaled must”) that doubles as body-attention filter for an elevator tech who notices air shifts. Dust-pattern micro-setting directly enables the pivotal discovery, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays clean: chair drag → climb → tile lift → box cradle; no floating geography. Circus referents (carousel, sequined leotard) evoke era without museum dump; fluorescent death sets temporal anchor and auditory zero-hour.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will he heed the ghost before the building is erased?”—is signaled in paragraph two and sharpened when demolition clock is mentioned. One meaningful tightening occurs at the dust-line disruption: the discovery forces a choice—profit vs. guardianship—whose price is the forfeited assessment fee. Escalation is modest but sufficient for 700-word scope; coincidence complicates (ghost arrival) but does not resolve. Cost is legible in the final paragraph’s “weightless burden” and his delayed turn to the broken elevator, i.e., the job he will now perform for free.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—“some hidden things must be carried back into light”—emerges through the mainspring’s journey rather than explicit statement; final image of the box under his arm reweights the earlier “ceiling” motif without moralizing. Subtext resides in silence: the unsaid circus collapse, the unpaid bill he now accepts. Insight is earned through tactile discovery, not lecture. Ambiguity lingers: we never learn how Celeste died or who hid the barrel, inviting reflection on anonymous custodianship.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Narrative voice is calm, compressed, slightly elegiac—apt for a man who dialogues with ghosts as routinely as wiring. Syntax favors em-dash and participle openers yet stays purposeful under pressure. Perceptual signature is specific: dust gradients, acoustic tile edges, the haptic “weightless burden.” No dialogue, so voice contamination risks are bypassed; free indirect slips are clean. Register never drifts into corporate; diction remains within elevator-tech lexicon (“mainspring barrel,” “ventilation systems”).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies via sentence length modulation; no template cadence detected. Information density is high: one sentence often layers external action with metaphysical stake (“feeling the weightless burden…prayer”). Figurative language is selective—three metaphors total—and avoids clutter in the peak discovery beat. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; “ceiling” recurs but each mention re-weights meaning, qualifying as purposeful return, not redundancy. Copy is clean; only one comma splice in inscription line, negligible.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: elevator tech + ghost whisperer + horological relic fuses vocational specificity with supernatural stewardship in a way that feels inevitable, not gimmicky. Dust-pattern forensics as emotional divination is a sharp, non-obvious escalation. Risk is moderate—quiet lyric ending rather than set-piece—but coherence justifies the choice. Premise avoids familiar “haunted carnival” tropes by keeping carousel off-stage and focusing on its mechanical heart, transforming nostalgia into custodial ethics.</comment>
