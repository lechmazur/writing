<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Margot’s “photographically cursed” trait is vivid label-only until late; the advisor remains a Gothic prop rather than a pressure source. The interior contradiction—terror of breathing yet calm self-analysis—never collides with embodied cost; her micro-choices stall at confession. The clasp’s final beat lands, but the emotional ladder between drowning terror and trophy stride is skipped; we see no degradation under stress. Earned stasis exists, but the price feels intellectual, not visceral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Closure is a crisp Conceptual Repricing: fear shrinks, clasp becomes trophy, photographic curse flips to weapon—cost is legible in the final image. Causal chain is thin: advisor appears, gives book, vanishes; Margot speaks aloud, fear materialises; no intermediate trial or failed tactic. Orientation is clean by word 80. Drive lens is Hybrid tilting to Accumulative; the escalation is a single density jump rather than because/therefore tightening, but the final reweighting justifies the pattern.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Carnival funhouse is sketched with compact, night-side sensory detail (warped glass, dust in moonlight) that mirrors internal distortion without overt nudging. Micro-setting of the clasp works harder: its silver warmth against throat charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays intact in the single location. Economy is good; no filler landmarks.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“see fear clearly to survive it”—is announced early. Single escalation beat: fear is spoken, materialises, is seen small, trapped. Agency is verbal confession; no tactical failure or retry, so pressure spike feels abrupt. Cost is conceptual (she now carries fear in clasp) rather than felt loss; adequate for short length but not multi-layered.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges cleanly: “Fear’s power is proportional to the distance we keep.” Emergence is via image (mirror multiplication shrinking to one tiny parasite) rather than statement. Dream-dictionary paradoxes risk thematic echo, but their contradictions feed the image track, so penalty is minor. Final image reweights premise without moralising; resonance lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Voice carries Gothic-lyric texture: “silk dragging across gravel,” “wound opening” smile—diction stays controlled and atmospheric. Perceptual signature is consistent: Margot notices angles, reflections, after-glow—precise to her curse. Psychic distance stable; no head-hop. Rhythm is deliberate, sentence variance adequate; occasional poetic lift but not purple.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is fluid; sentences vary in length and opening. Information density good—every paragraph advances image or knowledge. One scaffold hiccup: “the opera cloak clasp growing warm…its lingering luminance brightening in her mind until it seemed to pulse” compresses two clauses on same idea. No mixed metaphor; grammar clean. Minor filter-verb cluster (“seemed to”) but not in closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh angle: fear literalised as pathetic parasite photographed by drowning-resurrected memory. Dream-dictionary with paradoxical entries is a novel device; execution is slightly outline but concept is memorable. Carnival funhouse mirrors used as camera obscura for psyche is smart synthesis. Specific detail (“screaming face clasp”) prevents generic Gothic. Risky tone (repulsive allure) sustained without cliché; feels author-driven, not prompt-stitched.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.6</grade>
<comment>Appears early, gives book, vanishes—no pressure after entrance. No tactical advice tested or resisted; functions as oracle slot machine. Needed for plot ignition but swap-in-able with any cryptic guide.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>First found in hand, warms under speech, ends as fear-prison—three distinct beats. Irreplaceable shape (screaming face) ties to theme. Closure linkage strong: clasp fastened = fear caged. No real cost to her body, so capped below 8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>Introduced as post-mortem glow only she sees; frames photographic curse. Re-appears in funhouse mirrors’ after-glow, then in clasp pulse—serves as visual metric of fear’s visibility. Does not alter tactics, only signals shift; middle development thin.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Governs every perception: captures infinite reflections, makes fear materialise. Directly enables climax beat—without exact curse, fear stays abstract. Cost acknowledged but not viscerally felt; still structurally essential.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Confession sequence is the decisive turn; fear only incarnates once she “unbosoms.” Action is dramatised, not told. Could swap verb with “speaks” but thematic resonance would drop; strong but not absolute indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.2</grade>
<comment>Paradoxical notes seed the reversal (“drown is breathe,” “reflections show future”) and pay off visually. Mechanics not probed—book merely cited—so feels device-lite. Early setup and closure linkage secure mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade>
<comment>Supplies mirror apparatus essential for fear’s visual reveal; spatial distortions echo memory warping. Micro-use not broad—only hall of mirrors matters—but that moment is pivotal. Setting is active platform, not backdrop.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade>
<comment>Frame is “three days after resuscitation,” but no clock or deadline pressure emerges; time feels static night visit. Serves as origin stamp, not tactical constraint. Late arrival of temporal stakes would break logic; as is, neutral ornament.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Desire articulated up front and reframed at end; every beat of confession executes the trick. Motive is inseparable from plot mechanics—remove it and no materialisation occurs. Visible conceptual cost at close locks high score.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Advisor voice, imagery of smile-as-wound, silk-on-gravel sustain repulsive allure consistently. Tone modulates slightly upward to triumph in final image without losing sinister undertow. Coherent across beats and charges closure.</comment>
