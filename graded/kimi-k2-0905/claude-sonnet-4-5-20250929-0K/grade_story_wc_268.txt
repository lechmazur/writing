<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Ossian’s quiet, centuries-deep vigil is conveyed through poised micro-choices—dissolving the pellet, selecting the lightning-quill, planting each rune—each step tightening his understated resolve. The“regally unpretentious”trait is lived, never declared: he works without spectacle, lets starlight evaporate“into constellations,”accepts endless duty. Interiority stays concrete(“the fabric of deception begin to sunder”)and the final small smile shows earned, proportionate cost. No contradictory impulses in scene, so the quick test isn’t fully met, capping the 9-band; still, character feels singular and immortal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the rune-fractured lies collapse gracefully across the realm, final image of drifting starlight-pages reweights the premise. Causal chain: pellet→quill→rune inserts→oneiric corrections; each because/therefore link visible. Orientation anchored by line 3(timeless library) and line 10(object arrival), beating the 120-word guide; no debt. Lens stays Accumulative/Textural—density of inserted truths tightens pattern once—then lands as CR with undeniable social cost. One hairline slip: “Tuesday that might have been a Thursday” is cutely meta but doesn’t threaten causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The temple-library is both macro-stage and micro-tool: shelves that record futures, starlight-water basins, impossible windows—every detail is tactile, usable, and constrains Ossian’s quiet campaign. Spatial logic is clean; movement through stacks is tracked, exits implicit. Sensory hierarchy obeys an immortal archivist: constellation-leather bindings, suspended dust motes, evaporated ink becoming actual stars—none are touristy, all service theme. Environment charges the final image when evaporated ink drifts upward, mirroring the graceful collapse below. 9-band quick test met: setting actively shapes tactics and final resonance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—restore true lineage—signaled when pellet arrives and tightens once when final rune fragment is placed. Escalation is textural rather than causal-reversal: each inserted rune increases atmospheric pressure until“the fabric of deception begin to sunder.” Graceful collapse works as Resonant Reconfiguration, but the cost is conceptual-social, not personal-physical; protagonist remains unruffled. Agency is steady, not sharpened by a trade-off, so the visible-price gate for 8.8+ isn’t quite cleared, though stakes feel large and elegant.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: memory is fragile yet self-righting; truth, like oil, will surface if patiently loosened. Subtext operates in marginalia that“write themselves,”a lovely image of history self-correcting. Final starlight drift re-prices the idea of guardianship—Ossian’s eternal vigil is both necessary and beautifully adequate. No moralizing, only an indelible after-image of quiet cosmic maintenance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person omniscient stays locked to Ossian’s poetic-archivist register: diction of“constellation-leather,”“rune of drift,”and measured cadence. Rhythm modulates—long sentences for timelessness, clipped“he dissolved… he composed” for action beats. No head-hopping; mortal-world glimpses remain external, filtered through Ossian’s intent. Free indirect style is clean(“he understood immediately”). Micro-texture could be even more idiosyncratic for 9+, but voice is consistent, purposeful, and musical.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: concrete nouns(“petrified lightning bolt,”“starlight-water”)replace modifiers; metaphors stay physically coherent. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; each sentence adds new angle(ink→constellations, cathedral spire slow-topple). One mixed image:“cathedral spire topple in slow motion”is slightly incongruous for ancient temple, but it’s brief and doesn’t touch closure. Final line lands with satisfying sonic snap. High-band ear test passed.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Miniature immortal librarian rewriting reality via marginalia runes feels fresh, yet rooted in mythic resonance. The“graceful collapse”concept—truth undone by its own weight—offers a non-violent, elegant insurgency rarely seen. Specific synthesis of time-folds, starlight ink, and constellation archives is memorable; could not swap names and keep effect. Risk-taking(omniscient micro-titan, lyric historiography)enhances coherence rather than obscuring it. One small echo of Borges/”Library of Babel” keeps it from 9.0, but transformation is strong.</comment>
