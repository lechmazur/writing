<comment>Mara’s insomnia is credibly rendered through ritual and bodily cost, but her “methodical hope” is asserted more than dramatized; the only micro-choice that visibly enacts it is the decision to keep painting, and that beat is summarized rather than lived moment-by-moment. The internal contradiction between exhaustion and stubborn hope is present, yet never forced into a fork where renunciation feels possible; the result is an arc of accumulation rather than change, acceptable under Accumulative/Textural lens but limiting for high-band characterization.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each saffron stroke layers memory-density until the canvas becomes a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) that reweights the city’s air. Anchors (who/where/when) are fixed by line 3 and the greenhouse glass acts as both lung and lens—an object that constrains and charges the closure image. The final image of rooftop greenhouses “blazing with impossible languages” carries undeniable conceptual cost: the state can police speech, not moonlit pigment; closure is intact.</comment>

<comment>The rooftop greenhouse is not backdrop but respirator—humidity, orchid perfume, and smog press against glass to shape every breath Mara takes. The moon-tipped brush functions as micro-setting: its moon-crescent glint and erased characters dictate what can (and cannot) be painted, charging the final canvas image. Saffron pigment’s quiet warmth is returned as environmental counter-tone against toxic amber smog, a sensory pairing that tightens theAccumulative/Textural pattern.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—proving kindness is transmissible—remains abstract until the final image; no concrete resource or relationship is risked, so cost is conceptual rather than visceral. Escalation is achieved through density: each saffron stroke adds a new stranger-memory, tightening the weave until the canvas becomes evidence; this satisfies Accumulative deepening. Because the protagonist’s tactic never adapts or is threatened, tension plateaus rather than spikes; the piece lands in Charged Poise, not a fork where failure felt possible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as inverse surveillance: instead of the state cataloguing citizens, citizens catalogue covert kindness, storing it in moonlit pigment. Saffron shifts from color to cipher to collective ledger without thematic statement; the final rooftop constellation of greenhouses reweights “illegal memory” as visible graffiti of care. No moral is asserted—only the undeniable image that erased languages now glow in rooftop glass—satisfying the non-literal answer test.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Mara’s perceptual biases—humidity as lung, moon as coin, saffron as warmth of remembering—creating a consistent lyric signature. Syntax lengthens and pools during daydream beats, then contracts to short declaratives at brush-lifts, mirroring inhalation/exhalation of memory. No head-hop, no filter-verb stacks; diction stays within the lexicon of a painter who experiences language as texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</question>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—e.g., “orchids her grandmother had planted decades ago released their perfume—another act of defiance” fuses backstory, olfactory detail, and thematic gloss in one breath. No paraphrase loops; only two consecutive adjectives (“toxic amber”) but they are earned by smog metaphor. The moon-as-coin and language-as-pigment metaphors stay internally coherent, peaking in the final image where “impossible languages” literalize as colored light—closure clarity intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</question>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: the erased-language trope is remade as graffiti performed by moonlight rather than human voice, making the city itself a palimpsest that forgets while the sky remembers. Risk—using painting-as-memory without overt antagonist—pays off because pigment density becomes the stakes meter. The rooftop greenhouse as resistance archive feels inevitable yet un-worn; no derivative premise penalty applies.</comment>
