<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Cassian’s interiority is lyrically specific—“fingers stained green,” “heart quickened”—and his micro-choice to turn the crank is the hinge beat. The flaw is that the inherited-mission motive is front-loaded in a reflective block rather than tested under pressure; still, the final weep feels earned because the machine’s success retroactively justifies the obsession. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible is N/A.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the arbor’s overnight fruiting is the visible cost/proof that reweights the village’s forgetting. The causal lens holds—every gear-turn is a because/therefore step—though the 19-year moon alignment is off-stage coincidence rather than earned pivot. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“verdant arbor”), well inside the 120-word guardrail. The final image of baskets-to-doors crystallizes the new equilibrium.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The brass-and-vine loom is rendered as a tactile micro-setting that literally constrains every turn; its copper wire tension decides the harmonic pitch. Dawn light evolves from “pale” to “true,” mirroring the land’s revival. Spatial tracking is clean—vine from soil to framework to fruit—no impossible positions. Meets the 9+ gate: the tool charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will the machine re-awaken the land?”—is signaled early and tightens with each crank; the single meaningful deepening is the golden leaf’s unfurling that proves life response. Cost is present but conceptual (village scorn, grandmother’s death) rather than viscerally felt on page; a sharper physical price (bleeding fingers, collapsing frame) would have pushed higher. Escalation is accumulative/textural: density of fruit and scent, not reversal. Luck (moon alignment) complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges without sermon: forgotten song as living technology. The final image—baskets of out-of-season fruit—reconfigures meaning of “sacred practice” as something you can taste, not believe. Subtext in the loom’s creaks carries the grandmother’s absent voice. Avoids thematic echo penalty; no character states “this is how we heal the land.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited hovers just above Cassian’s skin, filtering every perception through green-stained fingers and spiral musical notation. Syntax lengthens and shortens with crank-rhythm, creating a loom-like cadence. No dialogue, hence no voice convergence. Diction stays within rustic tinkerer lexicon; “resonating chambers” is the lone borderline tech term but justified by the machine itself.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but breathable: “the gathering hush…pressed against his ears like velvet” does triple sensory work. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or causality. One mixed metaphor—“music as architecture”—is permitted at lyric peak without obscuring closure. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Premise fusion of biomechanical loom + forgotten agrarian rite is fresh, yet the “machine that sings the earth awake” trope has recent literary echoes; specificity of spiral notation and 19-year moon cadence offsets familiarity. Risk in lyric accumulative structure pays off: final fruit-draped arbor feels inevitable, not gimmicky. Could push higher with a sharper idiosyncratic detail (e.g., grandmother’s cracked front tooth shaping a note-hole).</comment>
