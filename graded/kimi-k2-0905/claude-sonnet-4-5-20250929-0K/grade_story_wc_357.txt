<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is concrete—palming the arrow tip, feeling gravity invert in her stomach—and her navigation method shows individualized competence under pressure. The final realization (“resilience wasn’t about resistance…”) is earned because the echo-vision dramatizes the mechanism first; she doesn’t lecture us. Still, we never see a genuine mistake or flaw; her “eccentric” method works flawlessly, muting internal contradiction. A single micro-choice that backfires would push this into the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the crystalline sphere reweights the premise—resilience is multi-temporal grafting—and the broken arrow’s silence shows cost (its echo complete). Causal chain holds: arrow warmth → water cue → convergence → sphere, each because/therefore link tightening options. Orientation is clean by line 9; world rules are learned through action, not dump. The −0.1 gap: the sphere is found, not seized through a risky trade-off; a hair more agency would hit 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Floating rock arches, silverleaf chandeliers, and upward rain are vivid yet always filtered through Mara’s pilot priorities—she clocks water flows, not tourist vistas. The irrigation hollows inside the arches constrain her unique navigation method, directly shaping the trajectory to the sphere. “Whirling silence” modulates into gravitational strain songs, charging the final drift-down image. One more sensory squeeze under Inversion (a metallic taste, suit seam tug) would nudge 9+.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—locate the source of orchard resilience—tightens when the echo-vision forecloses all other paths: only the convergence point matters now. Gravity inversion functions as coherent pressure; failure to follow the water stream would mean pod loss, a felt price. The discovery itself is passive (she watches, then pockets), so the escalation plateaus rather than apexes. Add one active trade-off—jettison pod stabilizer to reach the sphere—and this crests 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the specific horticultural trick—trees grafted across their own timelines—rather than a tagged maxim. The closing image reprises “whirling silence” now freighted with paradoxical strength, achieving resonance without moralizing. Ambiguity remains: who were the Cultivators, and what price attends multi-temporal life? The almost-on-the-nose line “resilience wasn’t about resistance…” keeps it sub-9; cutting that sentence would let the image alone reprice the concept.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Mara’s perceptual filter—she notices irrigation shifts, arrow warmth, gravity in throat. Syntax lengthens during drift, then clips when she fires thrusters, mirroring pilot tempo. No dialogue, so voice carries solely through rhythmic description and sensory hierarchy. A single diction slip—“crystalline chandeliers” edges toward writerly flourish rather than pilot jargon—prevents 9.0.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from fluid aerial sweeps to staccato corrections, propelling momentum. Figurative language is sparse, each metaphor (silver threads, chandeliers) earned at a high-stakes beat. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; every clause adds new visual or tactile data. One mixed moment—“world turned inside out” beside “down became up”—is redundant; trimming either phrase would clear 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The inversion-powered orchards and temporal seeding feel inevitable yet fresh, a synthesis of agrarian and quantum imagery not seen in routine sci-fi. Resilience reframed as self-grafting across time is a non-obvious moral calculus emerging from world logic, not authorial decree. Risky structural choice—almost no antagonists, pure discovery arc—pays off through sensory immersion. A hair more protagonist jeopardy would push full 9+.</comment>
