<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid—her blindness is never abstract, always embodied in how she decodes the world through water, sound, temperature. Every micro-choice (fingertip search, polymer patch, final smile toward Voss’s voice) is rooted in her repaired-life ethic. The “magnetic calm” never flattens into saintliness; it’s a practiced stance with a cost—time, nerve, the solitary depot. No contradiction under pressure; her refusal to let Voss leave broken lands as Earned Stasis with felt price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Causal lens holds: because the drone mis-reads refraction, therefore Mara must re-calibrate; because she patches it, Voss can sail. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration—her “different kind of light” speech crystallizes the premise and forecloses her ever rejoining the sighted world. Cost is visible in the final image: she turns back to three more broken drones, the queue of damage endless. No orientation debt; depot, mist, horn anchors arrive by line 6.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The depot is not backdrop but instrument: copper pipes become diagnostic tools, mist becomes refractive medium, horn blasts become clock. Water features function as microscope, spectrometer, and emotional barometer—every sluice and temperature shift constrains her next hand motion. Micro-setting (the drone’s lens, the basin’s meniscus) charges the final image. Spatial choreography is immaculate; bodies and objects never float.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—”fix it before we launch”—tightens once, no slack. Escalation is micro but decisive: the horn’s second blast shifts from ambient to countdown, forcing the patch under time cost. Agency is entirely hers; no coincidence rescues. The price (she absorbs the risk of failure, the loneliness of another completed farewell) is legible in the final beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges refractively: repair as epistemology, blindness as deeper sight. No thesis statements until the coda, and even that is offered as lived credo rather than moral. The hummingbird’s patched lens becomes an objective correlative for her own cracked worldview—whole enough to guide others, never restored to factory self. Final image reweights “broken” from deficit to modality of perception; ambiguity stays charged.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays lashed to Mara’s sensorium; every verb choice is tactile or acoustic. Syntax shortens under tool-work pressure (“fingertips found the microscopically damaged crystal lens”) then lengthens in coda reflection, mirroring emotional cadence. No filter-verb stacks; water does the filtering. Dialogue sparse, idiomatically male-military (“You’re not leaving yet”) vs. her lyrical precision, maintaining distance control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is near-invisible: high information density without pad. Metaphors are spare and functional—“mist rolled… like breath through lungs” sets respiratory rhythm for the depot. No mixed vehicles; refraction physics stays consistent. One loop only: “making the broken world whole again” echoes earlier “making broken things whole,” but it is the thematic reprise, not artifact churn, and lands in closure beat where repetition earns its keep.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The blind tech who sees by water-refraction is fresh enough, but the deeper freshness is the story’s refusal to convert disability into super-power; instead it converts repair into epistemic humility. Risk taken: no antagonist, no reversal, just a single escalating constraint—time—answered by a single micro-gesture. Synthesis feels inevitable after the fact, not contrived. Derivative-premise guardrail waived: workmanship ethic is ancient, but the sensorial translation via depot plumbing is specific to this text.</comment>
