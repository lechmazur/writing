<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Maya’s interiority is rich and sensorily anchored; her contradictory impulses—yearning for human connection yet choosing isolation—are dramatized through the micro-choice to stay at the compass rose each anniversary. The cost of her adaptation is viscerally felt: she can never leave without dying, a price that charges the final image. Voice remains distinct, though a few abstractions (“blessed pariah”) flirt with label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/textural lens: temporal strata, compass rose, and anniversary sketching accrete into a resonant reconfiguration—Maya’s mapping of “when” rather than “where.” Closure lands cleanly in the last two sentences: her pencil scratch arrives out of order, crystallizing her eternal present with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation is taught by line 3; no causality breaks.</comment>

<comment>The station’s warped titanium and time-folded sky are filtered through Maya’s astronomer gaze, producing tactile specifics—brass warmth, gravitational flux after-images—that constrain her movements. The compass rose functions as micro-setting, charging the final stance; remove it and the closure collapses. Spatial choreography is coherent despite relativistic logic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: the impossibility of leaving versus the infinity of staying. Pressure tightens once: each anniversary sketch re-commits her to fatal exile. Cost is legible—cellular lock-in, solitary eternity—though the escalation is more iterative than sharply reversed; a single deeper tightening midway could have pushed higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: time as navigable terrain, solitude as chosen cartography. The compass rose’s redefinition from cardinal direction to temporal “true north” reweights prior material in the final line. Subtext of sacrifice and agency is carried by the out-of-order pencil scratch, not exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Lyrical, slightly elevated diction fits the cosmic scale; cadence modulates—long sentences for dilated zones, fragments for compressed beats. Perceptual signature is strong: Maya notices starlight latency, alloy temperature, silence texture. No head-hopping or register drift; elision of corporate evacuation details is purposeful and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable; metaphor vehicles stay consistent (compass, map, star-paths). One paraphrase loop (“silence itself seemed to reverberate” echoing “echoed silence”) slightly dulls momentum. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks; final image is uncluttered.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Temporal-topographic navigation feels fresh; the fusion of astronomical ritual with relativistic exile transforms familiar isolation tropes. The compass rose as chronometer is an inevitable-yet-surprising reconfiguration. Risky relativistic physics could have collapsed into hand-wavium, but internal logic holds.</comment>
