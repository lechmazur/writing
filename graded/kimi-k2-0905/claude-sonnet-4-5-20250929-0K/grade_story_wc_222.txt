<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Kael’s shift from hoarder to sharer of secrets is legible and embodied in the tactile chess-piece ritual; his trembling fingers and cautious-abandon stance show cost. Interiority stays concrete—he “pets a wolf” when approaching the guardian—yet the epiphany “now I know secrets are meant to flow like water” drifts into label-speak, blunting the peak beat. The flaw complicates but does not unearn the arc, because the final image of descent “with open arms” still forecloses the old path. Relationship crucible is absent (single on-page character), so the score rests on solo interior credibility.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: missing lid → return → coordinates → new mission; each because/therefore linkage tightens options. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—Kael accepts the unknown with felt cost (“ready…to be an apprentice of all the beautiful, terrible mysteries”). Orientation is clean within 120 words (who, where, when anchored by brass sky and ice steps). One soft spot: the guardian’s line “You’ve come to amend what you broke” is slightly expository, but it pays off immediately in the chess placement, so causality remains intact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Frozen spire above clouds is not postcard scenery; altitude crystals bite skin, wrong-colored sky presses close enough to distort vision, constraining Kael’s eye-watering climb. Micro-setting object—the sundial lid—returns with reweighted meaning (coordinates that shift live), charging the final image. Selective sensory economy: breath tinkles like glass, furs sparkle with permanent frost, brass sky color recurs to mirror internal shift. Spatial choreography stays coherent across ascent/descent; no impossible positions or floating rooms.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether Kael will restore flow of wonder—signals early and tightens when the guardian demands amendment. Single meaningful escalation: placing hollow chess pieces on the board enacts the swap, foreclosing the hoarder path with visible ritual cost. Agency is present; no coincidence resolves tension. Price is felt (trembling hands), yet the world-level stakes of the wrong sky remain more conceptual than visceral, keeping the score just shy of 8.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: wonder as circulating gift, not possession. The chess-piece swap and flowing-water image reweight the premise without final-paragraph moralizing. Final image of descent “into the wrongness with open arms” offers non-literal answer to fear of unknown. Subtext lives in gesture—cracking open pawn to reveal cat-staring secret—rather than exposition, avoiding thematic echo penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Kael; perceptual signature vivid (“breath forming crystals that tinkled”). Free indirect clean: “This was exactly where he needed to be.” Guardian’s voice distinct—laugh “like ice breaking in spring”—provides tonal contrast without head-hop. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses climb, shorter fragments peak at trembling placement. No filter-verb clusters; diction remains within Kael’s plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings avoid mechanical stems. Metaphors stay coherent—sky as brass, laughter as thawing ice—no mixed vehicles. Information density high: one sentence can anchor place, sensory cue, and emotional charge. Minor paraphrase loop “secrets are meant to flow like water / give them one in return” costs −0.2, but clarity and closure beat remain untouched.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fusion of chivalrous thief with secret-carrying chess pieces feels fresh; the hollow pawn containing why cats stare transforms folklore into lived magic. Brass-wrong sky and icebound spire synthesize climate fantasy with moral fable without template drift. Final inversion—thief gives rather than steals wonder—grows inevitable from setup yet surprises in sentiment. Risk in lyric compression pays off: compressed ascent mirrors compressed closure, coherence intact.</comment>
