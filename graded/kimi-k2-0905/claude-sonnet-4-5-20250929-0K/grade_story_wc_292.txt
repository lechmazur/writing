<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mira’s interior contradiction—scholarly caution vs. ancestral devotion—surfaces in every beat; the copper nail is handled, pocketed, brandished, its coffin origin kept alive in tactile memory. Micro-choices (spreading journals, suiting up, inviting Kao) flow from the same motive string and escalate to the final air-lock step. The only dent: “spongey dread” is named but not embodied in pulse, breath, or skin—the body stays curiously calm under existential threat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the two women step toward the wound-door, options narrowed, cost felt in the station’s abandoned instruments. Causal chain holds: nail → journal decoding → site identification → air-lock decision, all “because/therefore” links. One soft spot: the station’s sub-ice access appears only in final paragraph—no prior cue—so the decisive locale feels lightly teleported rather than earned.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Violet clouds singing auroras, snow falling upward, negative-temperature readings—each impossibility is filtered through Mira’s map-librarian eye for pattern. The copper nail micro-setting is re-grasped, pocketed, and finally lifted like a key, charging the last image. Spatial choreography stays clean across the one-room station; only the sub-ice hatch appears without foreshadowing, a minor geographic pop-in.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prove reversible exile real—threads every beat; pressure tightens when Kao’s skepticism threatens institutional ridicule, then again when the hatch beneath them becomes the single live option. Cost is legible: abandonment of scientific legitimacy the moment they exit the air-lock. The escalation is single-tier; no second reversal, but the lens is causal and the tightening suffices for 800-word scale.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme—exile as choice, not condemnation—emerges through the nail, the journals, the ancestor’s alleged cowardice; no moral is stated, only the final image of two women stepping sideways out of catastrophe. The concept reweights earlier material: the coffin nail becomes liberation rather than imprisonment. Subtext in Kao’s silence and mirrored coffee mugs hints at complicity without exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays snugly inside Mira’s perceptual filter: archaic notation, maritime maps, jet-stream physics—all voiced in her diction. No head-hop; Kao’s interior is implied only through gesture. Rhythm modulates: longer, clause-stacked sentences when decoding, then staccato “Coming?” under adrenaline. Only minor register drift: “conceptual repricing” feels like rubric intrusion, not Mira’s lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, high-density; figurative language is rationed to two vivid kernels—violet clouds twisting into impossible geometries, journals crackling like thin ice—each tied to Mira’s sensorium. No mixed metaphors, no synonym loops. Sentence lengths vary; opening line anchors voice and stakes. A lone filter-verb stack (“seem to bend”) is justified by her measuring gaze.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The reversible-exile concept feels fresh, wedging climate fiction into metaphysical territory without losing material stakes. Copper nail as skeleton key and family shame-token fuses tropes into one irreplaceable object. Risk: negative-state temperature is hand-waved, but the piece owns its rule-break early and uses it to charge wonder rather than cheat plot. Synthesis of ancestor’s coded poems + climate collapse + personal legacy is non-obvious and lingers.</comment>
