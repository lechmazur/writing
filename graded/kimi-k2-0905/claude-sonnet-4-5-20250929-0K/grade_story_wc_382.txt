<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Elena’s buried bilingualism and her need to normalize it through academic Latin are credibly conflicted; the memory-triggered admission feels earned because the rooftop setting and Moss seal act as concrete cues. Mrs. Kovac’s professorial patience and family stake in Heinrich’s escape architecture give her more than mentor polish—she risks passing a clandestine inheritance. Interiority is character-specific (Elena’s palm-heel weight of the seal, the cold tea as emotional anchor). No label-speak; the discovery is rendered through sensory beats rather than diagnostic summary. Cost is present but light—Elena’s former denial is forfeited, yet the story stops before we see how this new fluency will complicate her life; that keeps it just shy of 8+.</comment>

<comment>Causal lens holds: because Elena lies about needing Latin lessons, Mrs. Kovac tests her with the cornerstone photo; therefore the hidden architectural language is confessed and the seal passed on. Orientation is clean within 120 words (fire escape, meteor shower, Thursday tea). Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: “the city spoke in stone” reweights every prior inscription as living dialogue; cost is legible—Elena can no longer pretend her ability is academic translation. Mrs. Kovac’s line “the buildings are interrogating you” crystallizes the new rule-set. Persistent constraint is visible: she now carries the seal and the duty to answer the city’s questions.</comment>

<comment>Rooftop garden rendered through interacted specifics—amber tea pour, string lights, meteor glare that greens the vines—never a static postcard. Spatial choreography is clean: fire escape ascent, chair settling, seal passed hand-to-hand. Meteor shower functions as micro-setting that re-illuminates inscription and interior state, charging the final image. Only two tiny props—photo and seal—but both handled tactilely; redundancy avoided. No occupational missteps; Latin phrases are brief and accurate. Weather (meteors) directly affects visual hierarchy and cues the climactic light-flare, satisfying the 9+ constraint test.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—will Elena admit her innate “language of decay” and accept custodianship—signals early and tightens when Mrs. Kovac reveals Moss’s hidden grammar. Escalation is micro but decisive: the inscription lie exposed → Elena's confession → seal transfer → city’s audible approval. Agency sits with Elena: she could flee, but opens her hand to the seal’s weight. The cost is conceptual rather than visceral—her camouflage of Latin student is gone—but still legible. One beat, one shift suffices for 700-word scope; pressure lands cleanly under causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges obliquely: built environments outlive builders yet demand interpreters; inheritance is a conversation, not a deed. Subtext carried by gesture—Mrs. Kovac palms the invisible impression, Elena later feels the seal “settle like a key.” No explicit sermon; the meteor shower’s ancient indifference supplies cosmic frame. Final line’s “city spoke in stone” offers resonant non-literal answer—language as living obligation. Ambiguity remains (what will Elena do when a building calls?) but complexity is embraced, lending after-shine without tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Narrative texture is lyrical but controlled; free-indirect slides (“the language of structures…”) stay within Elena’s comprehension. Perceptual signature sharp—Elena notices limestone carving wear, tea cooling, seal’s brass warmth under meteor light. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for remembered grandmother, staccato confession beats at climax. Dialogue sparse yet distinct: Mrs. Kovac’s professorial brevity versus Elena’s tentative elisions. No head-hop; single POV holds. Filter verbs minimal; metaphor vehicles are architectural and consistent. Final cadence slows to match “ancient sentence” closure, showing purposeful modulation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Sentence-level propulsion is high; opening line grounds stakes (“meteor shower painted silver streaks”) and each paragraph advances either knowledge or image. No paraphrase loops; information is duplex—tea pour signals hospitality and time passage. Metaphors stay architecturally coherent (inscriptions as promises, meteors as punctuation). One register spike—“Conceptual Repricing” diction—but justified by Elena’s academic self-defense. No typographical, tense, or pronoun flaws. Final image re-uses “stone” and “language” without mechanical repetition, achieving resonance rather than redundancy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Fusion of architectural history with magical linguistics feels fresh; “dying language of decay” reframes heritage conservation as live conversation. Moss’s wartime hidey-holes threaded through ornamental limestone is an inventive, grounded extrapolation. Rooftop garden as classroom plus meteor light avoids stock mentor scenery. Elena’s bilingualism-as-shame sidesteps chosen-one cliché, giving urban-fantasy trope emotional specificity. Risk taken with quiet, lyric closure pays off: no city-shaking catastrophe, yet stakes feel personal and irreversible. Could push further into consequence for 9+, but within band originality is strong.</comment>
