<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara’s isolation and pattern-seeking gift are vivid, but her late-shift “choice” is declared not dramatized; the interiority is lyrical yet risks diagnostic self-tagging (“I’ve always been good at seeing patterns…”) without embodied contradiction under final pressure. Cost is asserted (“years of isolation”) rather than felt in the closing beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: storm-light and fragments intensify mood until she accepts the prophet’s invitation, a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost—she is now conspirator in a dawn shaped from darkness. Slight causality wobble: the prophet’s direct address feels unheralded, a late external push rather than an inevitable outgrowth of her listening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Observatory, cobalt portico, and lightning-filtered glass are tactile, bias-filtered, and return in the final image to refract the coming dawn—setting directly charges closure. Selective sensory economy keeps sky, glass, and equipment in tight rotation, each beat anchoring her attention and choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><pressure>Dominant stake—stay in daylight explanations or step into shadow broadcast—tightens once when the prophet names her listener. Agency is present (she presses transmit), but the external voice resolves tension more than her own tactics; cost is conceptual rather than visceral on-page.</pressure>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of knowledge versus wonder emerges through encrypted storm-voice and sapphire light; no final moral is stated, only the image of cobalt glass witnessing a conspiracy of dawn. Subtext relies heavily on repeated light/shadow binaries; the prophetic diction occasionally drifts toward pseudo-profundity (“crown of morning”).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly bolted to Elara’s perceptual filter—synesthetic storm imagery and radio bleeds feel idiosyncratic. Free-indirect diction (“Prophet rising,” “lyrically prophetic fragments”) justifies its own cadence; no head-hop or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lyric patterning is dense—figurative language appears in 70-80 % of sentences—but the storm-electric motif teaches its own repetition and pays off in the final cobalt flash. One mixed metaphor risk: “barnacle made of stone and glass” is novel yet slightly anatomically confused.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Storm-bleached mountaintop radio mysticism feels fresh, but “lonely listener heralds hidden broadcast” is a known SF beat; specificity of cathedral cobalt glass salvaged into observatory filter gives it a memorable twist. Final prophet gambit is the least transformed element, leaning on familiar chosen-one beats.</comment>
