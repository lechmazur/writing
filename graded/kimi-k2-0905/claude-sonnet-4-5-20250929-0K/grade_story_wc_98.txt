<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Kima’s interiority is concrete (“seed…weight like a tiny sun”) and her contradictory impulses—oath-bound skepticism vs. ache to believe—are present in scene. The final leap is foreshadowed by the dream fragments, so the renunciation carries visible cost. Yet the sister functions more as exposition mouthpiece than crucible, and the “reality checker” credential never alters tactics; the job title stays ornamental. Emotional progression is steady but avoids genuine irrationality—no self-deception or hypocrisy surfaces under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Kima plants the seed, trading certainty for possibility, and the felt cost (“we lose the seed forever”) is on-page. Causal chain holds: dream data → mounting urgency → luminous doubt → planting; each beat tightens options. Orientation is clean—ridge, monsoon clock, sister arrive by line 100. One minor causality fuzz: the elders’ claim is neither verified nor falsified before she acts, but the story frames this as the very wager, not a break.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ridge flowers function as calendar and countdown, guiding both imagery and decision; the seed’s micro-setting (soil between blooms) constrains the final gesture. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—Kima notices petals as seasonal code, not tourist spectacle. Spatial choreography is clear: kneeling, parting earth, pressing soil. Monsoon horizon supplies tonal mirror without overt symbolism. World rules stay consistent; no expository dump.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—cultural memory vs. empirical verification—is signaled early and tightens once: “Either plant it or don’t.” Agency drives the turn; no outside rescue. Cost is legible—irreversible loss of seed and epistemic certainty. Escalation is modest but coherent under situational lens; one meaningful deepening suffices. Could use a sharper mid-scene complication to enter 8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as lived belief rather than provable fact. Subtext operates in gesture—the silent acceptance of tea, the seed’s sun-like weight—avoiding explicit thesis. Final image reweights premise without moralizing: possibility itself is the new truth. Ambiguity lingers—will the tree grow?—but remains coherent, inviting reflection rather than confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person close stays tightly fused to Kima’s diction; perceptual signature is vivid (“patterns Kima had never learned but somehow recognized”). Syntax modulates with tension—long reflective sentences in early beat, shorter declarations at climax. No dialogue register drift; Prem’s idiom is plainer, distinguishing siblings. No filter-verb stacks; immediacy holds. Voice avoids lyrical inflation while retaining poetic density.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and dense: “seed…weight like a tiny sun” compresses metaphor and tactility in one stroke. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances. One mixed metaphor—“luminous doubt”—is sanctioned by thematic necessity and taught early. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge motif effectively. Minor over-adjectiving in flower description is offset by sensory purpose.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: skeptic-scientist meets ancestral magic via dream empiricism. The “empirically whimsical” method is a genuine conceptual twist, not quirk. Seed-as-sun metaphor particularizes object without generic fantasy trope. Cultural-memory stakes avoid nostalgia by framing forgetting as epistemic loss. Could risk more by letting the dream data actually mislead her—twist feels slightly underplayed.</comment>
