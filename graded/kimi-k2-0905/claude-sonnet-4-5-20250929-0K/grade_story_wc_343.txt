<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Celeste’s interior contradiction—duty to Hendrik vs hunger for hidden knowledge—drives every beat; the thumb-smudge that erases the hopscotch is a micro-choice that stakes her life-path. The “sociable isolation” motif is embodied in her watching birds while copying routes, not declared. Apprentice curiosity is more than label: it forces her to decode, risk, and decide. Closure is earned stasis: she accepts slower danger, foreclosing the option to expose the discovery now, and the cost is legpable in her deliberate “casual” tone to Hendrik.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative-textural lens holds: starlings, chalk, phrasebook, and light density into a final crystallized stance rather than causal chain. Orientation complete before 120 words; no lens ambiguity at end. Closure is Charged Poise: the last image of re-forming starlings reconfigures the stake—she will mimic their dissolve-reform tactic. Persistent constraint (Guild secrecy) shapes her future tactics and is legible in the final paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Brass hull, magnetic tethers, and vellum give tactile steampunk specificity; starlings provide kinetic motion to the fixed airship. The hopscotch board as micro-setting constrains her body and discovery path. Phrasebook page reappears at end as tactile anchor for multilingual secrecy. Final image of swirling birds re-weights the setting as instruction manual for survival.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—survive while pursuing hidden cartography—signalled early. One meaningful tightening: the moment she matches hopscotch numbers to port sequence and sees the light below; options narrow to covert continuation. Cost is future danger and moral complicity; price visible in her decision to lie to Hendrik. Agency is attention/notation rather than overt defiance, sufficient for 750-word scope.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Theme of cartography-as-power emerges through chalk numbers, starling patterns, phrasebook pages—never stated. Subtext: knowledge is deadly so must be encoded like children’s games. Final image offers non-literal answer: dissolving/reforming flock models the apprentice’s required camouflage. No closing moral, only reweighted perception of secrecy’s beauty and peril.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Free-indirect style stays inside Celeste’s diction—“sky-sickness” mirrors Hendrik’s bitterness she would absorb. Rhythm accelerates with short sentences during decode beat, relaxes at erased chalk. Perceptual signature sharp: she sees fields as potential star-projections. No dialogue, so voice coherence judged solely through internal texture—maintained.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Clean read-aloud rhythm; sentences vary. High density—“polyglot’s phrasebook lay open, its pages soft as cloth from years of handling” does three jobs. No mixed metaphors; starlings/constellation metaphors stay coherent. One paraphrase loop spotted (“she would suggest…casually, as if idle curiosity rather than calculated purpose”) but does not touch closure; minor −0.2, still within 8.5 band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Fusion of steampunk airship with children’s chalk cipher feels fresh; starlings as living map trope is re-angled through cartographic secrecy. Apprentice-as-decoder is familiar, but encoding forbidden coordinates into hopscotch sequence offers specific twist. Final link between murmuration tactics and personal camouflage gives non-obvious payoff. Not radical but specific enough to feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
