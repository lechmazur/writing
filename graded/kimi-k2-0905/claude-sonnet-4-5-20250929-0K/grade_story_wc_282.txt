<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maren’s interior contradiction—hunger for connection vs. duty to map—stays embodied in the elm-leaf squeeze and trembling fingers. The micro-choice to press fossil to wall crystallizes values and costs: she surrenders isolated watcher status, accepting irreversible porousness to alien emotion. Exterior behavior (furious mapping) diverges from interior need (to be witnessed), giving authentic tension. No secondary character on page, so relationship bullets waived; single-POV interiority remains specific, avoids therapy-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the cave’s sentience reweights Maren’s purpose, cost is felt in irrevocable fusion of self with alien memory. Causality holds under Accumulative lens: each sensory layer deepens emotional density until boundary dissolves. Orientation clear by word 70; no lens ambiguity. Persistent constraint—she exits “porous”—shapes future hibernation cycles, satisfying cost test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Coastal cave system constrains every move: limestone channels dictate where emotions pool, tidal pulse marks time, wall warmth guides hand placement. Micro-setting of elm fossil acts as portable chamber whose 50-million-year memory recharges final fusion. Selective sensory hierarchy—temperature before visual, texture before sound—mirrors Maren’s professional-then-personal priority. Environment is not backdrop but agent that enables the climactic reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she remain merely observer or become interpretive voice—tightens when alien emotion drifts within reach; refusal costs her former detachment. Escalation accumulates through denser emotional strata; final press of fossil forecloses solitude option under undeniable price. No coincidence; pressure coherent to Accumulative lens. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: translation across unbridgeable temporal orders is possible only through surrender of sovereign identity. Subtext resides in fossil—once alive, now stone—mirroring Maren’s transition from mapper to medium. Final image of “genuine communion” reweights prior isolation without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: is fusion transcendent or erasure?—inviting reflection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>POV remains stable close-third; perceptual signature skewed to thermo-tactile data, scientific diction (“gradients,” “grotto”) filtered through poetic cadence. Syntax lengthens under wonder, fragments under sensory overload, mirroring psychic porousness. No dialogue, hence no voice convergence risk. Free indirect style clean: “tense became meaningless” stays within her ken.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>High information density—single sentence often layers sensory data, historical context, emotional import. Metaphors (“grief pooled”) remain consistent to liquid cave imagery; no mixed vehicles. Rhythm modulates: tidal caesuras calmer, clause-rich surges during contact. Minor scaffold: repeated “she” opener in final paragraph; does not obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Premise—sentient pre-human emotions preserved in stone—feels fresh yet inevitable once elm fossil logic is seeded. Synthesis of mineral memory with psychological transitional-object theory avoids gimmick by embodied cost. Risk in treating cave as character pays off because emotional stakes stay human-scaled. Specific detail (glowing blue fingertips, 50 myo leaf) anchors abstraction in verifiable image.</comment>
