<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Vera’s adaptive trait is shown through her disciplined glass-work thinking, but the climactic decision to spare Galloway is declared rather than dramatized with visible cost; the pistol confrontation compresses her interior contradiction into a single calm speech, muting the felt price of mercy.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: ledger strip ➔ cave gunpowder ➔ confrontation ➔ exchange for clemency; closure lands with Conceptual Repricing as the kiln-light reframes ‘fire’ from weapon to art, but the cost of Vera’s clemency is asserted, not dramatized—no legal jeopardy or social consequence appears on-page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Frost patterns, boot prints, and rock-fall camouflage perform double duty—micro-setting clues both for reader and for Vera’s glass-trained eye; the cave’s spatial layout is cleanly tracked, and the kiln’s final roar re-codes the canyon’s silence into creative heat, charging the last image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—exposure of smuggling ring versus personal survival—tightens when gunpowder replaces charcoal; Vera’s agency drives the reveal and the negotiated surrender, but escalation flattens in the final beat because the pistol standoff dissolves into off-screen clemency with no visible price or constraint.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of transformation emerges through fire imagery—explosion, kiln, dawn frost—without overt statement; the closing image of melting frost on the window quietly re-prices ‘pause’ as creative risk accepted, avoiding moralizing. The parallel between glass-work patience and moral choice is effective but relies on Vera’s explanatory dialogue.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays anchored to Vera’s sensory filtration—‘luminous glass’, ‘drifting resonance’—with perceptual signature sustained; the prose modulates from meditative canyon opening to compressed cave confrontation, earning the rhythmic shift. Dialogue is minimal but carries subtext; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is varied, with purposeful enjambment in canyon descriptions and clipped clauses during discovery; high information density in most lines. Occasional elevated diction (‘drifting resonance’, ‘luminous glass artist’) edges toward lyric self-consciousness, but metaphorical coherence survives; no loops or mixed metaphors.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Glass artist turned reluctant sleuth via frost pattern reading is fresh; gunpowder masquerading as charcoal supply chain offers a smart inversion of creation/destruction. Final kiln re-kindling as artistic answer to violence is foreseeable yet grounded in established craft logic, avoiding gimmickry while synthesizing familiar tropes with sensory specificity.</comment>
