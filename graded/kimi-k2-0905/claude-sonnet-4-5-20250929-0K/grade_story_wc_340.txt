<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maren’s interiority is concrete and embodied; her contradictory impulses—safe detachment vs. longing to feel—coexist in the elevator beats. Micro-choice at tenth-floor hatch (renounce promotion, embrace risk) is earned by prior causality: goggles → diary fragments → captain’s model. Cost is visible: she steps into colder isolation to seek connection. Voice stays servant-specific, no diagnostic self-talk.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because she finds goggles → reads fragments → therefore re-orients life at top floor. One continuous scene, 720 words; orientation anchored by line 4. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration: Maren’s refusal of promotion crystallizes new stance with felt social cost—she forfeits security. Persistent constraint: captain’s absence leaves her to act alone, price legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Icebound spire is filtered through servant’s eye—metallic groans, scattered prismatic light on gloves. Micro-setting of elevator cage constrains every beat; floor numbers act as ticking clock. Cold walls mirror her frozen detachment; thaw begins when light refracts through goggles. Spatial choreography clean: no impossible body/prop positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: risk feeling vs. safe numbness, signaled paragraph 2. Tightening occurs at each floor reveal; knowledge that captain chose hope escalates pressure. Final turn at tenth floor forecloses bureaucratic safety; cost is immediate—she forfeits warm bed, pension. Agency drives escalation under causal lens; no coincidence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: service as conduit for rehumanization, not moral. Goggles’ refracted light = internal thaw; no allegory forced. Final image of “messily, affectionately alive” reweights earlier frozen corridors without sermon. Ambiguity remains: she may fail, but choice is real.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays servant-close; perceptual signature—“polishing silver,” “blank with routine sorrow”—is distinct. No head-hopping. Syntax modulates: longer reflective sentences in lift, crisp single clause at hatch decision. Filter verbs minimal; “watched,” “pressed” serve immediacy. No register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sentences carry dual duty: “elevator groaned… world dropped away” advances motion + stakes. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors are sparse, clean: “clockwork” servants. Paragraph cut test passed—each graph advances knowledge or charge. Minor adverbial cluster “rather than lived” could trim, but doesn’t dull closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Frozen-spire servant tale is familiar, but captain’s encrypted diary + light-reveal mechanic freshens trajectory. Goggles as lens-literacy tool is specific, not gimmick. Risk taken: entire story in ascending lift; claustrophobia serves theme. Could edge higher if diary language or captain voice had starker idiom.</comment>
