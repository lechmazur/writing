<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Maya’s interiority is textured and specific—her “luminous disbelief” on seeing her own portrait lands as embodied contradiction. The shift from thief to future painter is credibly prepared by the moonbeam vision, yet the moment she “simply moved through moonlight” feels lightly earned; more micro-choice under pressure would lift the arc to full cost. Still, her perceptual signature stays sharp throughout.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The causal chain holds: stolen jar → impossible self-portrait → recognition that she is the subject, not the thief → renunciation of theft and embrace of creation. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: Maya walks out owning a new vocation, the cost being the forfeiture of her old identity. The moonbeam vision pays off the set-up; no teleporting props or soft resets appear.</comment>

<comment>Emerald Station’s green tiles glow “like jewels,” the lilies’ stem direction becomes navigational code, and moonlight turns shadows to “liquid pools”—each sensory choice filters through Maya’s painterly eye and guides her next move. The jar itself functions as micro-setting: its swirling light literally shows future canvases, constraining her decision to leave it behind. Spatial choreography remains clean across the single platform scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will Maya keep stealing or accept being seen?—tightens once the moonbeams reveal her own image. The reversal is internal but visible: she sets the jar down, renouncing possession for creation. Cost is the loss of familiar identity; escalation is the narrowing of options from thief to artist. A second tightening beat would lift the score another notch.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: being the subject is the price of trying to own others’ crossroads. The final image—Maya walking into moonlight now equipped to paint, not steal—reweights all prior thefts as rehearsals for authorship. No meta-statement intrudes; the insight stays lodged in the jar’s relinquishment and the station’s silvered rails.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Maya’s painter-attuned perceptions; metaphoric diction (“light pooled thick as honey,” “shadows into liquid pools”) feels character-native rather than ornamental. Psychic distance modulates with pressure, compressing as the moonbeam vision hits. Dialogue is sparse but subtextual—Celeste’s “You saw it, then” carries the whole reversal without exposition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Figurative language is dense but patterned early, so the lyric escalation reads intentional rather than purple. One minor scaffold: “pooled thick as honey” and “thick as honey” idea repeat across two adjacent sentences—subtracts a hair. Otherwise, information density stays high, every line doing double duty.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The conceit—portraits that capture choice-moments, moonbeams that archive destiny—is fresh yet emotionally grounded. The inversion that the thief discovers she has always been the subject feels inevitable in hindsight, not gimmicky. Risk is taken: a largely internal climax in a single station scene, but the lyric payoff justifies the narrow frame. No close echoes of prior famous scenes.</comment>
