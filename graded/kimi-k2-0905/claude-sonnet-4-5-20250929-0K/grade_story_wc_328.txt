<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya’s interiority is vivid—her clinical detachment cracking on the page—and the arrowhead micro-choice (“pocketing the arrowhead”) crystallizes her shift. The “frost in her heart” refrain is the only overt therapy-speak, but it’s anchored in embodied cold imagery. Voss’s spectral laugh supplies credible external pressure that rewrites her long-held bitterness without an unearned epiphany. Old Marrow remains more atmospheric cipher than crucible, but his single line “hunting a better version of us” lands as spoken subtext that reframes her stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: static voices, moss-grown artifacts, and bioluminescent plants thicken until the final image reweights meaning. Closure is a Charged Poise: Maya’s pocketing the arrowhead and asking “when they return the second time” crystallizes her new stance with undeniable cost—she forfeits her report and former self. The underground garden and phone confessions are concrete anchors by word 80; no orientation debt. Causality is intact: each artifact (arrowhead, phone laugh) is discovered, not conjured, and the final question grows directly from them.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The garden is not backdrop but tool: the phone mounted between terrariums literalizes the conduit; the upward-tugging arrowhead in Maya’s palm constrains her final choice. Sensory triage favors touch and kinesthetic weight against winter-death outside, mirroring her thawing interior. Spatial choreography is flawless—root stairs, wall mushrooms, moss without disturbance—tracking bodies and objects cleanly. One micro-setting object (the phone) delivers the closure laugh, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</question><grade><comment>Dominant stake: will Maya file a debunking report or believe in the harmony? Pressure tightens when Voss’s laugh emerges from the phone—an irreversible re-pricing of her vengeance. No external antagonist is needed; the conflict is her bitterness versus metamorphic invitation. The cost is legible: she forfeits institutional credibility the moment she pockets the arrowhead and asks about second returns.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: returned bodies, upward-falling stones, and a laugh traveling static create an argument that transformation may be benevolent predation. No character moralizes; even Old Marrow’s “better version” line is offered as hypothesis. The final question—“do they come back at all?”—invites ambiguity between loss and ascension without thesis. The frostbitten-hope tonality reweights earlier winter imagery into possible spring inside the earth.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question><grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Maya’s perceptual filter—she notices soil under nails, moss showing zero disturbance, tea glowing with moonlight. Syntax grows slightly fragmented under stress (“It feels like remembering something we never knew”) yet remains readable. Dialogue is minimal but distinct: Old Marrow’s crackling-leaf idiom against Maya’s clipped scientific diction. No head-hopping; Voss’s laugh is experienced as external phenomena, not interiorized for her.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</question><grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “clipboard in hand, but her true work lay in tracking…” compresses occupation and covert motive in one line. Metaphors are internally coherent—autumn-leaf voice, green cathedral—without mixed logic. No synonym loops; each verb is specific (“sprawled,” “twisted,” “crackling”). Rhythm modulates: longer cadences for descent, staccato for phone fragments. Only micro-slip: “frostbitten hope incarnate” edges toward elevated register, but it’s brief and frames closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</question><grade><comment>The “cosmic joke” angle on grief is fresh: Maya’s vengeance inverted into voluntary surrender to the very phenomenon that took her mentor. Returned civilians singing new names and leaving upward-falling stones weaponizes familiar Missing 411 tropes into lyrical SF. The underground garden as conversion site subverts usual surface-creature cryptid beats. Risk is taken and paid off: institutional skeptic converts without melodrama, closure image keeps ambiguity alive.</comment>
