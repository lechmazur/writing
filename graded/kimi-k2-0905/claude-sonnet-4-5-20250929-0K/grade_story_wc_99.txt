<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira’s need to “read” the lace and to tend memory instead of recovering the past is embodied in her micro-choices (opening the box, pruning). Yet the grandmother remains an off-stage cipher; her only contradictory impulse is relayed through Takeo’s calm exposition, so the interior conflict is filtered, not dramatized in scene. The final renunciation is credible and costs her the fantasy of reunion, but the emotional groundwork is second-hand, keeping the score just under the 8.8 gate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: Mira accepts that restoration is horticultural, not archaeological, and the cerule horizon re-weights “color of unspoken apologies.” Causality is intact because the lace pattern literally instructs the pruning act that enacts this shift. The reflective load is high (~30%) but anchored to present tactile cues and alters her immediate tactics, satisfying the BRR exception. One small orientation wobble: we reach word 138 before the islet location is confirmed, but the delaying haze serves the final image, so the Orientation Test penalty is waived.</comment>

<comment>Post-storm islet, wet sand, salt air, and the driftwood table constrain the pacing—everything must be done before dusk, in full view of the mutable “cerulean” horizon that will later carry the thematic color. The brass compass re-appears in-hand, its trembling needle supplying micro-setting pressure. Bonsai tools and lace square act as portable “settings” whose spatial arrangements dictate every cut and pause. Only the 8.8 gate is missed because no object/environment finally blocks an alternative path; the horizon is evocative but not an active obstacle.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: learn how to mourn without recovering the lost ship. Under an Accumulative lens, pressure tightens when each lace motif translates into a literal snip of living branch, making silence material. The visible price is the surrendered fantasy of finding the ship; that forfeit is dramatized on the page when she moves from clutching the compass to setting it down beside the pruned tree. Coincidence is absent; escalation is modest but sufficient for 800-word scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the concrete act of shaping bonsai according to lace instructions: repair is not retrieval but disciplined tending of what remains. Subtext lives in gesture—compass set down, branch cut—never in thesis statements. The final cerulean horizon re-prices the concept of apology, refusing a moral and leaving ambiguity between sky and sea. Only a hairline deduction for one quasi-aphorism: “apologies need not be spoken to be real,” stated aloud by Takeo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person tight to Mira holds without leakage; perceptual signature is filtered through her novice patient eye—she notices tide-lines in lace, salt smell of “renewal,” trembling compass needle. Rhythm mirrors the slow bonsai work: long sentences breathe, then shorten on each snip. Takeo’s dialogue idiom is distinct—meditative, oceanic—but remains subordinate to Mira’s focalization. No head-hop; no register drift; no filter-verb clusters under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is almost loop-free; only two adjacent near-paraphrases (“salt and renewal” / “smelled of salt and renewal”) cost −0.2. Figurative language is sparse and coherent; no mixed metaphors. Sentence rhythm consciously echoes wave and snip, accelerating slightly at the pruning beats without-template cadence. Copy is clean; information density high—each paragraph advances knowledge or atmosphere. Artifacts do not touch the closing horizon image, so 9-band remains reachable.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The lace-as-bonsai-manual is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that could not be swapped out without collapsing the instruction plot. Ghost-ship compass repurposed as memory-needle rather than treasure map avoids trope default. Risk is quiet—no structural acrobatics—but the concept commits fully. Slight familiarity in post-storm island & mentor figure tempers score, yet specificity of textile choreography keeps it above median.</comment>
