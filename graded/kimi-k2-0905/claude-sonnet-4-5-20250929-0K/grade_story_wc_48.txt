<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade>  
<comment>The novelist’s paralysis, her “strange practice,” and the final crystallization of her protagonist’s stance all track cleanly through embodied micro-choices (pressing shell to temple, pocketing it, turning homeward). Interior contradiction is vivid: she mistrusts endings yet chases them, and the cost—carrying the sharp-edged hope of memory—is felt in the closing image. No stock interiority or therapy-speak; the flaw (obsessive witnessing) complicates rather than solves. The only minor drag is that the chorus of cameo figures remains gestural; they pressure her but do not individuate, so relationship crucible is absent by scope, not error.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the shell fragment, once a broken record of growth, becomes the emblem of refusal to forget. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—each apparition layers density until the pattern breaks into the insight that “the question was false.” Cost is undeniable: she accepts the “sharp-edged and terrible” burden of memory. Orientation is anchored by word 50 (“feral nexus”), and the reflective block is interleaved with on-page stimuli and micro-choices, satisfying BRR exception.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>  
<comment>The ruined lighthouse, salt-poisoned earth, and invasive thorns are selectively sketched yet constrain choice (paths converge, only one exit). The spiral shell fragment functions as micro-setting: handled twice, its jagged edge literalizes the cost of memory. Mist is not backdrop but medium—figures “move against the current of dissolution” inside it. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: mathematic curves of shell, tactile press to temple, final pocketing—each tactile engagement advances the stake.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>  
<comment>Dominant stake—how to end her novel without betraying the dead—arrives by line 3. Escalation is textural: each apparition tightens the same question until the option space collapses to “the harder third thing.” Agency is cognitive—her realization reweights all prior material rather than changing external terrain. Visible cost is the acceptance of perpetual grief; the tightening would sharpen further if one tactic were physically forfeited, but at this length the cognitive turn suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>  
<comment>Theme emerges from the shell’s broken spiral and the refusal to let forgetting win; no explicit moral is stated. The final image—“she carried something now that she hadn’t before”—reconfigures the entire story’s meaning without abstract assertion. Subtext operates in gesture: laying down arms, forgetting a face, planting in salt—all are silent moral arguments. The piece resists binaries (mercy vs vengeance) and lands in a charged poise whose cost is felt.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>  
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to the novelist’s perceptual filter: mathematics of growth, lantern that casts no light, current of dissolution. Syntax grows slightly fragmented under pressure (“sharp-edged and terrible—”), mirroring her narrowed cognition. No dialogue, so voice purity rests on rhythmic control and diction within her plausible lexicon. The lyric pattern (cameo, dissolve, re-form) is taught early and paid off in the final line without ever breaking POV.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>  
<comment>Prose is dense yet airy: “mist rolled in from the sea like breath against glass” does triple sensory work. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or insight. Metaphors stay coherent (current, spiral, breath) and culminate in the closure image. One tiny scaffold—“she had learned to be lucidly watchful”—could compress, but it occupies low-pressure space and does not dull the final beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>  
<comment>The “writer blocked at the edge of the world” trope is transfigured by the Accumulative apparition engine and the shell’s reweighting. Risk is taken: static vignettes instead of external plot, yet the pattern teaches itself early and charges the ending. Specificity of “salt-poisoned earth” and “feral nexus” roots the concept in coastal decay rather than generic limbo. The synthesis feels inevitable—only this narrator, only this shoreline, only this shell could yield this particular refusal.</comment>
