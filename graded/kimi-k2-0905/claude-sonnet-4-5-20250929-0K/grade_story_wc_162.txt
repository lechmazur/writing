<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is textured and embodied; her contradictory impulses (search vs. endure, blame vs. understand) play out in her fingertips on the rail and in the logbook micro-choice. The final stance—teaching thresholds instead of crossing them—arrives via the oak’s grain and her father’s mathematics, so the renunciation is earned and priced. Minor slip: “featherly determined” is used as label twice before it is dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: Mara writes PRESNT beside BECMG, renaming her father’s weather code into lived presence; the cost is the lifetime she spent carrying the logbook and the future she now surrenders by refusing to “cross.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: every shard adds density to thresholds, grain, and codes until the final image reweights love as distance kept, not bridged. Orientation is taught early (“the terrace drifted…”) and paid off in the prism shimmer at the end; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The drifting-prism terrace functions as both macro-setting and micro-setting: its impossible surface forces the survivors to invent new spatial intuitions, and the oak rail’s grain becomes the tactile map Mara navigates. The logbook and the rail are recurring objects whose altered states (her annotation, the compressed ring) directly shape the final choice. Sensory hierarchy is POV-filtered: Mara’s carpenter-eye reads wood before void.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—how to live with a father who left by threshold instead of doorway—tightens when Mara’s reading of the twenty-third ring collapses blame into comprehension. Escalation is textural: each mention of maze, code, or grain adds layer until the final annotation reweights the entire pattern. Cost is visible: she forfeits the child-role and accepts lifelong stewardship of thresholds. One micro-turn suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the repeating motif of measured distance: corn-maze corridors, weather codes, growth rings, and finally the decision to stand still. No character articulates the thesis; instead the logbook’s rewritten code performs it. The aftereffect is a hush that feels like love redefined as spatial mercy—an insight that lingers without sentimentality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyric-patterned compression (“fractured hush,” “featherly determined”) is taught in the first paragraph and remains legible. Syntax mirrors carpenter-daughter precision: clauses splice like wood grain. POV distance stays tight; no head-hop. Register never drifts into academic; diction stays within Mara’s artisan lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Rhythm modulates from long refracting sentences to the clipped final exchange; no template cadence. Figurative density is high but patterned—light/void/wood triad—so it accrues rather than obscures. One micro-loop: “distance kept and distance closed” is a near-paraphrase yet serves as thematic hinge, forgiven.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of weather-code meteorology + corn-maze topology + post-causality drift creates a fresh conceptual scaffold. The father’s final threshold is neither suicide nor transcendence but a spatial rite that unmade physics; Mara’s refusal to repeat it is non-obvious. Risk in structure (lyric shards) heightens resonance without losing clarity.</comment>
