<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren’s quietly obsessive caretaker persona is sharply etched through tactile micro-choices—fingerless gloves, fountain-pen ledger, private journal separate from official records. Internal contradiction flickers when detached cataloguing suddenly collides with involuntary tears, proving her stoic stance is porous. The slide’s 528 Hz “warmth” is the pivot where her private longing breaks cover, giving the ending its cost. Still, the story leans on reflective summary more than in-scene pressure, so the full arc of renunciation feels slightly under-cooked on the page.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: crystal-hush setting + successive slide measurements tighten the dominant stake—“can any promise survive oblivion?”—until the undiminished 528 Hz pattern breaks the fade-only rule. Closure earns Conceptual Repricing: Maren re-categorizes her life’s work as vigil for the rare irrepressible vow, a stance shift with felt professional/existential cost. Causality remains internal but coherent; no orientation or prop issues. Lacks one external obstacle or ticking clock to push tension past 9.0 threshold.</comment>

<comment>Frozen-library above cloudline is not backdrop but survival constraint—cold that bites joints, glass that cracks, tears that threaten to freeze. Temperature-controlled cases, spectral refraction, ice-expansion pops keep the environment live in every beat. Micro-setting is literally built into the measuring device and slide-handling gloves, tools that constrain choreography. Final image of golden light refracted through the kept slide fuses setting with thematic re-pricing, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—documenting vow-decay vs. hope of permanence—tightens through each frequency reading; the 528 Hz outlier is the single decisive intensification. Because lens is Accumulative, escalation is density/pattern break, not external jeopardy; cost is existential, paid by Maren’s rewritten life-mission. Would edge higher if one slide had threatened immediate physical consequence (meltdown, quota deadline) to force a riskier micro-choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges purely imagistically: spectral color vs. white nullity, fading Hz vs. steadfast 528. No reader-dictated moral—just a private journal entry “Evidence that some promises outlive memory itself,” which still lets the silence speak. Subtext lies in haptic detail—wool, frost, glass—more than exposition. Avoids overt thesis statement but flirts with “luminous vows” as abstract trope; trimming one adjective line could sharpen further.</comment>

<comment>Third-limited voice carries a curator’s cool precision: “quartz hush,” “temperature-controlled case,” “spectral color” catalogued like exhibit notes. Rhythm lengthens in calms, tightens into short sensory bursts under discovery. Free indirect thought (“someone must document what remains”) stays within her professional idiom. No dialogue = no voice-clash risk; perceptual signature is consistent, if slightly academic.</comment>

<comment>Prose is clean, varied, high-density: each sentence advances cataloguing process or atmospheric pressure. Figurative layer is restrained—no metaphor pile-ups in peak beat. Minor scaffold: “gently meticulous” appears twice; “luminous vows” three times could lose one. No loops, no filter-verb stacks, no mixed metaphors. Copy-level mechanics flawless.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>“Library of broken promises as frozen sky-archive” is fresh world-building; frequency-meter yielding emotional data literalizes metaphor without feeling gimmicky. Core insight—that archivists live for the exception that vindicates their futile vigil—offers non-obvious emotional payoff. Could push higher if the vow-type taxonomy or Hz science revealed stranger specificity rather than familiar wedding/soldier slides.</comment>
