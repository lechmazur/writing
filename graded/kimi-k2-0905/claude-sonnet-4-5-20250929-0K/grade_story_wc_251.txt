<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Miss Chen’s interiority is textured through chess-as-metaphor and a perceptual signature that notices silence; Danny’s disappointment lands in embodied gestures rather than labels. Their power dynamic—mentor steering a minor toward dissent—carries credible stakes, and her renunciation of his continued attendance (she demands free thought, not membership) crystallizes her values at cost. Yet Danny’s arc is largely reactive; his final decision to confront his father is off-page, muting the felt cost that would push this into the 8-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: Miss Chen’s diagonal queen move re-weights the rules—chess becomes a model for distributed resistance—while the misted library window glows as an undeniable social cost. Causality holds under an Accumulative lens: each micro-choice (sharing sketches, naming the grotto, refusing to beg Danny to stay) accretes until the final image reconfigures the town’s “predictable geometry.” The late reveal of synchronized window displays is earned because earlier beats taught the pattern of symbolic action over confrontation. No orientation debt; time/space anchors clear by line 40.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Cobalt glass, mist, and dimming light serve as both atmosphere and metaphorical filter—literally tinting perception—while the chessboard and window sketches function as micro-settings that constrain tactics. Sensory economy is biased toward sight and hush, matching the idea of “amplified quiet.” The magnetic grotto itself is withheld until mid-scene, a minor orientation lag, but its starlit under-bridge locale is sharply re-envisioned as a clandestine forum. Environment does not physically alter the climax, preventing entry to 9-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can a teacher seed civic disobedience without losing her student?—tightens when Miss Chen risks Danny’s withdrawal by refusing to coddle him. Escalation is textural: each disclosure (grotto, numbers growth, window plan) raises the social cost of complicity. Danny’s agency is thin; the final tightening depends on Miss Chen’s micro-gesture, not his irrevocable choice, so the visible price lands on her alone, capping intensity below 8.5.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars—chess pieces, window symbols, misted glass—rather than slogans. The forest of second thoughts is never lectured; it accretes through sketches and synchronized quiet. Final image of the glowing library reframes the premise: rebellion can be a soft light that makes geometry waver, avoiding tidy moral. Subtext in dialogue (“I hear unspoken words”) carries double meaning that rewards re-reading.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited clings tightly to Miss Chen’s perceptual filter: she hears footsteps as semantic data and sees “predictable geometry” outside. Syntax elongates in reflective beats, then shortens when she pitches the plan, mirroring persuasive urgency. Filter verbs (“she thought”) are minimal; metaphors stay within her pedagogical register. Distinctive cadence in “amplified quiet is louder than shouting” reads like her private aphorism, not authorial appliqué.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; sentences switch length to mirror reflective vs. persuasive beats. No synonym loops or template cadence; figurative language is sparse enough to avoid density penalty. One strained metaphor—“forests of second thoughts”—is forgiven because it is immediately contextualized via window displays. Opening and closing lines are ear-tested; final sentence lifts “cobalt library” from first paragraph to create resonant frame.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The conceit of synchronized window displays as civic resistance is fresh, low-tech, and plausible, avoiding dystopian tropes. Chess coach as quiet revolutionary seeds an original synthesis of pedagogy and activism. Specificity—cobalt glass, philosophy shelf hesitation, starlit grotto—prevents abstraction. The “amplified quiet” thesis feels non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight, satisfying transformation test.</comment>
