<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mei’s emotional mass-mod acts as a lived barometer, anchoring her joy in physical drift; her obsession with crystallized grief is credibly obsessive, but Akio’s pacifist stance stays mostly ornamental and costs her nothing concrete in their one exchange.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The piece teaches an accumulative pattern—photograph shimmer-spectra layering toward resonance—and lands a Charged Poise: the ship lights dim as grief becomes portal, cost felt in the undeniability of ‘luminous emptiness’; causality holds under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Observation deck micro-gravity, magnetic cradle for the Tear, and fractal photo grid give tactile staging; ship’s seventeen rebirths act as iterative palimpsest that ultimately constrains the final transformation, satisfying micro-setting rule.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will accumulated grief be faced or buried—tightens once via Mei’s decision to fire the resonance chamber; cost legible in Akio’s hand-grab anchoring against irreversible aperture, though external antagonistic pressure stays abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of collective shadow-confrontation emerges through photo-salt harmonics rather than thesis statements; final ‘luminous emptiness’ reweights earlier dread into terrible beauty, achieving resonance without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person close retains Mei’s idiom—‘peculiar lightness’, ‘ghostly resolve’—with controlled psychic distance; no head-hop, clean free-indirect drift, and cadence that breathes with her rising/falling mass.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong verbs (‘grazing’, ‘blazed’, ‘prepared to be transformed’) and selective sensory detail keep momentum; only minor filter-verb clusters (‘she could feel’) and one mixed metaphor (‘pain...pooled like water behind a dam’) short of 9-band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fusion of bodhisattva relic, spectroscopic grief-print, and generation-ship palimpsest feels fresh; risk in crystallized-tear-as-key pays off because mechanics are seeded early and closure re-images the ship itself as final chrysalis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.4</grade><grade>Akio’s pacifism is declared, shapes no tactics, and is abandoned the moment he takes Mei’s hand; meets only setup gate, hence capped below functional midpoint.</grade>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.5</grade><grade>Tear is seeded early, magnetically suspended, and re-emerges as the aperture lens in the closure glow; its specific crystalline refraction is irreplaceable to the dimensional breach.</grade>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</question><grade>‘Shadow work’ is named, enacted via photo-salt decoding, and justifies the entire resonance experiment; one beat short of higher band but clearly shapes mid-story choices.</grade>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><grade>Mass-to-joy trait enables the floating opening beat and literal ‘lift’ at climax when she rises again; visible trade-off anchors emotional state in physics, though no escalating cost is drawn from it.</grade>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><grade>‘Stitch’ governs Mei’s fractal photo arrangement and metaphor of mending torn collective psyche; synonym could not replace without rewriting central mechanics, but it is more metaphor than prop.</grade>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.0</grade><grade>Shimmer-reading method appears in first third, drives the spectroscopic decoding, and enables the final frequency lock; mechanics are explicit and outcome-dependent.</grade>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><grade>Seventeen-times-rebuilt ship supplies history strata and final transformation readiness; micro-setting matters yet could have been another generational ark with light edits.</grade>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.0</grade><grade>‘Last human born 32 yrs ago’ sets species twilight urgency but produces no ticking clock or deadline altering tactics; functions as atmospheric rather than causal timer.</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><question>Desire to open locked dimension is stated early, contested by Akio, and acted on in climax where she literally activates chamber; friction between fear and necessity is dramatized.</question>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</question><question>‘Ghostly resolve’ saturates opening and recurs in final ship readiness; tone modulates from dread to awe, charging the luminous aperture image, though not uniquely indispensable.</question>
