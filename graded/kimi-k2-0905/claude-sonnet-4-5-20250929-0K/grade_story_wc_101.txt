<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is concrete—rolling the bell, feeling inscriptions, deciding to speak—each micro-choice visibly alters risk and tactics. The contradiction between secrecy and communal need is embodied, not labeled, and the final renunciation of anonymity costs her the safety she prized. The only drag is a touch of explanatory summary (“anonymous donations feed bodies but starve something else”) that momentarily abstracts the felt stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: sanctions → hunger → midnight runs → anonymity’s limit → public declaration → communal pledge to inherit the bell. The arbor gathering is a decisive change that forecloses Mara’s invisible role; cost is legible in her exposed vulnerability. One minor causality bump: the network’s continental reach is asserted rather than shown, but it does not break the closure lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Terra-cotta arbor, clay softened by wind, silver bell passed hand to hand—each tactile detail is filtered through exile POV and constrains the final public act. Spatial choreography holds as bodies gather on the ridge; the bell’s weight and weathered clay charge the culminating image. No wasted landscape catalog, only the objects that bear memory and future risk.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—community survival without loss of dignity—tightens when anonymity threatens cultural continuity. One meaningful escalation: Mara chooses exposure, narrowing her own options and forcing communal ownership of the risk. Cost is visible in the instant the bell is publicly raised; the price of her visibility is irreversible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of invisible solidarity emerges from bread parcels and star cards, not thesis statements. The final image—bell passed forward—reweights exile from isolation to recursive mutual aid, leaving resonant ambiguity about whether sanctions will ever lift. No moralizing coda; meaning is charged through the object’s transfer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-limited voice maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature is tactile—palm on silver, clay grit, engine wheeze. Syntax lengthens under reflection, shortens under risk (“She rang it three times”). No head-hop, no filter-verb clutter; diction stays within Mara’s lived lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and rhythm; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is sparse and accurate (“sound rippling like water finding its level”). Paragraph cuts are purposeful—each advances knowledge or stakes. Clean grammar, no scaffolding; high information density without purple overload.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The anonymous-aid network plot is familiar, but the bell as intergenerational baton and the terra-cotta arbor as exile parliament give the piece specific cultural texture. Risk is taken in the quiet ending—no sanctions lifted, no heroic rescue—yet the closure feels inevitable. Could push further into non-obvious moral calculus for the 9-band.</comment>
