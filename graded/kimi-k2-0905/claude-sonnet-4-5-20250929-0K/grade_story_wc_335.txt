<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The archivist’s nervous backwards-walking is a vivid, embodied tick that complicates her authority and humanizes her mentor role. Finn’s “combative tenderness” is dramatized through insults that beg for approval, giving credible interior contradiction. The final micro-choice—Finn copying the tea-leaf geometry—earns a quiet change, though the cost feels light for 750 words. Interiority sometimes drifts into therapeutic summary (“exiled their fear onto you”) that blunts the edge of embodied emotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the pair’s shared reflection in the trapped shadow crystallizes “reversible exile” with felt cost—the librarian admits she still walks backwards. Causality is lyric-accumulative; each mention of the glass shard and tea-leaf geometry accretes meaning rather than forcing plot turns. Orientation is swift: who/where/when anchored within 60 words. The ending image reweights the premise without explanatory moralizing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Library operates as micro-setting: dust-laden aisles, broken window, copper kettle—all tactile, lived-in, and filtered through archivist habit. The trapped shadow in glass functions as portable setting/object that constrains the final image. Selective sensory layering (taste of copper, ghost-sound of swing) supports tone without tourist catalog. Spatial choreography stays clean through the single-room choreography.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can exile reverse? Pressure tightens when Finn touches the shard and the shadow ripples—knowledge that banishment might be two-way narrows their emotional options. No external antagonist; tension is internal/relational. Cost is conceptual but legible: archivist confesses ongoing fear, Finn commits to reading his own geometry—path foreclosed, new stance assumed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: brokenness as lens, exile as reversible through self-reading. Subtext resides in gestures—backwards walking, tea-leaf copying—rather than thesis statements. Final image of “two exiles discovering… walking in unexpected directions” offers resonant non-literal answer. Avoids final-paragraph sermon; wisdom stays anchored in concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Narrative voice sustains hushed, elegiac rhythm with controlled syntactic variation. Archivist POV stays tight; no head-hop. Diction skews lyrical—“shard-mirror archivist,” “afternoon shadow caught in glass”—yet remains consistent with bibliophile sensibility. Dialogue sparse but distinct: Finn’s clipped insults contrast with archivist’s measured cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical yet disciplined; no template cadence or synonym loops. Metaphors (“trapped shadow,” “ghost-sound of swing”) stay coherent and purposeful. Minor scaffold: “She poured the tea, then upended…” could compress, but rhythm serves quietude. Information density high; each sentence layers sensory, emotional, or symbolic freight.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: tea-leaf geomancy + reversible exile theory + glass-entrapped shadows. Concept feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk is quiet—choosing contemplative lyric over plot fireworks—and pays off via charged poise ending. Transformation test passes: swap elements and whole arc collapses.</comment>
