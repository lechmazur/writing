<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elena’s interior contradiction—genuine observation vs fabricated data—remains active throughout; her micro-choice to strip away the false numbers and re-submit raw field notes costs her the last hope of immediate academic redemption and is embodied in the shiver of the lantern light on the page. The chameleon-as-mirror is understated but effective; her spoken line “Honestly this time” crystallizes a credibly flawed self-forgiveness rather than a tidy redemption.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Decisive Change: the new document title typed in the final paragraph irrevocably forecloses the old fraudulent path and incurs the social cost of academic exile; the lens is Causal—each beat narrows her options until only the honest qualitative paper remains. The “shedding” image taught early (skin in corner) cleanly pays off in the final sentence, satisfying the persistent-constraint test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The mountain mist, lantern flicker, and translucent shed skin are not backdrop but tools: the mist “obscuring and revealing” mirrors her own method shift, and the regenerated tail-tip is handled twice—once as observed evidence, once as moral exemplar—charging the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless; the bench debris and broken thermometer track across beats, grounding every motion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can she salvage scientific truth without statistical armor—is signaled by line 3; pressure tightens when she lifts the broken thermometer and realizes fabrication is no longer tenable. The meaningful turn occurs at the keyboard: choosing qualitative framing forfeits fast-track redemption, a price spelled out in the “journals that valued different approaches” line.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the moral calculus of compassionate observation vs empirical rigor is never sloganized; the final image of starlight “reconstructing itself from scattered pieces” reweights the title concept without moralizing. The chameleon’s shed skin recurs with shifted meaning—first biological fact, then ethical mandate—earning its resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elena’s perceptual filter—notice asymmetry of “one eye rotating independently” and tactile focus on “leather cover worn soft.” Syntax mirrors her slowed-time vigil: long sentences breathe during observation, then compress at the keystroke moment. No head-hop, no filter-verb clutter; diction stays within a field-biologist’s lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and double-jobbing: “mist curled through the gaps in the wooden walls” sets both atmosphere and porous boundary between truth/academia. Figurative control avoids purple overload—only two metaphors across 750 words, both paid off. No loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts are surgical.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Freshens the “disgraced scientist” trope by pivoting to qualitative methodology rather than redemptive triumph; the chameleon’s tail as epistemic metaphor feels specific to this narrator. Risk taken: quiet, no-antagonist plot stakes on method rather than life—coheres under accumulative lens. Not quite 9 because the premise skeleton remains familiar even if flesh is new.</comment>
