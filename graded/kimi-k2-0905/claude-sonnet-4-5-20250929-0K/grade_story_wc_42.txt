<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kenji’s interior contradiction—clinging to preservation while enabling departure—drives every calibration turn; the final “let it spin” renunciation is earned by the grandmother-taught leaf-listening micro-choice and carries visible cost as he forfeits fixity. Embodied emotion (tremor in bones, cold-water realization) stays particular; no stock labels. Only two characters keeps crucible tight; Chen’s luminous worry mirrors stakes without diluting POV. Meets 9+ quick test but micro-choice could be even sharper under final pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the still-spinning hand reweights the entire premise—capture becomes witness, cost is the moon’s measurable distance. Causal chain holds: tremor → orbital decay → recalibrate → spin accepted. Orientation clean by 120 w. One meaningful tightening: “old parameters are gone” forecloses restoration. Persistent constraint (spinning hand) shapes every tactic; cost legible in final image. Lens (Causal) stable throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Titanium struts, brass blur, thin alpine light—selective sensory triad anchors immediacy. Observatory height and shifting bedrock constrain the recalibration imperative; the orrery itself becomes micro-setting that charges closure. Spatial choreography clean: bench, dome aperture, Chen’s shoulder. No exposition dump; world rule (lunar decay) learned through telescope and seismograph. 9+ gate met: tool (orrery hand) directly shapes final choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—record the moon’s leaving—signaled in opening paragraph; acceleration tightens once with “already infinitesimally farther.” Kenji’s agency: redirect rather than resist; this narrowing choice costs the possibility of stasis. Price visible: he surrenders the hope of freezing moments. Under Causal lens, escalation coherent; no coincidence resolves. Could edge higher if a second resource loss altered tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: impermanence as something to be instrumented, not arrested. Subtext in the spinning hand’s final acceptance—witness over control. Final image reweights earlier camera-repair ethos; no moralizing. Luminous ache tone modulates into bittersweet serenity, felt rather than named. Complexity intact: departure is both tragedy and liberation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays strictly in Kenji’s perceptual orbit: “tremor through his feet,” “thin alpine light.” Diction—escape velocity, chronometer, orrery—within sage-tech lexicon. Rhythm accelerates with clause stacks during recalibration, then exhales into final short sentence: “Let it spin.” No head-hopping; distance stable. Distinctive sensory signature (sound of falling leaf) reprised at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Figurative layer (“clockwork heart,” “escape velocity from time”) stays coherent, never muddled. High information density: each sentence advances mechanism or stakes. Zero paraphrase loops; no scaffold. Proofing clean. Meets 9+ quick test: zero artifacts in peak beats; closure image pristine.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise—lunar orbital decay witnessed by clockmaker—feels fresh yet inevitable. Synthesizes celestial mechanics with artisanal precision; not a trope retread. Risk taken: quiet scientific resignation instead of disaster spectacle, yet stakes remain intimate. Specificity of orrery retrofit and leaf-listening method prevents swappability. Could push 9+ with sharper societal ripple beyond observatory.</comment>
