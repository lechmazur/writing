<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The fractal-weaver’s interiority is sensorially grounded (“hands seemed to blur into infinite possibility”), but agency is largely receptive—she waits for burdens to arrive and calcify. The decisive shift from “trapped” to “becoming the trap” is declared rather than dramatized with a visible micro-choice, so the cost feels conceptual more than embodied. Still, the kerosene-burner history seeds a credible lineage of endurance, and the final renunciation lands as coherent Earned Stasis.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: she leaves the crystals behind, fractals stop multiplying, and the burner’s return to daylight reweights the entire mandala of sorrow. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each burden’s arrival and calcification layers density until silence itself becomes the final accumulation. Causality is symbolic rather than sequential, but the pattern is taught early (“she could not stop weaving”) and paid off when she chooses to stop. Cost is legible in the line “she was becoming the trap itself,” where the price is perpetual containment of others’ grief.</comment>

<comment>The bronze grotto functions as micro-setting: its walls supply the mineral substrate that lets burdens crystallize, and the starlight shafts provide the exact angles needed for calcification. Sensory detail is selective—sound is “shingled hush,” touch is “miner’s exhaustion seeping like condensation”—each filtered through the weaver’s perceptual bias. Spatial choreography stays coherent; the burner remains center-stage, and the seventeen crystals form a legible mandala. The environment actively constrains the magic system rather than merely decorating it.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake is the imperative to transform abstract sorrow into bearable crystals; pressure escalates as each new burden arrives and must be correctly oriented before it hardens. The protagonist’s agency is present in her micro-adjustments—cupping, pooling, aligning—each a small tactic that prevents overwhelm. The final stilling of her hands signals the single meaningful tightening: accumulation halts because she accepts the role of container. Cost is the lifelong forfeiture of leaving the grotto unchanged, now a living reliquary.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: grief can be externalized and mineralized, but the collector must become its substratum. The burner’s family history and the crystallized burdens create a lattice of specific particulars; no abstract maxim is imposed. Final image of stars as “burdens that had found their proper angle” conceptually reweights the entire premise, turning cosmic light into voluntary sorrow. Ambiguity is purposeful—reader must decide whether this is transcendence or perpetual servitude.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a consistent fractal diction—“recursive patterns,” “infinite possibility,” “crystalline shafts”—mirroring the protagonist’s perceptual mode. Rhythm modulates from long liquid sentences during descent to staccato listing of crystal types mid-scene, then relaxes into the final quiet. No head-hopping; focalization stays tightly bound to the weaver. The elevated register is justified by the mythic task and never drifts into corporate filler.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but legible; most sentences carry double duty (e.g., “Fatigue hardened into amber-colored crystal, beautiful and terrible”). One paraphrase loop appears—“silence layering over silence”—but it serves the shingle motif and is allowed. Mixed metaphors are avoided; crystallization logic stays physically coherent. Final line delivers a crisp, image-based payoff that re-illuminates earlier starlight shafts without rhetorical overhang.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The conceit of sorrow-as-mineral that must be angle-oriented via inherited lamp burner is genuinely fresh; no standard trope maps grief to geometric crystallization governed by starlight. Risk is high—lyric accumulation could have collapsed into preciousness—but the piece commits fully, and the closure reprises the cosmic scale without cracking the metaphor. Specificity of “bronze dust,” “selenite that glowed beneath the stars,” and the grandmother’s seed-catalog dreams anchors the concept in lived detail. Transformation test fails: swap any element and the entire mandala crumbles.</comment>
