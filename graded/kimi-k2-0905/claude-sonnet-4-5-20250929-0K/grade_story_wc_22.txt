<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The coachman’s quiet, ritualized precision—speaking to birds in dead tongues, kneeling to work seeds into war-salted cracks—makes his interior life legible without exposition. His inherited gift and wartime memory create a lived-in contradiction that justifies the ending’s renunciation. No secondary character appears, so relationship/status bullets are waived. The only cap: we never feel him risk failure; the task seems pre-ordained, so the cost is contemplative rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a lyric Conceptual Repricing: the seeds “begin their work of reclamation” in darkness, making the submerged concord’s redemptive logic felt without sermon. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each scattering beat deepens the pattern until the final image reweights the whole. No orientation debt; twilight/jetty/coachman are anchored by line 3. Lens stays legible throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The jetty’s salt-crusted boards, rusted nails, and freshwater seeps are rendered through tactile action (kneeling, pressing seeds, dew-slick boots). The birds’ calls map the space like sonar, turning the structure into a living manual. The setting constrains every micro-choice and charges the final image of invisible seeds at work. Meets 9+ gate: environment shapes tactics and final charge.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will the garden truly reclaim the battlefield?—is signaled early and tightens via each seed placed. No huge reversal, but the accretive pattern forces a quiet stance crystallization: he leaves the site to darkness and potential, renouncing further control. Cost is conceptual—the soldiers’ absence is permanent, the reef stays dead—but felt in the image of seeds abandoned to tide and time. Sufficient for 600-word scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of militarily poisoned ground into unplanned fertility; no character spells it out. The dead-language whisper “Mortuus est campus, vivat hortus” is the closest thing to a thesis, yet it’s a private ritual, not exposition. Final image reweights the premise: reclamation is ongoing, unpaid, and largely hidden. Avoids moralizing; lets the biological fact carry the irony.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close stays inside the coachman’s multilingual, bird-tuned perceptual field; diction never exceeds his plausible lexicon. Rhythm modulates from measured Latin cadences to the clipped bird-call translations, mirroring the shift from human mourning to non-human instruction. No dialogue, so mechanics bullets are waived. Patterned elision (no exposition of grandmother or war crimes) is taught early and paid off in the earned hush of the ending.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is compact and image-dense yet fluid: “wood slick with evening dew” does triple duty—texture, risk, temporal marker. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances seed, setting, or memory. Figurative control holds even at peak (“submerged concord” stays consistent with brackish mixing). One near-purple moment—“vastness of darkening water”—but it is POV-colored and brief, not touching closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Freshest synthesis: multilingual avian agriculture manual performed on a military jetty. The dead reef/fresh-spring concord is a scientifically plausible but narratively non-obvious image. Risk—quiet lyric horticulture—pays off by making the reclamation internal to the reader’s imagination. Could not swap setting or object without collapsing the whole conceit.</comment>
