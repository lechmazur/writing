<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The keeper’s shift from archivist to witness is embodied in micro-choices—gripping reality loosely, clearing sediment by handfuls—each tactile gesture anchoring an interior arc. Flaws (compulsive witnessing that borders on self-erasure) complicate every beat; the final smile carries the cost of never naming truth again. No contradictory impulses are voiced in scene, so the arc feels slightly under-catalyzed, but the earned stasis still lands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each image layers decay until the library and keeper meld. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—her calcifying bones add the final archive—with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are implied early by texture rather than exposition, satisfying the waiver. No causality breaks; the origami swan’s late rule is taught one beat before payoff.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Obsidian refuge, mineral-script columns, and paper soft-as-fabric constrain every movement; their material logic dictates the pace of burrowing and the final stillness. Sensory hierarchy skews tactile—sediment between fingers, hum in stone—matching the keeper’s haptic epistemology. Spatial choreography is dream-clear: descent stair by stair, drip by thousand-year drip. The setting charges the ending image without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: witness vs. preservation. Tightening occurs when the origami swan rewrites the quest—burrow, don’t catalogue—narrowing options to dissolution. Cost is the loss of taxonomic language itself, felt in the final smile. Pressure plateaus rather than spikes; one deepening suffices but keeps the score sub-8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from decaying text becoming living geology; no sentence spells a moral. The origami swan’s final fold—“Everything that knows itself completely stops growing”—reprices the entire premise without sermon. Ambiguity lingers: is entropy loss or liberation? Resonance is concrete, not asserted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is crystalline, slow, mineral: long vowels and caesuras mimic drip-time. Perceptual signature notices texture over taxonomy—“paper grown soft as fabric,” “silence pooled like water.” Compression teaches its pattern by line three and never wavers. No head-hopping; interior distance swells then dissolves with the keeper.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from terse clauses to liquid cascades; no two openings repeat. Figurative language is sparse, each metaphor geologically accurate—no mixed vehicles. Information density high: one line (“history composted itself”) performs decay, irony, and world-rule. Zero loops or scaffold; final line’s inverted syntax recharges “letting go.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: library as stalactite necropolis + origami as living map. Risk—plotless dissolution—heightens rather than obscures stakes. Detail is unrepeatable: fossils of collectively dreamed creatures. Conceptual integrity commits to entropy as genesis; no retreat to heroism.</comment>
