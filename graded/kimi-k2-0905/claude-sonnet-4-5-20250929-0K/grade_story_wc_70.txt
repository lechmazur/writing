<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira’s compulsive honesty is dramatized the moment she blurts “This is frustrating,” and her final micro-choice to name the riddle-answer aloud crystallizes her role. Chen’s regret is equally embodied in the cracked voice and the trembling spread of flawed schematics. The two carry sufficient contradictory impulse and visible cost to satisfy the 9- gate, though the shift in Mira’s personal stake is more intellectual than visceral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: hoard-code → drones withhold → blackout → tower meeting → confession → new open-handed design. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: Mira’s spoken answer publicly reframes the catastrophe and commits both characters to a costlier, inefficient future. The amber-lit planning scene undeniably charges the final image with felt social cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The copper-warm coils, lacquer box of gold-leaf bees, and nectar dusk light are returned at closure, reweighting “efficiency vs. wonder.” The tower deck constrains the conversation—no escape from the site of failure—and the matchbox micro-prop is handled twice, focusing attention. Environment specifics directly shape the decision to abandon optimized code.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—whether to reinstall generosity at the price of reliability—tightens once when Chen hands over the “gloriously imperfect” schematics. Mira’s inability to soften the public report guarantees future personal cost, supplying a visible price that forecloses the safer path of silence. Agency is intellectual but definitive under the causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through the drones-bees parallel rather than lecture: hoarding kills, generosity animates. The final line quietly re-coins “bee” as hope, achieving resonance without moralizing. One sentence (“progress without wonder was just elaborate death”) flirts with Echo but is earned by the preceding mechanical corpses and blackout fallout.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Narrative voice is steady close-third, syntactically controlled, with perceptual signature in Mira’s involuntary candor. No head-hop; psychic distance tightens appropriately under the amber glow. Compression in the opening bridge paragraph is taught by syntax and paid off in the final cooperative planning, keeping elision legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; only one soft paraphrase loop (“drones…they…they”) appears mid-scene. Metaphors (nectar dusk, copper coils) remain coherent and value-adding. No register drift or filter-verb stack; high information density advances every sentence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Using a citywide blackout to interrogate algorithmic thrift in pollinator drones is fresh; coupling it with a truth-compelled witness gives private failure public stakes. The riddle-gimmick is familiar, but its answer reframes both bee biology and energy ethics, so the synthesis feels specific rather than borrowed.</comment>
