<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marcus’s interiority stays lean but legible; his need for a counter-narrative to the Institute’s verdict drives every beat. The vine-dresser’s pragmatism shows in tactile ritual, not exposition—each marble placement is a micro-choice that rewrites her past. Their status flip (seeker → witness, victim → oracle) is earned through the garden’s visible preference. No stock therapy-speak; even the thematic line “gardens know their gardeners” is uttered after physical proof, not before.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the maze’s impossible bloom/rot reweights the entire luck premise without a single decimal. Causal lens holds—every because/therefore links Marcus’s score to the vine-dresser’s counter-experiment. Orientation anchored by line 3; no teleporting props. Cost is visible in the dying wisteria that opens for her but not for him—constraint that will persist after page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The garden is not backdrop but antagonist: seasonal impossibility forces the conceptual repricing. Micro-setting = cracked marbles function as soil-fertility record; their spiral arrangement charges the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless—tendril, fountain pipe, hedge regrowth all track. Weather and season disobey calendar to enact the theme; that violation is the closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can identity be quantified?—is signaled in line 1 and tightened when the maze physically sides with the vine-dresser. Agency is observational (Marcus) and ritual (her polishing); both foreclose the Institute’s authority without reversing it. Cost: the garden’s simultaneous life/death state becomes irreversible, a living refutation. No off-stage luck; the maze’s betrayal is the on-page reversal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from vegetal defiance: measurement vs. belonging. Subtext sits in the cracked marbles—fracture as record of survival, not damage. Final image reconfigures “luck” as ecological allegiance, stated only via the garden’s impossible season. No moralizing; the thesis is a purple crocus in November.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Lyrical third-person stays close to Marcus’s sensory filter yet allows metaphoric altitude. Syntax mirrors vegetal growth—clauses curl, snap, flower. No head-hop; vine-dresser’s voice is reported through Marcus’s ear, maintaining distance. Register shift from clinical “negative seven” to vegetal myth is deliberate and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero scaffold; every sentence advances image or stake. Figurative layer is spare—only “light like broken teeth”—and that simile reappears in the marbles, earning its place. Rhythm accelerates into the final paragraph where nouns stack like seeds. No filter verbs, no synonym loops; “polishing” gains meaning each repetition.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Freshest angle: botanical memory as counter-data to algorithmic fate. Cracked marbles > fortune cookies. Risk: impossible horticulture, but the story commits fully—seasonal disobedience is the entire proof. Transformation test fails if swapped to any object; only a living maze can refute a numeric destiny.</comment>
