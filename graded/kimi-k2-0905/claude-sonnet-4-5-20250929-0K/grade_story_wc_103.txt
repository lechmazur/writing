<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lyra’s interior voice is lyrically specific—“time felt like soil after rain”—and her micro-choices (laying photos on root-etched planks, pressing the fragment) externalize the retrocognitive curse without diagnostic jargon. The contradiction between mapping time and being consumed by it is alive in scene, not summary. Cost is legible when she forfeits the photographs—her last external memory scaffolding—to the hyperbolic unfolding. Still, the renunciation is slightly under-cooked: we see the warm paper but not the visceral stab of losing every hedge she ever built.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative-textural lens holds: each photograph dissolution increases density rather than causal sequence, culminating in a Charged Poise where mazes become temporal bone-structure. Orientation is swift—bridge-ravine-fragment anchored by line 3. The reversal (photos gone, garden rewired) is on-page with conceptual cost: her past is now literally un-walled. One minor warp: “tomorrow or yesterday” is repeated motif, not fresh tightening; the beat still lands but the cadence flickers.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Bridge-garden is not backdrop but prosthetic: roots tighten path choices, railing sockets accept the fragment, ravine depth mirrors memory drop-off. Hyperbolic vegetal geometry is sensed through touch and kinaesthetic slope rather than visual postcard. The final image—fragment glowing in railing exactly where it began—charges the loop with embodied place. Micro-setting triumph: the leather case’s brass clasp clicks open/closed, tracking tool-state across beats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“map time or be un-mapped by it”—is signaled in first paragraph and tightens when photos begin irreversible unfold. Agency is present at every increment: she chooses to touch, to surrender, to re-slot the fragment. Felt price is the evaporating mazes; option set narrows to eternal recurrence inside the living lattice. One escalate could be sharper: the moment she realizes escape is impossible is implied, not dramatized, muting peak pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from reciprocal metaphor: maze = temporal curvature, hedge = memory wall. No moralizing; instead, the closing image re-prices existence as navigable but unfinishable garden. Subtext of design-as-self-erasure is carried by the vanished photographs—an object lesson in professional hubris. The resonance is specific to her occupation; swap “composer” and the emotional algebra collapses.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric hovers at middle-distance, able to slip into synesthetic physics—“golden streams hung suspended”—yet stay rooted in moss underfoot. Syntax elongates then fractures mirroring backward time-slips: long anacoluthon clauses snap into single-line staccato beats. No head-hop; every perception is Lyra-filtered. Diction stays within her surveyor lexicon until “hyperbolic geometry” is correctly—if densely—deployed; one archaisms (“silver halide”) is earned by photo context.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is high-density lyric with zero paraphrase loops; each sentence either advances root-motion or re-specifies light. Metaphors are vegetal-physics hybrids that stay coherent: “crystallized light” later reifies as cooling mineral fragment. Rhythm modulates from luxuriant carpet sentences to fragment shards at climax, mirroring photo disintegration. Only minor slip: “yellowed more each day” is cliché cluster amid otherwise fresh imagery.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: retrocognition as topological garden architecture. Combines memory-loss trope with mathematical curvature rarely seen outside hard-SF, yet grounds it in tactile botanic work. Risk of over-abstraction is embraced and paid off when bridge itself re-knits into lived maze. Variant on eternal-return is individuated by her profession-specific guilt: every hedge she ever planted becomes the bars of her own cell. The transformation test fails—swap beekeeper and the vegetal-math spine collapses—confirming genuine novelty.</comment>
