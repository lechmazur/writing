<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Miren’s seed-sorter identity is established early and colors her noticing, but her transformation is reported (“there was something fluid”) rather than dramatized; the epiphany is delivered as summary, not embodied choice. Interiority leans on abstract labels (“obsession,” “mystery she pursued”) without contradictory impulses acted under pressure. The final stance—merging with the message—is earned, yet the cost is poetic assertion, not on-page forfeiture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The causal spine holds: leaf pattern → curiosity → moonstone trigger → ability shift → purposeful building; each beat because/therefore advances her stance. Closure lands cleanly—“she had become the message”—a Conceptual Repricing that reweights the whole quest; cost is legible in her irrevocable fusion with the arbor’s memorial purpose. Orientation is swift; world rules remain consistent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>“Ashen skyborne arbor” and “perpetual twilight” anchor immediately; the floating tree’s bark, copper light, and falling leaves are tactile, lived-in, and filter through Miren’s taxonomic gaze. The setting subtly guides choice—only from the oldest branch can the moonstone speck be accessed—charging the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless; no exposition dumps.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode the leaf message—is signaled in paragraph two; pressure intensifies when spirals spell almost-words, tightening again with the moonstone bell-sound that forces a perceptual upgrade. One meaningful escalation suffices: her new seed-mandalas sprout better, proving the payoff. Cost is present yet soft—she loses mundane precision but the forfeiture is asserted, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of remembrance as repair emerges through concrete ritual—sorting, sketching, building—never lectured. Final image of sky-and-earth reconciliation is implicit in the arbor’s widening reach; ambiguity remains fertile. The past-meets-prophecy refrain risks thematic echo yet feels ancestral, not authorial. Subtext operates in the silence between leaf-spaces.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical, slightly archaic (“hush where past meets prophecy”) yet consistent; perceptual signature—weight, viability, old classifications—remains seed-sorter specific. Sentence rhythm breathes with leaf-fall cadence; no head-hopping. Compression (“she emerged transformed always”) is pattern-taught and paid off. Register stays within Miren’s plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, mostly free of loops; metaphor density is high but patterned and taught early (“branches spreading like veins”). One mixed metaphor—“joy that rose…like the first shoots”—is minor. Information density is strong; each paragraph advances knowledge or image. Final line lands with ringing cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Floating memorial-arbor that writes with falling leaves feels fresh; seed-mandalas as tiny monuments to forgotten things is an elegant inversion of archival logic. Folklore is integrated, not bolted on. Concept is specific enough that swapping names would break the resonance; risk is quiet, not gimmicky.</comment>
