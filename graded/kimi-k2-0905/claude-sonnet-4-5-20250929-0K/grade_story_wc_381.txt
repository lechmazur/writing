<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied—fingers trembling, whispering the spaces between words—yet the summoner’s contradictory impulses (preserve silence vs. act) stay mostly summarized rather than enacted in a single, pressured beat. The final renunciation is credible and scaled to length: lifelong loneliness accepted without complaint. Still, no second character appears, so relationship/status bullets are N/A; the arc is solitude accepting further solitude, which limits depth but feels earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a luminous Conceptual Repricing: the wing’s dissolution reweights the entire valley’s reality, burying the name again under mapped silence. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each fold, whisper, and mapped pause adds density until the final cadence shift releases the hush across the land. Cost is unmistakable: “no one would thank her” and the candle already lit for the next wing. Orientation is anchored within 120 words; no lens ambiguity at end.</comment>

<comment>Starflower paper, tranquil blaze, and the brook’s whispered pauses are tactile, sensory, and filtered through the summoner’s craft. The “nocturnal haven” functions as micro-setting: proximity to water determines where she kneels and speaks silence. Environment does not merely backdrop but supplies the medium—water, moonlight, jasmine—that carries the final spell. One hairline slip: “valley” stays slightly abstract, keeping it just under 9.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—keep the valley from screaming its buried name—is signaled early and tightens through each fold and whisper. Escalation is textural: density of silence increases until the final release forecloses the prophecy’s awakening. Agency is renunciation rather than confrontation; the cost is her perpetual vigilance and anonymity. No coincidence; pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the paradox of active stillness: silence must be tirelessly cultivated. The origami wing’s transformation from flight to dream-of-flight reconfigures the cosmic into the terrestrial without moralizing. Final image—her lighting another candle—offers quiet, non-literal answer: peace is an endless, thankless craft. No thematic echo or final-paragraph thesis statement; ambiguity lingers productively.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is precise—she maps silence the way cartographers map terrain. Syntax lengthens and breathes during folding, then compresses into fragmentary whispers, mirroring tension. No dialogue, so no voice contamination. Register stays within her artisanal lexicon; no academic drift even at peak beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyric yet propulsive; each sentence layers image or action without scaffold. Metaphors (terrestrially cosmic, tranquil blaze) are repeated but patterned early and payoff at closure, avoiding mere loop. One near-loop: “like a blessing, like a lullaby, like the softest answer” triples simile, but cadence serves the spell-release beat and does not obscure causality. Otherwise, clauses are varied, concrete, and information-dense.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fusion of origami, cartographic silence, and apocalyptic lullaby feels fresh and inevitable. The premise subverts the chosen-one template: averting doom through anonymous, unthanked maintenance. Risk—entire climax is a quiet dissolution—pays off because prior texture taught the reader to feel hush as stakes. Specificity of starflower paper and meteor dust anchors the cosmic in tactile craft, preventing abstraction.</comment>
