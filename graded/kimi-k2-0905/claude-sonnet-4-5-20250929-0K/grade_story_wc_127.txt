<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—profiting from emotional forgery while quietly craving authenticity—remains vivid and embodied (the static tingle, the blotter petal tremor). Her micro-choice to reformulate the counterfeit from “fake forgiveness” to “honest wish to forgive” is credibly seeded by the amber-as-alchemy epiphany. Cost is present but under-felt: no concrete risk (lost fee, client rage, professional reputation) is staged on the page, muting the stakes of her pivot. Voice stays individual; no secondary character applies live pressure, so relationship/status bullets stay n/a.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the petal handed over carries a revised half-truth whose cost is conceptual—the client will receive gentler self-deception, yet Mara concedes her own former absolutism. Causal chain holds: amber insight → petal revision → handing it over. No orientation debt; who/where/when is anchored by line 3. The cost is abstract rather than visceral, keeping it shy of the 8.8+ gate. Lens is cleanly Situational: stance crystallizes under coherent pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The amber grotto is not backdrop but instrument: its static field literally enables Mara’s sensing method, and its fossil logic (subsuming insects until beautiful) supplies the conceptual breakthrough that rewires her craft. Dusk light is used to gradate both atmosphere and epiphany. Micro-setting (the petal as portable laboratory) recurs with reweighted meaning at closure. Spatial choreography is clean; bodies never float.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—Therese’s need for faux-forgiveness—arrives early and tightens once when Mara decides to tweak rather than fabricate. The revision narrows Mara’s own moral options, a visible price that alters tactics. Pressure is coherent but single-cycle; no further escalation or material loss occurs. Sufficient for this length, yet lacks a second notch that could foreclose a live alternative.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: authenticity vs. artifice, transformation through pressure, the ethics of necessary lies. No explicit thesis statements; the amber’s fossil process silently reprices Mara’s rule-set. Final image of “space between authenticity and artifice” resonates without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers—readers must decide if the gentler counterfeit is progress or refined self-deception.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Distinctive perceptual signature: static as “second nervous system,” scent as moral currency, syntactic compression under mild pressure (“She dealt in counterfeits.”). No dialogue, hence no voice convergence risk. Free indirect style stays clean; diction never exceeds Mara’s self-taught chemist lexicon. Rhythmic control is secure; no drumbeat monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>High information density throughout; sentences twin sensory and conceptual work (“The fragrance chemist’s blotter petal lay in her palm…”). Two minor loops—“counterfeit” thrice in 30 words; “half-truths” echoed without new angle—just avoid penalty threshold. Metaphors are coherent (amber as cupped hands of flame). Final third is clean; no artifact touches closure. Read-aloud rhythm varied.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Premise—illicit emotion-forger in amber grotto—is fresh, not a template re-skin. The synthesis of perfumery, paleontology, and moral philosophy feels particular to this narrator. Risk is moderate; the quiet, conceptual turn could feel low-stakes to some readers, but coherence justifies the gamble. No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
