<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rational, isolate forager Mira is credibly sketched through wary sensory detail and her cataloguing of mycelial data. Her shift from pure avoidance to guarded facilitation is embodied in her decision to host the orchard gatherings and hand over the relic; the cost is the erosion of her own defensive solitude, felt when she charges nothing and keeps no distance. Interiority stays concrete—no therapy-speak—and her flaws (emotional stinginess, risk-aversion) actively complicate the choice to become caretaker. The reconciliation of Henrik and daughter occurs off-page, so relationship-as-crucible pressure is secondary, capping the score just below the 9-band.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands cleanly: Mira’s stance crystallizes in the final orchard image—she accepts her role as steward of a placebo ritual that nevertheless restores conversational grace. Cost is legible in her unpriced labor and the quiet surrender of her isolation, shown in the relinquished eye and unpaid invitations. Causal chain holds: found relic → rumor of “occlusion” → belief-enabled careful speech → micro-society re-knits; each because/therefore step is motivated and tight. Orientation is handled by ~120 words; no prop teleport or lens drift; structure is single-scene with one micro-turn, satisfying short-form scope.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The storm-battered hanging orchard is far more than backdrop: rope bridges swaying in perpetual wind physically force cautious movement, constrain exits, and mirror the fragile social bridges Mira tries to rebuild. Truffle-rich root systems and lichen-speckled glass eye are tactically exploited—she pockets, displays, and finally relinquishes the relic—so setting and object actively shape tactics. Sensory detail is filtered through forager expertise (soil smell, fungal netting) without tourist excess; spatial choreography stays clean across ladder, bridge, and market stall. Environment charges the final image: the orchard entrance beacon symbolizes repaired social visibility, nudging the score into high band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—restoration of safe human contact after viral honesty—surfaces early and tightens when Mira risks her solitude to offer the orchard as ritual space. Escalation is subtle but causal: each visitor pair tests whether placebo belief can temper involuntary truth; each successful pause before speaking narrows Mira’s option to remain aloof. Protagonist agency drives the final stance—she sets the terms, refuses payment, and accepts permanent exposure to others’ needs. Cost is visible (loss of isolation, unpaid labor) though not physically endangering; pressure plateaus rather than spikes, keeping the score just shy of the 9-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Theme emerges without sermon: the story asks whether functional grace requires shared fiction rather than brute truth and answers through the orchard’s fragile success. Subtext resides in gesture—Mira’s empty sack after giving away truffles, the weather-worn glass eye still “catching light” though powerless—avoiding abstract pronouncements. The glass eye’s reconfiguration from antique trinket to social keystone reweights earlier material, satisfying the resonant reconfiguration test. No tidy moral is stated; complexity remains (ritual is “false” yet lifesaving), earning the high band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</question>
<comment>Third-person limited adheres tightly to Mira’s perceptual lens: fungal metaphors, risk calculus, wind direction color every observation. Syntax is controlled and purposeful—no filter stacks or register drift; perceptual signature (antiquarian cataloguing, weather wariness) stays consistent even under emotional softening. Dialogue is sparse but idiomatic; Henrik’s trembling whisper carries subtext of shame and supplication. Voice modulates with intensity, tightening sentences during ladder descent, breathing longer during memory reflections, showing rhythmic command.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured: “storm-churned soil,” “rope bridges that groaned with each gust” deliver dual sensory and symbolic weight without purple overload. No paraphrase loops, template cadence, or mixed metaphors; information density is high—one sentence often layers setting, character trait, and thematic hint. Line order is crisp; pronouns unambiguous even when Henrik enters; paragraph cuts are purposeful. A single nit: “rational about her foraging” edges toward label-speak, but it is embedded in action and immediately contradicted by her superstitious pocketing of the eye, so the slip is minor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</question>
<comment>The empathy-virus trope is inverted: rather than dystopian thriller, the aftermath becomes a quiet meditation on socially necessary white lies, freshening familiar sci-fi material. Grounding the cure in a placebo relic rather than pharmacology keeps concept focused on human choice, not tech solutionism. Specificity—rope-hung orchard, truffle-mapping forager, hand-blown green iris—prevents generic overlay; removing any detail would dull the texture. Risk is moderate (quiet stakes, no twist), but the synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, meriting upper-band recognition.</comment>
