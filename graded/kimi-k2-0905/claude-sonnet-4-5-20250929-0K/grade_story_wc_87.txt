<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Marina’s paralysis and cautious re-entry feel lived-in; the compass-weight in her lap and refusal to use it embody shame without label-speak. Her decision to paddle is credibly incremental—first a weather observation, then a quiet “I’ll use everything”—so the turn feels discovered, not declared. Amy’s grief mirrors hers, but Amy is sketched only enough to trigger Marina’s shift; secondary-character pressure is thin. Still, Marina’s contradictory impulses (fear of recurrence vs. need to redeem navigation) coexist in-scene, and the final “navigating… through them” crystallizes a visible cost: she forecloses permanent land-bound safety.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: grandfather’s death → miscalculation → three-year stasis → Amy’s request → incremental yes → launch. The astronomical compass re-enters as both talisman and tool, its brass patina anchoring orientation within 120 words and later re-appearing to charge closure. One meaningful tightening occurs when Marina decides “within the hour,” collapsing her avoidance into action. Closure lands as Charged Poise: open water, island ahead, stakes re-weighted; cost is felt—utility-pole certainty is gone, only fallible multi-system navigation remains.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Coastal kayak launch and Pacific swells are economically sketched; brass compass, worn smooth and warm against chest, functions as micro-setting that constrains the yes/no choice. Utility-pole metronome provides an idiosyncratic anchor that is later relinquished, charging final image. Dawn light and silver-bright water mirror emotional shift without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography clean—bodies, kayaks, shore distance track across beats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can Marina re-assume responsibility without repeating fatal error? Pressure escalates causally: Amy’s need collides with Marina’s public shame, forcing a now-or-never launch window. No coincidence; the weather turn is external but her decision to go is earned. Cost is paid on-page: she abandons the pole-counting safety crutch and accepts psychic risk of another life in her hands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme—redemption through re-engagement with imperfect systems—emerges via compass, poles, stars: no single guide suffices, only layered vigilance. Subtext surfaces in gesture: Amy studies the compass “like a staff,” wordlessly asking Marina to trade grief for trust. Final image of “open water now” offers quiet, non-moralizing answer: progress demands relinquishing absolute certainty. No overt thesis statements; one near-echo (“broken navigators gravitate…”) is embedded early enough to feel like voice, not sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays glued to Marina’s perceptual filter; no head-hop. Distinctive synesthetic moment: compass “heavy… like an accusation,” utility poles in “metronomic rhythm” betray an ex-navigator’s sensory bias. Syntax grows slightly breathless during launch—“They launched into gentle swells, paddles catching rhythm”—mirroring nerves. Dialogue minimal but natural; Amy’s lines pursue goal, carry disclosure-subtext. No filter-verb clutter; free indirect clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm, varied sentence openings, no template cadence. Information-dense: one sentence can set scene, reveal backstory, and foreshadow (“She hadn’t known then how prophetic that melancholy was”). Metaphors stay coherent (no mixed vehicles). Minor scaffold: “three years since…” anaphora thrice; because it frames grief, reads as pattern not clutter. No loops or paraphrase in final third; closure beat sharp.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Familiar redemption-on-water arc is refreshed by idiosyncratic navigation method—counting utility poles—and the notion that layering imperfect systems is the only honest course. Compass-as-conscience and pole-counting as land-bound crutch feel specific to this ex-navigator; swapping either would change story mechanics. Risk taken in quiet, lyric closure rather than catastrophe; payoff coherent. Could use fresher stroke in Amy’s sister backstory, which dips toward stock drowning-motif.</comment>
