<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Kael’s quiet competence and yearning for recognition surface through micro-choices—wiping condensation, the precise lever pull—and the final smile carries a believable, scaled cost: they’ve claimed authorship of reality-bending truth yet remain the same “obliging” tech. Interiority avoids label-speak; the contradiction between humble role and cosmic insight is embodied, not declared. The single relationship with Venn is less crucible than sounding board, so the full 9+ gate isn’t quite met, but the arc of endurance-to-vindication feels individual and earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the final image of Kael calibrating while knowing “time moves sideways” reconfigures their identity and the station’s mission with felt conceptual cost. Causal linkage holds—each magnetic nexus adjustment is a because/therefore step toward the lateral-time reveal; no convenient resets. The persistent constraint (mechanic’s subordinate role) shapes tactics and is visible in the last line, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Twilight-shadowed gas giant, silicon-moth wings, and the mechanically warm nexus are rendered through Kael’s technician eye; every sensory pick anchors in their task. The nexus surface’s “contained energy” and the icy pockets of air constrain stance and movement, charging the final calibration image. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 5. Micro-setting (nexus housing) directly enables the closure beat, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—proving temporal anomaly—tightens once: the hologram’s lateral cascade forecloses skepticism and visible cost is paid when Kael’s undocumented months of tracking are finally vindicated in front of Venn. Escalation is knowledge-based under Causal lens; no reversals needed. Cost is legible in the final smile that accepts continued obscurity despite discovery. Sufficient for band but lacks a persistent tactical constraint beyond social role.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the ephemerality of certainty: what reads as humble maintenance secretly rewrites physics. The moths’ “subdued awakenings” reprice human assumptions without a sermon. Final image of eternal hush reframes earlier twilight as perpetual ambiguity—resonant, non-literal, complex. No thematic echo penalties; insight stays anchored to Kael’s embodied experience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person intimate maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature is restrained, technician-precise—magnetic nexus “pulsing with contained energy”—and modulates into quiet awe without register drift. No dialogue to test, yet interior syntax stays clean and idiom appropriate. Filter verbs are sparse and motive-driven. Voice coherence holds through the lyric final sentence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with scene beats—long sentences for twilight calm, clipped fragments at reveal. Figurative language is sparse and coherent: “time as crystalline facets” is taught early and paid off. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Information density high; each sentence advances calibration, perception, or stakes. Minor −0.1 for two adjacent “they” openers in final paragraph, not touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lateral time via silicon-moth bioelectric interference is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis; premise commits fully without late rule changes. Technician-as-unseen-author is a risky inversion of discovery narrative that heightens stakes. Specificity of magnetic nexus calibration and twilight alignment makes the concept inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking elevates meaning without obscuring clarity; qualifies for +0.2 within-band bonus.</comment>
