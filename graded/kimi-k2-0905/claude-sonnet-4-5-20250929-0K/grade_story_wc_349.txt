<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Vera’s calm expertise is vivid, but the parolee’s interiority is delivered through labels (“hesitant gait,” “weathered features”) rather than embodied contradiction; his moment of recognition depends on a quasi-magical external cue rather than on-page micro-choice, so the cost feels symbolic rather than personally earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the transfer of bottle-darkness reconfigures the premise that erasure is a purchasable commodity, and the library’s rebalancing signals cost under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is clear within 120 words, transitions are smooth, and causal logic holds—only the parolee’s off-stage drink defers the decisive beat, keeping the score just below the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Glass orchard, floating cloud-sea, and refracted parole-band light are selective, POV-filtered, and directly charge the final image of “rebalancing.” Spatial choreography is clean; the library itself acts as a tool that permits the incise ritual, satisfying the 9+ constraint requirement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can a past be un-written?—is signaled early; pressure tightens when Vera refuses payment and instead demands the parolee ingest absence, foreclosing the option of simple transaction. Cost is legible in the man’s trembling and the library’s physical shift, but escalation is single-note; no further trade-off complicates the ritual.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: erasure is not deletion but re-orchestration of fragments. The final image of clouds “arranging themselves into something that might, finally, cohere” reweights prior scattered motifs without moralizing, delivering a quiet CR that invites counter-readings about penal reform and narrative agency.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Vera’s perceptual signature—“quantified the absence,” “you-shaped hole”—with rhythmic, glass-bright diction that modulates under pressure. No dialogue, so no voice convergence; prose itself functions as character, sustaining lyric control without head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally; information density is high (“bottled moonlight in various gradations...memory of where light had been”). One scaffold loop—“fragments...into new configurations” closely echoes “fragments into meaning”—but it does not touch closure; no mixed metaphors or filter-verb bloat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The clean-slate library, parole band, and quantified-absence method synthesize into a fresh conceptual lattice; the inversion of moonlight as bottled darkness reweights a familiar trope. Risky lyric compression is taught early and pays off in the rebalancing image, making the piece feel inevitable yet non-derivative.</comment>
