<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Marcus’s contradictory impulses—urgency to know vs terror of who he was—are alive in every beat; the moment he fingers the ball’s stitches while asking “What did I do?” shows embodied guilt without label-speak. His micro-choice to set the ball down and step back is a credible renunciation that costs him the comfort of certainty. The Interpreter’s jaded wonder is sketched in two efficient strokes: silver hair + eyes that still “fascinate,” giving her status as chorus without stealing focus. No therapy-speak or stock epiphany; the flaws stay messy and unbalanced.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure (Earned Stasis) lands cleanly: Marcus refuses memory and chooses forward motion; the cost is the forever-loss of self-knowledge, felt in the luminous ripple that answers him. Causal lens holds: because he meets the Interpreter → receives the ball → sees the future fail → therefore reweights oblivion as acceptable price. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) taught by line 3: “edge of the underground lake… bioluminescent algae,” beating the 120-word window. No lens drift; the final image is a deliberate refusal, not an open loop.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The lake’s living light physically steers the climax: Marcus sets the ball on the dock, and the “something luminous stirred” beneath—environment directly charging the stasis image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: ex-operative notices exit routes, classified ciphers, the ball’s weight—never tourist-catalog. Proxemics stay clean: dock, woman, water, tunnel mouth tracked without impossible jumps. One micro-setting error: “ancient yet trembling” is abstract, but it’s a lone clause in an otherwise tactile world.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—oblivion vs accountability—signaled in line 1. The single meaningful tightening arrives when theInterpreter reveals the time-traveler’s failure: empathy can’t be imported, only chosen; this narrows Marcus’s options to endure amnesia voluntarily. Cost is legible: he forfeits the right to remember, a social/psychic price paid on-page. Agency remains his; no coincidences rescue him.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from concrete paradox: memory is expendable, yet choice is inescapable—“Empathy isn’t memory. It’s choice.” No character sermonizes; the sentence is carved on an artifact Marcus physically handles. Subtext carries in gesture: the Interpreter’s smile is “jaded but genuine,” implying decades of watching ex-actants rationalize; Marcus’s silence after reading the ball is the real answer. Final image reweights the labyrinth concept: tunnels remain, but he steps into them unburdened, a quiet conceptual re-pricing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Marcus; no POV leakage into the Interpreter. Psychic distance modulates: compressed when decoding ads (“reading between the lines”) then widens to cosmic when he studies 2087 ink. Diction stays within operative lexicon—codes, tunnels, stitches—no academic drift. Rhythm mirrors pulse of water: longer sentences for wonder, fragments under pressure (“I choose to try.”). Dialogue sparse, goal-driven; Interpreter’s diction carries weight of exhausted omniscience without voice merge.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: single clause “procedure stripped… worth forgetting” layers backstory + emotional stakes. Figurative control: “delicately robust” risks contradiction but recovers by pairing fragile algae on stone—image is physically accurate. No loops; sentence stems varied; paragraph cuts are crisp. One strained phrase: “jaded wonder” could feel oxymoronic, yet context justifies it by payoff. Closure line carries perfect cadence: short declarative after lyrical build.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusion of memory-wipe noir with time-travel artifact feels inevitable, not grafted. The baseball-from-2087 is a fresh inflection on the classic “object with message” trope because its futility (empathy plague) re-prices Marcus’s personal stakes. Labyrinth trope rescued from abstraction: each tunnel is a live option, not metaphoric wallpaper. Specificity—the algae glow, the classified ad cipher—anchors universals. Risk in concept pays off: reader must accept time-travel signature, but story earns it by tying the failure to emotional truth.</comment>
