<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Maren’s archivist identity is embodied through the stained hands and magnifying-glass beat, but the climax choice—accepting the returnees—relies on a sudden collective epiphany rather than a prior micro-choice that costs her anything. Interiority is vivid (“strange arrhythmic dance”) yet the decisive beat is communal, diffusing personal agency. Still, her perceptual signature remains consistent and the endurance of seven solitary years is credibly felt. Flaws complicate rather than disappear; the cost is the solitude she can now relinquish.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise: Maren’s stained hands taken by Mrs. Corvin crystallize the covenant’s reversal with undeniable conceptual cost—“you made our leaving matter.” Accumulative lens holds: the lockets, scent, and ink accumulate until the final image reweights their meaning. Causality is retroactively coherent rather than一步步驱动, but the pattern is taught early (“she would archive this too”) and paid off. One soft spot: the mass return is off-stage triggered; luck complicates but does not resolve, acceptable under Accumulative rule.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The jetty-as-finger, walnut-ink chemistry, and jasmine scent are concretely filtered through Maren’s archivist gaze; the locket functions as micro-setting that constrains her attention. Spatial choreography is clean: she stands at the end, figures approach from the road, hands are taken. Weather is twilight, but its emotional shading (purple, darkening) is integrated into the euphoric/haunted tone rather than decorative. The town’s hollowing is shown through emptied shops and silence—dense, not catalogued.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving the weight of small moments—tightens when the returned dozen validate that preservation as the price of return. One meaningful deepening: the covenant flips from failed magic to successful witnessing, forcing Maren to recognize her solitude as the steeping cost. Agency is archival attention rather than physical act; the tightening is epistemic, not tactical, fitting Accumulative lens. Cost is legible: her stained hands become the bridge, foreclosing lifelong anonymity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges without sermon: memory work is a reciprocal steeping—archivist and town steep together until return becomes possible. The locket’s reprise and the ink-stained hands reweight “small moments” from futile to salvific. Haunted euphoria is felt, not labeled, in Mrs. Corvin’s smile. Final image refuses moral symmetry: return is gift, not redemption, leaving ambiguity about whether the town will thrive.</comment>

<comment>Third-person close stays tightly lashed to Maren’s perceptual filter: “walnut-ink archivist,” “specific sepia,” “haunted-euphoric smile” are her idiom, not authorial flourish. Rhythm modulates: longer reflective sentences yield to short beats as figures appear. Dialogue is minimal but carries subtext—“We know” speaks volumes. No head-hopping; collective “we” in quoted line is spoken, not narrative.</comment>

<comment>Prose is almost loop-free; one paraphrase overlap (“she would archive this too” echoes “she had spent seven years documenting”) but the repetition is purposeful callback, not scaffold. Sensory nouns are specific—jasmine, vinegar, sepia—not adjectival fluff. Metaphors stay coherent: jetty as finger, steeping as recognition. One clause drifts toward abstraction—“context would change everything”—but is anchored by the concrete locket beat immediately after.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: archival chemistry + floral covenant + reverse exodus feels inevitable in hindsight yet not templated. The walnut-ink trope is transformed from quaint craft to salvation technology. Risk—the quiet, accumulative structure—pays off in a Charged Poise rather than spectacle. Minor proximity echo to “jasmine-return” motif in other literary works, but detail-level specificity (vinegar, hull-crushing) personalizes it.</comment>
