<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Vera’s skeptical-scientist persona is cleanly dramatized through tactile micro-choices—knelt soil-sifting, Geiger-click counting, calm reburial—so her “conspiracy-debunker” identity is more than label. Inner contradiction surfaces once: the pulse-quickening at “Project Stillpoint” hints she wants the myth true even while disdaining it, but this tension is stated more than embodied. The final renunciation (truth published, diamond hidden) carries visible cost and is causally prepared; still, the emotional price feels efficiently rather than richly earned at this length.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the stillpoint science rewrites orchard “miracle” into accident, and Vera’s choice to obscure exact coordinates imposes social/ethical cost on herself, all legible on-page. Causal chain holds—shredded paper → coordinates → dig → decision—without logistical cheat. Drive lens is clearly causal; pattern is taught early and never breaks. Only hairline slip: the off-stage “someone” who first dug and shredded is never settled, a micro-motivation gap that nicks perfection.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The orchard-as-micro-setting directly shapes every beat: Geiger chatter, poisoned snow, roots breaching leaded earth. The diamond’s shoe-box coffin becomes the final tactile image, charging closure. Sensory triage favors touch and sound over visual catalog, matching a investigator’s priorities. One minor gap: no bodily radiation symptom (nose-bleed, metallic taste) to threaten or guide Vera’s timeline, a missed pressure lever.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—truth vs. miracle—surfaces in para 1 and tightens once: the dig choice forecloses her public reputation if she hides evidence. Cost is visible (risk of irradiation, ethical compromise) but not escalated by a ticking counter or antagonist push-back; pressure plateaus rather than spikes. Agency remains hers throughout; coincidence is absent. Sufficient for length, yet that single, level escalation keeps it shy of the 8.8 tier.</answer>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: knowledge as double-edged comfort—people need lies to live, experts need truth to matter, and sometimes both needs collide. The final image (clean circle hidden in toxic ground) re-weights earlier orchard reverence without moralizing. Subtextual irony stings: Vera defeats mysticism only to seed a new, gentler myth herself. Complexity stays intact; no tidy moral is pronounced, although the “uncomfortable truth” line edges toward thesis-statement and is the only soft echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Vera’s perceptual filters—numbers, tools, soil granularity—creating a crisp, unsentimental diction. Syntax tightens under pressure (“She began to dig.”) and relaxes into reflection (“Beautiful nonsense…”). No dialogue appears; therefore voice-distinction test is waived. The one register wobble—“conceptual repricing”-style phrasing in the penultimate paragraph—leans academic outside her prior lexicon, a minute artifact.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, information-dense: every paragraph advances either evidence or atmosphere. Metaphors are spare (“poisoned snow”) and mixed only once (“kernel of truth buried in baroque fabrications”) without logical clash. No loops, synonym churn or filler beats. Opening line anchors voice and premise; final line crystallizes choice. Copy is clean; minor opportunity: replace the cliché “pulse quickened” with a visceral alternative to hit full 9-band terrain.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Stillpoint-as-failed-shield is a fresh twist on both post-apocalyptic orchard and cursed-diamond tropes, welding hard-SF concept to folk myth. Vera’s ethical inversion—expose the lie, protect the accident—offers a non-obvious moral calculus specific to her vocation. Some tropes remain familiar (lone investigator, wasteland miracle) and are not fully inverted, preventing the leap into 8.8+ territory, but the synthesis feels particular and memorable within the form’s scale.</comment>
