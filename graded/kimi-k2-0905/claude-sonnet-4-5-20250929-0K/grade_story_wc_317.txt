<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Margot’s interior contradiction—puzzle-obsessed yet able to walk away—drives the beat; the moment she photographs the seed, then chooses to float it away, her renunciation carries visible cost as she forfeits both the answer and the community she will now warn. Her “notably receptive” trait is shown, not told, by the instant pattern recognition that dooms others; this same trait flips to become the agency that breaks the trap. The earned refusal satisfies the closure under a causal lens, though micro-choices stay light for 740 words.</comment>

<comment>Causal chain holds: seed arrives ⇒ recognition ⇒ sabotage deduced ⇒ refusal. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) are locked by line 4. Closure lands with Decisive Change and felt cost—she forfeits certainty and embraces outreach—under a clean Causal lens. One hairline slip: “the mystery seed mail phenomenon had plagued…” is a touch of explanatory backstory before we see the envelope in her hand; it slightly softens the immediate present-moment pressure.</comment>

<comment>The moonlit brook and cottage deck function as micro-setting: isolation enables undistracted puzzle-design yet offers the flowing water that literally carries the trap away. Sensory economy is strong—weathered deck, thick air, storm-born silence—filtered through Margot’s designer perceptions. Spatial choreography is clean; seed-hand-to-water motion tracks without drift. The setting constrains choice (no neighbors, no witnesses, only the brook as disposal) and returns charged in the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve creative space versus solve tempting puzzle—tightens at seed-ID beat; escalation is one-step but sufficient for length. Visible price: surrender of “the hush of a possibility just born” (future puzzles) to warn others. Coincidence only complicates (anonymous mail) and does not resolve. Cost clarity is high; tactics pivot from solitary curiosity to communal protection.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: ingenuity turned outward to protect collective imagination rather than consume itself on a solitary bloom. Subtext carries in gesture—photographing the seed (evidence) versus casting it away (refusal). Final image of moonlit water reweights the premise: mystery is not treasure but contamination. No tidy moral, only a stance crystallized with cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Margot’s perceptual filter—botanical database, pattern hunger, brook’s murmur. Prose texture varies: longer lyrical cadence at opening, compressed diction at climax—“She dropped the seed.” No dialogue, so voice modulation shows through syntax shift under pressure. Distinct idiom in “orthogonal approaches” and “nocturnal haven” fits puzzle-designer intellect without drifting into jargon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Rhythm alternates between meditative rolling sentences and crisp decisive fragments. No filter-verb stacks, no mixed metaphors. High density: one line often delivers sensory, intellectual, and causal jobs (“She photographed the seed under her desk lamp, then searched her botanical database”). Opening and closing lines are image-anchored and ear-tested. Minor paraphrase echo—“storm-born silence” appears twice; does not obscure closure but prevents 9+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Freshest synthesis: botanical sabotage weaponized against puzzle designers—coercion via curiosity rather than violence. The corpse-flower-as-creative-vampire is non-obvious and thematically coherent. Risk of quiet refusal instead of investigative climax pays off; the renunciation feels inevitable yet surprising. Specificity of escape-room subculture grounds the premise; transformation test passes—story collapses if Margot is a generic small-business owner.</comment>
