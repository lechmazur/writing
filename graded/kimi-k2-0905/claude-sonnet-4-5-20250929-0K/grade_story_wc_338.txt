<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Maren’s interiority is specific—her cartographer’s eye, her refusal to fear the whispers—and the micro-choice to leave the vault doors open crystallizes her arc. Yet the “methodically curious” trait is stated more than dramatized; we see only one brief measuring gesture. The rotated-stone discovery feels observed, not wrested, so the cost is intellectual rather than viscerally embodied. Still, her stance shift is coherent and scaled to the length.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the vault’s question-mark cracks re-weight silence from threat to invitation, and Maren’s decision to walk onto the moor carries undeniable conceptual cost. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern builds across dual footage, rain, fresco—until the final image tears the map open. Causality is clean: rotated stone → points to gap → vault asks → Maren answers. Only nit: the “methodically curious” tag is told, not proved in scene, a micro-gate squeak but not a break.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The rain-scoured vault, body-as-tool (headlamp beam), and the fresco itself constrain every move; the environment literally dictates where Maren can stand, see, and interpret. Sensory economy is tight—soundless rain, ochre/ash palette, cracked stone question-mark—each detail filtered through her map-trained bias. Spatial choreography is flawless; we track her circling the wall, finger-tracing cracks, packing gear. The setting’s final reconfiguration—doors left open against decades of sealed dread—charges the closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can the vault’s silence be read rather than feared—tightens once the stone’s rotation is measured; options narrow from preservation to answering. Escalation is textural: dual footage, cracked question-mark, open door—each layer reweights the same stake rather than introducing new threats. The cost is conceptual but legible: she abandons the safety of archival detachment and steps into the literal gap. Agency is present yet quiet—her final act is to walk through the torn map, foreclosing sealed-dread forever.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: silence as living cartography that updates itself, demanding empathy-driven interpretation. The rotated stone and question-mark cracks are concrete particulars that reweight “whispers” from curse to collaborative inquiry. No moral is stated; the final image of Maren leaving the doors open answers the thematic question by stance alone. Subtext in the branching crack-shape and the torn moorland gap invites lingering ambiguity about what any map leaves out.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is crisp—cartographer’s fractal eye, moisture-counting patience, synesthetic rain-as-prayer. Syntax lengthens in calm cataloguing, then tightens into fragment clusters (“There.”) under discovery. No head-hopping; psychic distance stays snug inside Maren’s beam of attention. The lyric compression (“Silence wasn’t absence; it was a language…”) is earned by prior concrete decoding work.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Zero loops, high density: each sentence advances map, weather, or interiority. Metaphors are spare and coherent—vault as chapel, silence as language, crack as question-mark—no mixed vehicles. Rhythm breathes: long clause for rain-drumming, single-word beat for discovery. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and re-ignite motif without flourish.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Fresno-self-updating map is a fresh supernatural premise, yet grounded in archival science and geologic time. The parallel-footage device feels inevitable, not gimmick, because Maren’s profession justifies the method. Risk is quiet—no monster, only repositioned pigment—but stakes feel large because the shift rewrites epistemology itself. Specificity of ochre/ash palette and 15-degree rotation keeps the concept from drifting into abstraction.</comment>
