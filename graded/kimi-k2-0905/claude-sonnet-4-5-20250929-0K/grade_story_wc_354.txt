<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kavir’s exile-rooted need to listen rather than lecture is dramatized through the stone’s relinquishing and the earth-palm beat, showing interior contradiction. His renunciation of vengeance and acceptance of incomplete beauty carries visible cost. The Hierophant’s daughter is sketched only in micro-gesture, but the single on-page relationship still crystallizes a power shift. Micro-choice hierarchy is legible; the only cap is the 8.8 gate because contradictory impulses are summarized rather than enacted in live scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the covenant is reframed as “incomplete,” not invalid, a decisive cognitive shift that reweights the political-spiritual rule-set with undeniable social cost. Causal linkage holds: because Kavir translates silence, the daughter can inherit a path that renounces renewal. Cost is felt in the final image—“rolling his stone through the last moments of twilight” marks endurance of ongoing exile. Persistent constraint: his exile remains, the stone’s dent still there, shaping the final solitude.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Magnetic nexus and twilight are not postcard backdrops; their hum vibrates through bone and constrains the listening tactic that solves the plot. The basalt stone acts as micro-setting whose dent mirrors the covenant’s hidden flaw and is handled in multiple beats. Sensory selection stays inside Kavir’s bias—iron-rich cliffs violet under eclipsing light filtered through exile memory. One minor spatial lapse: the ridge “above” is never re-oriented after the daughter descends, but it never breaks choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preventing another generation’s binding—tightens when Kavir realizes consent itself is void if silence is unread. Agency drives the escalation: he actively relinquishes strategy, presses flesh to earth, and chooses testimony through the heir. Visible price: eternal outsider status confirmed in final solitude. No cap triggered; escalation is coherent under Causal lens and cost is legible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the reframing of consent: legality without voiced suffering is tyranny. No thematic echo statement; the realization stays inside the sensory moment. Final image reweights the stone and the hum as instruments of non-violent subversion. Ambiguity remains—covenant may still renew—but the moral calculus is irreversibly altered.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains psychic distance; diction—“thoughtfully precise,” “difficult beauty”—stays within Kavir’s academic register. Rhythm modulates: longer cadences for magnetic listening, clipped fragments for dawn deadline. No dialogue to distort voice; daughter’s single line carries subtext. Slight convergence in final exchange, but internal texture holds.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies without template cadence; sentence openings diversify. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful—“twilight bled,” “emotional architecture”—no mixed-metaphor muddle. One paraphrase loop: “because it was built on unspoken suffering… on the beauty people discovered in sacrificing themselves” could compress, but it does not touch closure. High density: each sentence layers setting, interior, and concept.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fantasy-court intrigue is reframed through silence-as-evidence, a fresh jurisprudence twist. Chess logic repurposed to listening strategy feels inevitable, not grafted. Risky choice to resolve conflict via epistemic reframing rather than physical coup pays off. Specificity of magnetic nexus as lie-detector is memorable and internally coherent.</comment>
