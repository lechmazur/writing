<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Kasimir’s interior contradiction—ex-revolutionary turned solitary archivist—drives every beat; his body registers time-light as “weight of obsolescence” and his fingers hover, never touching, enacting fragile restraint. The choice to reinterpret the shard rather than seize it crystallizes his shift from smash-and-rebuild to memorial poetics, foreclosing a return to activism with visible cost: his name remains “an embarrassment.” No second character on stage, so status/relationship bullets skipped; single-POV interiority stays specific, avoids diagnostic labels. Micro-choice of pen-on-paper versus mortar-into-wall anchors the hierarchy of values—grief over glory—earning the renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: baroque corridors, golden time-threads, and shard-refractions layer density until “brokenness itself architectural” reweights the stake. Closure is Charged Poise—journal clutched, corridors “gleamed with burnished sorrow and stubborn hope”—felt cost is the perpetual visibility of time passing, making revolution obsolete. Orientation anchored by 120 words; no causality breaks. Persistent constraint: visible time-light keeps past failures literally glowing before him, shaping every later tactic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Environment (asteroid corridors) and object (crystal shard) directly constrain interpretation choices; shard’s facets “refract time-light into prismatic ghosts,” charging the final image. Baroque spirals act as micro-setting that guides Kasimir’s eye and argument, their “frozen water finding its level” mirroring his emotional surrender. Sensory economy: amber light, gilt edges, visible time-threads—select, purposeful, filtered through ex-revolutionary aesthete perception. Spatial choreography clean; no headcount confusion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: prove the shard is memorial, not mercantile—signaled early via contempt for Vhen’s ledger logic. Tightening occurs when excavation data (shard was already broken) forces Kasimir to abandon vandalism-of-memory thesis and embrace grief-architecture; cost is abandonment of last hope for revolutionary vindication. No antagonist on page, but scholarly dispute supplies coherent pressure. Escalation is textural: each refracted ghost and baroque curve deepens the emotional price of being wrong; final image reconfigures options—he now carries “new kind of revolution” of patience, not overthrow.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme—civilization built from brokenness—emerges via concrete architectural choice to mortar shattered vase into wall, not via assertion. Subtext in gesture: covering mirrors superstition rewritten as “they made mirrors from their storms” implies art as catastrophe-handling, not catastrophe-avoidance. No final-paragraph moralizing; last line offers resonant, non-literal answer: “baroque spirals finally making sense” reweights prior excess as grief-poetry. Complexity preserved—revolutionary failure neither redeemed nor damned, just reframed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Kasimir’s perceptual signature: time-light as “golden pollen,” baroque curves as “poetry rendered in stone.” Diction—“emotional archaeology,” “burnished sorrow”—remains within lexicon of a poet-revolutionary. No head-hopping; psychic distance contracts under pressure to staccato sentence fragments (“Failed. Failed so completely…”). Rhythm mirrors mental state: languid spirals of description accelerate into urgent note-taking, then quiet cadence of acceptance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences fuse sensory, emotional, conceptual work—“asteroid's baroque corridors twisted like frozen music, their gilt edges catching the amber light that now marked time's passage.” No paraphrase loops; metaphors stay consistent (frozen music / frozen water). Filter verbs minimal; strong verbs (“gleamed,” “clutched,” “traced”). One mixed-metaphor risk—“cathedrals from shards” reads cleanly because baroque architecture already established. Closure beat free of overwriting; final line earns rhythmic emphasis through monosyllables and hard consonants.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Premise—visible time-threads post-Unveiling—freshly reframes antique archaeological debate into existential pressure. Baroque asteroid as memorial-generator is non-obvious synthesis of excess + grief. Transformation test: swap setting to generic space station and the “shattered vase = civilization” thesis collapses; specificity is load-bearing. Risk of ornate diction paid off by thematic need for excess; no retreat into minimalist safety.</comment>
