<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mira’s survivor guilt and need to inscribe the “small gestures” into permanence drive every beat; her refusal to sentimentalize yet insist on tenderness is credibly paradoxical. The embodied detail—“her scripted screams becoming genuine”—anchors the crisis-actor irony inside her body. Interiority stays concrete: she “walks letters only she could read from above,” a perceptual signature that fuses observer and scribe. No stock labels; even the final alliance with the archivist feels like a micro-choice that costs her sole authorship. </comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the jointly walked testimony reweights what counts as “history.” The lens is Accumulative/Textural—each footstep is a density increment that finally reconfigures the archive’s meaning. Cost is unmistakable: Mira trades solitary witness for shared record, foreclosing her private language. Pattern taught early (footsteps as text) and paid off in the final image of two bodies tracing words beneath a dome that once listened to power. </comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The whispering gallery’s acoustic curve and dusty skylight actively filter attention; the missing-pawn board becomes a micro-setting that constrains their closing conversation. Spatial choreography is clean—the archivist “looks up at the dome” where Mira’s invisible words hover. Light through dust is not ornament but “luminous absence,” a phrase that reweights the city’s glow as potential rather than loss. Setting never stalls; every detail is walked, touched, or seen through Mira’s exact bias. </comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will the unofficial witness survive erasure—tightens when her private alphabet is offered to the archive, narrowing her options from solitary seer to collaborative historian. One meaningful deepening: the chessboard’s missing pawns crystallizes the story’s scale—no small players left to sacrifice. No external antagonist needed; pressure is the city’s memory vacuum. Cost is conceptual but felt: her singular testimony is diluted into shared record. </comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: history belongs to the gestures that power never records. The chessboard, the walked words, and the archivist’s transcription all reprise the same question—what counts when the state collapses. Final image answers obliquely: two sets of feet writing together under a dome built for secrets. No moralizing; resonance is visceral—readers feel the cost of shared memory replacing private witness. </comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Mira’s perceptual filter—“stone ear,” “luminous absence”—diction precise yet unshowy. Rhythm mirrors her pacing: long sentences for circling the gallery, abrupt fragments when the riots intrude. No dialogue until the archivist arrives, and his first line—“You’re walking words”—sounds spoken, not written. Voice never lectures; even abstract notions like “nomadic penumbra” arrive via sensory metonymy. </comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances image or stakes—“she spelled out the gestures she had witnessed” packs witness, method, and motive into one clause. No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay internally coherent (light as absence, dust as hope). Filter verbs avoided; perception is direct—“the board’s black and white squares caught whatever light filtered through.” Final line re-illuminates the missing pawn motif without metaphorical stretch. </comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The crisis-actor-turned-actual-survivor angle is fresh; the walked alphabet in a whispering gallery is a specific, non-portable device. Conceptual leap: small gestures as historiography reverses archive logic without preaching. Risky choice to leave pawns literally absent pays off visually and thematically. Synthesis feels inevitable—every element would break if transplanted to another plot. </comment>
