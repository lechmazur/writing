<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is lyrically specific—her felt need to “encrypt vulnerability as strength” is dramatized through the dice-throw key choice and the underwater choreography. The contradiction between grief and tactical ruthlessness is alive in scene, not stated. Cost is visible: the same algae glow that preserves the lab also forces her to leave it nightly, sealing her exile. Voice stays hers; no diagnostic self-labeling.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tight causal spine: because the lab was flooded → grandfather’s gear survived → Elara can decode → she can code the dance → tomorrow seventeen walk free. Orientation anchored by sentence 3; no drift. Closure is Conceptual Repricing: the poem-garden that is also a jailbreak map reweights all prior “memoir” entries into weapons; cost is the perpetual endangerment of her own grief text. Lens (Causal) holds without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The sunken laboratory is not backdrop; its pressure locks every move—buoyancy decides speed, algae dictates visibility, tidal generators power the code rig. Velvet pouch and dice serve as micro-setting that literally sets the encryption key. Final image of words “swimming like light through deep ocean” re-weights the entire fluid space as a distribution network. Environment constrains and enables; meets 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—free tomorrow’s seventeen—signalled early; each decoded patrol tightens the noose around possibility. One visible cost: she must surface before shift-change, leaving the only safe place, proving the tactic is not consequence-free. Escalation is causal under lens: every decrypted page forces her to invent a riskier medium (first journal, then dance) to stay ahead of interception. No abstract stakes; all on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: the transformation of intimate grief-text into collective weaponry. No moralizing; the final image of “keys that opened every cage” is concrete, not thesis. Subtext of dance-as-code keeps meaning in gesture rather than declaration. Ambiguity lingers: will the regime learn to read dance? Complexity honored.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric close-up sustains perceptual signature: “mathematical music her grandfather had taught her to hear.” Syntax mirrors underwater suspension—long breath-like clauses, sudden regulator-sharp fragments. No head-hop; knowledge strictly Elara-bound. Compression (“tomorrow, seventeen prisoners would walk free”) is taught pattern, paid off. Voice modulates with pressure; no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; no template cadence runs. Information density high—one sentence often decodes setting, stakes, and tech rule simultaneously. Metaphors organic to sub-oceanic physics (“like amber freezing time”) and avoid collision. Only minor loop: “coded journal entries that looked like personal reflection” echoed twice; does not touch closure. No scaffolding; prop states tracked cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: submarine cryptographer who choreographs jailbreaks. Hangman’s dice converted to phonetic key generator is specific, non-obvious, inevitable in hindsight. Risk of dance-instruction accepted and paid off by taught pattern. Concept commits fully—no retreat to safer tech. Emotional specificity anchors novelty; avoids gimmickry. Feels singular, not stitched.</comment>
