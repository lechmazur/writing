<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Marcus’s desperation is viscerally embodied (“eyes had deepened,” “swallowed wasps”); the Oracle’s fierce-gentle stance is shown through micro-choices like offering her hand while warning. The interior contradiction—she broke her own rule to help—remains credible and charges the ending. The only dent: the leap from “I’ll pay anything” to full destiny-swap is asserted, not dramatized, so the motivational ramp feels slightly compressed.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands with unmistakable cost: the burned card left on the martyr’s palm crystallizes the irreversible taint of swapped souls. Causal chain holds: failed reversal → acceptance → joint walk-away. Accumulating pattern of barter, botched return, and residue burns the rule-set into the reader. One micro-turn—Rebecca wanting her melancholy back—tightens stakes exactly where needed.</comment>

<comment>Catacomb orchard never drifts into postcard; every root-around-bone detail is filtered through Marcus’s manic inlaying and the Oracle’s barefoot vigil. The burned card functions as micro-setting that constrains the final choice: its remaining heat and ruined image force acceptance. Spatial choreography stays clean; one contiguous walk-through maintains orientation. Environment, tool, and body interlock to charge the closing image.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—can you return a soul you rented?—is signaled early and tightens when the reversal flops. Agency sits with the Oracle: she initiates the confession, hands over the card, models acceptance. Joy-as-wasps is a visceral price that alters tactics (no second swap). Escalation is single but sufficient; no artificial reversals, just the dawning that residue is permanent.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges from the ruined Lovers card: love of self includes love of wound. Subtext lives in gesture—roots tightening “lovingly” around bones mirrors Marcus clinging to borrowed happiness. No explicit thesis; the final image of the card on stone reconfigures meaning without moralizing. Complexity lingers: happiness can kill when worn by wrong skeleton.</comment>

<comment>Voice is lush yet controlled; consonant clusters (“catacomb orchard,” “ribcages of saints”) create a moth-wing flutter without purple drift. Perceptual signature is Oracle-bound: heat on thigh, glow grading into corridor, fierce-gentle modulation under pressure. No head-hop; Marcus observed from outside keeps distance clean. Syntax shortens at peak—“Will it hurt? Yes.”—showing rhythmic command.</comment>

<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; paragraph lengths breathe. Mixed metaphors avoided: roots/bones/card form one coherent skeletal through-line. No looped stems or synonym churn. Filter verbs minimal; most perception is direct (“edges still warm”). One scaffold risk—“he’d been coming… who believed… who thought…” triple tag—but compression serves backstory economy without breaking propulsion.</comment>

<comment>Soul-swap as depression treatment feels fresh angle on familiar “be careful what you wish for.” Oracle lineage and orchard-of-bones are particular to this storyworld; not extractable. Burned tarot as residue-object is organic, not gimmick. Risk is present—lyric density could obscure—but coherence holds. Transformation test passed; swap the names and the emotional engine collapses.</comment>
