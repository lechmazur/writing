<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is concrete—she “reads dust patterns” and chooses speech over silence with visible cost. The flaw-consequence chain is present: her refusal to repeat the elders’ silence dissolves ghosts on the page. Yet the emotional turn hinges on a single diagnostic line—“what we don’t say becomes the ghost”—that momentarily abstracts the body. Still, the renunciation is earned and irreversible under the eucalyptus, so characterization clears the 7-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the letter read aloud reweights the covenant rule-set, ghosts visibly thin, Mara assumes custodianship of speech. Causal lens holds—because she speaks, the after-life prison dissolves. Cost is unmistakable: she forfeits solitude and invites an unending duty. Orientation is anchored by word 70; no lens ambiguity; no artifact touches the final image—meets 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Scorched apiary and amber-glass box both constrain choice: only the box’s translucency lets her discover the letter, only the dead hive’s silence drives her to speak. Sensory triage—crumbling cloth, crystalline wings—mirrors urgency without checklist excess. Micro-setting qualifies; environment charges the final image. Slight over-reliance on visual; still, setting materially shapes tactics and closure, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“preserve the weight of unspoken words”—tightens when covenant silence is revealed as ghost-source. One meaningful deepening: reading the letter collapses the false peace option, forces her custodial vow. Cost is legible: she trades isolation for endless witness. Agency drives escalation; no coincidence resolves—the 8-band is secure, just shy of 8.8 because the price is spiritual, not viscerally felt on the body.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the inversion: silence ≠ harmony, speech ≠ violence—truth-telling as communal mercy. No final-paragraph sermon; the reconfiguration is the silent dispersal of ghosts. Ambiguity remains—will new ghosts arrive?—inviting reflection without confusion. The stained glass reprise charges the closing image, satisfying the resonant non-literal answer test.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly pinned to Mara’s perceptual signature—“angle of a broken frame suggesting violence”—no head-hop. Diction is controlled, arid, beekeeper-precise; no register drift. Syntax breathes with emotional beats: short clauses at ghost dispersal, longer reflective cadences earlier. Minor slip: one near-algorithmic string “then the drought came, and they’d fled, and the bees had died”—template cadence costs the 0.1 that keeps it from 8.4.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Information-dense lines—“wraps the oasis in necessary speech”—advance both texture and stake. Figurative layer is spare and coherent; no mixed metaphors. Parallax check clean: no synonym loops, no scaffold. One buried participle opener “Nestled inside…” is justified by breathless discovery. Closure sentence—“weight of unspoken words would find voice here”—lands with crystalline propulsion; line-level craft clears 8.5.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: beekeeping ghost-drought + silence-as-toxic-covenant, all braided through stained glass reliquary. Image of translucent bees feels inevitable yet unforeseen. The “garden of necessary speech” coinage is bold but earned by prior particulars. No recognizable template echo; conceptual risk heightens emotional stakes without obscuring clarity—justifies the high-band bonus.</comment>
