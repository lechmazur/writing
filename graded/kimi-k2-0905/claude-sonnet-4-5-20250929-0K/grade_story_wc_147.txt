<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—thrall versus duty—rides every beat; the vial’s addictive tug is embodied in pulse and pocket warmth. Chen’s limp surrender and wheezing tank give credible counter-pressure, forcing her micro-choice to pocket the vial mid-rescue. Renunciation at the end is earned: same pocket that once seduced now seals the mystery, cost legible in her lingering gaze. Minor slip: Chen’s “lifetime studying” line drifts into expositional shorthand, not embodied memory.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: every ascent meter tightens because/therefore linkage—oxygen alarm → vial pocketed → temple last look → surface light—each step forecloses the last. Closure is a Charged Poise: the vial still pulses, but the choice to seal it reconfigures both scientists’ future tactics with felt conceptual cost (“we’re choosing to forget we ever knew”). No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 5. Persistent constraint—the vial’s addictive gravity—shapes the final image and is never neutralized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Kelp-shrouded limestone and red-flashing gauge are handled, not catalogued; the vial’s shifting surface becomes micro-setting that constrains the final choice. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly as Mara hauls Chen through collapsing pillars toward the sub hatch. Environment mirrors internal pressure: temple “dissolving back into the patient ocean” charges the Earned Stasis. One hairline slip: “gathered hush” is named but not given acoustic or tactile specificity until late.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—addiction to preserved emotion versus survival—tightens once but decisively when oxygen alarm screams while vial warmth seduces. Agency sits with Mara: each refusal to re-touch the crystal narrows tactical options under causal pressure. Cost is visible: Chen’s blue lips and her own “fingers linger” show price paid. No escalation loop; single meaningful intensification suffices for 700-word scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the cost of archiving feeling: the vial literalizes that preserving emotion consumes the living. Subtext operates through gesture—Mara’s thumb rubbing pocket fabric—never thesis. Final image of temple dissolving reweights the premise without moralizing. No thematic echo; “lonesome splendor” is image, not assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Mara’s sensory filter; no head-hop. Perceptual signature—“gathered hush,” “patient ocean”—is atmospheric yet idiosyncratic. Dialogue is sparse, goal-driven: Chen’s whispered “You came” conveys both gratitude and surrender. Minor cadence repetition in “still pulsed…still feeling” but mirrors vial heartbeat, hence permissible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sentences vary length and opening; no template cadence. Figurative language scarce but precise—“kelp like funeral shrouds”—and never clusters. Information density high: one sentence can merge light refraction, addiction, and temple history. Zero paraphrase loops; no scaffold. Copy clean except one typo “deadened” for “dead-weighted,” negligible.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Memory-preserving perfume vial freshens the antiquated “artifact of ancient wisdom” trope by making emotion the narcotic, not knowledge. Underwater temple as emotional archive feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk taken: no villain, no chase, yet stakes stay intimate. Slight proximity to “forgotten underwater cathedral” motif keeps it from 9.0.</comment>
