<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Maya’s love of incompleteness is palpable, but her interiority stays lyrical-abstract (“find the beauty she left suspended”) rather than dramatized contradiction. The choice to play unfinished music is stated, not tested under rising pressure; we see no moment where she almost abandons or distorts a piece. Family members cry, yet their emotional beats are summarized, so relationships act as backdrop, not crucible. The earned cost—she drinks the bowl’s mixed water—lands softly, not forced by a prior irreversible action of hers.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: each fragment layers sensory density until the hush is “slightly” repelled. Orientation (who/where/when) is crisp within 60 words; no penalty. Closure—Charged Poise—arrives with the falling-apple splash that reweights silence as “potential,” satisfying RR. Cost is present but diffuse (shared grief, environmental loss) rather than a price Maya personally forfeits; the bowl drink is collective ritual, not consequence of her agency.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sunken greenhouse, sideways trees, and shipwreck ribs create a tactile micro-cosmos that literally directs movement—wading, platform choice, acoustic echo. Ash, glass shards, and slapping water are filtered through Maya’s sound-focused bias, keeping detail selective. The final falling-apple sound is charged by the setting’s acoustic architecture, satisfying 9+ gate. Only minor slack: iron ribs “sing” is lovely but not tied to a specific tactical beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“reclaim beauty from silence”—is clear, yet pressure stays atmospheric; no external or relational force threatens the concert. Escalation is textural: hush “retreats slightly” as fragments accumulate; no option is foreclosed for Maya. The chronic hush is the antagonist, but it neither narrows her choices nor demands adaptation beyond playing on. Cost is global (burnt world) rather than personal, so agency feels low-stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the motif of incompleteness as communal space; no character sermonizes. Final image—single fruit dropping—re-weights silence from dead to “living quiet,” achieving non-literal resonance. Subtext in shared bowl of rainwater/tears hints at collective grief without stating it. Only hedge: theme drifts toward consolation that may dampen the fires’ moral ugliness, leaving faint aftertaste of aestheticized catastrophe.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person close keeps tightly to Maya’s acoustic perception: “glass panels humming sympathetically,” “ripples slapped gently against apple bark.” Rhythm modulates—long sentence to carry melodic flow, then clipped “She set down her bow” to mark cadence close. No head-hop; family’s tears are external observation. Register stays within her artistic lexicon; no filter-verb stacks. Voice risks loftiness but earns it through consistent sensorial bias.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sentences carry triple duty—image, acoustics, emotion: “apple trees grew sideways through the flooded foundation, their branches breaking the waterline to bloom in defiance.” No paraphrase loops; each metaphor is singular. Minor purple flicker—“amber horizon,” “chronic hush”—but pattern is taught early and paid off. Closure line—“a single fruit dropping into water, the sound carrying perfectly, magnificently clear”—is crisp, uncluttered, propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Post-climate-concert in half-drowned greenhouse feels fresh; sideways orchard and shipwreck-rib acoustics are specific, not stock. Unfinished-music-as-portal is familiar from Bolano et al., but here it becomes collective ritual rather than solitary genius trope. Risk of beautiful-catastrophe indulgence is partially acknowledged by communal tears, though still skates close to aestheticism. Final sonic re-pricing rescues piece from mere elegiac tableau.</comment>
