<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Keeper’s serene fatalism is credibly alien, but the mother/daughter pair remain sketches—only their sacrifice-reflex is shown. Interiority is poetic-summary (“watched three thousand generations bloom”) rather than scene-pressed contradiction. The brass gear as tactile memory works, yet no micro-choice on the Keeper’s part is dramatized; the help offered feels predetermined. Cost is present (the Keeper’s perennial solitude) but only asserted, not embodied in a beat that hurts.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the brass gear tumbles away, recalculations complete, while the humans receive “impossible light” whose price is the Keeper’s endless vigil—cost is visible. Accumulative lens holds: pattern of arrivals → sacrifice → garden-light accrues until the image reweights meaning. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“nebula garden”) and never breaks. One minor causality waver: the pod’s systems revive instantly without physics cue, but the fantastic frame buys it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Nebula garden is not wallpaper; its luminous petals constrain how help can be given (light without fire) and supply the rescue resource. Micro-setting of the failing pod is sketched with sensory economy (“dying life support,” “viewport”) and stays consistent. Spatial choreography clean: Keeper materializes, palm-garden visible, light transferred. The brass gear’s final drift externalizes the rule that measurement alone fails—object charges closure image under Q2.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake established at once: can love survive the repeating pattern of sacrifice? Pressure tightens when the Keeper must decide whether to intervene again—agency is decision to share light, not physical scramble. Escalation is accumulative: each echoed sacrifice deepens the moral cost of continued gardening. Price is legible but diffuse (Keeper’s eternal loneliness); a sharper, momentary forfeiture would push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges without sermon: the only pattern worth repeating is love’s self-extinguishing offer. Brass gear’s worn teeth reprice “calculation” as emotionally bankrupt; final image of tumbling gear answers the thematic question non-literally. Subtext resides in the sonar echo—technology of seeking becomes metaphor for compassion. Final line avoids moral statement; resonance comes from image, not assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Voice is lyric-omniscient with controlled distance; nebula diction (“mist remembering water”) stays within poetic license. Rhythm modulates: long breathless accumulations mirror cosmic scale, then contract to crystal-chime dialogue. No head-hopping; Keeper’s consciousness remains anchor. Dialogue minimal but distinct: mother’s diction is urgent-human, daughter’s flicker of curiosity breaks terror.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; metaphors are coherent (“echoes in a canyon”) and serve theme. No scaffold loops; sentences vary in length and syntax. One mixed metaphor mild: “sonar pinging through cosmic medium” stretches physics but acceptable in lyric frame. Opening and closing lines are ear-tested and cadence-matched, recharging the gear image.</question>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Alien gardener who rescues generational castaways via nebula-flowers is fresh synthesis; trope of cosmic benefactor is reweighted by the keeper’s own immortality-as-burden. Brass gear as anti-talisman of failed metrics is a specific, memorable object. Risky lyric mode commits fully and pays off in final reprise. Could edge higher if the human pair felt less generic, but the conceptual angle is non-obvious.</comment>
