<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Marina’s interiority is vivid—“I’ll keep everything safe, even if it means keeping everything the same” crystallizes her flaw and anchors the loop. Micro-choice—reaching for the biography as the orchard spins—embodies the rupture with visible cost. Operator remains more catalyst than crucible, softening the “relationship as crucible” test, but her earned awakening is fully motivated.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each frost-etched line and press-pull thickens pattern until the spin snaps the loop. Closure is a Charged Poise—the library’s rotation reframes every prior morning as falling, not floating, with conceptual cost paid in the final image. No causal gaps; the bottled whisper anchors motivation and payoff.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Glass orchard, pneumatic dock, crystalline branches—every anchor is sensuous, tacticle, and skewed to POV’s librarian sight. The setting itself becomes the constraint that fractures; when frost letters crawl, the world-rule is rewritten in real time. Micro-setting (bottled breath, press bed) charges the final image. Orientation is taught by word 30.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—escape stasis versus preserve safety—is declared early and tightens with each press-thud that rattles branches. One meaningful deepening: frost patterns translate into a map of her own erased mornings, foreclosing the “safe” option. Cost is legible in the lurching floor and the dissolve of her younger vow. Agency sits with Marina; operator only provides the lever.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through imagery, not label: preservation vs. experience is argued by glass fruit that finally chimes off-key. Final line “awakening always feels like falling…” offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in operator’s indirection—patterns reveal themselves best in morning frost—invites re-read. No thematic echo in closing paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyric third-person hovers close to Marina’s selective attention—phantom sunlight, dewdrops of knowledge—creating a perceptual signature that blurs when frost distorts glass. Compression (“older than memory itself”) is taught early and paid off in the spin. Rhythm modulates: long breathless sentences for looped monotony, staccato beats during rupture. No head-hop; operator remains opaque by design.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences perform double duty—each frost spiral both describes and rewrites the library’s physics. No scaffold loops; “glass fruit chimed discordantly” is the only figurative stack in peak beat and it is earned. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and re-charge motif. Clean grammar, precise spatial choreography as floor tilts and books tremble.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Floating glass library whose fruit are books is already non-obvious; coupling it to a letterpress that prints frost-maps of trapped time feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk—destabilizing the very matrix that suspends the story—pays off in a final image that reweights every prior identical morning. Trope of “loop awakened by outsider” is transmuted through material specificity of type cases, bottled breath, crystalline branches. Fresh synthesis, not checklist.</comment>
