<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Marina’s reactive-vision trait is shown through her cataloguing reflex and the “ten-second” coping device; her loneliness is concrete in the archive ritual. Thomas appears mainly as mirror and recipient; his interiority is sketched rather than pressured. The moment she hands over the valve crystallizes her shift from burden to bridge, paying the cost of exposure. A fuller interior contradiction or visible trade-off in the final beat would have lifted this into the 8.8+ band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the archive door opening spills seventeen years of attention into light, making the conceptual cost of her vigil undeniable. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each fragment she hoarded accretes until it can only discharge as gift. The valve’s return supplies the single tightening required; no reversal is needed. Orientation is secure by line 5; the only minor drag is a too-summarized handshake between the two exiles.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Ivory Harbor is evoked through steaming planks, rain-slick stones, and the white triangle of sail—selective, never touristic. The archive building is only sketched, but the trumpet valve serves as micro-setting that constrains the final offering. Weather is used causally: rain-washed light literalizes the “clean” return and allows the valve to gleam as charged object. Spatial choreography on the pier is tracked cleanly in staggered ten-second glimpses.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—how to survive being the rememberer—tightens once: the returned herald appears, forcing Marina to decide whether to keep or release her hoard. The cost is the emotional exposure of handing over the valve, acknowledging seventeen years spent in absence. Under the Accumulative lens the pressure is coherent: each catalogued fragment increases the weight until discharge is inevitable. A more explicit forfeiture (e.g., an offered archive key, or Thomas refusing part of the collection) would have pushed this higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme emerges without statement: memory as asymmetrical labor, absence as architecture. The empty doorstep toys and half-finished letters accrue into a quiet thesis on caretaking. The final image of light spilling across boxes reweights prior motifs—fragments become gifts, absence becomes presence. No moral is declared; the resonance is felt through the valve’s glint and the open door.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Marina’s perceptual signature—cataloguing by absence, interval counting, salt-smell metaphors—remains consistent and specific. Syntax lengthens in reflective beats, then fractures into staccato sightings on the pier, mirroring her coping rhythm. No dialogue is required; the one spoken exchange is functional, not distinctive, but the narrative voice never leaks into committee prose. The lyric repetition of “seventeen years” becomes pattern, not tic, paid off in the final spill of light.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, with high density: single sentences layer sensory data, emotional calculus, and world fact (“rain-darkened wood planks steam in the returning sun”). No filter-verb stacks or mixed metaphors. The only minor loop is the twice-used “seventeen years of boxes / seventeen years of waiting,” but the reprise serves cadence rather than padding. Opening and closing lines are image-driven, propelling rather than decorating.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The post-exile archive caretaker angle feels fresh; the trumpet valve as synecdoche for voice returned is elegant and specific. Staggered-interval observation is taught early and repurposed as both coping mechanism and narrative delivery. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulative structure rather than causal thriller—but the payoff justifies the choice. A sharper external obstacle (doubting returned family, city council erasure plan) could have elevated stakes uniqueness.</comment>
