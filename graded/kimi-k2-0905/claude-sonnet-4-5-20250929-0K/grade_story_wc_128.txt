<comment>Marianne’s shift from ledger-value to recognition-value is visible, but the interior contradiction is narrated rather than dramatized in a single high-pressure beat; the “something shift[ing] in her chest” is shorthand, not embodied cost. Her one micro-choice—deciding to photograph the lighthouse keeper—reads as logistical, not values-laden, so the renunciation of pure shrewdness is asserted, not enacted. Chen remains functional, not pressure-tested; their rapport is summarized across weeks, not crystallized in a single stakes scene. The closure therefore feels gestural rather than paid for by a visible, character-specific forfeiture.</comment>

<comment>Closure is present: a Resonant Reconfiguration in which recognition becomes Marianne’s new currency, signaled by the lighthouse keeper’s near-tears and the star-wheeled final image. Causality is Accumulative/Textural: each small documentation act layers density until the premise is repriced. Cost is conceptual—Marianne’s time and her altered metric of worth—but not viscerally felt on the page; the final line’s cosmic frame is lovely yet bloodless. The pattern is taught early and held; no orientation or lens ambiguity issues.</comment>

<comment>The observatory library under the glass dome is more than postcard: the starlight pooling like “spilled milk” literally illuminates the photos, making the setting an active display mechanism. Salt-sweet harbor breeze through vents keeps the maritime economy present even in this ethereal space, grounding the cargo broker’s lens. Spatial choreography is clean—spiral staircase, table by glass wall, entrance display trackable throughout. The dome’s stars return in the final image, recharging the motif with conceptual cost rather than decorative repetition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—Marianne’s expansion of value from profit to recognition—is signaled early and tightens once: the decision to photograph the lighthouse keeper narrows her remaining free nights and commits her publicly. Pressure is textural: each new story added to the foyer display increases the social density of gratitude, forcing her either to keep scaling or to admit the project matters. No visible price (money, reputation, lost deal) is dramatized; the cost is opportunity-only, weakening the punch. Escalation is coherent under Accumulative lens but stops at gentle deepening rather than a trade-off that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Theme—cycles of noticing—emerges inductively from the growing photo wall rather than thesis statement, avoiding overt moralizing. The lighthouse keeper’s whispered “People think the lighthouse just runs itself” provides the sharpest subtext about invisibility, yet the story repeats the insight several times in slightly different wrappers, blunting irony. Final image of star-wheeling witnesses offers conceptual repricing that feels cosmic rather than earned from Marianne’s bodily risk. Ambiguity is present but thin; the piece leans toward comforting affirmation rather than complex moral tension.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Narrative voice maintains a hushed, observational cadence fitting the dome-at-night locale; perceptual signature leans visual–mercantile (“salt-sweet scent,” “ledger and manifest”). Syntax is clean, with gentle anaphora (“the rope-makers… the customs clerks…”) that teaches its list pattern early. Dialogue is minimal but natural; Chen’s diction carries soft formality without caricature. No head-hopping or register drift; psychic distance stays consistent in reflective third-person.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is largely smooth: strong verb choices (“echoed,” “wheeled”), concise scaffolding, no mixed metaphors. Occasional soft filters (“felt,” “seemed”) sneak in during emotional peaks but do not cluster. One paraphrase loop: “thank you for bringing that envelope” idea is iterated three times in closing paragraph; trimmed once would sharpen cadence. No artifacts touch the closure image; final sentence lands cleanly with stellar choreography.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Freshest inflection is treating logistical gratitude as brokered cargo: Marianne’s spreadsheets expand to include human “invisible labor,” repricing value without a villain or romance arc. The mistaken-address envelope trope is familiar, but repurposing it as portal to social portraiture feels gentle, not gimmicky. Risk level is modest—lyric uplift rather than stakes that could fail—so ingenuity is solid but not startling. Specific maritime details (rope-makers, customs clerks) keep the world from feeling generic, though the dock cast is off-page.</comment>
