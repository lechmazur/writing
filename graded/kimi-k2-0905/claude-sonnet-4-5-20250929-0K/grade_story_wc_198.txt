<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Marcus’s memory-triggered tremor and the grandmother-haunted set-list micro-choice embody contradictory impulses in-scene; the renunciation of prophecy via deliberate anti-selody carries visible cost—his literal breath used to erase family doom—so the 9+ test is met, though secondary-pressure from an off-stage family never fully materializes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Earned Stasis: the prophecy is not denied but absorbed into chosen silence, with the final image of “dewdrops catching muted light” making the conceptual cost legible; causal lens holds throughout—every prism color-shift follows directly from the anti-notes played; Orientation is secured by word 60 (“radiant grotto”), so no penalty applies.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The prism-atrium is not mere scenery; its light refraction directly responds to the anti-melody, physically enacting the silence Marcus engineers and thus charging the final image; the tool-obeys-music rule taught early and paid off at closure satisfies the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Dominant stake—“silence the doom encoded in music”—is signaled in paragraph 2; escalation occurs through the prism’s tightening color reaction that narrows options to either finish the anti-song or let the prophecy echo; the final breath-shaped silence costs Marcus his childhood lullabies, a felt price clearly on the page under causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges entirely through the inversion of sound into silence; the final dewdrop image reweights earlier droplets as now “quietly vivid,” delivering a Conceptual Repricing without moralizing; no thematic echo violations—prophecy is never named in protagonist self-analysis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyric, pattern-taught compression (“the condensation forming on stone…”) sustains a jazz-solo rhythm, while perceptual signature—“each droplet catching the first pale light”—remains idiosyncratically Marcus’s; no head-hopping; elision is paid off when the final breath literally shapes the absence of echo.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>High density—single sentences fuse sensory cue, memory stab, and causal link (“his fingers trembled slightly… because the margins of her letter used musical notation so faint it looked like decorative flourishes”); zero loops, no mixed metaphors; one scaffold (“the prism atrium loomed”) forgiven because it serves as transition beat, not high-pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a “negative-space jazz exorcism” inside a quartz grotto; prism acoustics repurposed as metaphysical canceling device; final image of dew holding silenced prophecy is specific enough to fail the transformation test—could not swap in any generic cave.</comment>
