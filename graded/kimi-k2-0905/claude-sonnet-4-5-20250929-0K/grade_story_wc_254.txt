<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Meris’s interiority is concrete (“the weight of silence,” “tremor of certainty”) and her micro-choice to compose inside the quartz anchors a credible renunciation. Kael’s pressure is minimal, so relationship-as-crucible is not required. Earned stasis lands with visible cost: she strides through boundaries “without looking back,” foreclosing retreat. Missing a second contradictory impulse in-scene caps the score just below 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Single-scene, single-POV, causal lens holds: because the ban lifts, therefore Meris returns; because she touches the pillar, therefore certainty arrives; because she composes, boundaries dissolve. Closure is an Earned Stasis (renunciation of fixed meaning) with felt cost in the final image. Orientation is anchored by line 4; no causality breaks. One hairline slip: “paraphrase would kill it” leans toward thematic echo rather than causal turn, keeping it under 9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Cobalt glass shadows, cracked-lake porcelain, and humming quartz are selective, sensory, and mirrored in Meris’s fracturing of meaning. The colonnage itself is the micro-setting/tool that constrains her compositional act and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean: palm on pillar → deeper colonnade → watchers arrive. No environment detail is idle; each refracts the theme of dissolving fixity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—poetry’s right to remain fluid—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightened when Meris physically composes inside the quartz, narrowing options to irreversible renunciation of fixed language. Cost is legible in the final image: she accepts the likelihood of another ban (“They’ll try…”) yet strides on. Agency is pure; no coincidence resolves tension. A crisper visible price (e.g., Kael losing his post) would lift it higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: language as aesthetic flux versus authoritarian fixity. The frozen lake’s ephemeral wind-drawn patterns objectify the poetry ideal; quartz frequencies bypass words entirely. Final image—poetry “remembering how to breathe”—reweights prior material without moralizing. No abstract thesis statements; subtext lives in gesture and setting. Complexity is honored: ambiguity is both liberation and risk.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate stays tightly bound to Meris’s sensorium; perceptual signature is poet-specific (lantern-moth simile, synesthetic “blue shadows humming”). Syntax modulates: longer cadences for reverence, clipped fragments during pillar tremor. No head-hopping; Kael’s dialogue is externally observed. Diction (“verse-shadows,” “quantum states of meaning”) stretches but remains within poet-POV lexicon. Rhythm control heightens pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences do triple duty (e.g., “humming quartz colonnade stood waiting…” advances setting, stakes, and backstory). Figurative language is sparse, precise, never muddled. No paraphrase loops; each metaphor extends the last. Minor scaffold: “boundaries once thought sacred” appears twice with slight rephrase (−0.2). Final line earns its lyric uplift without purple drift. Clean grammar and tense.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: cloud-shadow poetry as quantum language banned by authoritarian semiotics, staged inside a resonant quartz instrument. Conceptual risk—poetry without fixed meaning—drives every beat and is fully committed to at closure. Transformation test fails if relocated: the colonnade’s frequencies, the poet’s non-verbal composition, and the frozen lake’s fractal patterns are inseparable. Specific detail throughout prevents allegorical abstraction. Risk-taking heightens coherence rather than gimmickry.</comment>
