<comment>The bell tuner’s motives remain abstract—“frequency of hope,” “shared balance”—never embodied in a hard choice or visible cost; she is a catalyst, not a crucible. Townspeople follow in rhythmic lockstep without interior contradiction, so no relationship acts as crucible and no micro-choice exposes a hierarchy of values. The ending’s “earned stasis” is credited to the collective, but the agent herself exits unchanged and therefore unscored for personal arc.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the sealed bell crystallizes the town’s restored resonance, cost paid by years of silence and the tacit price of perpetual communal walking. Accumulative lens holds: pattern of footsteps → harmonic density → crack seals. Orientation is clean; archway, bell tower, and timeline anchor within first 120 words. No causal break; the magical repair is seeded by the tuner’s repeated fork-to-stone tests.</comment>

<comment>Selective sensory triangulation—amber light on ebony fork, wild hush, cobblestone pulse—grounds the ghost-town texture without tourist catalog. The fork functions as micro-setting: its material note constrains every tactical stop and charges the final bell strike. Spatial choreography stays coherent across the square, tower, arch. Environment does not yet constrain a character choice at 9+ level, capping at 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“will the town remember its heartbeat?”—tightens via density of footfall resonance; option to remain ghosted is foreclosed when crack seals. Escalation is accumulative: each walked beat adds harmonic mass; no reversal, but decisive deepening. Cost is felt in the communal labor of endless rhythm, though individual price stays abstract. Sufficient for 600-word window.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of communal memory as vibrational repair emerges through patterned action, not thesis. Final image of continuing footsteps offers non-literal answer: survival is maintenance, not monument. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the tuner’s eternal return. Fork–bell–footstep motif reweights meaning at close, satisfying 9- band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Lyric omniscient voice sustains hushed cadence, modulating from elegiac to anticipatory without register drift. Perceptual signature is collective yet haunted: “wild hush,” “hollow-eyed buildings.” Repetition of rhythmic clauses mirrors the restoring pulse—pattern taught early, paid off at bell strike. No dialogue contamination; voice remains singular.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Figurative language is spare—tightening metaphor of “heartbeat” stays coherent. Minor scaffold: “Left foot, right foot, pause” repeated twice for effect, not loop. High information density; each paragraph advances pattern or stakes. No artifact touches closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Acoustic resurrection of a ghost town via communal walking is fresh synthesis of magical-realist trope. Risk lies in quiet, accumulative structure rather than twist; coherence rewards the gamble. Specificity of fork-note mechanics prevents abstraction from drifting into allegory. Could edge higher with sharper individual cost.</comment>
