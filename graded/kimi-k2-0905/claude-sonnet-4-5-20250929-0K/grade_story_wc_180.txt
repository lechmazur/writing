<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marta’s contradictory impulses—guilt over the corporate sell-out versus hunger for reconciliation—are dramatized in her tense climb and the micro-choice to unwrap the grandmother’s stone. The embodied tremor of her “chest tightening” and the final joined hands give credible emotional cost. Lena’s anger-to-willingness transition is sketched more briskly, blunting the relationship crucible, and the interior line “I thought progress meant…” flirts with diagnostic shorthand, preventing the top band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The closure image—mother and daughter grinding quartz under falling blossoms—delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration that visibly costs Marta her pride and Lena her silence. Causality is clean: cryptic letter → climb → stone discovery → co-grinding, each step shrinking the emotional distance. The drive lens is Causal; no orientation debt, though the contract breach is relayed in efficient exposition that still lands before the 120-word sweep. Closure cost is unmistakable in the hush of their joined labor.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The cathedral-orchard is not mere scenery: ladder placement, rafter walkway, and blossom drift all constrain movement and timing, charging the final tableau. Specific sensory triangulation—“slanted light,” “apple blossoms landing on their joined hands”—anchors POV bias. The setting’s conversion from nave to canopy mirrors the vow-renewal theme without overt symbolism, satisfying the 9+ gate for environmental charge on the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restoring the craft and the relationship—is signaled by line 3 and tightens when Marta realizes the bag contains the ancestral stone. The reversal is small but meaningful: she arrives expecting absolution, stays to re-earn mentorship. Cost is tangible: Marta forfeits residual pride when she admits failure aloud. Agency is shared on the last beat, sufficient for a quiet story; no coincidence resolves the rift.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The “deciduous vows” concept migrates from proverb to lived practice: the shedding of rigid corporate form lets new craft growth occur. Theme emerges through image (blossoms dropping, old stone unearthed) rather than sermon. Final re-pricing—“wisdom arrives accidentally”—is understated yet echoes the cathedral’s own accidental sanctity, giving pleasing asymmetry. Avoids explicit moral, though Lena’s line “somewhere that adapts” flirts with thesis-heat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Marta’s perceptions: she notices quartz before blossoms, time stretches as she climbs. Syntax is controlled, rhythmic micro-variation (“apple trees grew wild through the nave…”) that never clots. Dialogue is spare yet character-specific: Lena’s clipped diction carries residual anger; Marta’s sentences soften when teaching, reflecting generational difference. No filter-verb stacks or head-hop, peak-beat prose clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud cadence breathes with scene tempo; sentence lengths ebb during the climb, tighten at the reveal. Occasional softeners (“seemed like,” “looked like”) could be pruned; near-duplicate “thinking machines… thinking she could modernize” repeats stem within two lines, a minor loop. Otherwise dense, propulsive, and free of mixed metaphor; the blossom-to-hands image lands clear and tactile. Final sentence avoids drumbeat by varying participial close.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Fusing quartz-grinding heritage with post-industrial ruin inside a cathedral orchard is fresh; the corporate breach as generational sin adds moral complexity. Specificity of the canvas satchel and grandmother’s water-wet grinding method roots the concept in lived craft, resisting template swap. Accidental wisdom motif reframes familiar reconciliation plot without contrived twist. Risk is moderate but coherent; no famous-scene echoes detected.</comment>
