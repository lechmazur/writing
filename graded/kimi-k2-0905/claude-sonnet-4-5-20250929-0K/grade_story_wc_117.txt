<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses—professional calm versus maternal ache—surface in the tactile act of touching the baby curl; the same curl re-anchors her after Thomas speaks, proving the interior contradiction is continuous. Thomas’s shift from frozen silence to metaphoric speech (“starlight looks”) is dramatized, not diagnosed, and carries visible cost: his body uncoils and the mother weeps. Both characters read as individuals, not case studies; therapist jargon is kept off-stage. The micro-choice to match humming rather than applaud crystallizes values without exposition.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the final image of Mara packing her guitar while planning next week’s wind-chime session reconfigures her earlier doubt into forward motion, cost felt in the empty loft where the echo of Thomas’s voice still hangs. Causal lens dominates: eclipse → hum → first words → reorientation of therapist’s stance; each beat is a because/therefore linkage. Orientation is anchored by line 4 (“edge of town where the pines…”) and repeatedly re-anchored through sensory cues (cooling air, falling birdsong). No teleporting props; the curl, guitar, and eclipse glasses remain tracked.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The garden-as-micro-setting constrains the therapy: no walls, only sage scent and twilight noon, forcing intimacy and making the eclipse a shared ceiling. The guitar functions as portable “room,” its wood against Mara’s lap demarcating safe space. Spatial choreography is clean: cushions, distance, shared angle to sky. Final image of wind chimes inheres in the same garden, so environment continues to shape next session.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Single dominant stake: can Thomas speak before totality ends? Pressure tightens once, when the moon’s shadow crosses the sun and his hum becomes audible; that sonic threshold forecloses the option of eternal silence. Cost is legible: Mara must risk musical trespass, Thomas must risk audible exposure. No coincidence; eclipse is external clock that demands internal surrender.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Ordinary magic emerges through sensory particulars—sage scent, single guitar string, corona glare—never labeled theme. Final line “space between darkness and light” reweights the opening twilight metaphor without sermon. Theme stays porous: miracle is both astronomical and interpersonal, refusing either/or. Reader left to decide whether voice returns because of science, therapy, or cosmic accident.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited clings to Mara’s perceptual bias: she notices breathing shifts, shoulder angles, “barely perceptible” changes. Syntax mirrors her cadence—“softly adaptive,” “mellow quality”—without drifting into how-to manual. Thomas’s two spoken lines break voice open with startling metaphor, justified by three-year silence. No filter-verb bloat; guitar rests “like an old friend” is single permissible uplift, earned by prior texture.</comment>

<comment>Read-aloud rhythm: long sentence sets forest dusk, then short pluck—“She played another note”—mimics cardiac pacing under eclipse. No metaphor pile-ups; “starlight looks” is lone compressed compound, justified by child’s wonder. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances light, temperature, or breath. Copy-clean: no tense drift, pronoun confusion, or scaffold sentences.</comment>

<comment>Trope of mute child healed by art is familiar, but eclipse-as-clock and therapist-as-mother lend specific tilt. Baby-curl anchor transforms from cliché to living conduit between past and future sessions. Risk taken: no antagonist, no medical exposition, yet stakes feel intimate rather than small. Could swap Ridge name and still function, so freshness capped short of breakthrough.</comment>
