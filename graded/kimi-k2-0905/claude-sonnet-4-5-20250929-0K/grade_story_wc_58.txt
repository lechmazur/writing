<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren’s interior contradiction—professional detachment vs. the tender trespass of stealing the carpet thread—surfaces in one sharp gesture and drives the final intimacy. The Duchess’s micro-choices (unmarked palms, the quill grip, the finger squeeze) embody her exile-within-flesh without therapeutic self-labeling. Both women’s flaws complicate the moment: Maren’s voyeuristic craft and the Duchess’s self-haunting collide to earn the shared, costly “slow work of a soul finding its way back.” Only the absence of a second character in the garden prevents a full relationship-as-crucible beat, capping at 8.7.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory fragment (fog-bound lanterns, bitter chrysanthemum scent, bronze leaves) layers until the crimson thread becomes the decisive re-pricing image. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by line 4; the 120-word test is waived because late disorientation (the “geography of healing”) is paid off when the thread literally maps the return path. Closure is a Charged Poise: the silk bridge reconfigures the Duchess’s options—she can now choose to walk the hall again—with the conceptual cost of admitting she had never truly left. Persistent constraint: the visible absence of wounds on her palms keeps the price of exile legible to the final line.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The autumn garden is not backdrop but prosthetic memory: skeletal roses force Maren to ask about the daughter, and the wind-scattered leaves literally write the first draft of the obituary. Micro-setting—the thread extracted from a pre-war map—constrains the closing gesture: only that specific red strand can literalize the Duchess’s “return route.” Spatial choreography is flawless: from fog-bound quay to desk lamplight, every move is tracked through Maren’s biased noticing (scent first, visual second). The palace carpet’s missing cities echo the daughter-shaped absence, charging the final image without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can the Duchess re-enter her own life?—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens through sensory accumulation rather than external reversals. The single meaningful turn occurs when Maren proposes “simply let yourself be absent until you're ready,” instantly narrowing the Duchess’s options from endless self-explanation to earned stillness; the cost is the sob-squeeze that follows. Under Accumulative lens, density (bitter perfume, unmarked palms, crimson thread) reweights the stake until silence itself becomes the decisive act. No visible loss of money/tool/time keeps this just shy of 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Theme emerges from the repeating motif of maps that chart absence: the carpet’s lost cities, the garden’s unreachable roses, the thread-as-route. Subtext lives in gesture—palms without scars speak louder than any diagnosis about exile. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the thread glinting “like a route home” re-prices absence itself as the necessary geography of return. No character sermonizes; the insight is felt when the Duchess’s squeeze acknowledges the cost of having never truly left.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Third-person limited stays strictly inside Maren’s perceptual signature: “scent first, visual second,” professional inventory of grieving objects, synesthetic slide of lamplight on silk. Diction—“geography of healing,” “lonesome splendor”—is precise enough to feel authorial yet remains anchored in Maren’s occupational poetry. Rhythm accelerates into breathless compression during the intimate proposal, then exhales into the longer cadence of the final sentence, mirroring the Duchess’s release. No head-hopping; the single POV sustains coherent psychic distance throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; each sentence layers new pressure or texture. Mixed metaphors are avoided: lanterns “fading into the fog like dying stars” keeps the celestial/map axis consistent. Information density is high—“rust and gold” simultaneously colors foliage and the muted violence of autumn. Clause variety propels the final paragraph from participle opener to prepositional sweep to crystalline noun phrase (“a small bridge across an unmapped distance”), earning the cadence shift that mirrors closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>The “obituaries for the living” premise offers a fresh inversion of elegiac form; the thread-from-carpet tactic turns interior design into navigational instrument. Familiar tropes of grief-garden and absent-aristocrat are re-inflected through Maren’s cartographer-of-sorrow profession, making the Duchess’s exile feel specific rather than archetypal. The final reconfiguration—that absence can be a plotted return—grows inevitable in hindsight yet is not obvious at entry. Risky compression of plot into a single intimate conversation succeeds without gimmickry.</comment>
