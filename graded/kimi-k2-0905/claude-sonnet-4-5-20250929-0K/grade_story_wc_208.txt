<comment>Maya’s interiority is convincingly tied to her sculptor’s eye—reading storm-ripped landscapes, feeling “turbine-hum reverie” in her body. Her discovery of the slide triggers a visible shift in creative method: from “scaffold complexity with simplicity” to layered transparency, a choice enacted when she pockets the slide and selects the cedar root-ball. The only drag is a faint self-explanatory gloss (“she realized something new…”) rather than pure embodied inference, keeping her just shy of the 9-band.</comment>

<comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Maya’s new aesthetic (revealing history in resin strata) crystallizes in the final image of the GPS ignored, older navigation embraced. Causal chain holds: storm → archway → slide → insight → altered artistic tactics → root-ball chosen; each beat layers density rather than reverses plot. Cost is felt in her deliberate abandonment of digital ease, the turbine-song now internalized. Minor clarity dip: “timewoven alliances” is named rather than dramatized, but the pattern of inscribed names on the slide teaches the concept early enough to waive any ambiguity cap.</comment>

<comment>Coastal storm debris, salt-slick granite arch, kelp-choked tunnel, and the cedar root’s “twisted chambers” are tactile, choice-guiding environments. Weather and objects (slide, root, brass frame) constrain options—she can’t drive further, must walk, must select wood that will read translucent. Micro-setting inside the arch supplies both acoustic filter and relic discovery, directly charging the final aesthetic pivot. GPS blink-out functions as temporal/technical anchor that later flips to thematic stasis, satisfying the 9+ gate for setting-as-constraint.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake: can she evolve her art to honor hidden strata without losing structural elegance? The meaningful tightening occurs when slide-in-hand reframes her driftwood hunt into a quest for layered transparency; this narrows her selection criteria and foreshadows resin casting. Cost is legible: she forfeits GPS ease, embraces slower, ancestral navigation. No external antagonist needed—pressure is internal and accumulative, coherent under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through images, not sermon: layered glass, palimpsest names, cedar rings, ignored GPS all argue that transparency to history is the strongest structure. Final image of “turbine-song of time” reweights earlier simplicity mantra without stating a moral. Subtle counter-readings linger—does surfacing pasts erase present authorship?—adding complexity. One minor echo of prompt phrasing (“timewoven alliances”) is early enough to avoid final-paragraph thesis-violation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Maya’s sculptor-perception: wind “sings…with a low, mechanical hum,” paint fragments read as “translucent depths.” No head-hop; psychic distance tightens under storm pressure, then relaxes during reflection, mirroring tide rhythm. Diction is her tool-kit—she “scaffolds,” “reimagines,” “reads landscapes”—never drifting into writerly flourish. Dialogue absent, so voice evaluation is clean and internally coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “storm-tossed and defiant” packs motion + attitude in four words. Varied sentence lengths mimic surf surge; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. One strained metaphor “turbine’s steady roar” for rain is permitted under storm-heightened perception. Closure line “humming with the turbine-song of time itself” crystallizes earlier motif without overwriting—high information-to-word ratio sustained.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusing Victorian magic-lantern tech with post-st salvage sculpture feels fresh, avoids quirky-for-its-own-sake trap. Palimpsest names provide non-obvious lineage, transforming familiar “found-object” trope into trans-era mentorship. GPS obsolescence versus archaic navigation offers quiet conceptual repricing. Slight risk in accumulative structure rather than causal reversal keeps it just outside 9+ bonus band.</comment>
