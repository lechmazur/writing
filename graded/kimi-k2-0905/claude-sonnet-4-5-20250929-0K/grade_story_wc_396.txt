<comment>Maren’s seven-year survival as a shadow-laced peacekeeper is asserted not shown; the interior contradiction between absorbing darkness and remaining calm is implied but never embodied in a visible tremor or micro-choice under pressure. The moment she decides to “help people see themselves in the breath before choice” is a clean, earned pivot that forecloses Thomas’s fatal path and carries felt cost: the shadows in her flare with starlight, a visible price. Because the causal shift is tied to her prior flaw (knowing too much paralyzes) and lands on-page, the arc clears the 9+ quick test despite the early expositional telling.</comment>

<comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the mirrors progressively refract emotional history until a pattern break reweights Maren’s tactics. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—she renounces predictive certainty and embraces the fragile mirror-space of shared choice; the cost is the irreversible star-shot texture of the shadows she now carries. The lighthouse apples reflecting “two families remembering how to choose” crystallizes the new rule-set without moralizing. No causal gaps; orientation is anchored by word 70; escalation is the tightening density of glimpsed hinge-moments that force her stance shift.</comment>

<comment>The impossible apple trees rooting between sea and sky are not postcard color but a living constraint: their blossoms later mirror the families’ possible reconciliation, charging the final image. The fragment and vintage mirrors function as micro-setting that literally refracts choice; removing either would collapse the mechanics of empathy-mapping. Spatial choreography is flawless—Maren moves “between mirrors” while ice cracks below, the upward/downward vectors tightening breath-space. Sensory selection stays urgent: only visual and haptic detail (warm crystal) survive until the blossoms exhale a scent of thaw.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake: find the thread that dissolves Voss-Henriksen hatred without self-annihilation. Escalation is accumulative: each mirrored glimpse tightens the emotional archaeology until the revelation about Astrid reweights all prior grievances. The price is visibly legible—Maren’s shadows acquire starlight, a permanent texture that constrains future mediation. No reversal is required; the deepening of knowledge is the decisive intensification that forecloses Thomas’s nihilistic path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: empathy is not a future we see but a present space we hold for others to choose. The mirrored blossoms reprise the lighthouse apples, now re-priced as sites of possible choice rather than frozen symbols. Subtext operates in silence—no character ever speaks the word “forgiveness,” yet the final image of blossoms reflecting memory performs it. The ending refuses tidy moral symmetry; the cost stays in Maren’s star-shot shadows, acknowledging that peacekeeping wounds the keeper.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Maren’s perceptual filter: “watching ice crack and reform far below” is scientist-calm, matching her occupational detachment. Syntax lengthens under contemplation, then fragments when she lifts the shard—“light scattered across the silvered surfaces”—compressing breath-time. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction is judged internally: the diction remains spare, Nordic, salted with sea-cold nouns. The final sentence’s scattering light mirrors the opening image, a taught pattern that pays off without monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; no filter-verb clusters. Sentences do double duty—“Their roots somehow finding purchase in the rocky soil between sea and sky” seeds both setting and metaphor for later choice. Metaphors stay within optical/ice physics: scattering, refraction, bloom—no mixed vehicles. The final line’s “scattering it toward the sea” re-uses the title image without repetition, achieving cadence closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The peacekeeper who renounces foresight via antique mirrors is a fresh synthesis of oracle and mediator tropes; the crystal shard as empathy-prism is non-obvious and inevitable once revealed. Risk—using mirrors as literal emotional projector—pays off because the physics (light scatter) stays consistent with the world rule. The lighthouse orchard above ice is a singular image that cannot be relocated without breaking the story’s logic. Emotional specificity: grief as contested resource between families feels Nordic, not generic.</comment>
