<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The queen’s interior contradiction—scorning prophecy yet obeying her dreams—drives every step; her micro-choice to touch the bleeding starlight embodies both compulsion and self-interrogation. The final refusal to command the grotto, instead accepting witness, crystallizes a credible renunciation with felt cost: she descends “carrying the bleeding starlight inside her like a wound.” Secondary pressure is absent, so the 9+ gate is missed, but within single-POV the arc is complete and earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each image (cobalt stone drinking twilight, starlight that burns cold, fireflies as reversed stars) intensifies the dominant stake—self-witness at any price—until the final breath reweights her identity. Closure lands as Charged Poise: “She took one breath. Then another. And began the long climb back…”—a crystallized moment where future cost is undeniable. No orientation debt; spatial and temporal anchors are vivid within 120 words. Persistent constraint (the wound of starlight) shapes the return journey. Tiny causal hiccup: the oracle’s lacy menace is declared but not enacted, yet this is thematic, not plot-breaking.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The cobalt grotto itself functions as micro-setting that constrains the final choice: its bleeding walls force tactile confrontation and foreclose denial. Sensory hierarchy is character-specific—she notices copper-tasting air and starlight that “burned cold” because her body is the instrument of judgment. Spatial choreography is immaculate: ridge → mouth-like entrance → abyssal drop, each shift mirrored by internal descent. The fireflies’ impossible altitude season charges the surreal rule-set early, paid off at closure. Environment literally drips into her skin, charging the final image; thus the 9+ gate is met.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Single dominant stake—will she reclaim feeling at any cost?—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens through each accumulative image. The meaningful deepening occurs when starlight brands her: knowledge that she is both perpetrator and victim forecloses the option to remain numb. Price is visceral (cold burn, memory assault) and persists into descent. No external antagonist needed; internal pressure suffices. Agency resides in continuing to climb and finally accepting witness. Cost clarity is legible on the page; entering 8.8+ would require an external consequence that alters kingdom politics, which the scope intentionally withholds.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the image pattern: starlight as both wound and teacher, prophecy as self-fulfilling memory. No explicit thesis; meaning accrues through sensory particulars. Final image reconfigures prior material without moralizing—she carries the wound that might teach her to heal, inviting multiple readings (penance, awakening, endless recurrence). Subtextual menace stays lacy—never explained, always felt. Ambiguity is meaningful, not evasive. The piece avoids tidy moral calibration; the queen remains morally suspect, future uncertain. Thus resonance is earned, not asserted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited remains tight to the queen’s perceptual signature: “starlight bleeding through her fingers like wounds that wouldn't close” is a thought she could plausibly form. Diction is elevated yet internally consistent—mist, ember, cobalt, lacy menace—mirroring royal education under stress. Rhythm modulates: short sentences at apex (“She took one breath. Then another.”) echo cardiac cadence without drumbeat monotony. No dialogue, so voice purity is maintained. Elision of crown/guard details is purposeful compression, taught early. Unreliable potential (is the grotto real?) is seeded but not over-explained, keeping distance controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or interiority. Metaphors are coherent—starlight as wounds, grotto as mouth—without mixed-vehicle clutter. Information density high: “The ridge loomed ahead, its cobalt stone drinking the twilight” fuses setting, color, and agency in one stroke. Filter verbs minimal; perception rendered as action. Opening and closing lines anchor and resolve with imagistic punch. Micro-scaffold only: “She moved deeper” could be cut, but momentum is unimpeded. No artifact touches closure beat, satisfying 9+ threshold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fantasy trope—monarch confronts mystical cave—reinvented via psychological witness rather than quest object. Starlight that brands memory is fresh, avoiding standard prophecy mechanics. Specific detail: altitude-generated copper taste, reversed-star fireflies, lacy menace as tonal descriptor all feel singular. Conceptual risk: no external plot payoff, yet coherence holds. Transformation test fails if queen is generic ruler; here her calcified heart and gendered entitlement (“not her brother”) personalize the archetype. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight—of course the oracle’s warning was about self-recognition. Thus originality is earned, not decorative.</comment>
