<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is vivid—her hand “dances between control and surrender,” her chest “aches” at Marcus’s graying temples. The contradictory impulses (fear of honesty vs. need to speak) are dramatized in the physically precarious act of writing with living ink. The final gesture of joined hands crystallizes a credible, costly shift: she hazards permanent separation to regain trust. Only the “misplaced loyalty” motive is told once, not re-embodied, keeping this just outside the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens: the ink → confession → Varesh self-authenticating grammar → Marcus’s aloud test → rapprochement forms an unbroken because-chain. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“subterranean vault”) and the clock (“within the hour”). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the intact spoken paragraph proves honesty and reconfigures their future with the visible cost of imminent separation. The Varesh rule is persistent and constrains every tactical sentence she writes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The archive’s dust, lamplight on obsidian, and mineral scent are filtered through an obsessed linguist’s selective attention. The glass ink well functions as micro-setting: handled thrice, its prismatic flashes echo the “symphonies” and charge the final hand-link image. Spatial choreography is flawless—desk, stairs, parchment, hands track cleanly. Only the cavern-origin line feels like a museum tag; it doesn’t constrain present action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore trust before final departure—is signaled early. Escalation is single but meaningful: each looping Varesh clause tangibly raises the risk that one lie could “unsnarl” the entire apology. The tightening is internal yet legible as physical tension in her cramping hand. Cost is visible: Marcus’s graying, the imminent divergence, and the parchment that could have disintegrated under his voice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the conceit that truth can be engineered into grammar that self-punishes lies; no character ever articulates a moral. Subtext lives in gesture: the ink’s crystalline refractions mirror the fragile new understanding. The final image—hands meeting through scattered light—offers a non-literal answer: connection survives distance only if each “note” remains honest. No tidy moral, only a charged poise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Close-third lingers in a linguist’s perceptual signature: spines “contain fragments,” consonants are “harsh,” vowels “liquid.” Syntax lengthens during the compositional fugue, then shortens as Marcus arrives, mirroring heart-rate shifts. Free indirect style is pristine: “Too much caution would make her words sterile” is her judgment, not authorial exposition. No head-hop; Marcus’s interior is accessed only through observable widened eyes and cracked voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is varied; paragraph lengths create visual breaths. Information density is high—one sentence can layer ink origin, mineral scarcity, and Civilizational collapse. No mixed metaphors; the “symphony” conceit stays consistent. Occasional elevated diction—“prismatic refractions,” “orthography”—is justified by scholarly POV. Only minor scaffold: two adjacent “each” openers in paragraph 4, not repeated elsewhere.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The Varesh “symphonies of truth” invert the familiar trope of magical ink by making grammar the lie-detector, not the ink itself. The extinct language archive feels lived-in because Mira navigates it with tactile habit. The reconciliation plot is ancient, but the mechanism—writing a self-collapsing apology—feels inevitable yet fresh. Specific detail (pressure-marks, loops, mineral provenance) prevents abstraction. Risky structural choice to hinge climax on a parchment’s survival pays off.</comment>
