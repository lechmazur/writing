<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Cordelia’s “searching too” is declared, not dramatized; no contradictory impulse surfaces in-scene. The patrons remain ornamental—none pressure her or alter her tactics—so the relationship crucible is idle. The scarf warmth is the sole embodied cost, arriving as an effect rather than a choice. Interiority is atmospheric but not sharpened under pressure; she never risks failure or re-prioritizes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The accumulative/textural lens holds: each catalogued patron, book-form, and architectural quirk thickens the same question—where do stories live—until the scarf’s heat and the bending lamplight deliver a Charged Poise. Closure is legible: the library “breathes,” time re-geometries, a conceptual cost is felt. Orientation is clean by line 10; no prop teleport. The “reawaken” act is slightly abstract—no visible mechanics—but the image pool of bent lamplight satisfies the on-page reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The library itself is the micro-setting that constrains and finally reconfigures perception; shelves curve, corridors double back, external dimensions lie. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: Cordelia notices paper dust and lavender because her grandmother equation-scented letters made those smells knowledge-bearing. The prime-number hours and Poe/Lobachevsky 1889 pedigree are named only once and reused, satisfying proper-noun economy. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly—scarf-trail, shelf-perimeter, atrium desk—anchoring the hyperbolic walk.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“find the place where stories live”—is early and stable; escalation is density-driven rather than option-narrowing. No reversals or tangible losses occur; patrons do not interrupt or threaten failure. The only tightening is the atmosphere thickening and lamplight bending, which reweights perception but not tactics. Cost is conceptual, not visceral—acceptable under Accumulative lens but keeps score mid-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the concrete catalog of poetic-scientific hybrids and the scarf-as-topology-tool; no character sermonizes “stories have geometry.” The final image—library breathing, time folding—offers a non-literal answer without moral tag. Ambiguity is purposeful: is the pocket dimension real or shared hallucination? The emotional aftereffect is wonder grounded in paper dust, not abstraction. Only minor drift: the phrase “mathematics of wonder” flirts with thesis-statement but is single and early.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly glued to Cordelia’s perceptual filter: she traces equations with the scarf, notices paint-stained fingers, smells lavender. Syntax is controlled and varied—“treatises on thermodynamics rendered as sonnets” uses paraleipsis to imply breadth without catalog bloat. No head-hopping; graduate student’s whisper is reported from her awareness. Diction stays within a librarian-poet lexicon; no filter-verb stacks. The lyric lift of “analog memory more vivid than any photograph” is earned by prior object handling.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with the scene: longer, shelf-listing sentences for browsing quiet, then shorter clauses as air thickens. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new texture (paint-stained fingers, meteorological haiku). Metaphors are coherent—“pooled like water in hyperbolic curves” keeps liquid geometry consistent. Opening line anchors voice and concept simultaneously; final line resolves with image, not explanation. Only micro-slip: “the place where stories lived existed in the curved spaces” repeats “lived/existed,” but cadence is intentional.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The analog-vs-digital topology of memory, prime-number operating hours, and hyperbolic floor-plan synthesize into a fresh, non-obvious whole. The scarf as measuring line in non-Euclidean space is an elegant, story-specific invention. Risk is taken and paid off: a 2:47 AM library opening justified by “prime boundaries” could read gimmicky, but accumulative detail makes the rule feel lived-in. Transformation is high: remove any listed element and the conceptual repricing collapses. No close echoes of famous scenes; voice is singular.</comment>
