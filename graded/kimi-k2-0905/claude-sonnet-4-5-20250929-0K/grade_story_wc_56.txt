<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is concrete—her “refined-by-failure compass” and the brass warming in her palm—but the story over-articulates her shift to “understanding voids” with abstract echo (“she understood”). Earned endurance without visible body cost slightly tempers the arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: Mira’s stance crystallizes as she pockets the sundial, accepting the liminal invitation; conceptual cost is legible in the final image of “ordinary darkness.” Orientation anchor (canal deck, twilight) appears by ~90 words; lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of architectural misdirection holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Micro-setting (sundial, canal water) constrains choice when the brass warms and water glows, charging the closure. Selective sensory hierarchy—“half-light,” “brass face catching what little remained”—mirrors epistemic uncertainty without tourist overload.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—seeing the hidden architecture—tightens once: the glowing water reveals 3-D schematics, foreclosing literal monument hunting. Cost is felt (she photographs frantically) but external loss (tool, injury) absent; pressure coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of “negative architecture” emerges organically from canal glow and sundial diagrams; no final moralizing. Final image reweights earlier failures as necessary training; ambiguity between built and unbuilt cities lingers with charge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is sharp—twilight narrowed to “neither day nor night,” canal as “faithful emptiness.” Rhythm modulates: long reflective cadences crest into short reactive bursts (“The water began to glow.”) No head-hopping; lyric compression taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density—“sundial counterclockwise” ripples water, reveals diagrams, reweights premise in one line. Occasional elevated diction (“epistemic,” “conceptual”) fits scholar-quester but edges toward register drift; no mixed metaphors or loops. Final sentence breathes with elegaic parallelism.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Negative-space architecture as hidden truth feels fresh; transforms familiar “lost architect” trope into epistemic heist. Specificity of canal-aligned twilight cities grounds novelty; risk taken with lyric accumulative structure pays off in resonance.</comment>
