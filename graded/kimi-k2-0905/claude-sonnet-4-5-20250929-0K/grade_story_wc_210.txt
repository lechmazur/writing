<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Miranda’s interior contradiction—her contempt for easy remedies vs. her hunger to resurrect—drives every beat; the refusal to open the bottle is a credible renunciation with visible cost, foreclosing her old alchemist identity. Emotion stays embodied (“bottle grew warmer in her palm… pulsing like a heart”). Micro-choices (nightly return to the bottle, showing it to newcomers) keep agency alive. No second on-page character, so relationship/status bullets skipped; head-count irrelevant. The earned stasis lands cleanly, though the shift from lone exile to community leader is slightly telescoped.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each shard adds density to the “architecture of potential” until the lanterns physically relight. Closure is a Charged Poise—lanterns glow by human hands, not magic—reconfiguring the stake from solitary vision to shared labor. Cost is legible: Miranda abandons the guild paradigm forever. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) taught by line 3, no penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Setting is built from micro-details—torn rice paper breathing, worn dock grooves, spacing of lanterns—that constrain Miranda’s speculative reconstruction. The bottle functions as portable setting, its amber interior refracting blueprints that literally shape her design choices. Final image of lanterns relit by hand re-weights the atmospheric tone from ghostly to generative. Spatial choreography stays clean across the four shard transitions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Single dominant stake: can anything authentic rise from wish-parasitized ruins? Pressure tightens when Miranda realizes the bottle is a mirror, not a key—foreclosing the easy alchemist shortcut. Escalation is textural: each night adds density to her reconstructed town until others arrive to test the vision. Cost is visible: she trades guild certainty for ambiguous communal labor.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: resurrection demands honest memory, not magical forgetting. Subtext runs through the bottle-as-mirror motif—closed vessel = refusal of consumption. Final image re-prices the concept: light is earned, not wished for. No moralizing paragraph; resonance is imagistic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Miranda’s perceptual signature: she notices “architecture of something that had never been built” and reads grooves as “rhythm of trade.” Syntax compresses under pressure (“wishes were parasites”). No dialogue, so no voice-contamination risk. Prose rhythm mirrors alchemical cadence—measured, iterative, then quietly incandescent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often does three jobs (ex: “paper lanterns still swayed on rusted hooks, their torn rice paper fluttering like the breathing of something long dead” = atmosphere, metaphor, time stamp). No filter-verb stacks or mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated diction (“speculative reconstruction”) is voice-motivated for an alchemist. Final line lands with imaginal punch, no scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fusion of alchemical exile + sealed bottle + ghost-town revival feels specific and inseparable; swap elements and the story collapses. Fresh angle: resurrection via refusal to consume magic. Risk—quiet lyric ending without confrontation—pays off by re-weighting light itself. Minor deduction for faint echoes of “revival through collective memory” tropes, but local detail keeps it particular.</comment>
