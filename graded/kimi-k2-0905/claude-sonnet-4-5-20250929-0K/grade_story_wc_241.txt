<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maya’s contradictory impulses—mathematical certainty vs. craving meaning in graffiti—are dramatized in the notebook/condensation beats. The hospital-bracket prop keeps her father present without flashback. The final micro-choice (leaving for the hospital) is small but earned: lantern-glimpsed “WIDEN YOUR VIEW” converts intellectual slogan into embodied next step. Cost is modest—no new risk is specified—so the arc tops out at mid-7.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the negative-space letters re-weight her koan-reading, making “probability = possibility” a usable stance toward her father. Causal chain (symbols → lantern distortion → negative space → widened view) is tight and on-page. Library-to-hospital exit supplies visible pivot with felt social cost—she must face the man she almost wrote off. Meets 9+ cost test; lens is cleanly Causal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rain-soaked library island, candle-mica amber, and condensation canvas are selective, sense-driven, and filtered through Maya’s probability gaze. Skylight drip and “liquid shadow” steer her melancholy without announcing metaphor. Micro-setting (mica pane) literally refracts the clue that re-weights stakes, satisfying 9+ constraint requirement. Spatial choreography is steady; only one clock cue (“late sunlight”) but sufficient.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to relate to a still-living, self-destructive father—is signaled early and tightened once: from detached calculation to reopened possibility. The lantern beat narrows options by forcing a choice between continued abstraction and present engagement. Cost is legible—she forfeits emotional distance she had weaponized for safety. No external antagonist needed; internal contradiction supplies adequate pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: pattern vs. randomness, forgiveness without forgetting. Koan and negative-space reveal subvert her lecture-honed certainty without moralizing. Final image (“soft and persistent as clover”) reweights melancholy from burden to medium for growth—Conceptual Repricing with emotional cost. No thesis statements intrude; meaning stays implicit in gesture and light.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays pinned to Maya’s perceptual quirks—numbers, probabilities, condensation writing. Syntax lengthens under reflection, shortens during lantern discovery, mirroring cognitive dilation. No dialogue to test voice distinction, but interior diction remains consistent with academic-turned-seeker mindset. Mica distortion metaphor is repeated just enough to feel like obsession, not loop.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; most sentences dual-task (e.g., “yellow light in a sea of grey June water” sets season, mood, isolation). One scaffold pair: “She’d just calculated…moved forward” restates prior beat. Figurative control strong except minor mixed vehicle (“melancholy felt alive, growing like clover through cracks in her certainty”)—organic but slightly over-cute. No artifacts near closure; momentum holds.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh angle: probability professor reads subway graffiti as stochastic parables to metabolize parental addiction. Koan + negative-space reveal feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk is moderate—quiet epiphany rather than grand reversal—but coherent. Could swap “clover” for another plant without breaking arc, capping score below 8.5.</comment>
