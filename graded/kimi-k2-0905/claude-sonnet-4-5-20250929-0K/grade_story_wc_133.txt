<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The painter’s insomnia is more observed than lived; we watch her “stay awake” rather than feel the fraying. Her artistic motive is stated early (“to thresh meaning from experience”) and returns at closure, but the only on-page choice is to keep following rain trails—already what she was doing. Marcus supplies most of the lore; her interior contradiction surfaces only in the final cave beat, giving the arc a late, thin agency. Still, the final image of the brooch against her heart crystallizes an earned endurance, satisfying the Earned Stasis test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the rain-trail pattern and brooch converge in a Conceptual Repricing—memory replaces mysticism, insomnia becomes communion. Causality is loose (Accumulative/Textural lens): rain → brooch → prints → insight; no reversal, but density and cadence reweight the stake. Orientation is swift; only one transition (studio→cave) and geography stay coherent. Cost is felt in the final canvas/image rather than a lost option, meeting the CR bar.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Skellig Minor is sketched with spare, sensory strokes—tidal causeway, limestone grooves, ochre handprints—each filtered through the painter’s eye. The amber brooch functions as micro-setting: handled twice, lit differently each time, charging the final image. Weather and tide constrain movement and timing; the cave pool mirrors stars, tightening the convergence. No spatial drift; bodies and props track cleanly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—extract meaning from chaos—arrives early; pressure tightens when rain trails keep delivering artifacts instead of answers. No antagonist; tension is epistemological. The single meaningful deepening occurs in the cave where handprints collapse time, forcing acceptance of cyclical rather than transcendent meaning. Cost is conceptual (mysticism lost) rather than tactical, but legible under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: art as memory’s archaeology, not revelation. The rain trails, brooch, and ochre prints form a silent triptych of human pattern-making across millennia. No character sermonizes; the final canvas is the moral act. Ambiguity lingers—communion or self-soothing?—inviting re-reading without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-limited painter POV holds; perception is color- and texture-obsessed, syntax lengthens under fatigue, then fractures into shorter clauses in the cave. No dialogue tags or dialect, but Marcus’s diction is drier, more utilitarian, creating subtle vocal contrast. No filter-verb clog; metaphors are painterly (“trapped sun,” “neurons across mudflats”) yet grounded in her palette. Final image cadence slows to match dawn hush, earning Charged Poise.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is lean and image-dense; each sentence moves (description → implication → next step). No synonym loops or template cadence; only one paraphrase pair (“convergence…convergences”) but it serves thematic echo. Figurative language is selective and paid off: rain-as-neurons returns as star-mirror neurons in the pool. Tense stable, pronoun clean, opening and closing lines book-end with luminous precision.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Post-apocalyptic trope is refreshed by micro-climate logistics (twice-daily tides, water reclamation station) and an artist-protagonist who converts survival insomnia into method. Rain trails as neural map is an unfamiliar metaphoric engine; amber brooch as prehistoric trade-token resists cliché. Conceptual risk—mysticism collapses into memory—pays off without ironic undercut. Specificity of ochre handprints saves the piece from generic eco-fable.</comment>
