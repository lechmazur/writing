<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lena’s interior contradiction—methodical restorer vs. dream-driven seeker—surfaces early and drives the final choice to keep the fresco exposed, paying the cost of professional risk. The “methodically playful” trait is shown through tactile micro-choices (coin pocketing, gentle tap) rather than labels. Yet the twin/doppelgänger beat is delivered as static image, not an active test of identity, so the arc’s emotional crest feels under-complicated for 9+ terrain.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Lena refuses to seal the discovery, accepting unquantifiable professional cost; the lens is Accumulative/Textural—each layer reweights her stance rather than forcing causal reversals. Pattern is taught by 25% (sound-garden → mural vibration → nested image) and coheres in the final breathing fresco. Orientation is clean within 120 words; no teleporting props or causal breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sound-wave garden’s parabolic dishes and bronze chimes are returned to twice, constraining attention and finally making the exposed fresco “breathe,” satisfying the 9+ gate. Pigment chemistry, scaffolding height, and coin crack give tactile anchors; spatial choreography remains coherent. Selective sensory economy (sound over visual catalog) mirrors Lena’s narrowing perception under mystery.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—professional certainty vs. epistemic curiosity—tightens when the hollow wall sound forecloses the safe route of reporting; the price (possible censure, dream recursion) is legible. Pressure accumulates through reflected sound and nested images rather than causal reversals, fitting the Accumulative lens. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length; no coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through the accruing layers: knowledge as sleep, questioning as wakefulness. The final image of continuing restoration without covering the hand reconfigures the stake without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers—will she wake again tomorrow inside the same dream—creating resonant after-effect. No thesis statements intrude; meaning is carried by the gold-leaf aphorism charged with cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays strictly inside Lena’s perceptual filter; diction (“methodically playful,” “pigment shift”) belongs to a restorer’s idiom. Rhythm modulates from long observational sentences to clipped discoveries, mirroring rising uncanniness. No head-hopping or register drift; even the architect’s intent is inferred through Lena’s guesswork, keeping psychic distance modest and consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—action, atmosphere, and thematic echo—without paraphrase loops. Figurative language is spare and tied to craft: “conversation with the dead artist,” “nested like Russian dolls,” avoiding mixed metaphors. One scaffold risk: “vibrations that shouldn’t exist in dead pigment” edges toward poetic overwrite but is anchored in tactile surprise and justified by POV. Final paragraph breathes rather than explains, sustaining momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fusing sound-art installation with mural archaeology feels non-obvious; the hobo nickel’s carved wanderer becomes a tactile quest hook rather than quirky ornament. Nested awakening concept is recursive yet emotionally grounded in vocational risk. Specificity of conservation practice (crack documentation, gold leaf underlayer) counters generic urban-fantasy portals. Risk-taking lies in the lyric loop of dream-within-dream that could collapse into gimmick but holds via earned cost.</comment>
