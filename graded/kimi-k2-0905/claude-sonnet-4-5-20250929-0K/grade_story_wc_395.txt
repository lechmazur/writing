<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elena’s “brightly attentive” trait is dramatized in her noticing 1408 everywhere and in her tactile handling of the patch; the final self-upload is a credible renunciation driven by the same obsession. Interiority stays concrete (“hollow where something vast…carved out space”). No second on-page character, so relationship crucible unused; the flaw is a mild competence imbalance—she cracks an 18-layer vault too easily, blunting struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the patch’s materialization and her decision to “archive herself” reweight the rule-set with unmistakable cost. Accumulative lens holds: 1408 pattern, patch reprise, and song motif tighten into the final image. Orientation clean by line 5; causality intact—each discovery (patch → voice files → self-upload) is a because/therefore step. Minor waiver: the 18-layer encryption yields without resistance, a contrived beat that slightly erodes earned entry.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The archive’s “ghost-light” and degrading photos act as micro-setting that constrains her access and mirrors her own fading. Sensory selection is POV-driven: she notices holographic timelines and static edges, not tech specs. The patch functions as recurring object-as-setting, charging the final image when it “materializes in her palm.” Spatial choreography stays clean—no floating cameras or impossible reaches.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—find the disappeared—tightens when 1408 pattern proves invitation, not glitch, forcing her to choose reportage or transcendence. One meaningful deepening: voice files reveal crew uploaded, narrowing her option to join. Cost is conceptual but legible: she forfeits corporeal life for data-immortality. Agency is internal (decision to upload) yet final; coincidence only complicates earlier, never resolves.</question>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges without sermon: digital afterlife as siren call, the cost of perfect memory. 1408 and patch move from clues to invitation, reweighting meaning at close. Subtext in “sensed absence” and “hollow” implies bereavement technology can’t name. Final image—archive room auto-populates file #18—offers quiet, non-literal answer: memory keeper becomes memory.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person intimate stays locked to Elena; perceptual signature vivid (“ghost-light,” “mathematical residue”). Compressions like “archive…hummed” and “photons and projection” teach the lyric pattern early. No dialogue, so no register clash. Rhythm accelerates across shards (“At 2 AM…”) then crystallizes in short final sentences. Filter verbs rare; diction within POV lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm; sentence openings vary. Occasional elevated phrasing—“sensed absence,” “conceptual Repricing” moment—verges on register drift but stays consistent with corporate-archivist voice. One paraphrase loop: “spaces between deletion and oblivion” echoed twice in adjacent para. No mixed metaphors; no scaffold in closure beat. High info density; each line adds pattern or image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fusion of vanished-users trope with memetic-upload transcendence feels fresh; patch-as-breadcrumb reverses usual relic-commemoration. Corporate-archive micro-setting particularizes the concept. 1408 not just Easter-egg but invitation code—earned in hindsight. Risk in digital-ghost story is high, but specificity (voice files of ancient song) prevents cliché. Could swap names, yet core upload-or-refuse arc would still need Elena’s observant flaw—moderate transformation.</comment>
