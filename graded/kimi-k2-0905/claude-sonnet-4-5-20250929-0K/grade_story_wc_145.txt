<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Mira’s vocation-driven obsession is sharply particularized through her condensation reading and atlas-fixing memories; the quietly contradictory impulse between empirical rigor and mythic hunger is dramatized in her decision to drill. Petrov functions mainly as sounding board, so relationship pressure is thin, yet her “subtly confident” stance visibly costs her warmth and alliance, foreclosing the safe path of mere reporting. Micro-choices—tracing the glass, photographing the vanishing pattern—embody motive without label-speak. The falcon loop and satellite data justify competence while the final solitude shows the price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure is a solid Charged Poise: Mira steps onto the ice in full knowledge that the lake will “know” and the atlases will burnish her discovery, so meaning is re-weighted with embodied risk; the cost is the solitude and the outpost left behind. Causal chain runs cleanly: because the ice has retreated, because she edited discrepancies, therefore she now drills—no convenient amnesia. Orientation (who/where/when) lands by line 5. Mosaic design (two shards) is taught early and holds. Lens stays Accumulative/Textural; condensation pattern provides the single intensifier that escalates and crystallizes at exit.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is more than postcard: the outpost’s rust, the glass pane as reading surface, the ice thickness dictating drill timing all constrain action. Falcon, beacon, phrasebook supply micro-setting texture that loops into plot. Sensory hierarchy remains Mira-centric—she cares about moisture geometry more than vistas, so detail is filtered through vocation. Frozen lake reappears in the final image as the cost surface she must cross, charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>A single dominant stake—prove the single source—threads from paragraph 1 and tightens when the condensation affirms the falcon’s vector. Escalation is modest but sufficient for 700-word span: confirmation shifts the stakes from theory to bodily risk visible in the final tread onto the ice. No external antagonist needed; pressure is internalized obsession plus environmental danger. Cost is paid in the outpost abandonment and the implicit frost peril—visible on the last line “older than cartography itself.”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: maps are human approximations, ice is the unedited archive; truth demands surrender to solitude and cold. There’s no overt thesis statement—final image is the lake waiting to be tasted, an aporia instead of morality. Subtext lives in condensation as palimpsest and in Petrov’s “ghosts” accusation that lingers unanswered. The emotional after-effect is a chill awareness that knowledge is never neutral—it costs caretakers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is tight third locked on Mira; no head-hop. Petrov’s dialogue shows slight Slavic cadence and mild evasion (“You think you’ve found it.”) distinct from Mira’s clipped hydrology register. Internal diction remains within her editorial perceptual signature—circles within circles, tributary maps—without academic inflation. Rhythm breathes with scene: shorter sentences during the exit, longer ruminative ones while tracing glass, mirroring her pulse.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>High information density: breath patterns double as map metaphors, ice age as historiography. Figurative layering is controlled—condensation as oracle is seeded early and paid off in the exit image. No filter-verb stacks, no synonym loops; varied syntax avoids drumbeat. Opening and closing lines are propulsive, each doing double duty (anchor voice + stake; resolve action + thematic reverb).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Core premise—global rivers spring from one hidden lake—flirts with myth, but grounded in climate-expose logistics and atlas fact-checking, giving freshness. Fusion of cartographer protagonist with retreating-ice reveal feels non-obvious; atlases as palimpsest is smart thematic inversion. Risk is moderate: quiet speculative earth-science rather than save-the-world stakes. Specificity of condensation divination and falcon telemetry rescues concept from abstraction.</comment>
