<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is concrete—her trembling hand on the key, the warmth of brass—but the “budding rune scholar” trait is told more than dramatized; no rune is ever read aloud or mis-translated under pressure. The final smile-and-notes moment is too tidy; we don’t feel the cost of re-opening the island’s day-cycle on her body or beliefs. Still, her micro-choices (insert key, realign orrery arms) track cleanly with motive.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the luminous noon-shadow web reframes the whole premise, felt cost is the irreversible surrender of perpetual night. Causal lens holds: key→orrery→dawn is a clean because/therefore chain. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) lands by word 80; no penalty. One minor slack: the “ancient equations” tethering the isle are asserted but never shown to fail or strain, so the stakes leap is slightly abstract.</comment>

<comment>The floating nocturnal observatory is more than postcard: its frozen gears, brass telescope, and stone foundation each constrain Mira’s next tactile move. Micro-setting triumph is the keyhole shaped exactly like the key’s teeth—an environmental detail that literally unlocks the climax. Spatial choreography stays clean as Mira moves from telescope to journal to orrery. Only gap: we get no sensory cue for how the isle “feels” when daylight returns—no temperature lift, wind shift, or weight change.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—“where do shadows go?”—is signaled early and tightens into “can I reopen the island’s day-cycle?” The single meaningful deepening occurs when Mira realizes the observatory itself must remember; this narrows her tactic from observation to mechanical realignment. Cost is conceptual not visceral—loss of safe eternal night—but the image of luminous threads makes it legible. No secondary pressure (antagonist, dwindling resource) keeps it just shy of 8+.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of “relearning as awakening” emerges through the orrery’s reboot and shadow-transfiguration, never stated. The spoon-bend is left unexplained, preserving productive ambiguity. Final image reweights prior night-bound imagery without moralizing. Minor deduction for the phrase “sealed awakenings” appearing verbatim near start—too prompt-echoey.</comment>

<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays strictly inside Mira’s perceptual filter: brass warmth, rune-etched teeth, “quietly deliberate” cadence mirrored in controlled syntax. No head-hopping. Diction is scholarly-steampunk—“orrery,” “zenith,” “luminous threads”—but stays within her lexicon. Rhythm tightens at climax: three short sentences mimic the key’s final turns. Filter verbs (“she sensed”) are minimal and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and high-density; sentences carry dual duty (action + world-rule). No scaffold loops; metaphors are consistent (clockwork, light, loops). One mixed metaphor blip: “shadows…trapped between existence and transcendence” is abstract, but it’s isolated. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line crystallizes image. Copy is clean: no tense drift, typo, or simultaneity error.</comment>

<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>“Spoons bend reality” could be twee, but here it’s a single off-screen rupture that seeds the entire cosmology; never explained, never mocked. The inversion—shadows don’t disappear, they become connective tissue at noon—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risk taken: entire world pivots on a key-in-orrery moment, yet tension holds. Specificity of brass key teeth and frozen orrery gears keeps it from feeling like generic clockpunk.</comment>
