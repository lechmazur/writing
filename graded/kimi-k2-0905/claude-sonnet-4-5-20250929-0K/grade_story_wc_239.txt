<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Kael’s interiority is vivid—“time fold around her like origami”—and her walking-unify choice anchors the arc, but the “end of history witness” role is asserted, not dramatized; no contradictory impulse tests her training. The dictionary, spiral, and Hiccup act on her more than she acts on them, so agency feels ornamental rather than costly. The final stasis is beautiful but not earned by prior micro-choices that foreclose alternatives.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural lens is declared early—“seventeen dimensions,” “probability’s shadow”—and closure lands cleanly with Conceptual Repricing: the universe’s laughter reweights all prior illusion talk. Orientation is taught, not anchored; causality is lyrical, not sequential, but the pattern holds. The cost is felt—“she was no longer entirely herself”—yet the紧缩 is diffuse because the tightening spirals are described, not decisionally experienced.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The library is rendered with tactile specificity: helical shelves, translucent dictionary pages, whispering air. Environment and object (dictionary, spiral floor) physically constrain motion and perception, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; each spiral turn is tracked. The “resounding hush” tone is maintained through selective auditory and proprioceptive detail, never static backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“observe without flinching”—is signaled early, but pressure is atmospheric, not tactical; the Hiccup arrives as scheduled, not as a cost she risks. No live option is foreclosed; the unify choice is inevitable rather than a narrowing. Escalation is poetic density, not rising cost; the final laughter is resonance, not consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through recurring image-spiral of word, walk, cosmos—without thesis statement. Final laughter reweights “illusion vs truth” into infinite perspective, achieving Conceptual Repricing. Subtext lives in silence and spiral motion; no character articulates the moral. The mystery lingers, but abstract vocabulary (“cosmic illusion,” “infinite utterance”) nudges toward pseudo-profundity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited hovers at lyric distance; diction—“origami of centuries,” “wanderingly exact”—is consistent, poetic, and POV-plausible. No head-hop; psychic distance compresses under Hiccup without syntax fracture. Filter verbs are minimal; perceptual signature is cosmic-scale yet body-rooted. Rhythm modulates with walking cadence; dialogue absent, so no voice contamination.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence length breathes with spiral motion. Information density high—“manuscripts that documented civilizations that would exist, had existed, or existed only in probability’s shadow.” No loops or synonym churn; metaphors (“origami,” “black hole”) stay physically coherent. Occasional elevated register (“resounding hush,” “conceptual repricing”) is voice-motivated. Final line is crisp, propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The spiral-arbitration cosmology fuses Buddhist walking meditation, Borgesian library, and Big Crunch eschatology into an inevitable, specific vision. Risky lyric structure is taught early and paid off in closure laughter. Tropes—timeless library, chosen witness—are reforged through physical spiral practice and dictionary-as-void. Conceptual integrity never blinks; freshness survives the transformation test.</comment>
