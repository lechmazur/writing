<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The oracle’s obsession with endings is shown through lived memory and shapes every beat; her interiority stays concrete, never drifting into label-speak. The commander’s doubt and growing dependence under the ambered hush are embodied in micro-gestures rather than stated emotion. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, keeping the score just shy of the 9-band.

<comment>Closure lands cleanly: the commander’s silent acceptance of a map drawn from absences is a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights the premise with felt cost. The pattern of three silences is taught early and pays off in the final cadence, satisfying Accumulative/Textural lens rules. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within the first 120 words; the deliberate early disorientation of “only one star” later charges the closure image, so no penalty applied.

<comment>The fort’s ambered hush, the flaking booklet, and the dying star are returned as charged objects that constrain the commander’s final stance. Sensory selection narrows to immediacies—salt-stiff robes, guttering star—mirroring the collapse of known geography. Spatial choreography stays clean as the oracle moves from gate to map table to exit. Professional detail is not required, so no deduction.

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—how to navigate after the last star—signals in sentence two and tightens through three silences that foreclose speech as a tactic. The oracle’s agency is narrative rather than physical; her retelling-by-silence forces the commander’s stance crystallization without offering new external options. Cost is conceptual (navigation through nothing) rather than visceral, capping eligible high-band entry at 8.4.

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: navigation through negation, meaning made from withheld speech. The booklet’s gold flakes, the ambered hush, and the star’s extinction form a returning set of particulars that reconfigure in the final image. No moral is asserted; the reader is left to feel the cost of steering by absence. Quiet ending is earned, resonance unmistakable.

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Lyrical third-person stays close to oracle POV with controlled psychic distance; diction (“pebble-shore,” “ambered hush,” “topology of hope deferred”) is specific and internally consistent. Rhythm modulates—long cadences for rising silence, clipped fragments for the commander’s doubt—without falling into template drumbeat. Compression and elision are taught by line two and remain legible at closure.

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally; no paraphrase loops or synonym churn detected. Metaphors (“flaking gold leaf booklet… like captured sunlight”) stay coherent and physically plausible. High information density: single lines deliver sensory, thematic, and plot data simultaneously. No artifact touches the closure beat; prose propulsion remains clean.

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The oracle who maps by cataloguing silence and the commander who steers by absences offer a fresh synthesis of post-catastrophe navigation. Premise commits fully to the inversion that landmarks are voids; conceptual integrity never retreats. Specificity of “pebble-shore childhood” and “topography of hope deferred” makes the concept indivisible from this story. Risk distinction applies (+0.3) for using negative space as cartography without losing clarity.
