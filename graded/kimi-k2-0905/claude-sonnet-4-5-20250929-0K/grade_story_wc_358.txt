<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is concrete—her father’s patch grounds memory and motive—but her on-page choices are largely observational. The decisive shift from “investigate past” to “survey future” is stated, not dramatized through a visible micro-choice that costs her something now. Competence is credibly limited by respirator alarms and fog, yet the emotional price of foresight remains conceptual rather than embodied. The patch reprise at the end supplies symbolic weight, yet the absence of a charged renunciation or immediate risk keeps the arc just shy of high-band earned cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: container spiral → narcotic cloud → silent town → global warning. Orientation is crisp within 60 words; space and stakes stay legible. The midpoint tightening—Chen’s manifest reveal—narrows the threat from anomaly to systemic convergence, foreclosing the option to treat this as a one-off accident. Closure lands as conceptual repricing: Mara transmits data, cranes dismantle the labyrinth, wind runs clean; the cost is the indefinite, unending survey she now carries—felt but not yet paid—satisfying the CR bar.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Port container geometry is kinesthetically mapped: rust streaks, chemical residue, wind currents that “shouldn’t exist at sea level.” The labyrinth actively channels wind and choice—every turn alters velocity readings, forcing Mara to adapt routes. Tool-as-setting (anemometer array) constrains motion; the father’s patch micro-props emotional history. Final image—clean wind toward the sea—recharges the earlier foul breeze, completing environment-driven arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Dominant stake—prevent repetition of mass unconsciousness—tightens when manifest data proves global shipping algorithms can breed new “singular convergences.” Agency is investigative, not intervening, yet the decision to transmit findings before the labyrinth is fully dismantled carries implicit professional risk. Cost is prospective rather than immediate, keeping pressure just below the 8.8 gate that demands a visceral price on this page. Still, the tightening forecloses the comforting illusion of locality; future catastrophe becomes live option.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges: disasters are not random but the emergent architecture of unexamined systems. Subtext operates through spatial metaphor—containers as chess pieces, wind as invisible agency—avoiding overt thesis. Final image reweights the father’s dictum: foresight is endless redesign, not retrospective understanding. Resonance is cerebral; absence of a body-level cost keeps it from top-band poignancy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person tight filters every detail through Mara’s professional gaze—velocity, chemical streaks, manifest codes. Syntax flexes with pressure: clipped clauses when alarms scream, longer cadences when fog “turns amber.” No head-hopping; Chen’s dialogue is utilitarian, keeping Mara’s perceptual signature dominant. Diction stays within investigator lexicon; only “hazy precision” drifts toward lyric, but the phrase is motif-taught early and reprised at closure, justifying the lift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm mirrors wind: short gusts (“She moved. Documented. Adapted.”) against longer accumulation clauses. High density—each line carries sensor data, spatial note, or memory cue—without purple overload. Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stake cleanly, achieving propulsion that serves the conceptual repricing ending.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: container ports as atmospheric engines, shipping algorithms as accidental bioterrorists. Details are irreplaceable—spiral wind math, salt-spray chemistry, manifest convergence window—grounding speculative infrastructure in lived procedure. Risk is taken: no villain, only system drift, yet causality remains legible. The concept reweights familiar father-grief trope into systems-thinking inheritance, satisfying transformation test.</comment>
