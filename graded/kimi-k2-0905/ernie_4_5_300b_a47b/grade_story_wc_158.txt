<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lira’s interior contradiction—writing as both shield and hoped-for bridge—is vivid and embodied. The centuries-long arc is compressed into lyrical summary, so the micro-choices that would make each tonal shift fully legible are elided; still, her trembling hands and the sleeping/not-sleeping toggle give enough corporeal cost to earn the final renunciation. The flaw: we are told the insomnia “faded” rather than shown the exact beat where surrender costs her something visible. Fits Accumulative lens; character depth sustains mood, but lacks one crystallized decision under pressure that would punch into 8+ band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is a legitimate Resonant Reconfiguration: the tree’s wild chorus crystallizes the “blossom armistice” concept and lets Lira relinquish sleeplessness; cost is felt in the iridescent seed’s irreplaceable absence. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of poems, songs, glowing moss—pattern taught early, cadence shift at blooming tree. The centuries montage risks mild orientation drift, but migratory shell and postcard re-anchors keep it legible. One soft spot: “insomnia faded” is asserted, not dramatized; a sharper micro-beat of her eyelids closing against her own earlier vow would have nailed causality and lifted it into 9+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Bioluminescent shell, kelp postcard, reef-shadowed tides—every sense is filtered through Lira’s poet-perception; tactile salt-slick under her palms constrains the moment she steps outside. Spatial choreography is clean across migrations; no impossible geography. The gargantuan shell functions as both house and pilgrim vessel, its slowly lumbering journey tightening the stakes of dispersing poems—environment directly shapes tactic. Minor over-egging in “captured starlight moss” but overall economy holds; meets 9- gate by charging final image with glowing tree grown from shell floor.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</question><comment>Dominant stake—will poetry remain a shield or become a bridge—remains coherent; escalation happens via density: verses left in tide pools, songs carried farther by wind, until tree sprouting forces the stance change. Agency is present in the choice to plant the seed, yet the centuries-long summary blurs incremental costs; we feel cumulative weight more than each because/therefore notch. No explicit price paid on-page until planting moment, but “seed pulsing with light she’d never dared name” supplies conceptual cost. Sufficient for 600-word lyric mode; one more tactile forfeiture mid-journey would secure 8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: art as photosynthesis of sorrow into beauty, refracted through marine imagery—no thesis clunk. The postcard’s nebula and final constellation-tree reweight each other without moralizing. Ambiguity is preserved: truce does not erase pain, it lets pain and dawn coexist, a nuanced stance. Final sentence offers Charged Poise—song released, reef listening—resonant, non-literal answer to central question. Docked 0.3 because “blossom armistice” is named twice; once in postcard, once in narration, slightly echoing prompt language instead of purely subtextual bloom.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lush yet disciplined: reef-shadow joy, off-key wind, “bruises beneath her eyes” show poet-perception without purple overload. Rhythm modulates—long breathless sentences for insomnia, clipped fragments when seed is planted. No head-hop; single POV stable across centuries. Distinct perceptual signature notices algae ink and salt-slick under same gaze. Compression taught early (“margins of her own exhaustion”) and paid off at tree chorus. One hairline slip: “quiet, shyly unstoppable certainty” borders label-speak, but context and cadence rescue it; keeps 9- gate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Read-aloud rhythm: varied sentence openings, no template cadence; information layered (migration = poem dispersion = seed). Metaphors consistent—tides, stars, blossoms—no mixed vehicles. Only two paraphrase loops (“centuries of longing” echoed) but they accrue thematic weight, not pads. No filter-verb stacks; strong subject-verb drive. Line-level artifacts absent in closure beat. Clean copy, no typos. High-band control; the lyric repetition is intentional pattern, not scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: insomnia poet inside migratory nautilus house, poems as spores—specific, not checker-list quirky. Turns on “blossom armistice,” a phrase that could feel workshop-forced yet here gains biological reality via seed. Coral-abyss setting keeps whimsy tethered to ecosystem logic. Risk of centuries montage is taken; payoff in choral tree earns inevitability. No close echoes of famous scenes; DNA feels original. Meets 9- quick test minus 0.2 because the postcard’s “pressed kelp” echoes eco-steampunk trope, slightly familiar.</comment>
