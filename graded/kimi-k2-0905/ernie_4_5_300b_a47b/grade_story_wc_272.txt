<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—painting ghosts while despising tarot’s “pretense of fate”—is concrete from the first paragraph and drives every micro-choice (tearing the Hanged Man, weaving threads). Embodied stress shows in smudged glasses, rib-ache, candle flame reflected in the portrait’s eyes. The shift from passive cataloguer to active re-weaver is earned: grandmother’s loom memory plus present claustrophobia force the redesign, paying the price of abandoning paint for thread. Crestfallenness is shown through client abandonment and city indifference, not label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the threads pulse, portrait breathes, lighthouse sighs—undeniable conceptual cost that reweights the premise from “fragments are lies” to “fragments can be rewoven.” Lens is Accumulative/Textural: repeated image-pattern (thread, card, lens-less tower) intensifies until the cadence shift at the top of the stairs crystallizes meaning. Causality holds: each collage act (tearing card, ink from crushed tarot, thread bridge) is because/therefore linked to rising claustrophobia. Orientation is anchored by 120 words (lamp, salt-rot, tarot box), no debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The library-as-lighthouse hybrid is vivid and selective: humidity-warped spines, stolen lens gap, salt-rotted wood—each detail filters through Elias’s painterly eye and constrains later action (no lens → interior gaze). Micro-setting objects—tarot box turned palette, thread snagged in box crack—function as tactile terrain that alters tactics. Spatial choreography is clean: ascending spiral staircase, spreading threads at the top, candle casting elongate shadows. Weather (salt air) is integrated into ink glow, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: escape fragmentation or be crushed by it. Pressure tightens once: walls literally close, forcing the climb and thread-web ritual. Cost is visible—artist trades paint for thread, destroys tarot icon, stakes portrait at center—foreclosing old method. Accumulative escalation suffices; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete arc: “fragments as lies” → “fragments as weave-able.” Subtext sits in silent objects: torn VII of Swords (thief of meaning) vs. reclaimed grandmother thread. Final image—“we’re all just waiting to be rewoven”—is Conceptual Repricing, not moralizing; it reweights prior scattered cards and lost client into hopeful cohesion. No prompt-echo platitudes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: painterly noticing (fading grain of card, luminescent ache) and rhetorical questions as stress-tics. Rhythm modulates: longer reflective sentences in library, staccato ascent on stairs. No dialogue, so voice remains pure interior; diction stays within smudged-glasses introvert lexicon. Compression (“crestfallen portrait artist”) is taught early and paid off in final smile.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences fuse action, metaphor, atmosphere (“He dipped his brush into a jar of ink made from crushed tarot cards”). No loops or scaffold; metaphors are coherent (thread as bridge, darkness as canvas). Read-aloud rhythm breathes with climb. Only minor flirtation with purple (“luminescent ache”) but it’s motivated by painter POV and charges closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: tarot destruction + lighthouse library + thread-loom ancestry. Risk of collage chaos is controlled by tight Accumulative pattern. Transformation test fails if relocated—specificity of forgotten maritime library and portrait-for-ghosts trade is irreplaceable. Not earth-shattering novelty, but angle feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
