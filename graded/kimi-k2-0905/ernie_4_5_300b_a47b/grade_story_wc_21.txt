<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara’s archivist identity is embodied through ink-stained fingers and diary-obsessed choices; the retrocognitive cost is shown rather than told. The final refusal to seize the codex is a credible renunciation, but the interiority flirts with diagnostic shorthand (“her identity fraying”) instead of dramatized dissolution. Still, the micro-choice to hurl debris and descend is character-specific and pays visible cost. Fits 600-word scope, one POV, one tightening.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: letters → diary → lagoon → parley → tunnel collapse forecloses codex retrieval. Closure is a Charged Poise: blank diary + Mara’s tear-streaked face reweights “truth” as ongoing struggle. Cost is legible in the empty pages and Joran’s dawn rope, proving price was paid. Orientation clean by 120 words; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Obsidian lagoon and zeppelin library are not postcard backdrops: the lagoon’s mirror surface forces Mara’s self-confrontation and later parts to reveal stairs; the zeppelin’s creaking gondola supplies the rope ladder that clocks exit. Sensory triage favors heat-scent-decay under crisis. Micro-setting (diary) doubles as tool and mirror, constraining decryption choices. Final image of blank pages recharges black-water motif.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Dominant stake—“truth vs erasure”—is signaled in diary plea “They’ll erase us all.” Tightening occurs when Mara sees her own death-vision yet still descends, narrowing options to risk or retreat. Cost is visible: blank codex, lost history, and the Society man swallowed alive. Agency drives every turn; coincidence only complicates (collapse triggered by Mara, not luck).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Theme emerges without moralizing: history is a living weapon wielded by victors; blank diary = unfinished fight. Subtext in debris language circles/angles reprises encryption motif, final blankness reweights it. No final-paragraph thesis. Ambiguity lingers—truth is “out there” but ungraspable—inviting reflection rather than dictating stance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Mara’s perceptions; perceptual signature is curator-academic (“symbols pulsed like a heartbeat”) yet salted with salt-decay immediacy. No filter-verb stacks; diction tightens under pressure (“she hurled debris—spelling ‘Lead on’”). Dialogue sparse but differentiated: Joran’s grizzled brevity vs Elara’s echo-chamber diction. No head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Figurative language is sparse, taught early (“obsidian lagoon…still as a tomb”) and returned in closure. No mixed metaphors. High information density: single sentence often delivers setting, stake, and sensory cue (“zeppelin’s gondola creaked…bookshelves that seemed to defy gravity”). Copy-clean, no scaffold loops.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</question><comment>Fusion of zeppelin library + retrocognitive archivist + obsidian lagoon is fresh, not checklist steampunk. Resistance history via beach-debris lexicon literalizes “writing on the sand” trope into plot device. Final blank codex flips expected revelation, reweighting premise. Risk taken with surreal elements yet causality preserved. Specificity outweighs genre furniture.</comment>
