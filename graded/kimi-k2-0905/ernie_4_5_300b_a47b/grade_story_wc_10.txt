<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lirael’s interior contradiction—voiceless yet driven to “compose”—is embodied in every micro-adjustment of the forks; the silently expressive trait costs her real social friction and shapes the final renunciation of speech. Elias functions as crucible: his silent witnessing forces her to risk the first audible note, crystallizing the Earned Stasis. The laugh-without-sound beat shows genuine irrational layering of grief and triumph. No diagnostic self-talk; trembling hands and frost-scarred case do the telling.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the conservatory plants dance to silent music, reconfiguring silence from wound to instrument with undeniable conceptual cost—she forever forfeits her voice-as-medium. Causal chain holds: capsize trauma → heat-map experiments → Elias’s presence → risked audible fork → global silent concerts. Orientation anchored by line 3; no lens ambiguity. One shard, single POV, default scope met. Cost is legible in the final image—“tuning fork case sat open…captured starlight”—the path foreclosed is ordinary sound.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Winterglass walls refract light and trap cold, directly constraining Lirael’s heat-mapping calibration attempts; the conservatory’s stillness is the necessary acoustic void. Frost-thick panes return in the climax as the vibration conduit that animates the plants, charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy obeys a composer-turned-mute: touch and temperature dominate, color noted only as refracted ice-light. No tourist catalog; every environmental detail is filtered through her tactile obsession.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove silence can sing—tightens when Elias’s silent gaze pressures her to hazard the first audible fork, narrowing options: succeed or remain invisible. Escalation is accumulative: each heat-map trial increases emotional density until the mother-lullaby memory aligns frequencies, forcing the public reveal. Cost is visible: she trades voice for vibration, a price legible in the wordless laugh. No coincidence; all pressure emerges from her iterative experiments and Elias’s steady presence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: art can transmute trauma into new language, but the artist must pay with the old one. The tuning fork case—salvaged wreck relic—reweights from souvenir to instrument, embodying the cost. Subtext resides in gesture: Elias’s palm on glass translates admiration into conduit, silence into communion. Final image refuses moralizing; plants dancing to unheard music re-prices the premise—silence is not absence but medium.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays latched to Lirael’s sensory register—temperature spikes, tremor of hands, vibration through ribs—no head-hop. Diction is precise yet musical: “refracted,” “unshaken marvels,” “captured starlight,” consistent with ex-composer mind. Rhythm modulates: long sentences for calibrations, staccato fragments at first audible note. No filter-verb stacks. Dialogue is absent by design; the voice carries the silence theme without spoken lines.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances heat-map process or emotional charge. Metaphors stay coherent: frost patterns = musical notation; starlight = frozen sound. Strong verbs—“spiked,” “rippled,” “jolted”—propel without adverb clutter. Final paragraph cadence slows into crystalline closure, mirroring the sustained fork tone. No scaffolding, no mixed vehicles, no register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—voiceless composer invents thermal-to-vibration music—is fresh yet inevitable given trauma and glass conservatory. Tuning fork case as emotional prosthetic transforms standard grief narrative into speculative art-making. Risk of global silent concerts could tilt gimmicky, but grounded in tactile science of heat sensors and wall conduction. Synthesis feels singular: not “trauma story” nor “science-magic” but both fused through character-specific obsession.</comment>
