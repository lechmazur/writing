<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clara’s synesthetic, texture-driven perception is vividly particularized (“charcoal-stained glasses,” “light pooled in hollows”) and consistently steers her micro-choices—every tactile sketching stroke doubles as investigative action. Interior contradiction surfaces when her proclaimed empiricism collides with intuition about the ribbon’s “plea,” but the beat is compressed into one declarative line rather than dramatized tension. The final renunciation—setting the ribbon beside the portrait—carries visible cost (she forfeits private obsession to communal memory), yet the emotional price feels lightly registered because the prior “numbness” was told, not shown. Still, her perceptual signature is unforgettable and motives track cleanly under rising pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: mist, ribbon, locket, and handprint layer into a density shift that reweights the stakes from cold case data to embodied empathy. The pattern is taught early (ribbon fused into stone cracks) and culminates in the framed pairing of ribbon + portrait—a Charged Poise that lets the reader feel the reopened case’s social cost without exposition. One micro-turn (handprint reveals pushed vs. jumped) tightens options; causality is coherent though secondary to accrual of sensory evidence. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity at closure; cost is legible in the final tableau.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Quarry is rendered through Clara’s haptic bias—“granite ghosts,” “damp stone scent older than the year”—turning landscape into an extension of her synesthetic canvas. The ribbon fragment functions as micro-setting that literally threads through sketch, pit edge, and final frame, constraining each mark she makes. Spatial choreography is flawless: lantern placement, kneel-to-trace motion, glint-location in dirt all track. Weather (mist lifting) mirrors internal shift but stays causal—visibility improves only after they finish their joint drawing, underscoring earned clarity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—awaken collective empathy for a forgotten victim—is signaled in paragraph four and escalates through tactile discoveries that make abstraction visceral. Tightening occurs when ribbon + handprint overturn the fall theory, forcing Voss to reopen the case; the price is Clara’s surrender of her private fetish to public evidence. Agency resides in her choice to hand Voss the charcoal and later to frame the relics; the external gain (justice) costs her solitary ritual. Under Accumulative lens, each sensory layer increases social pressure until detachment becomes untenable—effective, though the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges inductively: empathic imagination as forensic tool. Subtext operates through material paradox—soft silk against hard stone, anonymous face vs. named locket—without authorial commentary. Final image reframes earlier “opposites unified” from compositional theory to moral stance: victim and artist, memory and oblivion, fused in one frame. No moral is stated; resonance lingers in the ribbon’s glow “like a vein of blood,” revaluing artistic seeing as civic duty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited clings to Clara’s perceptual filter: every visual is translated into texture or shadow, creating a synesthetic diction unmistakably hers. Syntax lengthens under contemplation, then fractures into staccato sketch commands during discovery beats, mirroring cognitive tempo. Voss’s dialogue is stripped, gruff, a counter-rhythm that prevents voice convergence. No head-hopping; psychic distance contracts from arm’s-length “she” to almost-free-indirect when charcoal touches stone—precise control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is muscular and image-dense: “mist clung… like a second skin” fogs both quarry and reader in one stroke. No synonym loops; each metaphor advances new information (ribbon color “bleeding” into cracks = intrusion of humanity into geology). Filter verbs almost absent; when used (“she saw”) they signal cognitive reinterpretation rather than padding. Final paragraph’s cadence slows into elegiac triple cadence—“death and life, forgetting and remembering”—earned by earlier pattern, not decorative.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The face-blind artist who solves crimes by texture is a fresh archetype; combining synesthesia with cold-case revival feels inevitable yet new. Quarry-as-canvas, ribbon-as-vein, and drawing-as-autopsy transform standard procedural beats into lyric forensics. Risk: lyrical accrual could drift into preciousness, but tactile specificity grounds every image. The synthesis “empathy’s never truly dormant” lands as discovery, not aphorism, because particulars (charcoal handprint, silk sheen in lantern) have already rewired reader perception.</comment>
