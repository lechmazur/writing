<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lira’s curiosity is vivid and embodied—ink-stained fingers, muttering constellations under breath—but the final leap reads slightly unearned: no prior beat shows her risking physical danger, so the jump feels more author-willed than character-compelled. Interior contradiction is strong early (desire vs. captain’s scorn), yet the climax lacks a visible internal cost or irreversible stance shift. Still, micro-choices (kneeling on cold metal, tracing squares) keep her alive under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: hopscotch pattern → starling gap → portal → luminous orb, each step triggered by Lira’s active decoding. Closure lands as Decisive Change with conceptual cost—she returns carrying “a truth” that reweights the ship’s entire mission. The phrasebook cue (“Stranded luminance seeks the key”) is paid off when the orb’s images flood her mind, confirming the map was real. One minor warp: Jax’s instant grin softens the threatened captain consequence, slightly blunting cost.</comment>

<comment>Airship copper, creaking hull, and shifting starling murmurations are woven through action rather than blocks of description. The hopscotch board functions as micro-setting that literally steers plot—its worn numbers constrain her finger movements and later the ship’s course. Sensory hierarchy stays POV-true: Lira notices latitude-specific constellations, ignores rigging jargon she doesn’t know. Final orb-tunnel image reuses celestial motif, charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—“chart the next great discovery”—is signaled in paragraph one and tested when she must abandon safety to chase a void only she can see. One meaningful tightening: captain’s threat vs. starlings’ widening gap forces an immediate now-or-never leap. Cost is conceptual rather than physical (she carries uncontainable knowledge), satisfying the 600-word scale. Pressure escalates because each deduction narrows her options from sketching floors to jumping into empty sky.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of curiosity-as-compass emerges through concrete pattern-finding rather than assertion; the orb’s vision reweights earlier dismissals of “youngsters who don’t know a sextant.” Subtext flickers when Jax’s grin admits he’s seen “lights that flickered like ghosts,” hinting the ship already half-believes. Final image avoids moral—it lands on charged poise: she’s “charted… a truth,” leaving consequences to resonate. No echoing thesis line keeps resonance organic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person stays tightly latched to Lira’s perceptual filter: numbers “aligned with constellations only visible at this latitude,” diction rooted in cartographic mind. Rhythm accelerates into short clauses during jump—“For a heartbeat, she fell. Then…”—mirroring terror without drumbeat monotony. Dialogue is sparse but differentiated: Jax’s clipped “cap’n’ll have your hide” contrasts Lira’s murmured astronomical references. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty: “The starlings outside screamed as if urging her on” advances both atmosphere and stakes. Figurative language is selective—no mixed metaphors—and peaks only at the orb, justifying brief luminance stacking. Scaffolding nearly absent; one tiny loop: “She’d charted the next great discovery—not just a place, but a truth” could trim to “She’d charted not just a place but a truth.” Otherwise propulsive, clean grammar, vivid verbs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Hopskotch-board-as-celestial-map feels fresh, especially when etched into cargo-hold wood rather than parchment cliché. Starlings as living compass needles twists familiar migration imagery into portal key. Risk is taken—portal jump in under 800 words—yet causality stays intact, so it reads as daring, not gimmick. Could edge higher if the luminous orb’s specific visions tied back to an earlier mundane detail, making inevitability snap.</comment>
