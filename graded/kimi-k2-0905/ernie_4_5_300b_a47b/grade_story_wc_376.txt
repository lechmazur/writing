<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s grief-driven quest is vivid, her quill-curse gives instant interior contradiction, and the final “seed” choice costs her the fantasy of intact last words. Yet the mother’s absence is only asserted, not dramatized, so the emotional peak leans on prior exposition rather than fresh pressure. Still, micro-choices (bribing plants, confronting the keeper) track motive cleanly and the renunciation lands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: plate → map → room → orb → lie-detection → renunciation; each beat narrows possibility. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the Archive is hollow yet fertile, costing Elara her literalist hope while gifting her a regenerative stance. Cost is legible in the emptied orb she still cradles. One minor causality bump: the keeper’s instant surrender of the orb feels slightly convenient, but the quill’s un-wilt justifies it.</comment>

<comment>Glass-domed toxicity, Venus-flytrap fens, and moss-slick spirals are filtered through Elara’s cartographer gaze; every sensory note guides movement or stakes. The zinc plate and nectar vial act as micro-settings that constrain tactics. Final image of the orb-seed re-uses the greenhouse logic: life sprouting from recycled waste. No orientation drift; spatial choreography stays clean.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“recover mother’s last words”—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened when the orb proves empty, forcing a choice between despair or seeding new meaning. Escalation is single-cycle but sufficient: lie detected → truth of recycling → renunciation of literal recovery. Cost is the forfeiture of intact dialogue, paid on the page. No reversal for the keeper, but their pressure is ancillary.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges: candor, even when bitter, can germinate future life. No explicit thesis; the seed image re-weights the Archive from repository to compost. Subtext in the keeper’s hesitation and respirator implies collective guilt. Final line risks a touch of maxim (“truth … was nourishment”) but earns it through prior embodiment.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s perceptual quirks—ink, botany, map logic—without head-hop. Syntax flexes: longer clauses for map-work, staccato for flytrap attack. Quill-as-barometer is a consistent psychic filter. Keeper’s dialogue is functional but flattened through synthesizer; acceptable since disguise serves plot.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured: “moss-slick floors,” “poisoned honey ink.” No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. Figurative density spikes only in the final paragraph, but pattern is taught early (“quill wilts”) so it reads as culmination rather than clutter. One participle opener flagged (“Inside, she found”) yet action remains sequential.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Recycled-voice greenhouse vault feels fresh; merges climate-crisis, archival grief, and calligraphic magic without gimmick. Quill-lie detector repurposes a writerly trope into bodily stakes. “Seed” inversion of empty orb is an inevitable-yet-surprising reconfiguration. Risky elements (toxic sky, AI dome fuel) could slide into eco-cliché but stay specific to Elara’s craft.</comment>
