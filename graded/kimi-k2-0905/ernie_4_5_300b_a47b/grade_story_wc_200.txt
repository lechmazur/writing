<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira’s interior contradiction—fear that laughter may be insufficient—drives the single decisive beat when she offers the tooth; the embodied chill and throat-ache keep emotion concrete. Modest fearlessness shows in the unflinching walk and the final lighter-heart beat, but the “quiet resolve that burned like a candle in a storm” drifts toward label-speak and is never tested by a visible mistake or loss. No secondary character on page, so status/relationship bullets waived; occupation as soul-collector is color, not crucible here. The choice to wield the tooth for translation is earned, forecloses the ghost’s challenge, and carries felt cost via the pulsing relic—just enough for 8-band, capped at 7.8 by the soft epiphany phrasing.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the tooth’s new pulse and the warm diffusion of laughter re-weight healing from destination to pursuit, with undeniable felt cost. Causal chain holds—because she admits fear, the keeper yields, therefore the harp dissolves and the laughter transfers. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“Echo Gorge”), lens stable throughout. The keeper’s vanish is mildly convenient, but the protagonist’s volitional offer of the tooth keeps agency intact. Cost is visible in the relic’s glow and her lighter heart—meets 9- gate but shaved −0.6 for slight over-expository veiled-truth dialogue.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The gorge’s stone ribs, humming pebbles, and creeping ink-shadows constrain movement and set acoustic stakes for the harp; micro-setting qualifies. Sensory triad (cold air, keening sound, gold sunrise) is filtered through Lira’s professional attention to ghosts. Spatial choreography is clean: bend → boulder → hand-to-hand exchange. Crocodile tooth’s condensation and later pulse evolve with plot, charging closure. Weather and dust taste return at sunrise, mirroring internal shift. No credible errors; slight over-purple “sky bled gold” is pattern-taught early and repaid, so not penalized.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capture laughter to heal ghosts—signaled in first 200 words. Single tightening when Lira admits fear and offers the tooth, trading certainty for access; this narrows her stance and forecloses retreat. Escalation is modest but coherent under causal lens: each harp note raises doubt, her question raises stakes, her gamble answers. Cost is the relic’s activation and the internal ache of hope—visible but not irreversible. Lacks a second hard constraint, so stops short of 8.8 band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: healing = pursuit, not arrival; laughter = fragile evidence of life. Subtext resides in the ghost’s insistence that dead speak in sighs—Lira proves they can also laugh. Final image of dawn birds answers the moonless dream without moralizing. No motif recycling for points; crocodile tooth recurs with reweighted meaning. Insight is earned through concrete concession, not assertion. Minor dock −0.1 for “healing requires truth” line edging toward thesis-statement, but integrated within dialogue.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly pinned to Lira’s perceptual filter: she notices sound, temperature, relic weight. Syntax grows clipped under cold pressure, lengthens during the lullaby shift—rhythmic control supports arc. No head-hopping; ghost’s speech is external, unattributed interiority. Diction stays within plausible lexicon for a lone wanderer. Distinctive metaphor cluster (gold bleeding sky, stone ribs, candle in storm) risks excess yet forms coherent pattern taught early and paid off at dawn “chorus of birds,” justifying risk. Filter verbs minimal and voice-motivated. Dialogue brief, goal-driven, subtextual. Qualifies for 9-band; −0.4 because two adjective strings (“form flickering like a flame in a draft”) touch the climax beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; paragraphing mirrors dawn light expansion. No scaffold, no synonym loops, no mixed metaphors. “Quiet resolve that burned like a candle in a storm” is the single stock phrase; otherwise nouns and verbs are concrete. Adjectives purposeful (old dust, invisible harp). Momentum breathes—compression during approach, expansion during laughter diffusion. Grammar clean; tense stable; pronoun references clear. Read-aloud ear test passes. Artifacts do not touch closure; high-band but not flawless.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: soul-collector seeking laughter而非revenge; gorge as acoustic haunt; crocodile tooth pierces emotional veil, not literal. Premise transformed through sensory specifics rather than trope inversion. Transformation survives proximity test—plot relies on acoustic haunt logic and laugh-transfer. Risk taken with lyric register but grounded in bodily cold and relic pulse. Not radically experimental, so stops shy of 8.8+ bonus lift, yet feels memorable and non-template.</comment>
