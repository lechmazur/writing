<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Her obsession with translating texture into sound is viscerally embodied (copper shimmer, stylus on vein). The diamond throw is a credible renunciation, but the interior turn “I am the extinction” arrives as a declarative epiphany rather than a dramatized contradiction; still, the embodied cost (burnt palm, echo-roar) keeps the score in high-low 7s.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each bird-pattern and echo-layer thickens the sonic web until the diamond’s fracture reweights the whole. Closure is a clean Charged Poise—the canyon’s new silence and the lingering song reconfigure meaning with felt cost. The only drag is the slightly late “I am extinction” beat that tells us the change rather than showing it crystallize.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Canyon, bone towers, and diamond all constrain tactical choices (ledge slip, echo distortion, stylus tracing). Final image of “lingering song” is charged by the vertigo-height and resonant architecture. Micro-setting (vein on her palm) doubles as tool and map—exactly the economy this length rewards.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten from observation to existential wager: each bird-pattern and echo-beat intensifies the possibility of total sonic oblivion. The diamond’s burn and the canyon’s roar make the price visceral. One meaningful deepening suffices; no false escalations.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: extinction as a language one must consent to hear. The final silence is a resonant reconfiguration, not a moral. No thematic echo statements; the image of the song “not meant to be spoken” does the work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lush, synesthetic diction (“copper-veined,” “prismatic shards”) stays inside the POV’s perceptual signature. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses during flare, longer coils during reflection. No head-hop; patterned elision (no exposition dump on Age of Whispers) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentences carry double duty: “The diamond grew warmer in her grip” advances both prop state and stakes. One metaphor muddle—“a throat of endless echoes” mixed with “tidal wave of sound”—is a hairline slip that does not touch the closure beat. Otherwise density is high with zero scaffold loops.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The sonic archaeology of extinction through bird-flight fractals is a fresh synthesis. Risky personification of canyon as hungry mouth pays off in the final silence. Premise is non-generic; removing copper-vein or echo-tunnel would collapse the whole.</comment>
