<comment>Elias’s sharply observant nature is felt through percussion of sensory cues, but the interior tension between his skepticism and emergent credulity is reported rather than dramatized; the flake ignition scene is mostly declarative. Marisol exists only as projected cipher, so status crucible is not on page. The final “chance to sculpt” is telegraphed, not visibly costly yet, leaving ambiguity over what path he forfeits.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the flake clears, time folds, options reconfigure, and the bridge-song reboot feels irrevocable. Causal linkage along an Accumulative/Textural track (pixel pattern → scaffold flutters → music warp) holds; flake discovery and musical ignition provide the necessary tightening. Orientation is clear by line 6; no penalty. The cost—destabilized reality, exile from prior timeline—remains conceptual; slightly soft because not viscerally anchored in body or prop irreversibility.</comment>

<comment>Sensory triage is excellent: pine resin + engine oil immediately tilts attention; the scuffed case and jagged glass edges are tactile anchors. Micro-setting (van glovebox, guardrail vantage) constrains the discovery act. The 9+ gate met: the mountain pullout’s fogline and scaffold-wrap voids materially enable the fold; environment is the portal mechanism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—recover Marisol’s truth/exploit flake map—is declared early. Escalation follows pixel-reading → fiddle ignition → reality slippage; each step narrows possibility. Price is suggested (loss of prior world) but not yet felt in body or tool, so cost clarity hovers just under 8.8 band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of rewriting “never” through art emerges organically through fiddle-as-key; avoids thesis statement. The flake’s shift from ciphered pixels to clear glass supplies a resonant image of possibility purified, but subtext stays lightly suggestive rather than piercingly ironic. Earned, not sermonized, yet could carry more moral weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited keeps tidy distance; “dynamically observant” POV filters every noun through sensory hierarchy. Syntax flexes under pressure—compressed fragments when pixels spiral. No head-hopping; lyric elisions taught early and paid off at fold.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, high-density; figurative bursts appear only at pivot beats and serve shimmer. Minor template cadence in “He’d… He’d…” opener pair; not repeated enough to trigger cap. Clean grammar; no loops or strained metaphors; momentum sustained.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Pixelated amnesty + scaffold flutters + bridge-song rift marries folk mysticism with glitch aesthetics; not a trope stack I’ve seen. Conceptual freshness slightly undercut by Marisol-figure as archetypal muse; the risk resides mostly in form, not character. Still, the synthesis carries distinctive spark.</comment>
