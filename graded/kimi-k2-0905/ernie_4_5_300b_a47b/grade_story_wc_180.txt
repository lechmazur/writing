<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Lira’s grief-linked stubbornness is vivid in embodied beats (ribbon flutter, copper wire burn), but daughter Mara stays off-stage, so the relationship crucible is only recalled. Interiority drifts into thematic paraphrase (“mend not just quartz eyes but the fractures…”) that flattens contradiction. The decision to keep climbing tomorrow is credible endurance, yet the cost feels generalized; no specific flaw boomerangs. Characterization is strong-bordering-exceptional, but the epiphanic shorthand keeps it just below 8.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Causal lens: each weld of the quartz eye because/therefore blooms the orchard. Orientation lands by line 3; no drift. Closure is a quiet RR (Charged Poise): orchard renewed, ribbon pocketed, persistence crystallized. Cost is present yet conceptual (“no patrons, no gold”); a sharper material forfeiture would have lifted this above 8.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Setting is not backdrop but tool: rafters become ladder, fallen fruit conceals the eye, moss serves as workbench. Cathedral stone and liquid starlight obey consistent fabulist physics. Micro-setting (ribbon, wire, cracked eye) directly constrains the welding action that drives climax. Sensory hierarchy stays tight to Lira’s craft priorities; no postcard drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“keep the orchard alive after breach”—is signaled early and tightens when the weld must succeed or the vow fails. Agency is steady: each scavenged item (key, wire, starlight) escalates options narrowing to the single decisive weld. Price is orchard’s rebloom, itself a felt vindication; a personal material loss would have nailed 8.5+. Escalation is linear but legible and earned.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: persistence as non-heroic, scrap-heap wisdom. No final-paragraph moralizing; the ribbon’s last rustle in pocket reweights earlier mother-daughter material without statement. Subtext resides in tool-use: mending transmutes from craft to covenant. Complexity acknowledged—world still broken—but sentimentality avoided.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person stays close to Lira’s perceptual filter: “gnarled branches,” “quartz eye nestled,” syntax compresses under flame heat. No POV leakage; squirrels & trees remain observed, not thought for. Lyric repetition (“she’d persist”) is pattern-taught and paid off. Diction borders poetic but stays within a tinkerer’s lexicon; rhythm modulates with climb-descent arc.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm, varied sentence openings, minimal filter verbs. One mixed metaphor (“petals raining like confetti”) briefly dulls bloom magic. No synonym loops or scaffold. Final line cadence lands cleanly. A single over-figurative phrase keeps it from 8.5.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Fused premise—post-breach cathedral orchard + quartz-eye repair—is fresh, resisting tidy genre bin. Tropes (abandoned cathedral, maternal vow) are re-cast through micro-craft logic. Risk of fabulist whimsy is accepted and followed through. Specificity of starlight vial and moss nest anchors the novelty. Not quite transformative but memorably particular.</comment>
