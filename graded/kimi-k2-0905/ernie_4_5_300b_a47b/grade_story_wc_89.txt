<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s refusal-to-surrender humanity under duress is dramatized in feather-sprouting flesh; the cost (permanent hybridity) is felt in the final image. Interiority is concrete, not diagnostic, and the paradoxical steadiness shows in micro-choices (kneeling, whispering, dipping fingers). “I’m not ready” is a believable blind spot that drives the climax. Only hairline slip: “gift” abstraction mid-paragraph could be embodied one beat earlier.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/lyric lens holds: violet-glow spice → fox-feather → obsidian shard → feathered skin each deepen the same stake. Closure is Charged Poise: “bridge, conduit, keeper” crystallizes new identity with undeniable cost—she will never again be merely human. Orientation anchors by line 3; no causality breaks. One transition (reflection on fortune) is brief, anchored to present smell, and tilts her stance—meets BRR exception.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Orchard’s perpetual moonlight and pulsing ash-hearts constrain tactics: only here can scent-open the ghost-bridge. The clay mortar and spice-paste act as micro-setting that literally rewrites her skin; remove them and the ritual fails. Spatial choreography stays clean—fox, owl, willow approach in sequence,羽毛落在她脚边 without position drift. Final image of moon-lit phoenix re-uses the moonlight rule established on line 1.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“become bridge or let bond fray”—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens when each creature tribute makes refusal costlier. Agency is renunciation: she endures metamorphosis, foreclosing pure humanity; price is visible feathers and permanent hybrid role. Escalation is accumulative: each spice-scented beat adds density until skin itself rewrites. No coincidence; no false reversal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete sequence: metamorphosis is not loss but honorable translation—final image reweights earlier fear of “losing herself.” No moralizing; fortune cookie line is re-priced by embodiment, not repeated as thesis. Ambiguity lingers: she is both human and not, bridge forever open—reader left with cost, not lesson. Subtext lives in gesture (fox feather, obsidian shard) rather than exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person tightly latched to Lira’s perceptual filter: moonlight is “silvered stillness,” spice clings “like second skin,” bones shift under insect-prickle. Syntax grows shorter, clausal under stress—“She did not fight it.” No head-hopping; diction stays within fairy-tale register yet avoids pseudo-antique frippery. Rhythm mirrors transformation: long languid sentences collapse into staccato beats as feathers erupt.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathe-able: “scent clung to her skin like a second layer of flesh” does sensory + metaphor + consequence in one stroke. No scaffold loops; no mixed metaphors; “dormant hearts” is precise because ash-embers literally pulse. Filter verbs used only when voice-motivated (“she understood”). Opening and closing lines are image-anchored, no explain-everything capitulation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Familiar fairy-tale notes (moonlit orchard, phoenix, fox, owl) are re-cast through olfactory magic and reluctant hybrid outcome—scent-bridge is fresh. The “beast whisperer” trope is subverted: she ends up neither wholly beast nor whisperer but conduit, a role reversal seeded early. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight; remove spice-language and whole arc collapses. Risky lyric compression paid off in closure image.</comment>
