<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid—'the narrow vastness of hope'—and micro-choices (scattering pods, listening to gull) embody the arc. No second character onstage, so status/relationship bullets off. Flaw: motivation stays static; he ends where he began, so the ‘earned cost’ is only the dawn ride away, not a sharpened renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of seed, ash, bird-call builds to Charged Poise closure—flowers ‘flickering like tiny flames’ re-weight ‘submerged concord’. Orientation clean by 70 words; transitions not needed in single-scene design. Cost is conceptual: battlefield becomes garden, but emotional price remains oblique—hence not 9+.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Jetty, damp sand, salt-air, glowing petals—details filter through soldier-gardener’s gaze and constrain tactics (where he can plant, how he fertilizes). Micro-setting object: seed pods recur and charge final image. Weather (storm) foreshadows threat but doesn’t tighten options on-page; hence just shy of 9.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: restore life to dead reef-land. Pressure is ambient—time, storm, barren soil—but no live option is foreclosed; he simply keeps planting. Escalation is poetic density, not causal narrowing. Visible cost (reef ash in hand) is present, but stakes never spike to a decision point.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of life-from-ruin emerges imagistically; ‘the earth remembers’ whispers rather than preaches. Subtext in bird-calls and dead language avoids overt thesis. Final reweighting of battlefield→garden is resonant, but single-track metaphor limits complexity; no counter-readings offered.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person close stays tight to coachman; perceptual signature—deciphering gull dialect, feeling seed shells crack—remains distinct. Syntax flexes with cadence: long lyrical sentences mirror twilight, then compress as storm rises. No dialogue, so voice purity intact. Occasional elevated diction (‘conceptual repricing’) momentarily leaks authorial register.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Lyric rhythm serves twilight mood; sentences vary, propulsion steady. Metaphors organic (‘petals flickering like tiny flames’). One scaffold: ‘he’d learned…he’d chosen…he’d traded’ template cadence in para 4; minor. No loops or mixed vehicles. Clean copy, strong open/close lines.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Post-apocalyptic reef-garden is fresh, but ‘soldier turned gardener’ trope familiar. Bird-call linguistics and dead-language incantation add idiosyncratic turn. Transformation comes from image accrual, not plot surprise. Risk is lyric stasis; still, specificity of gloom-hill coachman as vocation lifts it above template.</comment>
