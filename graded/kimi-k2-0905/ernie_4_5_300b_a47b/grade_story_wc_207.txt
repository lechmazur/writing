<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lira’s curiosity, eccentricity, and collector’s compulsion are shown through tactile beats—cataloguing jars, palming the compass, kneeling to read rock—so motives remain embodied. Internal contradiction (scientist vs mystic) is hinted but never pressed to a visible micro-choice under the lagoon pressure; the final “hunger” is declared, not dramatized. Still, her steady attention and sensory filtering feel idiosyncratic and alive, sustaining single-POV credibility.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain: compass → fissure → lagoon → psychometry flash → sampling decision. Each step because/therefore narrows her options until the dropped compass and rippling water crystallize a Resonant Reconfiguration: she accepts unknowing and seals the cost in jars. Orientation (who/where) anchored by 90 words; no lens ambiguity. Closure beat lands with visible forfeiture of certainty and tactile jars as price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Factory silence, porous limestone, mirror-black lagoon, and compass weight are filtered through Lira’s scent-biased perception, guiding her route and tool use. Petrichor density itself becomes the micro-setting that charges the final image; the lagoon surface and air sample literally reweight her archive. Spatial choreography is clean across squeeze, slope, ledge, wade, initials. No exposition dump; world rules learned by flashlight and silt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reach the place where explanation fails—is signaled early and tightened when the compass vibrates and the lagoon hum forces her to drop it; this micro-turn trades control for access. Cost is legible: forfeiture of scientific certainty, sealed physically in jars. No additional reversals, but one meaningful tightening fits 600-word scope. Agency remains interior (acceptance) yet forecloses her former rational stance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of unknowing emerges from concrete collector practice—jars labeled by date/location—rather than thesis statement. Final image of compass-silent-on-desk next to new jars reconfigures the value of collection from proof to reverence. Subtext in gesture: dropping compass = relinquishing measurement. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers in lagoon hum. Thematic echo “place where explanations fail” is spoken once mid-story; not in final paragraph, so −0.4 waived.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Lira’s sensory hierarchy: scent > sight > sound. Syntax lengthens in calm, fragments under vibration (“She waded… dropped it.”). Filter verbs minimal; perception rendered through verbs like ‘shone’, ‘scooped’, ‘felt’. No head-hop. Distinct diction: “petrichor collector,” “psychometry,” “jars labeled by date” recur with rhythmic insistence that supports closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies; high-pressure beats compress to parataxis. Info density strong—one line often layers place, tool, and emotion. Minor scaffold: “the air here was…” (tell) could be cut. No mixed metaphors; “mountain observing a moth” is clean. One paraphrase loop “they’d argued, then panicked, then… nothing” (−0.2). Otherwise propulsive; opening and final lines anchor with image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Freshest synthesis: petrichor archive + vanished expedition + subterranean lagoon as sentient threshold. Collector protagonist reframes classic cave mystery through scent memory. Risk—quiet, interior resolution—pays off by making silence itself the antagonist. Specificity of quarry, limestone, factory fallout keeps it from genre pastiche. Could shave a shade more if earlier beats telegraphed lagoon sentience, but overall feels inevitable and particular.</comment>
