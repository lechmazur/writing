<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Lira’s prism-minded trait is shown only by label; no interior contradiction or kaleidoscopic perception appears under pressure. The key choice—taking one key—aligns with her goal but costs nothing on the page and is not complicated by flaw or fear. The ending stance shift (“keeper of thresholds”) is asserted, not dramatized, so the arc feels tidy rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: decipher → enter → invert → seize key → exit transformed. Gravity inversion lands as a decisive change with visible cost (upward fall, scraped boots), satisfying closure. One minor causality gap: the doodle map appears only after inversion, so its predictive power feels retrofitted rather than fore-structured.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Serpentine tunnels, mist, and low ceiling are tactile and bias Lira’s crouch, guiding her path. The “clandestinely luminous” stone and threshold light-bends are concrete, not decorative, because they signal the coming flip. Micro-setting (manuscript, box, keys) constrains the final tactile choice. Spatial choreography stays coherent; no floating rooms.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“find the seeds of vigilance before gravity flips”—is signaled early and tightened by the literal countdown. The inversion itself is the reversal that forecloses retreat; the key taken becomes the persistent constraint. Cost is visible (disorientation, scraped boots), but stakes never deepen beyond retrieval; no secondary loss or moral trade-off appears.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of hidden knowledge in margins emerges through the manuscript doodles and the final key, avoiding overt statement. The “seeds of vigilance” remain abstract, however; they never crystallize into a specific ethical or epistemic reweighting. Closure image (key in pocket) is resonant but does not conceptually reprice the world rule-set, keeping the idea suggestive rather than charged.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Third-limited voice stays tight to Lira’s perceptual filter: tactile stone, fogged breath, ticking watch. Syntax is controlled, with rhythmic variation that accelerates during inversion. No head-hopping or register drift; diction remains within an archivist’s lexicon. Occasional lyric uplift (“quiet fire fed by the seeds of vigilance”) is brief and motivation-consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; sentences advance image or action without scaffold. One paraphrase loop—“the seeds of vigilance… buried in the margins” restated twice—slows momentum slightly. Metaphors (serpent-coiled key, specter shadows) are coherent and sparse. No filter-verb stacks or mixed vehicles; clarity holds through the flip.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Gravity inversion as a literal hourglass constraint feels fresh, and the margin-doodle language concept is specific to this archive quest. Tropes (secret grotto, magic keys) are familiar, but the combination with epistemic archaeology and physical inversion reweights them. The final image avoids generic “chosen one” beats, landing on quiet custodianship instead.</comment>
