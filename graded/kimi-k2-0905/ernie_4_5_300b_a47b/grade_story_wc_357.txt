<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Lira’s curiosity and protectiveness surface early, but interiority drifts into explanatory paraphrase (“she theorized”) rather than embodied contradiction. The final smile feels tidy; we see no residual fear or cost after the planet-scale rewiring. Competent, yet the emotional ledger stays abstract.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: arrow tip → cavern socket → permanent inversion. One soft spot: gravity inversion is declared “forever” without on-page proof; the stakes jump off-screen. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—Lira’s role pivots from extractor to guardian—yet price is implied rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Floating arches, mid-air water spheres, and root-lattices are sketched with crisp sensory triangulation. The glider, arrow, and vines all double as micro-settings that constrain motion. Final golden-leaf image reweights the premise—setting becomes active archive. A few phrases drift toward catalogue (“centuries of fruit-bearing vines”) but never stall momentum.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—planet’s resilience—stays legible; escalation arrives via the arrow tip’s heat and the vines’ crimson flare, tightening once. Agency is mostly navigational until the final insertion; the irreversible inversion is external gift rather than earned trade-off. Cost is conceptual (guardianship) not visceral, capping intensity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>“Echoes” evolves from folklore to living data system without overt thesis. Symbiosis theme emerges through lattice imagery and Lira’s renunciation, avoiding moral homily. A shade more ambiguity—what she must now guard against—would sharpen resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains consistent perceptual tilt—professional pilot diction, vine-craft metaphors. Rhythm modulates: clipped propeller sentences under stress, longer liquid cadences near water spheres. No dialogue to test voice divergence, but internal idiom stays individual.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, image-dense; no scaffold loops or mixed metaphors. Occasional adjective clusters (“bioluminescent light, their growth so rapid”) flirt with overwriting but pass. Strong verb economy and varied paragraph shapes propel the read. Final line lands with quiet snap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Inversion-powered arboriculture feels fresh; the arrow-as-key trope is refurbished by alloy-botany nexus. Risk is present—planet rewrites its own physics—but the concept commits fully. Specificity (vine-woven glider, water spheres as way-finding) prevents generic drift.</comment>
