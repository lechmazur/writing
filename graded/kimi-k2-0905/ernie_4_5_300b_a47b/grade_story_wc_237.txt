<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid—ink-stained fingers, itching scars—but the decisive “I shed” moment is narrated rather than dramatized; the micro-choice of carving the second airborne rune is shown, yet the emotional pivot still leans on summary. Still, contradictory impulses (fear vs. craving clarity) coexist in real time under the platform’s shudder, and the glowing re-patterning of his scars supplies visible cost. Enough embodied tension to earn the shift, though the beat could be sharper.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: obsidian cups → quill → ink trail → crystallization → portal, each because/therefore link legible. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the mist-path opening reweights every prior failure into legible language. Cost is felt—the platform shudders, bones mist, mentor’s quill is now freighted with future debts—so 9+ gate cleared. Orientation is complete well before 120 words; no ambiguity at end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Floating rock, milk-pool mist, obsidian cups, and crow-quill relic create a micro-setting that literally tilts under Kael’s knees; environment dictates when he can carve and when he must freeze. Sensory hierarchy obeys his scholar gaze—visual star-ink, haptic scar-itch, auditory forest roar—rather than tourist checklist. Spatial choreography tracks: kneel → carve → stand → descend steps; no impossible moves. Final image of parting mist path is charged by prior rule-set, passing 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—turn scars into readable runes—signaled in paragraph two and tightened when crystallization threatens to shatter his arm. Escalation is causal: each new ink vein raises stakes until the portal rewrites his skin. Cost is visible (glowing lattice, platform shudder) yet the price stops just short of wounding him further; a hair more bodily jeopardy would push 8.8+. Still, agency is active—he carves the air itself after the first success, foreclosing retreat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete recurrence: scars → runes → stories, ink → starlight → language; no abstract sermon. Final image answers the mentor’s riddle—“breath between storms” becomes the literal mist-path he now walks—achieving Conceptual Repricing without moral statement. Childhood rhyme returns reweighted, now a key that opened a portal. Slight erosion because the rhyme’s mechanics aren’t stressed mid-story, but resonance lands cleanly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is strong—runes “pulse like a heartbeat,” bones feel “turned to mist,” diction stays within scholarly yet breath-held register. Rhythm compresses under stress (“The quill’s tip scraped…”) then exhales into longer cadences as path opens, mirroring inhale/exhale motif. No head-hopping; POV distance stable. Non-standard grammar is absent, but poetic compression is purposeful and paid off at closure. Meets 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density: one sentence often blends action, image, and lore (“The crystallized ink spread, forming a network of veins that mirrored the scars on his arm”). No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay consistent (storm/breath/mist). One mixed image—“edges softened by mist that pooled like spilled milk”—is minor. Opening anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges earlier motifs. Clean copy; no artifact touches closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fantasy rune rituals are familiar, but the tea-ceremony platform, crow-quill relic, and scar-to-rune transmutation feel freshly synthesized. Childhood superstition retooled as operative grammar is a deft twist. Risk lies in lyric causality rather than twist-for-twist’s-sake, and coherence holds. Not quite a 9 because the core metaphor—“breath between storms”—is recognizably archetypal, yet specifics make it memorable.</comment>
