<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s “simply complicated” label is shown more than told: her obsessive pursuit of forbidden knowledge collides with the board’s warning and her own trembling hands. Interiority stays specific—she catalogues relics but crumbles at her own past—yet the emotional cost of pressing the cameo into the tree is declared rather than embodied in a final beat. Still, her contradictory impulses (hunger vs. fear) remain active in scene and the final choice forecloses the museum path with visible institutional cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test within the length cap.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds throughout: each pistachio shell discovery tightens options—blank → portrait → map—because-therefore links push her toward the naming tree. The closure is a Decisive Change with Conceptual Repricing: pressing the cameo fuses her name into the tree, paying the price of lifelong exile from institutional legitimacy. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 50; no penalty. One minor causality bump: the grotto library vision is summoned without prior rule cue, but the pattern is paid off when the map appears on the shell, so the lapse stays sub-deduction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The astral orchard is never wallpaper: its whispering blossoms narrow Elara’s auditory focus, the liquid-light waterfall supplies the only “bathroom” for reflection, and the pistachio tree’s carved names physically accept her cameo to complete the inheritance. Micro-setting—the shifting cameo shell—functions as both tool and environment, constraining every tactical move. Sensory hierarchy follows her curator gaze: starlight-fruit shimmer first, then tactile pollen, finally the blue-glow soil. The final image (her name waiting inside the trunk) recharges the earlier spatial map, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“forbidden knowledge versus institutional safety”—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightens with each shell iteration. The portrait shell deepens the cost: if she proceeds, she confronts a future self already marked by cosmic gaze. Agency remains hers: she chooses to press the blank into the tree, instantly forfeiting her museum career (a price spelled out in “the board would never believe her”). Escalation is single-cycle but sufficient for 750 words; the tightening from map to naming tree is legible and irreversible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the fractal image: inheritance is not bloodline but chosen sight. Subtext lives in gesture—cameo fusion replaces spoken oath—avoiding moralizing. The final image of an unwritten name “waiting” inside living bark reconfigures legacy as participation, not possession, offering resonant ambiguity. No thematic echo in final paragraph; the quiet smile is earned stasis with cost rather than thesis statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person intimate maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is curator-cold yet synesthetic—“pollen from a pistachio shell cameo blank” is idiosyncratic and precise. Syntax elongates under wonder, contracts under choice: “She’d done it.” No dialogue, so no voice convergence risk. Experimental elision (“the orchard seemed to exhale”) is pattern-taught early and repaid in the final chime, keeping legitimacy under the lyric-causal hybrid lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm alternates between long sensory sweeps and hammer-short beats: “She’d done it.” No filter-verb clusters; strong verbs (“fused,” “exhaled”) carry motion. One near-loop “shell/shell” in adjacent sentences survives because the repetition is functional mirror, not artifact. Metaphors stay coherent—pollen as comet ash, library as infinite shelf—and none obstruct the closure image. High density with zero scaffold earns the upper band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: pistachio shells as nonlinear heirlooms reframes eco-memento into cosmic fractal, avoiding twee via curator rigor. Risky structure—vision-library inside a light-waterfall grotto—pays off when the map materializes, making grotto rule coherent in hindsight. Concept commits fully: no safety exit where the museum forgives her. Specificity of “pistachio shell cameo blank” is irreplaceable; swap to locket or acorn collapses the fractal logic. Bonus +0.3 for risk that heightens coherence rather than gimmickry.</comment>
