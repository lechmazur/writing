<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mara’s vocation as “connector” is crystalline, but interiority stays at a broadcasting level; we hear her philosophy (“cultivated estrangement”) more than private contradiction. No moment of personal cost or risk to her own isolation is dramatized, so her final smile feels curiously unearned. Micro-decisions (patching calls) are visible, yet they don’t tighten a private stakes screw; she remains a benevolent switchboard.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The mosaic of calls follows an accumulative design: each vignette layers the glass disc’s reverb until the final lullaby image re-weights loneliness into communion—Charged Poise achieved. Transitions are clean (“By dawn…”) and orientation is fixed inside the first 60 words, satisfying the Orientation Test. Causality is thematic rather than plot-level; disc-spin summons emotional alignment, not literal plot pivot, so lens stays Accumulative/Textural.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>“Damp earth and old copper” plus subway breath anchor atmosphere immediately; the booth, pipes, and flicker function as micro-setting constraining every call. Spatial logic never blurs; callers’ unseen tunnels widen the world without clutter. Glass disc’s visual-audio texture charges both atmosphere and later closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Mara’s need to transmute anonymous loss into connection—surfaces early and tightens through caller after caller, each mis-routed plea a mini-cost paid by strangers. She herself forfeits no live option; escalation accrues in others, not her, so pressure plateaus. Visible price (disc cracks, dawn exhaustion) is present yet thin; tension is cumulative vignette stress rather than narrowing options for Mara.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of “distances that bloom into connection” emerges organically from the looping action; no final sermon states it. Recurring glass harmonica re-images isolation as harmony without forcing symbolism. Ambiguity stays productive—reader must decide if Mara is angel or prisoner—avoiding tidy moral. One slight drift: “cultivated estrangement” is narrator-coined label rather than lived discovery, trimming subtext.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person hovers at a lyric distance, matching operator omniscience; diction stays tactile (“concrete veins,” “ghostly wail”) without purple overload. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses mirror tunnel hum, clipped dialogue mimics headset static. No POV leakage or head-hop; voice teaches mosaic pattern in first 150 words and honors it to lullaby end-line.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Most sentences pull double duty (image + emotional forward motion); only minor scaffold (“She’d…”, “Tonight, though…” opener stems). Metaphors stay coherent—disc as mirror, tunnel as artery. Two paraphrase loops (“sound lingered…reminder that even wrong numbers…”) sap momentum slightly but never obscure causality or closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The “operator of mis-dials” frame refreshes urban-magic realism; glass-disc-as-harmonica is a fresh acoustic talisman. Familiar “lonely hearts linked by magical tech” is re-cast through transit infrastructure, giving bodily place to digital yearning. Risk is moderate—lyric mosaic over plotted arc—but specificity of subway acoustics prevents full trope fatigue.</comment>
