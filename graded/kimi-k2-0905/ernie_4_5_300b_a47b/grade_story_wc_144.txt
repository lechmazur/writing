<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lira’s tactile “sight” and her mother’s lullaby ground a blind artisan whose competence is balanced by visible struggle; the servo-recalibration choice costs her dawn’s triumph and she feels the drone’s new balance in her palm. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into diagnostic labels, and the micro-choice to trust water-light over logic crystallizes values. Marlow functions as secondary pressure, his cane-creak status cue nudging her stance. The earned stasis—another drone already waiting—carries quiet cost: the work never ends.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Earned Stasis: the repaired drone launches with the ship, but Lira stays behind to the next broken thing—cost felt in the dripping depot silence. Causal linkage holds: servo-misalignment → water-refraction insight → patch → flight proves fix. Orientation anchored by word 60 (rail depot, mist, dawn). No lens ambiguity; accumulative pattern (water-light returns) tightens at final basin-glow. Persistent constraint: endless repair queue keeps her earth-bound while her birds sail.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Mist-clung depot, skylight basin, and braille tool-belt are sensually selective and bias-filtered through Lira’s touch-centric POV. The anchor-lift creaks and condensation drips evolve with action, guiding her timing. Micro-setting (water basin) literally constrains the final fix—no basin, no refraction map. Final image recharges the same basin catching dawn, mirroring her endless cycle.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—ensure flawless drone guidance before dawn lift—tightens once: HB-7 fracture forces recalibrate-or-fail decision. Pressure stays coherent under Accumulative lens; each basin shimmer deepens pattern until clean refraction signals success. Cost visible: she forfeits witnessing the ship vanish, stays with next broken drone. No coincidence; success earned by tactile scrutiny and solder smoke.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges quietly: repair as lifelong devotion to invisible infrastructures; no moralizing. Water-light motif shifts from skepticism to trusted oracle, reweighting “broken” into readable pattern. Final drip-charged image offers resonant non-literal answer: clarity recycles through perpetual rust and mist. Subtext in Marlow’s cane-tap approval shows legacy passing without speech.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person lingers inside Lira’s tactile synesthesia; perceptual signature vivid (“she could feel the drone’s balance”). Syntax shortens under solder heat, lengthens during basin contemplation, mirroring emotional tempo. Dialogue sparse, idiomatic—Marlow’s grunt, “Problem’s deeper”—carries subtext of shared history. No head-hop; distance stays intimate yet avoids filter-verb clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose breathes with scene: clatter / mist / solder hiss rhythm. Figurative control: “mist like second skin” opens, then restraint until “liquid sunlight” flash at climax. No loops or scaffold; each sentence adds new sensory or causal info. Strong verbs (“clung,” “solder,” “refracted”) replace modifiers. Final line lands on resonant noun-phrase “light’s lessons,” capping motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: blind drone-whisperer decodes servo language via water-optic poetics—SF grounded in tactile realism. Tropes (mentor, launch dawn) transformed through specific craft detail and sensory inversion. Conceptual integrity commits to repair-as-devotion without romanticizing. Risk: quiet ending, but Charged Poise of basin glow keeps stakes aloft.</comment>
