<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Eleanor’s interior contradiction—control versus surrender—runs cleanly through every beat; her palm-on-moss micro-choice anchors the arc. The hellebore’s visible metamorphosis crystallizes her renunciation with bodily cost (hand withheld, breath held). Yet the assistant Mara functions mainly as expository foil; no status shift or conflicting desire pressures Eleanor in-scene, so relationship crucible stays latent. Still, the single-POV interiority is specific, plant-knower’s voice, never label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: “because” plant retracts, “therefore” Eleanor must release control; the hellebore’s split stem is the decisively visible change that reconfigures her options. Closure is a Charged Poise—she sits, leaf in pocket, storms accepted—cost felt in the foregone need to dominate. Orientation is anchored within 50 words; no ambiguity. One soft spot: Mara’s late-appearing vines are narrated as fait accompli rather than causal trigger, a micro-ebb in because/therefore chain.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mossy trellis, rain-damp air, and chlorophyll haze are filtered through Eleanor’s plant-scientist attention; every sensory pick is also a judgment (“quiet resilience”). The trellis re-enters the final image, now vine-draped, reweighted as symbol of unplanned growth—meets 9+ gate by charging closure. Spatial choreography is flawless across greenhouse and nursery rows. Minor over-reliance on visual; scent alone carries the non-visual load.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Eleanor’s need for control versus nature’s refusal to be controlled—tightens exactly once when the hellebore insists on its own dissolution. The narrowing is legible: she either intervenes or relinquishes expertise; the cost is her identity as controller. No reversals beyond that single beat, but at this length one meaningful escalation suffices. Pressure stays coherent under causal lens; coincidence (spontaneous vines) complicates rather than resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of surrender-as-growth emerges inexorably from the hellebore’s literal shedding; no overt thesis stated. The linden leaf’s early “quiet resilience” is reprised at rest as badge of earned wisdom—organic, not pasted. Final line avoids preachiness; image of storm-welcoming sitter lets reader complete the thought. Docked slightly because Eleanor’s insight is voiced to Mara (“I’m going to help them by releasing control”)—a hairline echo of theme summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person close stays glued to Eleanor’s perceptual filter—every verb choice is vegetal (“unfurling,” “chlorophyll thick”). Rhythm swells and contracts with plant motion; no filter-verb stacks. Dialogue is minimal yet distinct: Mara’s terse practicality offsets Eleanor’s ruminative diction. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens measurably in the greenhouse beat. Voice is not flamboyantly original, but disciplined and consistent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, propulsive; every sentence advances image or decision. Figurative language is sparse and plant-exact (“stem thinning, then splitting”). No synonym loops, no scaffold. One pet metaphor—“circuitously sincere”—is reused three times; it is earned thematic diction, not churn. Read-aloud rhythm is flawless; final line lingers with open-mouth cadence that mirrors the trellis vines.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Core juxtaposition—botanical science versus plant agency—feels fresh against familiar “learn to let go” arc. Specificity of hellebore metamorphosis rather than generic “plant” elevates concept. Risk is moderate: quiet ending, no villain, but coherence justifies choice. Could swap nursery for apiary with minor edits, so not irreplaceably original; still, plant-behaviourist lens is memorable.</comment>
