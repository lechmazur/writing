<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Lila’s interiority is vivid—“her fingers brushing the cool stone,” the chest-tighten of hollowness—but her moment of change is narrated rather than dramatized: “now, she understood.” The spiral memory is embodied, yet the final resolve (“she’d encourage them… write a letter of her own”) is asserted without a visible micro-choice that costs her anything on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the sinking orb reweights her prior hidden life with undeniable social cost under an Accumulative lens. Causality is clean—touch spiral → memory → orb act → song—but the decisive beat is compressed into one sentence of resolve, so the cost is felt more than visibly paid.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The lotus temple and pond constrain movement (edge, mossy stone, floating orbs) and supply the glass-orb mechanic that enables the final reconfiguration. Selective sensory triad—marble curves, chestnut thrush feather, liquid-light ripple—anchors without tourism catalog; the twig spiral micro-setting recharges the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find the thread that connects all things”—is signaled early; pressure tightens once when she must expose her own secret to the orb. The tightening is meaningful (option to stay hidden foreclosed), yet the price is symbolic rather than tactile; persistent constraint is present but lightly felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from orb-sinking image rather than slogan: secrecy transformed into shared water avoids overt moral. “Prismatic quiet” motif recurs without checklist tokenism; final whistle of thrush reweights earlier twig spiral. One soft echo of thematic prompt (“the thread that connects all things”) is tolerated inside character thought.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person lyric distance stays stable; perceptual signature—“petal-strewn crown,” “water lilies woven into robe”—is POV-appropriate. Rhythm modulates: long cadence for temple hush, clipped fragments at orb drop. No head-hop; Elara’s dialogue carries chime-like indirection distinct from Lila’s interior straw-memory idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is clean, no looped stems; figurative language is spare and patterned—“liquid light,” “chestnut feathers”—taught early and paid off. One near-scaffold: “the letters never held the thread…” restates prior idea, but momentum recovers. Opening and closing lines are image-anchored, propelling without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Premise—ghostwriter of love letters forced to confess her own disconnection—is fresh, but execution leans on familiar “art ritual cures isolation” template. Specificity of straw-spiral memory and sinking glass orb lifts it above cliché, yet the thrush song closure is a gentle glow rather than a transformative surprise.</comment>
