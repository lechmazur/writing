<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is alive—her polymer-eye reading foam as "temporary unity" is idiosyncratic and stakes her guilt. The sisters’ reunion beat, however, flattens into mutual label-speak ("we’ve been like this") that spells out the arc instead of embodying it, trimming the top band. Still, the chrysalis-handling micro-choices trace a credible hierarchy of values under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The causal chain is clean: chrysalis → foam insight → text to Mara → studio rapprochement → joint release. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: they forego perfect harmony but gain a living, flawed duet; the cost is the chrysalis given to the current, felt on-page. One minor scaffold: "as the pieces fell into place" is used twice without pattern payoff, dulling the final cadence a hair.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The braided ravine is more than backdrop—its three-strand geography literally teaches Elara the divergence-collaboration model that rewrites her polymer work and sisterhood. Foam micro-setting constrains her epiphany; the chrysalis object-as-setting charges the final release image. Sensory economy is sharp (froth, eddies, roar) and always filtered through chemist perception.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—repairing the silent rift with Mara—is signaled early and tightens when the chrysalis mirrors their stalled emergence. The foam patterns provide one meaningful deepening that reweights separation as prelude, not wound. Cost is present (chrysalis relinquished, imperfect sonata), but pressure plateaus in the middle; the story tells us "grief loosened" rather than dramatizing a fresh test of that loosening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of divergence-as-connection emerges organically from river morphology and polymer science, never sermonized. The chrysalis and braided channels re-weight at closure without forced symbolism. Final image—sisters’ imperfect duet—offers resonant non-literal answer: harmony accepts dissonance. A shade more ambiguity could push higher, but complexity is honored.</comment>

<comment>Voice is chemist-precise yet lyric: "surfactants—natural and synthetic—swirled into temporary unity." Rhythm modulates from reflective long sentences to staccato studio exchange, mirroring emotional lift. No head-hopping; perceptual signature stays consistent. Minor register drift: "symphonically minded" appears twice in authorial slot, not Elara’s idiom, but compression keeps it legible.</comment>

<comment>High information density: one sentence can segue from grief to rheology to sister silence without scaffolding. Metaphors stay physically coherent (foam fractals, nutrient exchange). Only tiny loop: "the pieces fell into place" repeated; otherwise zero synonym churn or filter-verb stacks. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene tempo; paragraphs cut cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Fusion of polymer science with sibling grief feels fresh; "rivers as collaboration" reframes familiar eco-epiphany. Chrysalis-as-unemerged-moth is a trope, but its chemical reading and joint release ritual transform it. Risk is moderate—quiet lyric ending rather than twist—but execution commits fully. Not quite a singular inflection, yet specificity rescues it from template territory.</comment>
