<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Veyra’s drive is crystalline, her interiority tactile (“weight in her palm felt like destiny”), yet the “regally unpretentious” trait is asserted twice without a visible trade-off or cost; the moment she claims the throne is decisive but her internal contradiction is told, not dramatized under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: pellet → mosaic door → crown sundered → illusion collapses; the missing-map piece tightens options and the final image reweights the realm’s truth with visible cost. One micro-turn—pellet strike—delivers the Decisive Change demanded by the lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Library air “hummed with forgotten prayers,” drift-rune glows, trapdoor mosaic star-recess all constrain tactics; the body-as-setting micro-option is weak but the ink pellet as handled tool charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“unmask pretender”—is signaled early; escalation tightens once via the Silent Convergence clock that forces the pellet throw; cost is legible in the courtiers’ gasp and realm-crack sky, though secondary stakes remain abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of truth-through-erosion emerges from ink literally drinking the lie’s breath; no moral is stated, only the image of hollow crown shell, inviting reflection on legacy versus illusion; ambiguity is purposeful, not confusing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains archaic diction without slipping; perceptual signature sharp (“constellations hung suspended”), rhythm modulates under pressure (“floor yawned open”), no head-hopping; one POV throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density, zero loops; metaphors are selective (“star trapped in her chest”) and coherent; sentence rhythm accelerates at pellet throw; minor register lift in “regally unpretentious” but does not obscure causality or closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Titan librarian plus illusion-sunder ink is fresh synthesis; celestial pause as ticking clock elevates familiar usurper plot; risk is present but not radical; transformation test passed—story fails without ink pellet mechanics.</comment>
