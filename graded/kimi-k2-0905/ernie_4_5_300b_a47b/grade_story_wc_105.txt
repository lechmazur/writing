<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lira’s synesthetic cochlea and filial grief are vivid, but the final beat (“she smiled, battered but marveling”) summarizes rather than embodies the cost; the interior contradiction between curiosity and self-harm never crystallizes into a micro-choice that forecloses an option. The memory-forging quest remains compelling, yet the climax is narrated triumph rather than a charged stance with visible fallout. Still, her sensory bias drives every beat, and the filial silence motivates the crucible, so motivation mostly coheres.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each object-layer thickens the betrayal frequency until the final mold cools. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the new aid emits the exact break-sound—so a conceptual cost is legible. However, the forge’s dormant-to-eruptive shift is elided; we leap from cold ash to molten without an on-page ignition beat, a causal gap that nicks the because/therefore chain. Orientation anchors arrive early and spatial choreography holds, so the pattern coheres even if the crucible ignition is telescoped.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dead peach root, rusted hull ribs, and aurora mercury-glass immediately constrain Lira’s dig and pour; the greenhouse’s jagged shadows literally guide her cuts. The forge itself evolves from cold stone to glowing crucible, reweighting the final image. Micro-setting (the soil-filled fissure, the mold etched with coordinates) is handled twice and returns charged. Sensory hierarchy stays synesthetic—color → vibration—without checklist drift. All 9+ quick-test elements are on-page and functional.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—capture the sound of trust breaking—tightens once: the root’s severing spikes the frequency into an audible scream. Cost is felt (she clutches ears), but the price is momentary pain rather than a foreclosed path; she exits exultant. Escalation is single-step, sufficient for this length, yet the lack of a lived consequence after the implant weakens the tightening under the Accumulative lens. Still, the pattern break (root → molten sound) is legible and agent-driven.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: memory as residue that can be weaponized into sound. The final image—the aid emitting the exact fracture—reweights absence into artifact without moralizing. Subtext resides in silence-between-heartbeats, an earned resonance. No thesis statements intrude; the peach root’s genetic memory experiment stays a particular rather than an allegory. The concept of betrayal sound remains fresh, avoiding tidy closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Perceptual signature is consistent: “lavender static, green hum, blue ache” anchors every beat. Syntax stays lean, metallic, matching the salt-corroded locale. No head-hopping; interiority stays strictly to Lira’s cochlear palette. The only compression—forge eruption described in two sentences—still keeps diction within her plausible lexicon. Voice modulates from analytical cataloguer to rapt listener without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is varied; no template cadence or synonym churn. Sentences carry dual duty (action + sensory filter) with high density. One mixed metaphor—“liquid mercury” aurora already implies liquid—draws a −0.2, but clarity survives. No loops touch the closure beat; the final line is clean. Information propulsion stays high; paragraph cuts test clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Synesthetic alchemy of betrayal-frequency is a fresh synthesis; neither trope nor gimmick. The sunken greenhouse orchard ringed by wrecks feels inevitable yet uncatalogued. Risk—melting literal “absence” into metal—pays off because the crucible obeyed prior physical rules. The peach-root memory-storage twist is specific to this world, not generic biopunk. Only the smile-of-marvel ending hedges slightly, keeping it shy of 9.0.</comment>
