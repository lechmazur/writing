<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is evocative (“featherly determined”) and her micro-choices (tracing grain, reading codes) track, yet her emotional engine stays reactive; the logbook and codes are handled more than they complicate her. The final “walk on” is credible renunciation, but the on-page cost (loss of terrace, father’s regret) is felt only through his single line—hers remains abstract. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene; the maze heart arrives as revelation, not tested dilemma.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the father/terrace dissolve behind her and the blank logbook page becomes her own code—undeniable conceptual cost. Causal lattice holds: grain-reading → path revealed → door opens; ellipsis (why father left) is deliberate and paid off by final image. Orientation is swift (“prism terrace drifted above the cornfield”). Logbook codes never break into literal plot use, but work as thematic spine, not prop—allowed under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The terrace’s glass panels refract living light onto shifting floorboards; corn stalks “bend like compass needles”—setting actively guides step-by-step navigation. Micro-setting (warped railing knot) is handled with causal bite: its spiral pattern literally hides the door trigger. Final image reweights same light into “fractured, lingering silence,” anchoring closure. Weather is poetic filter, not tactical, keeping it from 9-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—map the sacred threshold to understand abandonment—surfaces early and tightens once: the corn path appears, foreclosing endless wandering. Cost is conceptual (codes rewritten, terrace lost) rather than visceral; she pays no new physical price, blunting escalation. Agency is present—she descends, writes, steps through—but the maze offers no resistance after revelation, letting pressure plateau.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>“Necessary distances” and “sacred gaps” stay implicit, seeded through paternal quotes and re-codified in Lira’s final lines—no moral paraphrase. Theme gains nuance: distance as prayer, as cartography, as filial separation, all refracted through light imagery. Avoids tidy thesis yet could risk abstraction; final blank-page inscription re-grounds it in earned act.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Lira’s perceptual filter: grain, light, hush re-sensed in motion. Syntax flexes with pressure (“wood groaning under her feet”). No dialogue to test, but interior cadence holds. Occasional elevated diction (“kaleidoscopic shadows”) fits architectural prism motif and is pattern-taught early.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>High density (“codes are stories we haven’t lived yet”), minimal scaffold. Mixed metaphors kept coherent: light = hush = map = memory. One paraphrase loop: “the way stalks bent… the way shadows pooled” could compress. Rhythm breathes at hinge lines (“She kept walking”), propelling to resonant close.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: meteorological code + wood-grain divination + optical terrace = memory cartography. Butterfly-effect trope becomes spatialized in drifting glass structure rather than abstract rule. Father-daughter reunion via light-door avoids generic maze-exit trope. Risk in lyric compression pays off; could edge higher if one surprise turn mid-maze tested Lira’s new code.</comment>
