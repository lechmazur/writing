<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lila’s phobias are embodied (shaking hands, breath hitch) and collide with her stunt-double reflexes; the contradiction fuels the climactic sidestep. The mother-daughter mirror lands via shell standoff, cost felt when Lila withholds it. Interiority stays concrete, though “vulnerability is power” edges label-speak. Micro-choices (decoding, hurling script) track her hierarchy of values cleanly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal chain—shell discovery → notes → decryption → arrest—holds tight; each beat alters options. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Lila keeps the shell, foreclosing reunion until trust is earned; cost is legible in Marisol’s trembling hands. Orientation anchored by word 80. One transition (library→café) is crisp and motivated. No plot amnesia or teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Rusted library’s decaying scripts and groaning shelves constrain movement and hide the cast; the pink cast itself becomes micro-setting that stores evidence and forces a kneeling beat. Starlight outside sharpens the escape and final café table anchors the re-negotiation. Sensory selection favors touch and sound (shell murmur, cold floor) over visual catalog. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly during the aisle chase.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—possession of shell/exposure of betrayal—signaled in first 100 words. Mid-story tightening occurs when decryption forces Lila to speak the notes aloud, narrowing her options to confrontation. Cost is visible: enforcer’s gun, mother’s exile, Lila’s forfeiture of immediate reunion. Agency drives every turn; coincidence complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of “vulnerability as power” emerges through shell’s voice and Lila’s trembling standoff, not thesis statement. Final image—shell withheld on café table—reweights earlier betrayal into conditional trust, resonance without moralizing. Subtext lives in Marisol’s shaking hands and Lila’s refusal, not dialogue. Some late articulation of vulnerability edges toward echo but is saved by embodied cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Lila’s perceptual filter (selective attention to heights, crowds, shell murmur). Syntax mirrors her pulse: longer clauses under pressure, crisp imperatives during action. No head-hopping; café dialogue carries subtext in silence and withheld object. Distinct idiom maintained; only minor register lift in “conceptual repricing” line.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings avoid template cadence. High information density—each sentence advances stakes, body, or setting. Figurative language is spare and accurate (“voice smooth as poison”). Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold. Clean grammar, unambiguous pronouns after subject shift. Opening line anchors voice; final line crystallizes shell as promise.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Stunt-double with height phobia and talking seashell as vault key is fresh synthesis; trope inversion feels inevitable in hindsight. Specific Hollywood detritus (decaying scripts, pink cast) grounds the fantastical shell. Final withholding reverses typical reunion arc, adding non-obvious moral calculus. Risk-taking stays coherent—no gimmicks—and heightens stakes.</comment>
