<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara’s “rational” label is asserted, not shown; her interiority is thin and generic (“her heart sinking,” “her mind racing”). The glass-eye insertion is the only micro-choice that visibly costs her, momentarily sharpening perception—strong, but it’s the solitary beat where contradiction, embodied emotion, and visible cost coincide. Relationship with Jorn is sketched in paranoia rather than lived status moves, so the crucible effect is muted. Closure choice—“We occlude”—is declared, not dramatized; we don’t see her weigh or pay for it, so the renunciation feels lightly earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as a declared intention (“We occlude”) rather than a Decisive Change on the page; the ledger is revealed but nothing is done with it, so cost is conceptual not felt. Causal chain is clear because/therefore across storm → eye → truth-spill → shelter, but the final beat merely reconfigures rhetoric, not reality. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive cleanly inside 120 words. One micro-turn: eye insertion forces Jorn’s unfiltered confession; this tightens options and sets up the ending, satisfying single-scene arc.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ravine-orchard is vivid—roots like chandelier, truffles as currency—but only the storm actively shapes movement (quickened pace, hut shelter). Glass eye serves as micro-setting/object that constrains choice at climax; this lifts it toward 9-band territory. Spatial choreography clean; no impossible positions. Selective sensory economy: damp soil, milky lens, lamplight flicker—all filtered through Mara’s pragmatic gaze. Weather is causal, not backdrop, earning its keep.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—protecting fragile psychological safety—announced early; pressure escalates when eye forces raw truth from Jorn, narrowing Mara’s options to either hide or weaponize the ledger. Cost is implied (exposure could destroy her market), but not paid on-page; ledger remains inert, muting climax intensity. Agency is reaction—she listens, decides to “occlude,” but we don’t see the implementation or immediate consequence, so escalation plateaus rather than spikes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—truth as dangerous commodity—emerges through eye-forced confession and ledger reveal, never sermonized. Subtext lives in Jorn’s trembling delivery and Mara’s instinct to veil, not broadcast. Final line (“truth could be a weapon—but only if you wielded it with care”) flirts with explicit thesis but is framed as her internal summation, not authorial caption, so resonance survives. Ambiguity lingers: reader must decide if “occlude” is prudence or complicity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays anchored to Mara; no head-hops. Free-indirect texture (“world shifted, colors sharpening”) captures eye’s sensory jolt; syntax shortens under storm pressure. Perceptual signature—methodical, botanical—shows in “orchard hung like a chandelier,” “truffles infused with herbs.” Dialogue sparse but voice-differentiated: Jorn’s fragmented fear vs. Mara’s clipped calm. Register consistent; no corporate intrusion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, largely free of loops; only minor template cadence (“She… She…” in two successive opens). Metaphors are coherent (chandelier, currency) and don’t clot urgency. Information density high; most sentences pull double duty. Filter verbs minimal; strong nouns/verbs predominate. No artifacts near closure; final image retains clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Post-empathy-virus economy traded in truffles-of-safety is fresh; glass eye that forces truth rather than falsifies flips expected magic-item logic. Orchestrating these elements through a quiet orchard-ravine rather than urban dystopia avoids cliché. Specific detail—milky scratched lens, empathy as weaponized contagion—grounds concept in sensory reality. Risky structural choice to end on rhetorical stance rather than action is mostly earned, though cost could be sharper.</comment>
