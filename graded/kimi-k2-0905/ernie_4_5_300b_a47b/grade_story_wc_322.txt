<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Clara’s interiority is sensuous—“fever dream architect” hints at a mind that sculpts delirium—but the text leans on label-speak (“rational enchantment,” “texture of connection”) instead of contradictory impulse in scene. Micro-choices are present (thread-handling, step through door) yet remain symbolic gestures; we feel no genuine flaw or cost that would foreclose a path. The curator is a cipher-prism, supplying thematic commentary more than secondary pressure, so relationship-as-crucible is muted. Emotional progression is steady but tidy; the calm feels pre-ordained rather than wrested from visible risk.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</question><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern-building with the thread, mirrored reflections, and perceptual density increasing until the lattice ruptures. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Clara steps back into a “steady-light” gallery, re-weighted by the infinity-web she now carries; cost is felt in her tingling hands and irrevocably altered gaze. One causality gap: the thread’s eruption is unmotivated physics, a poetic lurch rather than a rule-earned break; however, the pattern teaches its own surreal contract early, so the waiver partly holds. Orientation is clear by ~100 words; transitions are smooth inside a single continuous fever-room, meeting single-scene scope.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</question><comment>Gallery is rendered through liquified fractals, living floors, warped mirrors—selective, urgent visual strokes that guide Clara’s weaving. The sinew thread itself becomes micro-setting: its taut hum, glow-reaction, and final door-frame materially constrain her next move, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays clean despite illusion; no impossible body placements. Sensory hierarchy favors sight over other senses, appropriate to an “optical” house, yet the missed opportunity for haptics (thread biting flesh, glass dust) keeps it from ceiling.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</question><comment>The dominant stake—prove that logic and magic can coexist—converts into personal risk only metaphorically; the cost (shattered sanity) is declared, not dramatized. Escalation is textural: mirror density increases, thread lattice tightens, then bursts into “storm” of light-threads—a visible intensification that reweights stakes. Agency resides in weaving, but the eruption happens to Clara; she endures rather than decides at the critical turn. Price afterward is conceptual (“never look at the world the same”) yet remains off-page and low-visceral for 700-word scale.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Theme of pattern-making as epistemology emerges imagistically rather than by lecture: thread-lattice, mirror-infinity, curator’s echo about bridges. Subtext is woven into gesture—every shimmer of the sinew is an argument for rational enchantment. The ending re-prices perception without moralizing, though the final “thread by thread” line drifts toward aphorism, slightly softening resonance. Overall, the idea is coherent, non-binary, and lingers, but could carry sharper emotional cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person close hovers at dream-distance, filtering notice through fractal imagery and synaesthetic verbs—“light into liquid,” “thread…humming”—a consistent perceptual signature. Syntax grows clipped under pressure (“She closed her eyes… She opened them…”) mirroring strobe-like shock. Dialogue is sparse; the curator’s prism-eyes diction differentiates him from Clara’s smoother interior cadence. No head-hopping; psychic distance contracts credibly during the eruption, then widens to calm panorama for the charged exit.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is sensorily rich yet occasionally drifts into modifier stacks (“glass façade warping the light into liquid fractals”). Mixed-metaphor risk is present but controlled; physical logic is suspended by taught surrealism, not violated accidentally. A few template echoes—“thread by thread,” “one ___ at a time”—appear twice; the final recurrence is purposeful, the earlier slightly ornamental, allowing a −0.2 loop hit. Information density is high; sentences carry double duty; beats advance without scaffold clutter, keeping momentum through an 800-word window.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Premise fuses cognitive science cathedral with dream-weaver trope, then localizes it in a walkable illusion-gallery—an inventive compression. Sinew-as-software, mirrors-as-memory servers feel fresh, not checklist. The curator’s “fractured-prism eyes” offers a sharp, specific visual hook unlikely to be mistaken for another story. Risk is moderate: surreal dream-logic could alienate literalists, yet the piece commits fully and lands a coherent closure, so the gamble pays off. Derivative guardrail does not trigger; while “gallery of mirrors” is familiar, the thread-coding and perceptual metaphysics transform it.</comment>
