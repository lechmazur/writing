<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lirael’s flat-affect puppeteer past and family loss are cleanly anchored; the spoon-carving ritual embodies her refusal to forget without overt grief-display. Interiority stays concrete (“smoothness is a lie”) and her final whisper earns its cost. The static mask never slips into contradiction, so endurance feels earned, not asserted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: each shaving of wood thickens the emotional density until the polished spoon reweights the mandate’s rule-set. Closure is a Charged Poise—she forecloses surrender by vowing tomorrow’s spoon, cost legible in the crumbling petal stain on her finger. No因果 breaks; turbine hum and knife grit tighten the same cord.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Farmhouse/turbine tableau is sketched with bone-color planks and “fractured shards of light,” then micro-set into the scrap-wood block in her hands. Weathered boards and turbine shadows literally overhang her ritual, constraining light and sound that shape her pacing. Final image of merging shadows charges the spoon’s gleam without extra description.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will grief be erased?”—tightens through each carving step; the mandate’s threat is the off-stage pressure that makes sanding an act of defiance. No reversal, but a deepening: the bowl’s balance between emptiness and fullness mirrors her refusal to choose mandated joy. Cost is visible in the disintegrated petal and the vow to repeat the labor tomorrow.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the spoon’s contradiction: polish celebrates flaws the mandate demands erased. Final line reframes “lightness” as the courage to carry darkness, a Conceptual Repricing that reweights every prior shaving. No moralizing; the insight is carved, not lectured.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person hovers at a puppeteer’s objective distance, mirroring her blank mask while still letting tactile detail (oil on cloth, grit under sandpaper) seep through. Syntax stays deliberate and flat, then compresses into the final whisper without register drift. Distinctive perceptual signature sustained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length to match task phases; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is sparse and accurate (“sky… fractured shards”). Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line releases image without overwriting. Clean copy, zero artifacts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>“Mandatory happiness” dystopia is familiar, but the resistance-through-spoon-carving ritual feels specific and non-obvious. Scrap turbine wood as material and the performer’s staged mundanity give the trope a fresh inflection. Conceptual risk pays off: the ending reconfigures “lightness” without retreating from ambiguity.</comment>
