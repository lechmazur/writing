<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lira’s barefoot stargazer identity is vivid—calloused feet, opera glasses, outsider stance—but “awkwardly confident” is asserted, not embodied in micro-choices. The final stance crystallizes (“the mess had meaning”) yet the cost is communal, not personally etched into her body or future. Interiority is specific until the peak beat, where diagnostic shorthand (“madness is just clarity”) flattens contradiction. Still, her pattern-recognition drive fuels every beat and the closure choice is hers.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the stones’ flare reconfigures the rebellion’s meaning and the crowd’s roar makes the cost audible. Causal chain—opera glasses reveal symbols → alignment window → hum peaks → collective ignition—holds under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is clean within 120 words; no lens ambiguity. The only drag is a mild soft-reset: the physical price (Lira’s bare feet, Jax’s risk) is implied, not foregrounded, keeping the score below 8.8.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Spaceport bay is tactile—rusted cranes, ozone wind, half-buried drones—yet selective, never catalogue. The ancient stones function as micro-setting: their vibration against Lira’s palm constrains timing and charges the final flare. Light shifts from “liquid gold” to “jagged shadows,” mirroring escalation. One minor slip: “concrete and soil alike” hints at off-stage terrain we never see, but the bay itself remains coherent and choice-shaping.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“reignite the spark” of a stalled rebellion—surfaces early and tightens when the alignment window becomes non-renewable. The hum’s crescendo forces a public, irreversible act: Lira channels collective voice, narrowing her option to stay a private stargazer. Cost is legible in the bay-wide roar, though individual consequence is soft. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversals required.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges: meaning is not found by escaping chaos but by attuning to its hidden rhythm. Subtext lives in gesture—opera glasses passed from grandmother to Jax to crowd—and in the stones’ mute persistence beneath rubble. No moralizing; the final image reweights prior debris as signal. A hair more ambiguity could deepen resonance, but the particulars carry the weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-limited stays locked to Lira; perceptual signature filters every detail through pattern-hunger and barefoot tactility. Syntax flexes with pressure—“a low, thunderous serenity”—without purple drift. Dialogue is sparse but distinct: Jax’s skeptical engineer cadence versus Lira’s star-chart diction. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks; voice scales under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, image-dense: “liquid gold pooled between rusted cranes” does triple sensory work. No loops, no scaffold, no synonym churn. Metaphors stay coherent; “thunderous serenity” risks oxymoron yet pays off in the bay’s acoustic flip. One clause drift—“voice echoing off the metal walls” during barefoot walk—barely grazes momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Fusion of archaic stone circle with derelict spaceport feels inevitable, not grafted. Opera glasses as tech-shamanic interface refreshes the “chosen one” trope by making the tool flawed and inherited. Rebellion reignition via celestial alignment is familiar, but theAcc/Textural execution and collective voice twist lend freshness. Risk is present but not radical; specificity anchors it.</comment>
