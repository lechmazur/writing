<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is concrete—her hands brushing dust from the bell, the decision to “stop hiding”—and her micro-choice to ring the bell crystallizes the stake. The contradiction between fear and trust is dramatized, not labeled. Yet the council remains off-stage, so status dynamics and secondary pressure are muted; the cost is social but not fully embodied in a relationship crucible. Still, the endurance of naming carries credible cost under the lens.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: anonymous donations → Mira’s pattern recognition → bell ringing → public naming → donation pattern replaced by open notes. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the quiet is re-weighted from imposed silence to chosen communal language, with the spoon-clapper bell as visible cost. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by word 40. One soft spot: the council’s skepticism is told rather than staged, slightly diluting the final triumph.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The terra-cotta arbor is not backdrop but tactical hub: deliveries appear at its base, notes tie to its pillars, bell hangs from its beam. Sensory triad—wet clay, ember-red tiles, amplified quiet—filters through Mira’s urgency. Spatial choreography is clean: crowd stirs, bell scrapes tiles, children carve initials. Environment constrains the final image: the spoon-clapper bell daily rings, charging the “amplified quiet” with new meaning.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—community survival via intergenerational trust—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening: anonymity dissolves when Mira rings the bell, foreclosing the safe option. Cost is legible—fear of exposure, yet exposure chosen. Agency sits with Mira; the donations cease because she forces the shift, not because sanctions ease.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of silence: imposed quiet becomes chosen communal voice. The bell’s re-clappering with a spoon is a Conceptual Repricing that reweights silence as celebration. No final-paragraph moralizing; the last line “who listens” invites reader complicity. Subtext resides in gesture—notes tied to pillars, hand squeeze—rather than exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Mira; no head-hop. Distinct perceptual signature: “amplified quiet” as lived condition, dust on antique bell, ember-red tiles. Rhythm modulates—short declaratives at peak (“Tonight, we declare ourselves”). No dialogue, so voice distinction test waived. Free indirect style is clean: “She knew the giver” carries Mira’s idiom, not narrator overlay.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often performs scene-setting, interiority, and causality (“Sanctions had crippled…hope frayed like old rope”). Metaphors are controlled—quiet as language, bell tone “thin, brittle”—and pay off in closure. No synonym loops or template cadence; sentence openings vary. Minor filter-verb cluster (“Mira had noticed”) but forgiven in past-perfect compression.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Familiar “community under siege finds voice” arc is refreshed by the antique bell repurposed with a spoon and the quiet re-coded as language. Specificity—terra-cotta arbor, midnight food runs, spoon-clapper—prevents generic overlay. Risk is moderate: silence-as-language is known, yet the bell’s re-functioning offers a fresh inflection. Synthesis feels local, not checklist.</comment>
