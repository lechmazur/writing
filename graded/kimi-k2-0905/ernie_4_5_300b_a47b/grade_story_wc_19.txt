<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lila’s hunger for “flavors of silence” is embodied from the first breath of rust to the final sprout; her contradictory impulses—cling to the doll vs. let it go—activate simultaneously in the weightless hatch beat, giving the renunciation bite. Interiority stays concrete and sensorial, never drifting into label-speak. The micro-choice to release the doll costs her the only relic of the old world, earning the closing sprout and a credible shift from claustrophobia to hopeful endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the sprout through the bunker floor reweights all prior silence-tasting into living growth, and the cost—permanent loss of the doll—remains visible in the empty hand. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of tasting → planting tightens the dominant stake without need of causal reversals. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within first 90 words; no drift or disorientation. The final image’s conceptual cost (plant pushing through steel) is undeniable and legible under the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Bunker metal, inverted gravity, and the trellis are sketched with brutal economy—only the sensory details that Lila’s body can taste, touch, or float against. The porcelain doll and the green shoot function as micro-settings that constrain her final choice. Spatial choreography stays clean: hatch → trellis → fall → crack in floor tracks without drift. World rules (monthly inversion, stabilizer dials) are learned through action, never dumped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“collect silence flavors before the hatch closes”—is signaled early and tightened when the doll (anchor of past silence) is released to keep climbing the trellis. One meaningful intensification: gravity re-righting forces an immediate choice—cling to trellis or let doll go—narrowing options under time pressure. Cost is visible: she loses the doll and returns empty-handed, paying the price for the silence she tasted. No coincidence resolves the conflict; the sprout emerges later as delayed consequence, not luck.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of silence: from edible, gilded hush above to the metallic clang below, then into living growth. No character sermonizes; the sprout re-prices silence as something that germinates rather than evaporates. Subtext operates in gesture—hand opening to release the doll equals mouth opening to swallow silence—linking intake and surrender. Final image avoids moral, leaving ambiguity about whether hope or mere survival sprouts.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Lila’s perceptual signature—metallic breath, honeyed silence, green shoot pushing steel—without head-hop. Diction stays within a child’s sensorium; no academic register leaks. Rhythm accelerates during the weightless minute, then fractures into short clauses at “No!” mimicking breathless fall. Dialogue is minimal but natural: father’s warning and call carry parental tremor, distinct from Lila’s interior cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences carry sensory, emotional, and world data without scaffold. Metaphors are sparse, precise—“silence tasted of honey and old wood”—and never stack into purple accretion. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances choice or texture. Read-aloud rhythm modulates from tight bunker clauses to open-vowel trellis lines, mirroring pressure release.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Inversion-of-gravity-as-monthly-ritual feels fresh against bunker dystopia; the silence-as-flavor quest reframes typical escape tropes. Porcelain doll lost-to-sprout transformation avoids cliché reset, converting nostalgia into biological hope. Specificity of “gilded hush” and “xenial trellis” stakes out memorable diction. Risk stays tethered to internal logic; no gimmickry.</comment>
