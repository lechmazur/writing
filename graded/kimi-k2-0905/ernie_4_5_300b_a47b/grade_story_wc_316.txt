<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Intriguing premise, but Kael's psychology relies on diagnostic shorthand ("ego death," "emotional numbness") rather than on-page contradiction; the clone taunts but relationship/status pressure stays one-note; the pivotal renunciation ("you're a choice") feels asserted, not earned by displayed interior cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Closure is present—brain reclaimed, clone gone, sky stabilizes—but the decisive energy merge is summarized not dramatized, blurring cost; causal logic ("vivify this rock" as actual terrain rewrite) is fuzzy, weakening the because/therefore chain; orientation is clean inside ~60 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Floating rock, sky-vortex, brain-jar deliver vivid, selective imagery; jar-light reappears as closure beacon; spatial choreography stays coherent; could reach 9-band if terrain cracks had constrained footwork or final path, but environment mostly backdrop not tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant custody-of-self stake is signaled early and tightens once via the energy duel; price (clone erased, Kael emotionally re-awakened) is legible but stated rather than felt in a beat; sufficient for 7-range, not the visible tactical loss required for 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of self-ownership vs engineered perfection emerges through conflict, not lecture; final "you're a choice" re-weights the jar’s meaning; avoids tidy moral; slightly undercut by abstract diction ("vivify," "complementary opposites") that keeps sentiment arm’s-length.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds steady with Kael; perceptual signature is sharp ("wind howling through cracks in worn boots"); no head-hop; diction skews elevated but consistent; cadence breathes with action; clone dialogue functional, less textured, keeps score sub-9.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong momentum and varied rhythm; some metaphor density in combat ("sugar in tea," "liquid clouds") but not pattern-cluttered; no loops; odd register spikes ("Council of Synthesis") feel label-like; closure sentence clean; minor scaffold in repeated "energy surge" phrasing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ego-death, custody battle, and literalized mind-in-jar; speculative kung-fu on a fracturing rock avoids cliché; risk in concept partially offsets familiar clone-vs-original beat structure; specificity of complementary-opposite channeling gives new inflection.</comment>
