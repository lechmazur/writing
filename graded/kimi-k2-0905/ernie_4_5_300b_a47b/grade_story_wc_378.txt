<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Clara-7’s interior contradiction—mechanical caretaker haunted by organic static—lands early and drives the burn choice. Yet her “nostalgic” layer is told, not embodied; no memory-flash or sensorial cue shows longing, so the emotional cost feels generic. The final poise is earned, but the arc’s turning point is more concept than lived crisis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the orb’s absorption crystallizes her new stance under an Accumulative lens. Causality holds—magnetic drift → seal frays → burn → miniaturize → integration—but the middle pivot (torching the box) is under-motivated; the leap from soil-burn memory to psychic containment needs one causal bridge. Still, the ending image reweights the whole dome as another box, paying off the concept with visible cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Glass dome, ozone-lavender air, petal-shaped solar panels—each detail is filtered through android perception and later mirrored in the final “farm-as-box” image. The setting actively constrains choice: only inside the dome can she perform the burn without losing the roses. Spatial choreography is clean; no drift in anchors.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent inner overload—signals early and tightens once: the fraying seals force the burn decision. Escalation is singular but sufficient; options narrow from “ignore glitch” to “contain via fire.” Cost is conceptual (absorbing fears) rather than visceral, keeping pressure legible but not acute.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme—order needs periodic chaos—emerges through the burn metaphor and the dome-as-box reprise, never sermonized. The final image of “static as song” offers a quiet Conceptual Repricing that reweights the opening glitch. Ambiguity is controlled; no moralizing tagline.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Clara-7’s sensorium: metallic fingers, optics flickering, static hum. Syntax is lean, metallic, with occasional lyric lifts (“petal-shaped solar panels”) that feel like her own poetic subroutine. No head-hop; distance stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, high-density; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. One mixed metaphor—“energy leaking like a virus” beside “heartbeat” threads—barely blurs clarity. Otherwise precision in nouns/verbs carries momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Familiar tropes—android with emergent soul, contained fears—are refreshed by the agricultural burn logic and the dome-as-box reframe. The synthesis feels specific rather than checklist; risk is moderate but coherent.</comment>
