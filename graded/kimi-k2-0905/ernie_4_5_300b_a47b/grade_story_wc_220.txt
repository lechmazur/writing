<question>1</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Hush’s nose-as-reader is a fresh conceit, but the story tells us she “bark[s] once, and the settlement erupt[s]” rather than dramatizing a visible, costly choice. Interiority is asserted (“she seemed to say”) rather than embodied. Motive is declared early but never tested under pressure; no contradiction or forfeiture accrues. The dog remains symbol more than agent, so the arc feels observational, not crucible-forged.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Conceptual Repricing: the preserved leaf becomes communal icon, reweighting “distance into closeness.” Causality, however, is loose—each riddle is solved by authorial fiat (“Intuitively, she knew…”) rather than because/therefore links that foreclose wrong answers. The Orientation Test is waived: early disorientation (dog-as-reader) is the gimmick and does pay off. Still, the cost is communal, not personal; the lens is Accumulative/Textural, and that pattern holds without contradiction, though escalation is gentle.</comment>

<comment>Scrap-yard textures are vivid and selective—“rusted carcass of a harvester,” “salvaged glass,” “mouse’s nest”—and the autumn-leaf micro-setting finally constrains choice by becoming the symbolic center. Spatial choreography stays clean; bodies gather, circle, cheer without drift. World rules remain consistent; no exposition dump. The environment is mostly backdrop, but the leaf’s final charge on the settlement’s ritual life lifts the score above mere atmosphere.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—“translate distance into closeness”—is declared, yet pressure never tightens; each solved riddle adds communal warmth but no visible price or lost option. No meaningful reversal or trade-off narrows possibility; escalation is accretive, not crucible. Agency rests in Hush’s nose, but the cost is absorbed by the group, not the protagonist. The final cheer is felt, but the absence of a forfeiture keeps the score mid-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as communal glue, love as what “grows when shared.” Subtext operates in the leaf’s re-pricing and the elders’ murmurs rather than explicit sermon. The riddles avoid thematic echo; no character states the thesis aloud. Complexity is modest—no real counter-reading—but the ending image resists moralizing, letting resonance linger.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Third-limited keeps tight focalization through Hush’s perceptual filter; no head-hop. Syntax is lyrical but controlled, with purposeful cadence shifts (“wild hush” vs. “low, collective murmur”). Dialogue is minimal and natural when present. Diction stays within Jeb’s diction range; no register drift. The occasional soft filter (“seemed to say”) slightly blurs immediacy, but voice remains coherent and distinct to the piece.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Prose breathes with variable rhythm; paragraphs shorten toward the leaf reveal, accelerating momentum. Figurative language is restrained—no metaphor stacking under pressure. Occasional paraphrase loop (“the settlement erupted in cheers” after “cheers” is implied) but no clarity break. Clause order is clean; tense stable. Opening and closing lines are image-driven, not declarative. Minor scaffold present but never touches closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The bloodhound-as-phonograph-decoder is a fresh inflection on post-apocalypse scavenger tales; the waxed leaf as communal relic feels inevitable in hindsight. Tropes (scrapyard, elders, kerosene lamp) are transformed through sensory specificity and the dog’s sensory POV. No close echoes of famous scenes. Risk is moderate—concept could tilt twee—but commitment to lyric accumulation keeps it from gimmick. Synthesis is specific enough to outrun template charge.</comment>
