<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s motivation—hush a coded prophecy—grounds every choice; his interiority stays concrete (“his lungs burning,” “saxophone warm”). The final renunciation carries visible cost: exhaustion, dew-mirrors, lingering uncertainty. No secondary character on page, so relationship bullets NA. One slip: “strange peace” edges toward unearned epiphany.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elias forecloses the prophecy’s completion at measurable physical cost (burnt lungs, cold brass, dissipated figure). Causal chain holds: because he plays the negative space, the code frays; therefore the specter collapses. Orientation anchored by word 40. Lens-stable accumulative/textural; color-cadence deepens to white-hot then fade. One micro-turn: specter’s approach tightens stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prism atrium functions as micro-setting/tool that literally refracts and dissolves the antagonist; dew-drop mirrors reprise in final image, charging closure. Sensory hierarchy obeys musician’s bias—sound, breath, temperature—never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography clean: ledge-mist-distance tracked through saxophone strap, cold brass, recoil of figure. No slips.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—silence the prophecy—signaled paragraph 1; tightening occurs when spectral voice frays under sax-wail, foreclosing option to hear the code completed. Cost legible in scorched breath and fading prism-glow. Agency is sustained attention/renunciation rather than single decisive act; still sufficient under accumulative lens. Could use one earlier visceral price for 8.5+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</question><grade><comment>Theme—some truths must stay unspoken—emerges via silence-as-weapon, never stated. Negative-space music = subtextual conduit; final dew-mirrors reweight earlier lattice image. Avoids moralizing, ends on quietly vivid certainty. One near-echo: “vested hush” drifts toward thesis-phrase; barely under threshold.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person lyric close-distance maintained; perceptual signature rooted in breath, brass, color-refraction. Syntax flexes with crescendo—fragments (“A low, mournful cry”) mirror musical phrasing. No head-hopping; diction stays within musician’s poetry. Dialogue absent, so bullets N/A. Filter verbs minimal and purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentences lengthen then fracture under musical pressure. No loops, no synonym churn. Figurative language dense but never muddled—metaphor vehicles stay optical/sonic. One mixed risk: “ghost’s whisper” beside “saxophone’s cry” could clash; context justifies. Information density high; every paragraph advances image or stakes. Closure line clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</question><grade><comment>Converts familiar “musician vs doom” into acoustic negative-space battle; prism-atrium as literal refractor of myth feels fresh. Specificity of dew-mirrors, frost-etched glass, sax-cold against palm anchors novelty. Risk: prophecy-figure tropes verge on archetype; compensated by sonic execution. Not radically original, but memorable re-framing.</comment>
