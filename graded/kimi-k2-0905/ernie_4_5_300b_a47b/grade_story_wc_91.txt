<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is evocative—her empty pockets/full heart paradox and trembling hands—but her contradictory impulses stay summarized (“I just… wanted to fix things”) rather than enacted in a single visible micro-choice under pressure. The final shift to “purpose, not just habit” is declared, not dramatized; we see no immediate behavioral cost or renunciation that forecloses her old pattern. Relationship/status dynamics are absent; the hooded man functions as oracle, not crucible. Overall competence balanced with genuine struggle is asserted, not tested on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the release of each bug intensifies pattern and cadence rather than causal chain. Closure lands as Charged Poise—constellation-map footprint and quieted volcano re-weight her premise with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation is clean within 120 words; no penalty. The prophecy mechanics remain off-stage (“verses in a poem written centuries ago”) so the Decisive Change feels slightly abstract; cost is felt but not specific enough for 8+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Black sand, low stars, charcoal grit, and volcanic hiss are vivid, selective, and threaded through action. The beach’s warmth underfoot after the final release is a micro-setting shift that charges the closure image, satisfying the 9+ gate for environment constraining choice. Spatial choreography is ghost-clear—man appears/vanishes—but acceptable under lyric mode. Sensory economy favors immediacy over breadth, appropriate to 750-word scope.</answer>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“understand the texture of transformation”—is signaled early. Pressure escalates texturally: each bug released deepens the hush and narrows Lira’s emotional option from accidental to purposeful philanthropy. No visible price (lost bug, physical risk, social credit) is dramatized; cost is conceptual. Sufficient tightening for this length, but lacks tangible trade-off that would push above 7.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</answer><comment>Theme emerges organically: transformation as messy, volcanic, non-grandiose. Subtext lives in image—warm sand, constellation shadow—rather than overt statement. The final paragraph nudges toward moral (“she’d do it with purpose”) but stops short of sermon; ambiguity lingers. No motif checklist; lightning bugs reweight meaning at end, earning their keep.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</question><comment>Voice is lyrical, compressed, pattern-taught early (“stars burned low and slow”) and held consistently. Perceptual signature is intact—Lira notices light, texture, hush. Hooded man’s diction is distinct: “rough as lava rock.” No head-hopping; POV stable. Minor template cadence in release sequence (“She opened another jar…”) but rhythm supports mantra-like intensity, not artifact.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Prose is lean and image-dense; most sentences carry double duty. One paraphrase loop (“the hush you hear? It’s the world’s relief…”) is acceptable as direct address. Metaphors stay coherent; no mixed vehicles. High-information lines (“the sand beneath her feet felt… different. Warmer, softer”) advance both texture and plot. No artifact touches closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</question><comment>Premise—philanthropist completing hidden prophecies with stolen light—is fresh synthesis of familiar tropes. Volcano-as-transformation metaphor is standard, but constellation footprint re-weights it with specific iridescence. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates. Risk is moderate; execution competent rather than daring. No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</question><comment>Early signal + final reprise; middle development missing. Her shift from accidental to purposeful is declared, not dramatized in a visible trade-off, capping integration below 7.</comment>
<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Setup, three release beats, charged closure—final empty jars echo constellation map. Bugs reweight meaning; removal would collapse the prophecy mechanic and final image.</comment>
<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</question><comment>Hush shapes stakes (language of transformation) and tightens in each release; final silence crystallizes her stance. Present across beats; not merely thematic echo.</comment>
<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</question><comment>Trait enables early nudging but mechanics stay off-stage; no on-page cost or failed coincidence. Functions as backstory label; still motivates detour.</comment>
<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Detour to beach triggers entire prophecy closure; without it, no meeting, no final bug. Tight causal linkage, visible in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>9 F</question><grade>5.5</question><comment>Accidental prophecy fulfillment is asserted late; prior helping acts are summarized, not shown. Serves explanatory twist rather than shaped tactics.</comment>
<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</question><comment>Volcanic sand warmth underfoot reweights closure; environment shifts from hostile to approving. Micro-setting charges final image; not postcard backdrop.</comment>
<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</question><comment>“Slow dance of celestial bodies” is lyrical frame, not tracked clock. Time feels eternal; no tactical pressure from elapsed minutes.</comment>
<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</question><comment>Desire for transformation is explicit motive; friction appears in dialogue (“Fixing isn’t transformation”) but no torn choice between fixing vs. letting break.</comment>
<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>Vibrant hush is taught early, modulates with each bug release, and peaks in crystalline silence. Tone charges final stance; coherent across turns.</comment>
