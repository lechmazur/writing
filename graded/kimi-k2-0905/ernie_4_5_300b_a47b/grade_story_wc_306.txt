<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias’s “conscience for hire” premise is credibly lived-in: the hollow mirror shard appears twice with different clients, his shrug is both mask and habit, and the choice to let Mira remove the final chime is a micro-choice that costs him the cloak he might have kept. Interiority stays concrete (“the word tasting foreign on his tongue”) and avoids therapeutic gloss. The only drag is the faint safety-hedge in his rare smile—still, the flaw is sub-closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: shard hum → cloak donned → sensory filter → chime decipher → Mira’s decisive unhooking. Orientation is anchored by line 3; the single transition (inside tower) is legible. Closure is Earned Stasis: Elias forecloses the option to keep the cloak and walks into wind he can now “speak,” a visible forfeiture. No teleporting props or retro-patches.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lighthouse interior is filtered through touch and smell, not postcard list; the cloak’s weight and the cedar/oak/maple chimes constrain every tactical beat. Micro-setting rule satisfied: the cloak itself becomes the environment that alters perception. Weather (wind) is not backdrop but the final speaking partner. One minor slip—“salt-stained stone cool against his palms” is stock—but it occurs outside the closure unit.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can Mira hear the dead husband’s truth—tightens when Elias dons the cloak and feels his own morality blur; this is the single meaningful deepening that reweights options. Cost is visible: he gives up the cloak and concedes interpretive authority to Mira. Agency is shared but Elias’s facilitation still drives the turn. No coincidence; wind chimes respond only to deliberate unhooking.</question>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme—doubt as filter, not enemy—emerges through the chime-harmonics image rather than assertion. Subtext surfaces in gesture: Mira’s fingertip brush of Elias’s sleeve is gratitude and mild erasure of his professional shell. Final image of wind-as-language reconfigures the premise without moralizing. No echoic thesis statement in last paragraph.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias with perceptual signature: he notices salt-stains, oil-damp, and the “foreign” taste of the word nuance. Rhythm modulates—short declaratives under cloak-filter, longer sentences during chime listening. No head-hop; Mira’s interior is read only through her fraying voice and unreadable expression. Filter-verb count is minimal; syntax mirrors his calibrated detachment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence either advances causal chain or thickens texture. Figurative language is sparse and precise (“cloak of doubt hung from a peg—woven from years of second-guessing”). No mixed metaphors. Final line cadence mirrors chime harmonics: “He walked into the wind, its chimes a language he’d spent years learning to speak.” Clean mechanics throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The “conscience for hire” trope is flipped into acoustic detective work; wind chimes as truth-engine feels fresh yet inevitable. Risk taken: quiet, lyric exit instead of confrontation, and it pays off by recharging the language motif. No borrowed set-pieces or pop-culture echoes. Specificity of cedar/oak/maple tones prevents abstract anywhere-setting.</comment>
