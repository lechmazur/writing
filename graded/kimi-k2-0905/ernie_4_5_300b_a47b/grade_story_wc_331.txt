<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Eleanor’s interiority is concrete—her thumb on the scarf’s raised threads, the restlessness that “the silence had grown heavier”—and her micro-choice to light the candle at midnight drives the portal beat. Yet the sanely-eccentric label is announced, not dramatized; no visible cost attaches to her decision, so the arc feels more discovery than crucible. The young patron functions only as prompt, not pressure, so relationship-as-crucible is absent. Still, the embodied attention to analog texture keeps her idiosyncratic and believable.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The causal chain is tight: scarf → poet myth → hyperbolic key → candle ritual → mirror corridor → floating manuscripts, each because/therefore link legible. Orientation is clean by word 60; the midnight candle is the decisive change that reconfigures the library’s energy, paid for by Eleanor’s solitude and the poem’s unknowable language. Cost is felt: “her heartbeat quickened,” the scarf now “tied neatly” as perpetual reminder. Closure unit (Charged Poise) lands cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Scientific poetry library under Edison bulbs is sketched with selective sensory hits—lavender-ink scarf, rustling pages—rather than tourist catalog. Micro-setting (scarf as handled object) constrains the ritual beat and reappears at closure. Spatial choreography stays coherent; no impossible moves. For 9+ gate, the scarf needed to charge the final image; it does so by being visibly knotted, but the library itself never pressures tactics, capping at high 7s.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“reawaken dormant stories”—is signaled early and tightened once: the mirrors dissolve into floating manuscripts, narrowing options to “continue.” Agency is present (she lights the candle, steps forward), but the price is more wonder than loss; no live option is foreclosed. Escalation is atmospheric, not tactical, fitting an Accumulative lens. Sufficient for length, but lacks visceral cost that would push higher.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: analog memory as living vibration, not slogan. The poem’s final couplet reframes the entire quest—“Seek me not in words, / but in the curves of your mind”—delivering Conceptual Repricing without moralizing. Subtext in gesture (scarf knot at end) is stronger than any articulated thesis. Complexity is honored: skepticism softens but never vanishes, leaving plausible counter-reading.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays anchored to Eleanor’s perceptual filter—“analog memories, she thought”—with diction calibrated to her archivist precision. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for scholarly hush, fragments (“Ah. You’re here.”) at portal beat. No head-hopping; dialogue sparse but natural. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated. Distinctive syntactic signature—“the line between madness and genius is a Mobius strip”—reads as her idiom, not authorial flourish.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean: no loops, scaffold, or synonym churn. Figurative language is spare—hyperbolic planes, “corridor of mirrors”—each taught by context and paid off at closure. Sentence variety propels without purple drift. One near-miss: “the library itself were breathing” risks cliché, but immediately grounded in tactile scarf focus. Overall, high density, clear causal order, read-aloud rhythm intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusion of hyperbolic geometry with poetry archiving feels fresh; not a templated trope. Scarf-as-portal-key is specific to this milieu and reweights at closure. Risk is taken—quiet lyric portal instead of spectacle—and coherence holds. The “scientific poetry library” premise is particular enough that swapping details would break the spell. Final image of knotted scarf as perpetual imperative (“Continue”) offers non-obvious synthesis.</comment>
