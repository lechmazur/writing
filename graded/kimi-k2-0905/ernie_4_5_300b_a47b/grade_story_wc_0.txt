<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—neutron-star empiricism vs. raw greenhouse chaos—drives every micro-choice (scraping dust, filming chrysalis). Her habitual “preprocessing” is embodied, not labeled, and the final renunciation of institute approval carries visible social cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens taught early via dust settling and patterning; closure is a Conceptual Repricing that reweights her scientific gaze toward humility. The final symposium slide of “dust-caked ferns” crystallizes the before/after with undeniable conceptual cost. No causality breaks; orientation anchored by line 3.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Storm-damaged greenhouse, butterfly dust, and chrysalis function as micro-setting that constrains sampling tactics and charges the final image. Sensory detail is filtered through a physicist’s bias (humidity as “waveform of a dying pulsar”). Spatial choreography is clean; tools (spectrometer, vial) are handled, not listed.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can her reductionist lens survive the greenhouse’s entropic mess—tightens when butterfly dust refuses modeling, foreclosing tidy equations. Cost is legible: she forfeits institutional esteem, accepting local symposium chuckles. Escalation is accumulative (dust density, mold days) not causal-turn based, coherent under chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulate imagery: gradual change as a dialogic language, not tragedy. Final image of chrysalis spiral dust reweights earlier pulsar metaphor without moralizing. Insight is earned via concrete sampling, not stated; humility feels visceral because her professional status is visibly forfeited.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains neutron-star physicist perceptual signature: “moth-eaten fern frond…like waveform of a dying pulsar.” Syntax modulates—compressed clauses under lab precision, longer breaths during decay observation. No head-hop; diction stays within her plausible lexicon. Filter verbs are voice-motivated (“she hypothesized”) not intrusive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; sentences carry dual duty (action + metaphor) without clutter. Opening line anchors voice and stakes simultaneously. Metaphors are coherent (dust spiral echoes galactic spiral) and paid off. Varied sentence rhythm mirrors micro-tempo of sampling versus macro-tempo of decay; no register drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: astrophysics instrumentation applied to post-flood butterfly dust as predictive model. Transformation test fails if names swapped—details (spectra, chrysalis gold-green sheen, “waveform of a dying pulsar”) are irreplaceable. Risk of academic-slam ending is taken and landed with earned cost. Minor tick: familiar “scientist learns from nature” arc keeps it from 9+.</comment>
