<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—yearning for clarity yet distrusting engineered shortcuts—remains vivid in embodied tics (tingling wrist, geode palm-press). The micro-choice to keep mapping instead of swallowing a refund pill crystallizes his hierarchy of values. Mara’s pressure as witness sharpens his stance; her willowglass hope mirrors without merging voices. Cost is felt: the shock’s persistent burn and the grandmother-gift he might fracture if wrong.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Causal spine intact: because the shock tagged neural pathways, Elias therefore maps them; because pills bulldoze, he refuses recall refunds. Orientation anchored by word 50; studio geography remains coherent. One meaningful tightening: geode flare aligns breadcrumbs, foreclosing pill option. Closure lands as Charged Poise—sketchbook of “intertwined light and bone” reweights stakes with visible tool-cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Micro-setting succeeds: muscovite sliver functions as tactile compass and crystalline template, constraining every mapping move; neon-blue rigs supply shifting praxis. Ozone/acrylic smell threads through beats, grounding time elapsed since shock. Spatial choreography clean—Mara’s boots click distance before her shoulder-touch signals alliance shift. Final image of glowing lines on paper compresses studio into charged canvas.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—access hidden cognition without corporate pills—signaled in first paragraph and tightens when leaked memo confirms “adverse synaptic rewiring.” One escalation: geode alignment moment eliminates fallback to pills. Price paid is literal nerve burn and social derision risk (refusal of therapy). Agency remains internal-decision driven under causal lens; coincidence used only for complication (static), never resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: authentic pattern vs. forced connectivity. Geode’s millennia-grown precision argues against pharma shortcuts without sermonizing. Subtext lives in gesture—Mara tracing crystal vein equals tentative trust. Final reconfiguration: illumination found inside body, not market—no moral spelled, but resonance reweights earlier hologram as lived map, not product.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: scientific diction (“fractally precise,” “adverse synaptic rewiring”) filtered through artist’s synesthetic palette. Rhythm accelerates during geode-flare beat, short clauses mimic neural spike. Dialogue sparse but idiom-differentiated—Mara’s “willowglass hope” softens Elias’s brittle tech-speech. No POV slippage; interiority stays bounded to what burnt nerves could know.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>High information density: sentences twin sensory with concept (“ozone and acrylic,” “neural map… glowing like constellations”). Occasional scaffold: “The pills? They’re…” rhetorical questions repeat. Metaphors clean but risk stacking (“fractally precise” used thrice). Closure line uncluttered; earns lift. Minor loop −0.2 for repetitive interrogatives mid-paragraph.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Takes ubiquitous “telepathy drug” trope but reframes via somatic cartography and mineral lattice—fresh without gimmick. Static shock as neural tagger is non-obvious yet credible. Risk: refusal of recall therapy in favor of self-mined pattern—stakes personalized, not globe-doom. Specificity of muscovite crystallography versus pharma sludge feels inevitable post-closure. Grandma heirloom threads memory into science, avoiding cold tech-only tale.</comment>
