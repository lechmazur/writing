<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Lirael’s interiority is vivid—her fingers tremble, her breath syncs with aurora pulses—yet her contradictory impulses (preserve vs. risk collapse) stay mostly summarized, not enacted in a single, pressured beat. The beautician-mortician duality is shown through the moonlight-painting and lullaby choices, but the final renunciation (grotto intact, echo safe) costs her exhaustion rather than a visible path foreclosed. Micro-choices are present, yet the emotional hierarchy between “save Elion” and “save all echoes” is asserted, not dramatized with a moment of irreversible trade-off. Meets 9- gate: cost visible, lens held; falls short of 9+ because the decisive internal contradiction is not crystallized in-scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Causal lens holds throughout: because the emerald dims, Lirael must act; because she embellishes, the pool cracks; because she sings, the chip stabilizes—each link tightens options. Closure is Earned Stasis: she saves the echo but accepts perpetual endangerment of the grotto, paid with on-page fatigue and the aurora’s kiss. Cost is legible—“she slumped forward, exhausted”—and the persistent constraint (threshold forever fragile) shapes future tactics. No orientation debt; transitions clean within single scene; one sharpening move suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Skyborne grotto, liquid-starlight pool, obsidian runes, and aurora are rendered through Lirael’s tool-trained gaze—she notices lattice integrity, moss bloom, frequency harmonies—so setting actively constrains technique. Micro-setting (emerald chip) becomes the crucible: its lattice limits how much echo it can bear, thus deciding her embellishment gamble. Spatial choreography is flawless—every kneel, lift, paint stroke tracks against the cracking pool. Final image reweights the place: “stillness was never truly still” turns setting into a waiting canvas, charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“one last spark before oblivion”—is signaled on page 1 and tightened when pool fissures leak starlight, foreclosing the option to repeat this ritual risk-free. Agency is continuous: her decision to embellish with moonlight symbols directly causes the stabilization and the grotto’s continued peril. Cost is on-page: physical drain, future threshold fragility. No coincidence; escalation is driven by her artistic gamble under rising physical collapse pressure. Sufficient for 8-band; reaches 8.6 because the price is visible and persistent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the paradox of preservation-through-beautification: embalming as art, art as mortal risk. Subtext carried in gesture—painting protection runes while humming a lullaby—renders the theme without statement. Final image reframes stillness as canvas, reweighting the premise that beauty can defy oblivion, yet only by accepting perpetual vulnerability. No moralizing; resonance comes from the exhausted aurora kiss. Complexity embraced: salvation and ruin coexist in one polished sphere.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Lirael’s perceptual signature—silver spectacles, frequency listening, cosmetic tremor—no head-hop. Diction skews tactile and artisanal: “threads through a loom,” “pendulum’s swing,” matching beautician-mortician precision. Rhythm mirrors aurora pulses in sentence cadence; compression under pressure (“Infuse,” she breathed) without syntactic monotony. No dialogue, so voice carries all; prose itself becomes character instrument. Pattern of lyric repetition (“one last spark”) taught early and paid off in final line.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences fuse sensory, emotional, and causal work—“The chip flared, its light piercing the grotto’s twilight” advances infusion beat, shows stakes, keeps momentum. Metaphors are coherent—lattice, loom, pendulum—all belong to craft lexicon, no mixed logic. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new tactical or sensory intel. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; paragraph cuts land on micro-turns. Artifacts absent; closing line “stillness was never truly still” earns its paradox without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Combines embalming, aurora cosmology, and chip-based soul-capture into a fresh synthesis; trope transformation comes via beautician logic—moonlight varnish as stabilizer. Specificity of star-weaver Elion’s echo (bell-laugh, star-mending song) prevents generic “soul” abstraction. Risk in letting grotto crack feels bold; no retreat into safety. Final reconfiguration inevitable in hindsight: beauty preserves but only by leaving canvas perpetually open. Not 9+ only because premise ancestry (memory-crystal soul-storage) remains faintly recognizable beneath the cosmetic twist.</comment>
