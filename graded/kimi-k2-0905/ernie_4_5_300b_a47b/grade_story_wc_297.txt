<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lirael’s scars ache and guide her, but the interiority drifts into abstract self-diagnosis (“constellation of white lines”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The golden-eyed double voices the thematic payoff aloud, stealing the moment of earned realization from Lirael’s own choice. No visible micro-choice in the final beat—she simply “walked out”—so the renunciation feels declared, not dramatized. Diagnostic label-speak in peak beat triggers −0.5; cap applied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the two-moon sky reweights the covenant with undeniable cost. Causal lens holds: clipping-scar link → labyrinth reappearance → merger. Orientation clean by 120 words. Yet the decisive change is voiced by the double, not enacted by Lirael, softening the felt cost. Still, the image reconfigures stakes, satisfying the 9+ quick test borderline.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The glade’s cobalt light and ozone-elderberry taste create tactile bias; the clipping functions as micro-setting, pressed to palm and heart, constraining the final merge. Spatial choreography stays clean across hedge shifts. Two-moon final image charges the reconfigured covenant. Meets 9+ gate: recurring object (clipping) alters final tactic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—mend the covenant—signaled early; pressure tightens when labyrinth reappears and scars burn, foreclosing retreat. Agency moment: pressing clipping to heart splits world, visible price paid. Escalation driven by protagonist under causal lens. Cost legible; meets 9+ quick test threshold.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from scar-as-wound rather than lecture; “intersection of dreams” stays implicit. Final two-moon image offers non-literal reweighting without moral. Yet the golden double’s spoken thesis (“fear is a mirror”) edges toward echo −0.4. Still, resonance lingers through image, not assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays stable, no head-hop. Diction—“time pooled like spilled ink,” “sutured shut”—is patterned, taught early, paid off in final sky slit. Perceptual signature filters world through root-bound, scar-mapping attention. Rhythm accelerates into clipped clauses during labyrinth split; no register drift. Meets 9+ quick test: distinct texture under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>High information density: “edges were serrated, as if gnawed by time itself” does double sensory-concept work. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; metaphors stay coherent. One mixed vehicle: “time pooled like spilled ink” then “sutured shut” (liquid → solid) but pattern holds. Closure line clean; no artifact touches final beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: scar-map + topiary clipping + time-bleed labyrinth feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in compressed lyric future-fantasy pays off: two-moon reprice is memorable. Avoids stock portal-fantasy beats by keeping trauma internalized. Specific detail—“ozone and elderberries”—anchors abstraction. Within-band bonus +0.3 for bold cohesion.</comment>
