<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Jorin’s “quiet fire” is declared, not dramatized; the only embodied cost is the brief shard-cutting, which reads as ritual rather than earned wound. Interiority stays generic (“his throat tightened”) and never contradicts itself; we get no micro-choice that shows meekness colliding with resolve. The orb acceptance is smooth but foregone, so the arc is flat. Meets baseline credibility, misses contradiction-in-scene required for 7+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: silk → mine → shard trial → orb → bloom. Closure lands with visible planetary change, but the personal price is abstract (warmth in palm) rather than a lasting constraint on Jorin. Orientation is swift; no lens ambiguity. One soft reset: the orchard instantly re-blooms, muting cost. Sufficient tightening for 7-band, but lacks persistent price for 8+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Floating ribcage arches, crystalline tunnel walls, and the forge’s skeletal shadow give tactile, POV-filtered specificity. The silk’s azure glow is reused to light the final cavern, marrying object and atmosphere. Environment never blocks or enables choice—Jorin could have walked any tunnel—so setting decorates rather than constrains. Still, sensory economy is strong and the image reappears at closure, earning high 7s.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes (“Veyra dies”) are declared early but never localized—no withered fruit on Jorin’s tongue or coin lost to blight. Pressure escalates only once: shards cut skin; no tactical adaptation follows. The trial is endured, not chosen, so agency is thin. Meets single-tightening rule for 600-word scope, but low visceral cost keeps it sub-7.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Theme of “resilience from rubble” is stated by Jorin and Lira, then echoed in the final line; subtext is therefore overt. No ironic gap opens between what Jorin believes and what the reader sees. The orchards’ sudden bloom simplifies the moral—endurance equals instant repair—leaving no lingering ambiguity. Emergent but not nuanced.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Third-limited stays close to Jorin’s tool-centric gaze; diction is metallic, tactile, unobtrusive. No dialogue voice to test; interior register stable. One filter-verb cluster (“he felt,” “he knew”) slips in during the spectral encounter, but pressure remains. Rhythm breathes with descent and trial. Clean, not yet distinctive enough for 8+.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length; openings avoid template cadence. Figurative control good except “ancient ribcages” mixed with “skeletal hand” in same paragraph—minor metaphor overlap. No loops or scaffold. High information density: hammer-light, shard-blood, orb-warmth compress world, body, tool. One notch below 8+ only because no phrase surprises.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Silk-as-planetary-soul-key refreshes the trope of magic cloth; mine-as-sealed-pain is familiar but paired effectively. Risk is moderate—quiet hero endures cosmic wound—but resolution retreats to instant Eden, muting complexity. Specific planetary arches and blacksmith POV supply freshness, yet the narrative arc could transplant to any dying agrarian world. Solid mid-7 potential, capped by easy restoration.</comment>
