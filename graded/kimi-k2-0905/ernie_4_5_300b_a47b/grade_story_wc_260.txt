<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is concrete—her trembling hands, the weight of betrayal, the way sunlight once coaxed plants back—yet the “shedding” epiphany is articulated more than dramatized, nudging into diagnostic label-speak at the hinge moment. The ethical calculus is present and personal, but the micro-choice that commits her to the new stance (the exact second she decides to keep softness) is elided; we see the adhesive dry, not the irrevocable yes. Emotional layering is credible; still, the beat where fear of naïveté is actually jettisoned happens offstage, muting cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each sensory detail thickens the stake of “soft v. hard” until the rebuilt tail reframes survival. Orientation is secured by word 60 (“workshop’s rafters,” “Lira,” “after the con”). Closure lands as Charged Poise—the iridescent tail held to dawn—repricing softness as viable armor; cost is felt in the quiet smile after a sleepless night. No causal break; one meaningful tightening when she sees the tail as “map,” foreclosing retreat to cynicism.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Mist, starlight, and the terrarium glass form a micro-setting that literally filters her choices—she works under a skylight that dictatesvisibility and metaphorical “stars” guidance. The chameleon tail functions as setting-as-tool, constraining every delicate placement. Spatial choreography is clean; drawer creak, velvet cloth, and adhesive vile remain tracked. While broader geography is vague, the workshop body-object network satisfies the 9+ gate for environment constraining choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Dominant stake—soft compassion vs. self-protection—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when the tail is read as proof fragility can be strength. Escalation is textural: each scale she affixe increases density of commitment; option to harden is foreclosed not by event but by accrued image. Cost is visible in physical fatigue and the risk of again being duped, yet the price feels conceptual more than visceral; a slightly sharper loss (a tool slips, blood on scale) would have pushed higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tail-as-map image rather than assertion; no moralizing final sentence. Subtext resides in silence—she talks to an absent chameleon, underscoring loneliness of principle. The reframing of “shedding” from shame to strategy offers resonant reconfiguration without platitude. Ambiguity lingers: the world outside remains predatory, but her reclaimed softness is now active, not naïve.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Lira’s perceptual filter: “mist curled…like a ghost’s breath” is hers, not scenic tourism. Syntax mirrors her precision—long, careful clauses during reconstruction, then a short uplift at dawn. No dialogue, so voice purity is high; register never drifts. Rhythm breathes with scene tempo, climaxing in the ripple of color across the finished tail.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is varied; sentence openings rotate. One scaffold paraphrase loop: “she’d believed…she’d believed” could compress. Metaphors stay coherent—no mixed vehicles. High information density: “biodegradable adhesive” does world and character work. No artifact in final third; closure image remains luminous, not dulled.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh angle: wildlife-rescue fraud survivor rebuilds not just an animal part but her ethical stance via that part. Tail-as-map is specific, not generic symbol. Conceptual risk—quiet lyric ending without confrontational antagonist—pays off under accumulative lens. Could edge higher if tail’s material properties (color shift under stress) had fed back into her immediate tactics.</comment>
