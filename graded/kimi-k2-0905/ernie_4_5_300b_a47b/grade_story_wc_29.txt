<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lila’s cautious hope is shown through tactile micro-choices—trembling hands, the coffee sip—but her interior contradiction (scientist’s doubt vs. believer’s resolve) stays stated more than dramatized. The final refusal to flinch under the voice-in-her-skull crystallizes her stance, yet the cost feels intellectual rather than visceral because prior beats summarize stakes instead of embodying them.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: anomaly → funding threat → subsonic gambit → starlight truce, each beat shrinking options. Closure lands as Charged Poise—she tapes the singed chart up, a visible price and open invitation to round two—so the lens stays causal with cost legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Radio-basement maze of cables and vintage rigs is handled, not catalogued; the transmitter’s whine and oscilloscope green constrain her timing and signal choice. Campus quad arguments remain off-stage rumor, so the wider world stays slightly generic, but the station itself functions as micro-setting that charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keep the station alive and the sky sane—tightens when the board threatens funds, then again when retaliation becomes psychic. One meaningful deepening: the starlight chime replaces expected backlash, shifting the game from destruction to invitation; cost is the perpetual vigilance she accepts by pinning the taunting chart overhead.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme—knowledge as negotiation rather than conquest—emerges through her refusal to escalate with force; the surrender/truce sound is the non-verbal answer. Subtext of academic precarity versus cosmic scale is felt, but the community divide stays asserted more than explored, muting resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Lila’s perceptual filter: “hum of the university radio station’s transmitter buzzing beneath her fingertips” is tactile and idiosyncratic. Occasional lyric uplift—“wind chimes made of starlight”—fits the speculative frame without breaking psychic distance; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, information-dense; sentences vary in length to match rising transmitter whine. One scaffold loop—“the tricksters… the tricksters”—in adjacent clauses, but it occurs early and doesn’t recur at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Cosmic tricksters vs. campus radio engineer is fresh synthesis; using subsonics to “answer dissonance with harmony” reframes SETI tropes into a sound-engineer’s chess match. Risk lies in the quiet truce beat—works because the starlight chime reconfigures stakes rather than offering victory.</comment>
