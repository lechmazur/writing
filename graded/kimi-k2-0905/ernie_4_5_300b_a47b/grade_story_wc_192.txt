<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—self-protective isolation vs the need to re-connect—are dramatized in concrete gestures (hand on cold ring, trembling fingers brushing Kael’s shadow). The “tender shadow keeper” label stays mostly ornamental; her interiority slips into diagnostic shorthand (“emptiness had become a cage”) rather than embodied contradiction at the climax. Still, her final grip on Kael’s hand crystallizes a credible micro-choice that costs her prior absolutism, earning a modest but visible shift.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Closure is cleanly landed via Earned Stasis: Elara’s encroachment re-opens the threshold, foreclosing her zero-contact rule with felt cost (“sanctuary shuddered”). Causal chain is lean—knock summons Kael, reunion stresses the sanctuary—but causality holds. Orientation anchor (who/where) arrives before 120 words; no lens ambiguity. The doorknocker’s prior set-up behind a loose stone keeps the conduit rule consistent and pays off at the end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>“Ashen charcoal sanctuary under starlight” is filtered through Elara’s smoke-tasted breath and scar-touched ring, turning setting into micro-setting that constrains her ritual choices. Spatial choreography is clean: Kael’s shadow stretches toward but does not cross until the beat of voluntary encroachment. The sanctuary’s shudder when threshold is crossed supplies a concrete environmental reprice at closure, satisfying the 9+ gate. Some phrases edge purple (“air tasted of old smoke and forgotten prayers”) but rhythm supports the lyric frame.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve vs breach the threshold—tightens once: Elara’s encroachment is the decisive escalation that visibly costs the sanctuary’s stability. No reversals beyond the single crossing, but that act narrows her future options under Causal lens. Cost is legible in the shudder and scent-shift. Secondary pressure (Kael’s resentment) stays verbal and does not compound tactics, keeping this just shy of high-band intensity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of “holding the line between memory and oblivion” emerges through the sanctuary’s physical rule-set rather than exposition. Subtext lives in silence: the pair never discuss past or future, only the present pressure of the threshold. Final image—hand clasp in dark—non-literally answers the core question: connection requires the very breach that endangers the sanctuary. No moralizing line, though “teach suffocating to breathe” flirts with thematic echo; luckily it is voiced early and not repeated at the end.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains consistent distance and perceptual signature: smoke on tongue, iron pitting under fingertip. Rhythm modulates—short clauses under starlight give way to longer breath units at dawn—mirroring the loosening of Elara’s isolation rule. No dialogue artifacts; Kael’s diction (“You burned that bridge”) carries regional grit distinct from Elara’s interior cadence. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is mostly clean; one scaffold loop (“the line… the line…”) appears in paragraph 1 but does not recur. Mixed metaphors (“emptiness had grown heavier”) are minor and paid off by embodied grip at the end. Information density is high—each sentence advances image or motive. No artifacts in closure beat, allowing 9+ eligibility in other categories.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>“Doorknocker as portal through scars” offers a fresh inflection on the familiar summoned-lover trope; the sanctuary’s rule that crossing scars literally destabilizes space feels specific to this text. Risk is moderate—lyric ellipsis, single-scene stasis—but the concept commits fully. Transformation test passes: swap ring for generic door and entire causal hinge collapses. No close echoes of canonical scenes.</comment>
