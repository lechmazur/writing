<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lira’s pacifist stance and inherited mission are stated rather than embodied; no moment forces her to test or betray that creed, so the arc is static. The final “revolution” is asserted, not dramatized—no visible cost or contradiction proves she has staked anything. Interiority drifts into abstraction (“the farm was a manifesto”) that tells us weight instead of letting us feel it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The closure image—burying the scrap while humming—delivers a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights “quiet” from slogan to seed, satisfying the lens. Causality is thin: the decision to plant the scrap is not opposed or complicated, merely arrived at via reflection, so the beat feels foregone. Orientation is swift and the single-scene default is met; no structural violations, but the lack of friction keeps the score below the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Glass dome, crimson cacti, and glittering sand are tactile, selective, and filtered through Lira’s attention; heat and thorns guide her micro-movements. The ballast scrap’s frayed canvas and uneven engraving serve as micro-setting that constrains the final planting action. Sensory layering is economical and purposeful, never touristic; the dome’s refracted sunset charges the closing image with conceptual heat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Stakes are thematic—preserve father’s pacifist legacy—but no external or internal force threatens that goal; pressure is atmospheric, not tactical. The single “tightening” is the decision to bury the scrap, yet it encounters zero resistance, cost, or risk, so escalation is flat. Agency is present but unopposed, landing the story in the mid-band for conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>“Quiet” as cultivated focus emerges organically through image and action rather than statement; the final burial lets the theme seed itself. The piece resists moral binaries and allows the desert roses to embody both confinement and flourishing—ambiguity that lingers. A slight thematic echo in the last paragraph (“the farm…had become a revolution”) is abstract enough to avoid sermon, but still trims the top edge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person lyrical voice maintains consistent distance and perceptual signature—heat, thorn, glitter—rooted in Lira’s sensory priorities. Syntax modulates from long reflective loops to clipped planting motions, mirroring the shift from memory to action. No dialogue appears; therefore dialogue bullets are waived. Free-indirect moments stay clean and anchored.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is vivid and propulsive, with high information density: one sentence often layers sensory data, memory cue, and metaphor without clogging. Occasional poetic uplift (“sand glittered like fractured starlight”) risks prettiness but stays tethered to POV. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; grammar and spatial tracking are clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Fusing airship ballast with desert permaculture under a glass dome feels fresh and specific; the pacifist daughter repurposing a bounty-hunter’s knife into a planting tool is a sharp inversion. The “quiet” engraving repurposed as seed-label offers a conceptual reprise that grows from prior particulars. While post-collapse oasis farming is familiar, the exact constellation and the final sowing of the word itself lift the piece above template.</comment>
