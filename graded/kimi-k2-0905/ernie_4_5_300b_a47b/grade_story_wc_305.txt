<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lirael’s interiority is mostly concrete (fingernails in bark, shell weight), but the moment of forgiveness three years ago is delivered as retrospective label—“a quiet understanding”—rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. Elara’s return of the hairpin is externally motivated by off-stage “guilt,” so Lirael’s choice to trust again feels eased rather than earned in-scene. Still, the climbing/tree-thinking habit tracks as a character-specific ritual that reveals hierarchy of values. Micro-choice at the end—pinning the shell and hairpin together—visibly forecloses vengeance and lands a credible Earned Stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: because Elara stole → therefore exile → because merchant haunted → therefore return → therefore Lirael can choose reconciliation. Orientation anchors (who/where) arrive within 60 words; no debt. Single continuous scene respects scope; transition-free. Closure is a Charged Poise: pinning both shells crystallizes the cycle rule and carries felt social cost—trust now lives in the object. Off-stage merchant return is the one soft coincidence, but it complicates rather than resolves, so allowed under Situational lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Umbral grotto above clouds is atmospherically distinct—“clouds pooled like liquid silver” is a visual anchor reused with variation. Elderwood tree operates as micro-setting that literally supports the choice perch; bark texture guides climb pacing. Spatial choreography is clean: climb-descend distance tracked, herbs basket placed, no impossible positions. Setting does not yet constrain tactics to 9+ level—tree could be any tree, grotto any mist—but it suffuses tone and filters perception consistently.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can trust be re-won?—is signaled early and tightened when the hairpin physically returns. One meaningful tightening: the shell discovery links to the hairpin’s missing scallop, forcing Lirael to test her forgiveness rhetoric against tangible evidence. Cost is visible—she trembles, then pins both shells, publicly locking her stance. Escalation is modest but complete for 700-word frame; no reversal overload.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of cyclical forgiveness emerges through concrete returns (hairpin, shell, sister) rather than sermon. Final image of dual shells pinned in hair reweights “rebirth” from abstraction to wearable cost. Subtext in Elara’s downcast eyes and hesitant smile carries unspoken penance, avoiding explanatory dialogue. No final-paragraph thesis statement; resonance is left hanging in vineyard hush, satisfying CR criterion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains clean focalization; no head-hopping. Prose texture favors liquid, vineyard, elderwood—lexicon stays within rustic grotto register. Rhythm modulates: longer sensory sentences during perch calm, shorter clauses when Elara appears. Filter verbs minimal; perception is body-close (“fingers dug,” “chest tightened”). Dialogue sparse but natural—“I brought you something”—carries subtext of reparation. Voice distinction between sisters is slight, yet forgiven/broken tension compensates.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies; no template cadence runs. Mixed metaphors absent—“vineyard hush” is extended with consistency. Information density high: one sentence often nails motion + metaphor + interior tilt (“shell...worn smooth by time” implies erosion of anger). Minor paraphrase loop at “cycle of rebirth” reiterated three times; costs −0.2. Opening and closing lines anchor and resolve with echoing hush, giving cadence payoff. No artifacts in closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Fantasy return-of-stolen-heirloom is familiar, but cloud-top grotto and vineyard-hush acoustics give local specificity. Scallop-as-renewal is old symbol, yet integrated into hairpin architecture so object and theme merge organically. Risk level moderate—quiet lyric interior rather than twist—but execution coherent. Transformation test survives: setting and tactile tree climb could not swap with generic forest without loss. Freshness sits just above template, not revolutionary.</comment>
