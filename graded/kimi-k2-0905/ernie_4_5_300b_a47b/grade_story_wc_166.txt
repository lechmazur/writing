<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lirael’s ache for renewal is concrete (fading constellations on her skin) and every micro-gesture (pressing dust to collarbone, burning stylus strokes) externalizes her contradictory needs to fledge and anchor. The spontaneous-anchor trait is not merely labeled: it physically limits her leaps and forces her to dance in tension with gravity, so the body-as-crucible test is met. No interior diagnostic clichés; pain is felt, not explained. The final stance—elective exile in the in-between—is credibly foreclosed by the cost glimpsed in the garden’s retreat and the verse’s fading glow.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the garden recedes, the verse will fade, yet Lirael’s “elective exile” crystallizes with undeniable social/ontological cost. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of shedding/anchoring intensifies until the final image reweights the stake. Causality holds: because she steals the dust → dances → pens the verse, therefore she is now exiled from both ban-ruled world and full transcendence. No orientation debt: who/where/when anchored by word 70 (“twilight garden’s star-spangled canopy”).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The twilight garden is not backdrop but tool: the pulsing moss literally cushions and records her footfalls, constellations above mirror the ones fading on her skin, and the dimming at the end signals the cost she pays. Sensory triangulation (luminous mist under bare feet, moonstone adhering to pores) keeps spatial tracking clean. Object-as-setting qualifies: the moonstone dust is both terrain and catalyst that rewrites her flesh. One minor forced phrase—“obsidian grace” feels authorial rather than POV-filtered, preventing 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—personal renewal versus ban-reinforced erasure—tightens the moment the dust adheres and the stylus burns; no abstract cosmic threat required. Escalation is textural: each dance coil increases density until the garden itself trembles and options narrow to one illegal inscription. Cost is visibly paid in searing flesh and the irreversible exile announced in the last paragraph. Agency is hers: she steals, dances, writes—no external savior.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of nostalgic transgression emerges solely through action: the ban is never lectured, only violated, so the story enacts its argument rather than stating it. Subtext thickens when old hymns echo only after the stylus breaks skin—implication that memory needs corporeal scars. Final image of “obsidian grace” serves as Conceptual Repricing: grace is no longer celestial but mineral, heavy, outlawed. Avoids tidy moral; reader must decide if the burn was worth exile.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-limited interiority stays strictly inside Lirael’s sensorium; no filter-verb stacks. Perceptual signature is dancer-centric: gravity is a “suggestion,” silence is measured “between notes,” giving synesthetic tilt without showing off. Rhythm modulates—long, tide-like sentences build to short, hot stylus strokes—mirroring the escalation. One register slip: “conceptual repricing” diction in narration momentarily pops the lens, preventing 9.0.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High information density: single sentences deliver setting, tool, and stake (“Archive of Lost Things, where relics of the Before were locked away”). Metaphors are physically coherent—stars swirl like a cloak only while she hangs mid-air, then settle. No synonym churn or template cadence; sentence openings vary. Micro-loop: “obsidian grace” appears twice without new charge, a −0.2 artifact that keeps the score sub-9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Tide-dancer who pens starlight into skin feels genuinely new; combines oceanic mystic with body-mod outlaw in one compressed arc. “Nostalgia ban” reframes standard dystopia into affect-policing, a fresh angle. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped, because the moonstone dust and collarbone inscription are irreducibly specific. Risk—lyric density over causal turns—pays off via coherent closure image.</comment>
