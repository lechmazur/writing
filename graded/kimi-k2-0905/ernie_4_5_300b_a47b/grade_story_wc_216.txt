<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is textured—frayed cufflinks, palm on cold wall, the urn fragment’s weight—yet his emotional turns hinge on abstract realizations (“time wasn’t absence but layering”) rather than embodied contradiction. The final renunciation is credible: he walks away lighter, numbers now meaningless, carrying the cost of having seen his wife’s laugh. Still, the micro-choice that triggers the climax—placing the shard beside the coil—reads more symbolic than driven by a prior, legible stake. Enough contradiction pulses to satisfy the 9- gate, but not with the seamless cost-charge required for 8.8+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the mercury sphere and wife’s flicker reweight Elias’s ledger-obsessed world, costing him his former metric of time. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each described object thickens the “decay of moments” until the final image crystallizes. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (emerald silo / twilight) and the capsule’s location is foreshadowed via architect’s notes, so no penalty. One minor causality wobble: the urn fragment’s sudden stilling of mercury feels like late-rule magic rather than seeded physics, but the pattern is taught early enough to waive a deduction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The silo’s corrugated moss, metallic tang, and sloshing mercury are sensually selective and guide choice—Elias kneels only where dust reveals the hatch. Environment constrains the final image: the mercury sphere forms inside this exact container, making the silo itself the crucible. micro-setting qualifies (the urn shard as “bridge”) and charges closure. Minor over-reliance on visual; other senses appear but never dominate a beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover the feel of passing time—signals early and tightens when the capsule’s broken mechanisms mock that quest. Agency: Elias’s cataloguing of relics is an active tactic that eventually rewrites the rules (mercury sphere = earned reconfiguration). Cost is legible: he forfeits numerical certainty and carries permanent perceptual shift. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversal, but the lens-appropriate intensification holds.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particularity: objects as memory vessels, entropy as the true timekeeper. Subtext lives in gesture—the unspoken laugh Elias forgot—never sermonized. Final image reweights earlier motifs without moralizing: “whispers of other timekeepers” in garage-sale clutter. Avoids tidy binaries; ambiguity lingers about whether the whispers are real or projected.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly lashed to Elias’s banker-bred precision: “ledger entries he’d once obsessed over.” Syntax lengthens in calmer beats, fragments under revelation (“suddenly”). No dialogue, so no voice-drift risk. Perceptual signature—numbers dissolving into static, mercury defying gravity—remains consistent and character-bound.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene temperature—short clauses at mercury sphere moment, expansive ones during twilight exit. No template cadence; sentence openings vary. One mixed metaphor (“language losing its syntax”) but it’s brief and pattern-taught. Information density high: one sentence often layers setting, backstory, and emotional tilt. Minor filter verb clusters (“he realized”) but never in the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—timekeeper decoding entropy via thrift-store prose—is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Urn fragment / mercury pairing repurposes familiar grief-object into cosmological instrument. Risky lyric compression (garage-sale whisper coda) pays off by widening the speculative frame. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped: the emerald silo’s rust and moss are inseparable from the entropy thesis.</comment>
