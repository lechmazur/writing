<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Elias’s motivation—guarding “your own spark of defiance”—is declared rather than dramatized; we never see him risk anything tangible or feel a concrete loss. His interiority is limited to grinning and quoting poetry, so the contradictory impulses that would make the final garden reveal feel earned are missing. Lillian functions as a gatekeeper rather than a crucible, so the relationship pressure bullet is moot. The “earned place” moment is too smooth: the moths point, the club applauds, no visible cost is exacted for entry.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Causal chain holds: coded phrase → seed quest → orchid test → hidden door → club vote → luminous garden. Orientation is clean inside 120 words. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the glowing garden is now legible from satellites, a public defiance whose cost is the certainty of surveillance reprisal—felt even though not yet enacted. One soft spot: the seed’s “Class-3 disruptor” label is exposition dropped at the table rather than a constraint that shapes tactics during the climax.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Greenhouse humidity, carnivorous plants, and insect choreography are vividly selective, filtering through Elias’s rogue-scholar awe. The Venus-flytrap collar lean, moth-QR pinned board, and glowing soil final image all charge choices or reconfigure stakes. Minor slip: “late-afternoon light” is the only temporal cue; we never feel the clock that “thoughts become taxable” implies. Still, the orchid corridor spatial track is flawless and the living arrow moment fuses setting with plot pivot.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can Elias earn trust and amplify resistance—tightens through the pheromone test and the seed’s public deployment. The escalation is coherent but gentle: failure risk is implied (club rejection, civic surveillance) yet never made visceral; the orchid swarm carries no jeopardy beyond symbolic_pass/fail. The final garden glow is a beautiful widening, not a narrowing, of options. Cost is conceptual (exposure) rather than tangible, sufficient for this length but not gut-level.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of covert language versus surveillance emerges through seed, moth-QR, and最终 glowing Morse garden rather than sermon. “After thoughts become taxable” is reiterated twice; the second use in Elias’s closing line edges toward Echo but is saved by its integration into the garden image. The piece resists moral binaries: secrecy is both refuge and exposure, a complexity left charged rather than resolved. Subtext in gesture—Lillian’s sigh, Mabel’s tapping—keeps exposition lean.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person roams close to Elias, sustaining a playful, slightly mannered diction (“ink-stained fingers,” “oblique poetry”) that fits his rogue-scholar persona. No head-hop; perceptual signature stays anchored to his noticing. Dialogue is sparse but tonally consistent; Lillian’s crisp statements contrast with Elias’s florid quips without either voice slipping into explanatory prose. Filter verbs minimal; rhythm accelerates appropriately during the orchid release and slows for the seed pulse.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is generally clean and vivid, but metaphor density spikes in the greenhouse intro (“snap-jaws glinting,” “humid air clung”) without pattern justification, creating momentary purple tint. One template cadence run: “Elias grinned” appears twice in four paragraphs. Otherwise syntax varies, verbs stay strong, and paragraph cuts are purposeful. Closure line “The warp had just begun” is crisp, sending reader back to title without redundancy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: seed as biodegradable encryption device, moth antennae as living QR readers, community garden as pixel screen. Entomology greenhouse doubles as espionage salon—an unlikely yet wholly logical mash-up. Risk is taken and paid off: the fantastical seed resonance is introduced early, so the luminous finale feels inevitable not gimmicky. Specificity of Fibonacci beans and prime sunflowers shows research converted into story muscle rather than ornament.</comment>
