<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara's "truth excavator" identity is asserted rather than dramatized—no on-page debunking act until the letter reconstruction. The final choice (sacrifice flawed diamond) is credible, but the interior contradiction between truth-seeking and world-saving is only summarized, not shown in scene. Still, her perceptual specificity ("trees leaned...fingers grasping") keeps the score solid.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: diamond discovery → letters → stillpoint risk → sealing. Closure is a clear Earned Stasis—she pays with the diamond’s loss and accepts ongoing uncertainty about Crane. Cost is visible ("the diamond’s weight gone"). Orientation anchor (who/where/when) arrives by line 5; no penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Radioactive orchard is vivid, selective, and purposeful: glowing apples, dust frozen mid-fall, roots in radioactive loam. Micro-setting (the diamond, the soil markings) directly constrains the final placement act. Atmosphere mirrors interior without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography clean; no white-room lapse.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—seal the stillpoint before wasteland spreads—is signaled early and tightened at the fissure beat. Agency drives every turn: she chooses to read, to carry, to place the flawed diamond; the price is the orchard’s survival at cost of certainty about Crane. One meaningful escalation suffices; no reversals required.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: truth vs. survival, the price of sealing off wonder. Subtext in the diamond’s “curse” reframed as consequence, not supernatural. Final image of cleaner air reweights prior material without moralizing. Avoids tidy thesis; ambiguity lingers about Crane’s fate.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Mara’s perceptual filter; diction ("truth excavator," "patterns") is character-specific. No dialogue, so no voice convergence risk. Rhythm accelerates under pressure—the three-beat sentence run at the fissure mimics heartbeat. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>High information density: every sentence advances image, motive, or world rule. One scaffold loop: “the diamond…diamond…diamond” within five lines—minor, does not obscure closure. Metaphors stay coherent (apples as suns, branches as fingers). Clean grammar, no simultaneity errors.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Fusion of post-apocalyptic orchard + entropy-stasis portal feels fresh; trope inversion—curse as physics leak—not seen often at this scale. Specific detail (symbol soil markings, flawed vs. flawless diamond) keeps concept anchored. Transformation test passes: swap names and the emotional-geology nexus collapses. Risky stillpoint physics paid off.</comment>
