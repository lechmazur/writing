<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s grief for vanishing color is vivid, but her interiority drifts into poetic abstraction (“tapestry of whispers”) that blurs contradictory impulses. The climactic choice—hurl the seed—feels inevitable yet the cost is borne by the orchard, not by her body or value system, so the personal price stays ornamental. Still, her pruning gestures and dream obedience give a concrete occupational spine that lifts her above symbol.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: dissonant waterfall → dream command → harvest sap → seed baptism → rainbow geyser → blossom relay. Orientation lands by line 6; single-scene default met; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): she receives the iridescent blossom, proving the seed’s passage and her perpetual custodianship. Cost is felt in the hollow pocket and the unending task, not in lost self, satisfying the lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Verdant parapet, mossy stones, and churning pool are filtered through Elara’s practiced eye; the waterfall threshold doubles as literal height and magical interface, guiding the final toss. Micro-setting of calloused hands, meteorite knife, and etched seed constrains the ritual steps. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and sound over visual catalog, keeping momentum.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—save the orchard’s color—tightens once: the seed’s demand forces her to risk the last relic. No reversal, but the deepening of sap-collection and rainbow eruption visibly forecloses the option to keep the seed. Price is transferred to the landscape rather than her person, nudging it below the 8.8 gate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of custodial continuity emerges through the relay object (seed → blossom) rather than statement. Final image reweights the premise: wonder is not preserved but passed, making her lifelong labor the cost. Avoids moralizing; the waterfall’s “song” keeps the insight implicit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s perceptual filter: sap “weeps,” petals “flare,” waterfall “trills.” Syntax lengthens during ritual, then shortens at the toss, mirroring breath. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero; diction remains within rural-mythic register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush but disciplined: no loops, clean temporal order, strong verbs (“hurled,” “drank”). Occasional stacked modifiers (“liquid gold,” “radiant hush”) flirt with excess yet serve the fairy-tale cadence. No artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Color-leeching orchard and dream-responsive seed feel fresh, but the “meteorite knife” and “language the trees had forgotten” lean on genre furniture. The relay blossom twist rescues the concept, making the solution also the next burden. Risk is moderate; payoff keeps it above mid-band.</comment>
