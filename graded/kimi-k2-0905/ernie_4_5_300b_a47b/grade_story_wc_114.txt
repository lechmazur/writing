<comment>Lirael’s fever-shift from precision to margin-haunting is vivid, but her final pivot to “carry the truth” is declared twice rather than shown in one irreversible act; the swallowed truth never gains external pressure (no director confrontation, no crew betrayal) so her cost feels internal-only. Micro-choices—pressing forehead to glass, tracing veins—are specific, yet they repeat the same beat of anxious noticing; stronger contradiction or risk inside the station would sharpen the stakes.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands cleanly: the illustration tube under her coat is the visible price (she can’t return) and the herbalist’s line reweights “cracks” as home, a Conceptual Repricing with social cost. Causal chain is present (dream → smudge → office raid → descent) but the raid beat is compressed to a single paragraph of summary; a beat of real-time discovery (hand shaking on a redacted line) would tighten the therefore linkage and lift the score to 8+.</comment>

<comment>The bearberry illustration evolves from prop to root-map; its smudged fibers mirror her own fracture and literally ride against her ribs at exit, charging the final image. Mountain station is sketched with cold glass, rattling pines, auroral shroud—selective, atmospheric, and always filtered through her dazed senses; no occupational clutter, no geographic drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—own the swallowed truth or stay complicit—arrives late (~word 400) and escalation is mostly atmospheric (aurora, wind) rather than an on-page tightening that forecloses a live option; the director never confronts her after the raid, so the “rage” is off-stage rumor. One visible cost exists: she forfeits station shelter, but the choice is internally narrated rather than dramatized under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through recurrence of margins, cracks, and roots: fault-tolerance reframed from machine virtue to human fracture. Final reprise (“soil’s thin…world shows its cracks”) offers quiet resonance without moralizing. The swallowed-truth metaphor stays implicit; the bearberry’s shifting meaning carries the conceptual weight, satisfying the 9+ quick test for non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Percussive, frost-edged diction (“steel barnacle,” “metallic tang,” “auroral sorrow”) stays inside a scientist’s sensorium; syntax lengthens under fever haze, then snaps to short declaratives at departure. No dialogue to distort; free-indirect slips cleanly between oracle jargon and bodily immediacy. Patterned repetition (“margins, literal and metaphorical”) is taught early and pays off in the final line, earning its cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Strong information density—one sentence often layers sensorium, metaphor, and stakes. Minor template cadence in two “she’d never…” / “she also knew…” lines, not severe enough to dull closure. One mixed metaphor (“storm seeped into her bones” beside “metallic tang of swallowed truth”) but physical logic holds. Opening and closing images are razor-clean; no scaffolding or synonym loops.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Fevered oracle vs. failing mountain station is fresh; melding fault-tolerance engineering with botanical resilience gives the concept bite. Risk is moderate—lyric interiority over thriller beats—yet the synthesis feels inevitable. Could edge higher if the station’s seismic lie manifested in a physical micro-crisis (lightning fry console, door jam) to fuse tech and myth.</comment>
