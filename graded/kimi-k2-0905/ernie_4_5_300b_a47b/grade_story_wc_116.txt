<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The keeper’s longing for “to witness change without judgment” is stated repeatedly but never dramatized as an interior contradiction under pressure; choices are largely obedient to the origami map rather than active value tests. No micro-choice shows the cost of loosening judgment—silence simply arrives as gift. The final renunciation is gentle but causally thin because the stakes were never sharpened on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the river’s disappearance crystallizes the keeper’s new stance with undeniable cost (“grip on reality now a faint echo”). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—each fold deepens texture and narrows the empirical world to silence. The origami swan functions as taught pattern, its relaxing folds mirroring the keeper’s release; transitions are legible, lens coherent. However, escalation is almost entirely atmospheric; no concrete obstacle ever truly tests the stated want, so the cost feels gifted rather than earned.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Library, tunnel, cavern, black sand—each locale is rendered through tactile, POV-filtered detail (“roots dangled like question marks,” “air tasted of iron and old rain”). The obsidian river constrains the final image: its backward flow literalizes the conceptual repricing of time. Spatial choreography stays clean; no floating rooms. Environment earns its 9+ gate by charging the closing beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—need for judgment-free silence—is signaled early but remains abstract; no external force or ticking clock concretely threaten failure. Pressure mounts only through imagery density, not through narrowing options or visible price. Agency is largely discovery-walking; the one decisive act (dipping hand) is symbolic rather than tactical. Escalation is therefore atmospheric, acceptable under Accumulative lens but short of the visible cost required for 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme—knowledge as burden, silence as liberation—emerges imagistically via crumbling shelves vs. black river. Final image reweights prior motifs without moralizing: abandoned swan equals relinquished taxonomy. Ambiguity lingers (is silence enlightenment or annihilation?) inviting reflection. One minor drift: “regenerative” is authorial shorthand rather than dramatized concept.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric maintains consistent distance; perceptual signature relies on synesthetic sensory layering (“air hummed,” “silence seeped into bones”). Diction stays within keeper’s antiquarian lexicon; syntax lengthens under calm, shortens at river’s edge. No dialogue, hence no voice contamination. Patterned repetition of fold imagery is taught early and pays off as swan relaxes—legible and purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm; sentences vary in length and stress. Occasional modifier stacks (“moth-eaten tome,” “fractured black”) flirt with overwriting but occur in low-action beats; no clutter in closure. One paraphrase loop: “crumbling peace” appears twice within three sentences. Otherwise clean, high-density compression; environmental metaphors stay coherent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Fusion of origami map + catacomb library + backward river synthesizes fresh mythic topography without genre trapping. Keeper’s renunciation of chronicle duty inverts conventional archive-as-redemption arc. Specificity of paper folds resisting entropy gives abstract idea tactile flesh. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulative structure rather than plot—but executed cleanly, so earns upper-band credit.</comment>
