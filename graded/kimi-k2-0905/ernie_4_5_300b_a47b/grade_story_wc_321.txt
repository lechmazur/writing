<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Kael’s trait—resilient optimism—shows early, collapses under the grotto’s pressure, then rekindles after the merge, giving a visible arc. Interiority stays concrete (“tears streaming down his face” vs. earlier grin). The moment he whispers “Okay” is a micro-choice that crystallizes his hierarchy of values: ferry-keeper duty > personal safety. Cost is felt—ferry, passengers, hourglass all gone—but the beat is summarized, not dramatized live, so the endurance lacks full embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: empty hourglass triggers sideways lurch → radio pattern → dock-layer reveal → commuter merge → ferry dissolution. Closure is a Charged Poise: Kael stands alone, new constellation overhead, life-path foreclosed yet reopened. Cost is legible—“the ferry gone,” “radio silent,” constellation rename. One mild causality quibble: the radio’s “interconnected patterns” mechanics are asserted, not demonstrated, but the effect lands under the Speculative-Trope lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Spectral grotto is more than backdrop—its bioluminescent veins mirror the hourglass shape, guiding Kael’s pattern choice. Micro-setting counts: the empty hourglass and radio function as portable, manipulable terrain. Sensory hierarchy stays tight under crisis—starlight as liquid, hull echo as hollow—reflecting Kael’s narrowed attention. Spatial choreography is clean across the sideways lurch; no impossible positions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—completion for vanished passengers—surfaces by paragraph 3 and tightens when Kael realizes merge = erasure of boundaries. One meaningful turn: the “Okay” consent that narrows his option from passive observer to active collapser. Price is visible—ferry, job, community dissolve. Escalation is linear under Causal lens; no false reversals, though external antagonist remains abstract (time itself).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</question><grade>Theme emerges through image, not statement: unfinished journeys → constellation renamed “Hourglass” = time as bridge not container. Subtext in Kael’s grin-falter-re grin shows endurance as both wound and gift. Final image reweights premise—transience is permanent—without moralizing. One soft echo of “permanent transient” in closing clause skirts overt thesis but stays within lyric allowance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-limited stays locked to Kael; no head-hop. Perceptual signature: maritime lexicon (“deckhand,” “hull shudder”) plus cosmic diction (“liquid starlight,” “prism”) = ferryman-poet hybrid. Rhythm flexes—long anaphoric clauses for grotto awe, staccato “Okay” under pressure. Filter verbs minimal; “He unclipped” keeps agency externalized. One template cadence run—“The ferry… the child… the lover…”—but it serves accumulative memorial effect, taught by context.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High information density: single sentences deliver sensory data + emotional tilt + foreshadowing (“ghost of time”). Metaphors stay coherent—starlight as liquid, fungi as veins—no mixed vehicles. One paraphrase loop: “vanished… vanishing… vanished” within two sentences costs −0.2. Otherwise, rhythm breathes with scene tempo; paragraph cuts are taut. Opening and closing lines earn keep—anchor voice and re-charge motif.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: commuter-ferry as afterlife bureaucratic limbo + sideways time + pattern-radio as ritual tech. Tropes are inverted—the ferryman chooses to burn his own bridge. Specificity grounds novelty: “bioluminescent fungi threading like smoke” is not generic underworld. Risk in collapsing entire vessel mid-scene pays off under Charged Poise closure. Only mild familiarity—hourglass-as-time is well-trod—prevents 9+.</comment>
