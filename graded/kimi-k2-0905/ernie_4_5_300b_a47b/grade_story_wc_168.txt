<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elias’s survivor-guilt and mother-haunting are vivid, but the interiority drifts into thematic self-explanation (“he realized…”) rather than contradictory impulse in scene. The hourglass moment crystallizes change, yet the cost feels pre-assigned by the note, not earned by a micro-choice that risks anything tangible now. Voice remains individual; scar and porcelain read as lived-in extensions of self.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Single-scene causal arc holds: porcelain box opens → frozen sand falls → memory re-ordering → stance shift. Orientation anchors by word 60; no spatial drift. Closure lands as Earned Stasis—he forecloses self-punishment and accepts forest rhythm—with conceptual cost legible in the final “I hear you.” Persistent constraint is the hourglass itself, re-pricing time as cyclical rather than punitive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Ridge, frost, moon, and porcelain are rendered through selective sensory economy; gravel crunch and silk fade anchor body and object. The hourglass functions as micro-setting that constrains the final reconfiguration. Spatial choreography stays clean across the single continuous climb. No environment detail is wasted; each filters through Elias’s fire-reading gaze.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will he release self-blame?—is signaled early and tightened once when sand moves; no option is foreclosed, but knowledge reweights. Agency is interior and observational; cost is conceptual rather than tactical. Escalation is modest but coherent under Accumulative lens; the cadence shift of flowing sand suffices for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>Theme of fire as transformation emerges organically from ash-to-growth imagery and hourglass inversion; no overt thesis stated. Subtext operates in silence—forest “sighs,” stars “pirouette”—inviting reader to complete the universal language. Final image recharges porcelain and sand without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: is acceptance peace or resignation?</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s perceptual filter—scar biting, moonlight as milk. Syntax lengthens under reflection, contracts at “I hear you,” mirroring breath. No head-hopping; diction stays within wilderness-reader lexicon. Distinctive rhythm is maintained without algorithmic patterning.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is lean, lyrical, and mostly loop-free; only minor scaffold—“he’d… he’d… he’d…”—in backstory paragraph. Metaphors (moonlight as milk, celestial lullaby) are consistent and non-contradictory. Opening and closing lines carry propulsion. One paraphrase loop mid-story costs −0.2, keeping it below 8.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fire-trauma plus hourglass-as-time is not novel, yet the fusion of firefighter craft with mother-herbalist cosmology feels specific to this voice. Risk is taken in quiet, interior resolution rather than external blaze. In hindsight the frozen sand “mid-fall” elegantly prefigures the stalled grief. Could swap ridge for any peak, so locality less irreplaceable.</comment>
