<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—yearning to be heard yet terrified of shouting—are embodied in the trembling vial and the low hum she dares release; the micro-choice to exhale her swallowed words into glass is specific, irreversible, and carries the felt cost of possible ridicule. Thalos as secondary pressure works: his unexpected complicity re-casts the garden from ornamental to instrumental, forcing Elara to revise her taxonomy of allies. The endurance smile in rain, tears, and silence is a credible renunciation: she accepts that proof may never be acknowledged, yet the beacon inside the cork now burns for her alone. Only minor erosion: the fisherfolk reaction is summarized, not dramatized, so the social cost is slightly abstracted rather than embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the cork’s steady glow re-weights the premise—whispers can travel—while rain and tears make the cost visceral. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory layer (scent, salt, hum) tightens the texture until the final image crystallizes options. Orientation is clean (who/where/when anchored by line 3). The only hairline slip is the off-stage village reaction; because it is the proof Elara seeks, its summary rather than scene slightly dulls the conceptual cost, keeping the score just sub-9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The cobalt tower, salt-streaked glass, and night-scented garden are not backdrop but tools: the garden’s jasmine is plucked and inhaled, the windowsill becomes an altar, the rain physically mixes with tears. Micro-setting (vial cork) constrains the decisive action—only that sill angle catches dawn, so intent must be whispered there. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elara’s herbalist eye: lavender and moonflower are named, crushed, sweat-dropped; no tourist catalogue. Spatial choreography is flawless: spiral stairs, lantern room, eastern wall garden track cleanly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can a whisper change anything—tightens when Thalos’s grin shifts from antagonism to mentorship, stripping Elara of her victim alibi and forcing her to own the experiment. The humming exhale is the decisive turn that risks exposure; cost is immediate (Thalos’s footsteps, potential shame) and persistent (the cork keeps glowing, proof now private). Under Accumulative lens, scent-salt-hum layers increase density until the final rain-tear solution reweights the stake: the world did listen, just not loudly. Village beat summarized keeps cost from piercing 9.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the inverse of the prompt’s whisper-versus-shout binary: silence can propagate tenderness farther than noise, but the listener must be trained to feel vibration, not volume. The jasmine sprig and glowing cork re-cast communication as botanical and mineral, not verbal—an organic subtext that avoids thesis statement. Final image of tears diluting rain dissolves moral intofelt physiology. Only tiny echo of “whispers travel” in last line nicks the score.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited hovers at a lyric distance that permits synesthetic metaphor (“scent of a garden at night”) yet stays inside Elara’s perceptual signature—she clocks smells before sights, knows plants by folklore names, hears frequencies as tides. Rhythm modulates: long clauses for dawn bleed, staccato for stair creaks, low hum rendered in monosyllables. No head-hop; Thalos’s interior remains opaque, shown only by crinkling parchment grin. Filter verbs kept for voice (“she imagined”) and paid off when imagination becomes tangible glow.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but breathable: participle openers are sequential, not simultaneous; metaphors stay physically coherent (salt-streaked glass, parchment face). No loops or synonym churn; each verb is fresh (“beckon,” “trembled,” “kissed,” “swallowing”). Information multitasks—rain both sets atmosphere and supplies tears mixing with Elara’s. Only one clause borders purple (“dawn bled gold into the bruised sky”) yet it teaches the color palette that recurs in the cork glow, so it earns its keep.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Familiar “lonely lighthouse + magic botanica” is refreshed by treating intent as sonochemistry: vocal hum into glass creates a literal beacon, merging folk herbalism with wave physics. The risk—quiet proof that may never be acknowledged—flips triumph into private glow, a non-obvious moral calculus. Specificity of jasmine at night, salt-streaked cobalt paint, and vial cork as tuning fork makes the synthesis inseparable from this place. Village reaction kept off-stage is the one conventional safety that keeps it shy of 9.</comment>
