<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elias’s earnest naiveté is vivid—we feel the bell’s rim bite his flesh—but his interiority edges toward diagnosing his own brittleness (“clung to the idea…”). The moment he collapses and concedes imperfection crystallizes a credible, costly stance; still, the brief self-explanatory flicker keeps him just shy of the 8-band where full contradiction-in-scene would live.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain is tight: bell-drip → tide-sync → rift-stitch, each beat sliding the risk higher. Closure lands as Charged Poise—“it’s a start” spoken while the bell’s green copper still cuts him—cost is legible and the lens is cleanly Causal throughout. No orientation debt; all anchors (who/where/when) register inside 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The sapphire viaduct is not postcard scenery; its glass curve dictates Elias’s scaffold angle and drip mathematics, re-appears as the surface that bakes and finally cuts him. Micro-setting (oxidized bell, green copper grit under fingernails) rivals the vista for pressure. Early entrance, mid-circuit constraint, and final charged image satisfy the 9+ gate; description never stalls momentum.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—heal rift via bell—tightened once when cracks widen under his real-time tweak; option space narrows to “accept imperfection or lose everything.” Cost is visible: shoulder welts, sun-baked tremor, public mockery. Coincidence only complicates (last fish), never rescues; escalation stays causal under the lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through recurrence of fracture/sync metaphors rather than moral statement; ending reweights “madness” as devotion without roadmap, letting readers feel the cost of partial repair. Subtext operates in Marla’s eye-roll and the fishermen’s lifted spirits rather than exposition. A hair below 8+ because the bell’s symbolic shift is slightly underlined by Elias’s spoken coda rather than left pure-image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person close stays locked to Elias; perceptual signature is consistent—hears viaduct “hum,” feels bell “dig,” thinks in tide charts. Syntax tightens under fatigue: fragments like “He didn’t answer. He didn’t know.” register the stress. Dialogue limited but differentiated—Marla’s snorts vs. Elias’s breathless optimism—no head-hop or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Strong read-aloud cadence, varied sentence openings, no scaffold loops. Occasional intensifier clusters (“earnestly naive grin unwavering”) flirt with over-modification but occur pre-peak, not in closure zone. Metaphors stay coherent: glass bridge as “frozen light” aligns with sunrise refraction without mixed vehicles. No typos or pronoun drift; high density throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fusion of climate-anxiety fantasy with DIY steampunk magecraft feels fresh; “lukewarm mage” who literally tunes drips to cosmic rift is non-obvious. Transformation test passes—swap out the bell-drip science and the plot collapses. Dinged slightly because the apprentice-failure backstory is familiar scaffolding around an otherwise original premise.</comment>
