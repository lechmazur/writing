<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clara’s grief-turned-rebellion is credibly embodied in tactile micro-choices (cradling board, setting pieces on moss). The “hears unspoken words” gift is shown rather than told when she answers Lila’s silent scream. Lila’s arc from *I’m alone* to *I’m learning* is legible and earned, though her father-feelings are relayed more via Clara than through her own risky micro-choices. Cost is present but pooled in shared mood rather than a sharp, personal stake-loss.</comment>

<comment>Single-scene causality holds: runaway pawn → grotto discovery → night play → dawn covenant. Orientation anchors (who/when/where) arrive within 120 words and are never lost. Closure uses Charged Poise: “let’s keep planting” crystallizes options with felt cost (night-long play, Lila’s first spoken words). Persistent constraint—magnetic grotto as amplifier of silence—shapes every tactical move; no contradiction under Causal lens.</comment>

<comment>Cobalt library, mist, iron-filings shimmering under moon, and pawn-humming zipper are concrete, selective, and filtered through Clara’s tactile priorities. The grotto functions as micro-setting that literally tugs clothing and attention, constraining placement of pieces and conversation. Spatial choreography across seven games is cleanly tracked; no impossible positions. Final image of shifting window displays re-weights earlier detail, passing the 9+ gate test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“can silence be turned into connection?”—is signaled early and tightened when Lila finally speaks aloud. Escalation is lyrical rather than plot-twist: each game lost still raises the cost of continuing (dawn arrival, emotional exposure). Agency is shared: Clara risks her safe isolation, Lila risks voice. Price is visible (hood slips, board packed at dawn), though not irreversible, keeping it just outside 8.8 band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of “planting forests of second thoughts” emerges through concrete displays and chess moves rather than final moral. Subtext operates in magnetic tug and pawn placement; silence as language is dramatized, not stated. Final line “let’s keep planting” offers resonant non-literal answer, re-weighting prior window tableaux. No thematic echo penalty—no character recites the thesis in prompt language.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Clara’s perceptual signature—“hears unspoken words”—colors every sentence with hush, magnetics, and implied vibration. Syntax modulates from long, breath-held clauses to the staccato of pieces clicking. Dialogue is sparse but goal-driven (“You’re late,” “Your turn”) with credible child diction. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens credibly under grotto pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “hush where past meets prophecy” compresses history and foreboding in one stroke. Metaphors (magnetic starlight, forests of thought) recur with purpose and payoff, avoiding purple overload. Rhythm accelerates during rapid-fire moves, then exhales at dawn. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; clauses track cleanly across temporal sequence. Final line earns its cadence without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Familiar grief-heals-through-game structure is refreshed by magnetic grotto as literal amplifier of silence and public window installations as rebel messaging. Synchronized storefront chess displays provide a specific, non-obvious tactic that could not be swapped for generic graffiti. The “hears unspoken words” gift is understated world-building rather than gimmick. Conceptual integrity holds: every magical element (magnetism, prophecy hush) is introduced early and obeyed throughout.</comment>
