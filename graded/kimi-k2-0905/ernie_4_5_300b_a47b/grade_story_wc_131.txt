<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mara’s kindly-methodical trait is shown through ritualistic caching and cautious tape search, but interiority stays summary-level; no embodied contradiction or micro-choice reveals hierarchy of values. The climactic decision to share the cache is stated, not dramatized, so cost remains conceptual rather than felt. Character knowledge is tight, yet flaw/struggle is muted, keeping her just above stock guardian archetype.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: reel → decoder → cache location → resolve to act. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Mara’s invisible guardian identity reframed as messenger—with conceptual cost (exposure risk) stated in final line. One causal gap: decoder powers up flawlessly after decades, a light convenience. Orientation, lens, and on-page cost satisfy 600-word default; missing hairline tightening keeps it under 8.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Library crawl-space, pipe chase, and basement machinery are vividly filtered through Mara’s practiced spatial memory; condensation, rust, mildew, and metallic paper scent create selective sensory hierarchy. Sapphire dawn and flickering outage locate time while feeding atmosphere. Micro-setting (tape reel, decoder) constrains the final choice and is returned to in closing image, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“message that could change everything for hidden patrons”—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once when tape voice confirms cache existence, forcing Mara from secrecy to dissemination. Cost (exposure) is declared but not dramatized; no live obstacle or forfeiture appears, so escalation stays moderate under Causal lens. One meaningful tightening qualifies but lacks visceral price on page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of chosen visibility emerges organically through action; no explicit thesis. Tape motif reweights from curiosity to communal lifeline, creating quiet resonance. Final image crystallizes guardian-turned-messenger without moralizing. Subtext stays light—no silence, gesture, or irony deepens stakes—but coherence and earned insight satisfy.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited sustains Mara’s perceptual signature—methodical, tactile, scent-oriented. Syntax remains controlled and rhythmic; no filter-verb clusters or register drift. Compression (“sapphire hush”) is taught early and echoed at end, justifying lyric repetition. No dialogue, so voice unity is high.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, largely loop-free; only minor scaffold (“the reel… the reel…”) in paragraph 3. Metaphors (“laughter, brittle as glass”) are precise. Sentence variety and information density strong; no line clogs closure. Sparse deductions keep high-band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Post-apocalyptic librarian myth is familiar, but crawl-space perspective, ferromagnetic tape reel, and decoder machine give fresh tactile inflection. Combination of sense-memory hook with institutional archive feels specific; however, plot beats follow expected treasure-map arc without subversion. Sufficient particularity to clear derivative guardrail.</comment>
