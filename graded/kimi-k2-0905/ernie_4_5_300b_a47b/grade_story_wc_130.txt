<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her grief is embodied in the way she handles the glass eyes and reads the mosaic cracks. The twin-loss motive is consistent and personal, driving every micro-choice. The final renunciation—accepting loss as alive, not empty—carries credible cost, though the shift is announced more than dramatized. One hairline slip: “mathematics of emotion” flirts with diagnostic label-speak in the peak beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the mosaic-eye dovetail reweights loss from void to fractal orchard, with visible sap-tear cost. Causal chain holds—each step because/therefore—under Accumulative/Textural lens; pattern taught early via dripping stalactites and sap luminescence. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by word 60. Persistent constraint: the chipped flaw itself dictates the ritual and final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cavern orchard is not backdrop—the dripping water feeds the trees and literally powers the ritual; the mosaic stone is the fulcrum of the final image. Micro-setting (glass eyes) constrains every beat: their chips dictate alignment, dictate resonance, dictate new constellation map. Sensory economy is tight: mineral drip, blue sap-glow, velvet box—each returns charged. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode the ambiguous loss—signaled in paragraph two. One meaningful tightening: the moment sap enters cracks and eyes vibrate, foreclosing further searching; cost is the tear-mixed sap on her cheek. Agency is attention and alignment, not external battle; coincidence complicates nothing. Pressure stays coherent under Accumulative lens; density increases until constellation re-map lands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from concrete returns: glass chips = mosaic cracks = star-fruit pulsing = constellation re-map. No thesis stated; insight is the image of “absence nourished growth.” Subtext lives in silence after bats cease—grief as orchard. Final image offers non-literal answer: loss is not hole but living cavern, reweighting all prior fractures without moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly glued to Elara’s perceptual filter—she traces cracks, feels sap, sees brother’s warped wink. Syntax mirrors her scanning: long clause when she reads fractures, fragment when vibration hits. No head-hopping; psychic distance compresses under sap-glow beat. Diction stays within her lexicon—“dovetail,” “luminescent,” never academic intrusion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene: slowed drip sentences before ritual, staccato gasp at vibration. Zero scaffold; each sentence advances image or causality. No mixed metaphors; sap-light stays liquid throughout. High information density: one sentence slips in twin-taxidermy backstory without pausing momentum. Only micro-loop: “glass eyes… eyes” in adjacent clauses, negligible.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: taxidermy glass + cave orchard + mosaic fracture = grief map. Trope of missing twin is inverted—absence becomes fertile grove. Risk taken: climax is alignment, not confrontation, yet stakes feel higher because orchard itself rewrites sky. Specific detail—mineral drip, velvet box, starlight fruit—makes concept unrepeatable.</comment>
