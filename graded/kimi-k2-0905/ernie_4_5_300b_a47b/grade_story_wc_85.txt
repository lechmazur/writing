<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Elias’s guilt is vividly embodied in the trembling watch-hand and the visceral pull toward the driftwood; his decision to break silence is credibly forced by the visions he absorbs. Interiority stays concrete—no therapy-speak—and the final renunciation carries visible cost: he walks back to confess, pocketing the cold watch. Flaws (complicity in erasure) actively shape the climax rather than decorate it. Missing higher band: we never see micro-choices under live client pressure; the brother reveal is received, not enacted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Causal chain holds: guilt → driftwood method → vision → decision to confess, each step tightening options. Closure is a Charged Poise: the stopped watch and cobalt dusk reconfigure Elias’s rules—he chooses truth-telling as a new, dangerous ethic with felt cost. One minor scaffold—Lila’s off-page voice is declared panic but never concretely tests his nerve. Still, the driftwood visions are dramatized, not summarized, satisfying the cost-proof test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Cobalt terrace and salt air are filtered through Elias’s guilt-tinged perception; the driftwood operates as micro-setting that literally stores and constrains choices. Selective sensory economy—no tourist checklist—keeps momentum. The ocean’s rule (wood remembers) is learned through action, not exposition. High-band gate missed: the terrace itself does not return to charge the final image; only the watch and dusk do.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—whether Elias will keep manufacturing silence—is signaled in paragraph one and deepened when the cedar vision forces a trade-off. One meaningful tightening: the split-heart carving makes the brother’s erasure visceral, foreclosing the option to stay neutral. Cost is legible: he forfeits his profitable safety and shoulders client pain. Slight drag: escalation is visionary rather than interactive; Lila never confronts him on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</question>
<comment>Theme emerges inductively: memory as oceanic refuse that refuses burial. Subtext operates in gesture—the unsent letter, the split heart—never sermonized. Final image reweights silence from refuge to prison without moralizing. Minor abstraction: “sieved hush” is named, not dramatized, preventing 8+.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-close voice stays salt-stained and barnacle-specific; perceptual signature is consistent—“air tasted of salt and secrets.” Rhythm modulates: short clauses under vision pressure, longer reflective ones on terrace. No head-hop; psychic distance stable. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated. Lyric elision (“sieved hush”) is taught early and paid off in final line without clarity loss.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings avoid templated cadence. High density: one sentence often handles atmosphere, motive, and object. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold. One mixed metaphor—“guilt pulsed beneath his ribs like barnacles”—but it clears quickly and does not touch closure. Minor over-modification in dusk paragraph could trim 10 words, keeping score below 8.5.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Black-market genealogist who reads driftwood archives is a fresh synthesis; trope of guilt-ridden fixer is inverted through oceanic archive conceit. Risk—lyric driftwood visions—heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity: cedar slab labeled “Silence” operates as both clue and tool. Could edge higher if client interaction had complicated the moral calculus on-page.</comment>
