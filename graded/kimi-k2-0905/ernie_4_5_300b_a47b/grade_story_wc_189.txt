<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—duty to record vs. need to connect—survives one beat; the embodied “cold seep” and micro-choice of rotating the cicada show motive in scene. Yet the later shift to talking-about rather than living the conflict (“I’ve been thinking about the cicada”) lets diagnostic label-speak leak in, softening the cost. Kael’s passive acceptance lacks a status push that would force her to pay visibly. The final stance is credible but not irreversible; the path foreclosed feels gently, not painfully, shut.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single-scene causality holds: pool → cicada → rotated cue → softened Kael. Orientation is clean by line 7; no lens ambiguity. Closure is a valid Charged Poise: the altered cicada position + rising tide reconfigure relational options with felt, if quiet, cost—she accepts the pause may last. The缺少 a decisive external trigger keeps it shy of 9.0, but the image lands.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Grotto, body, and cicada function as micro-setting: the rock perch distance shapes the gesture that bridges the argument; starlight on jade charges the final image. Salt scent and moon-fracture are selective, urgent. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly across the pool. Would need one more causal push from environment to breach 9.0.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can she make Kael feel the pause’s creative potential—tightens once via the cicada rotation; coincidence absent. Cost is present but internal/relational; no visible resource lost. Escalation is a single deepening, sufficient for length, yet the absence of a tangible forfeit keeps it from 8.8+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Theme emerges inductively from tide-cicada parallel rather than overt statement; final line’s “sea agreed” offers Conceptual Repricing—time’s texture is collaborative, not dictated. Subtext in gesture (cicada nudge) avoids sermon. One stray “transition periods” echo line 7 approaches thesis-speak but is early enough to be forgiven.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person lyric remains close to Elara’s perceptual filter: moonlight “fractured,” tide “paused mid-breath.” Syntax lengthens during reflection, then compresses into the spoken line, mirroring emotional cadence. No head-hopping; Kael’s interior is only inferred. Near-perfect control; a single adverbial tag (“softly”) is redundant under pressure, preventing 9.0.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, high-density; no loops or scaffold. Mixed metaphors avoided; “moonlight fractured” is precise. One lapse: “texture visible in the way sand shifted” edges toward abstraction when tension is highest. Otherwise read-aloud fluent; final sentence earns its hush.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Cicada-as-transition metaphor is familiar, yet grounding it in tidal mechanics and chronicler lore freshes the angle. relational pause mapped onto metamorphosis feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk is moderate; no structural daring. Specificity of salt, moss, and generational duty lifts it above template.</comment>
