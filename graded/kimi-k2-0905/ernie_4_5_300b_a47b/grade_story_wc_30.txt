<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The librarian’s identity flux is stated, not dramatized; the woman’s fear→dive→feather arc is legible but compressed into a single beat, so the cost feels light. No contradictory impulses play out in real time; both characters speak in therapeutic slogans (“Fear is a tide”). The micro-choice that earns the change is off-stage—she simply “plunges” and re-emerges transformed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the feather in the chestplate reweights the premise—wonder is recycled, not consumed. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each trinket adds density until the final image crystallizes the loop. Orientation is swift; the melted-clock datum anchors us by line 3. Causality is loose but coherent under the lyric-repetition pattern.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Brackish pools, glass dome, and bamboo creel function as micro-setting that constrains the ritual: the creel must be submerged to activate. Sensory selection favors shimmer/boil/glow—purposefully narrow, never touristic. Spatial choreography is clean: librarian lifts creel, woman steps, plunge, emergence, feather retrieved. Weather is off-stage but implied by shifting dome tint, mirroring internal shift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—shed identity vs. lose self—is declared early. Pressure tightens once: the dive forecloses retreat. However, the tightening is delivered via librarian exposition, not through an active obstacle; the woman faces no meaningful resistance or price beyond momentary “boil.” Cost is conceptual (she’s “lighter”) rather than viscerally felt, keeping escalation modest.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—identity as migratory contradiction—emerges through ritual repetition and trinket accumulation, never sermonized. Final feather reprises earlier journal line, reweighting it from anxiety to gift. Ambiguity lingers: is recycled wonder still authentic? The piece avoids moralizing, lets image do the talking. One thematic-echo slip: librarian’s “preserve the wonder in routine” edges toward thesis-statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyric-fabulist: steam-and-salt hum, clockwork diction, tidal cadence. Compression taught early (“after tomorrow disappeared”) justifies elliptical syntax. Perceptual signature stays anchored to librarian’s gear-whir attention: it notices constellations, kelp strands, light puddles—never generic. No head-hopping; child’s entrance keeps external, sustaining distance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with ritual pacing: long sentences for lull, staccato for plunge. Figurative density is high but patterned—salt, tide, gear—so it reads as texture, not overload. No scaffold loops; each sentence adds new sensory or conceptual grain. Minor register lift: “conceptual repricing” is evaluator language, not story voice, but occurs outside text.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fusion of tidal mechanics with identity-smelting feels fresh; the creel-as-crucible turns a humble fish-basket into ontological forge. Recursion loop (librarian collects remnants) transforms typical “butterfly-in-jar” trope into sustainable wonder economy. Risk is high—mythic tone could slide into preciousness—but specificity of brass gears, kelp journal, wintersun glow grounds it. Ending reprises child arrival, implying eternal return without cliché.</comment>
