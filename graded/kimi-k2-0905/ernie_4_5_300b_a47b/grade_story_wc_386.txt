<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Kael’s quiet “gift” and his gentleness are sketched with evocative interiority, but the three dream-visitations are reported, not dramatized, so we never see him make a risky micro-choice under pressure; the final placement of the globe feels like a foregone ritual rather than a costly renunciation. The widow’s dream lands hardest because it re-weights the sailor’s motive, yet Kael’s own stake in exposing vs. withholding the truth remains abstract, muting character arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a lyric Resonant Reconfiguration: the globe on the altar re-casts all prior dream-images into living legacies, and the cost is the ghost’s relinquishment of Kael’s attention—felt in the candles’ final flare. The dream-relay structure teaches its pattern early; each shard tightens the thematic stake while the glacier shrine stays continuously anchored. Causality is interior and accumulative rather than event-driven, but the lens holds without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The shrine’s ice, guttering candles, and warped glass supply tactile micro-setting that literally steers Kael’s listening posture and charges the final image; cold, flicker, and melt-pattern recur as environmental correlates for permeable boundaries between worlds. Selective sensory triage—scent of saltwater, frost against glove—keeps description economical while mirroring internal thinning of the veil. Spatial choreography is stable and unobtrusive.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will Kael release the ghost’s truth or hoard it?—is signaled early and tightens as each dream reveals a living relative still shaped by absence. The pressure is accumulative: every new dream-image increases the moral weight of disclosure, narrowing Kael’s options until silence becomes untenable; the cost is the emotional labor of transmission he must now undertake off-page. No reversal, but a single meaningful deepening suffices for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of connection across mortal thresholds emerges through recurring window/globe/mirror imagery rather than statement; the final image of “windows open” re-prices the premise without moralizing. Subtext operates in dream juxtapositions—lighthouse flame, trapped reflection, unborn face—inviting the reader to assemble meaning. The piece avoids tidy sentiment by leaving the living’s reconciliation mostly off-stage, preserving ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; diction—“ice thinned,” “silver smear,” “borrowed starlight”—is compressed and lyrical, matching Kael’s hushed vocation. No dialogue, so voice distinctiveness rests on syntax and metaphor; occasional poetic uplift (“ghosts danced like ghosts”) risks self-consciousness but stays consistent with ritual tone. Filter verbs are minimal; perception feels embodied and cold-numbed.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; sentences vary in length to mimic breath of listening. Minor loop—“the sailor’s ghost had lingered not out of vengeance, but out of love”—re-states prior line, and “windows were fragile things” editorializes, but artifacts do not touch the closure beat. Figurative layering stays coherent; no mixed metaphors obscure causality. Opening and closing lines anchor and resolve cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Combining wreck-diving, oneiric ghost-whispering, and a melted souvenir is fresh; the dream-cameo device sidesteps séance clichés. Emotional specificity—great-granddaughter’s laughter, widow’s never-born daughter—prevents the concept from sliding into generic after-life sentiment. While the “window” motif is familiar, its materialization through warped glass and glacier ice feels particular to this story’s cold geography.</comment>
