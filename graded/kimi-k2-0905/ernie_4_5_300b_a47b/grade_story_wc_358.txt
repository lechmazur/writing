<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Anya’s mentor-loss motive and professional training ground her choices; the buzzing patch embodies her internal conflict between rational procedure and uncanny intuition. Her embodied reactions—steady sensor adjustments, fingertip tremor on rust—show tension without cliché. The climactic recognition that the port “is hungry” feels earned because her earlier micro-choices (climbing toward the hum, pocketing the patch) foreshadow surrender to instinct. Cost is present but muted: she decides to “document it all,” accepting complicity with a machine she cannot shutdown, yet this forfeiture is stated more than felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Continuous scene, single POV, and causal chain hold: gust → climb → reveal. Orientation secured by line 7 (“salt-stained gravel”) well before the 120-word mark. Closure lands as CR: the port’s transformation into sentient machine re-weights every earlier wind reading; cost felt through patch vibration synced to heartbeat. Slight haze: missing-engineer stake is introduced late, so the earlier investigation feels procedural rather than pressing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Container geography stays coherent: red/blue color cues, ladder ridges, stacked tiers all guide spatial choreography. Weather micro-climates are shown via shiver drops and tablet warnings, never explained. Sodium dock-light reflects Anya’s investigative filter (industrial, night-shift) and charges the final image. Environment is more backdrop than constraint until the final gust; earlier winds could have been used to obstruct access or tools to tighten stakes further.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—uncover why the drone fell—signaled early and tightens when she realizes the yard itself is the culprit. Agency manifests in her decision to climb toward the flicker despite 45-mph gusts; this act physically risks her and unlocks the revelation. Cost is visible yet mild: breath knocked out, patch searing thigh—more sensory than strategic. No material resource is lost, and her later recommendation is off-page, so the price feels intellectual rather than lived.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges inductively: human systems (ports, logistics, data) can self-organize into predatory ecologies. Subtext runs through the haptic patch—technology grown intimate, almost biological—without authorial nudging. Final image of “machines that never sleep” offers chilling conceptual re-price. Echo of mentor-death is briefly articulated mid-text; mining it for deeper irony or ethical ambiguity could heighten resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person close stays locked to Anya’s perceptions, filtering world through professional tools and sensory triage. Diction (“sodium lights,” “corrugated sides”) reveals investigator’s techno-visual bias. Rhythm tightens under gust pressure: fragments (“She climbed…”) echo breathless ascent. No dialogue voice clash; only two curt lines from engineer keep distinct idiom minimal. Filter verbs minimal; when used (“she realized”) they cue genuine cognitive pivot.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Strong nouns/verbs (“container monoliths,” “wind howled”) reduce need for modifiers; sensory economy fits 750-word frame. Mixed-metaphor risk—“puzzle box designed to outthink her”—but pattern is taught early and recurs at closure, just tolerated. One paraphrase loop (“the patch…warm”) appears twice; trims easily. Sentence variety good; opening paragraph alternates long descriptive with short kinetic clauses to establish cadence. No scaffold impeding closure.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fusion of wind-tunnel physics with sentient-port conceit offers fresh angle on urban-horror; avoids zombie-crane cliché. Specificity of aeronautics investigator and micro-meteorology anchors novelty in procedure. Transformation test passes: story needs containers’ orthogonal geometry to create vortices—swap to alleyways and logic collapses. Risk is moderate but coherent; no bold structural experiment. Emotional core (mourning mentor) is familiar but personalized through patch motif.</comment>
