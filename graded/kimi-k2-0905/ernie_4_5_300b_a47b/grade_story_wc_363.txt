<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s stoic solitude and tactile obsession with the beads are vivid, but her interior contradiction—hope vs. acceptance—stays summary; the “wistful” label is repeated rather than dramatized. The final renunciation (letting the bead float away) is credible and costly, yet the pivot from self-saving to messenger-saving is asserted more than earned in micro-choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each puzzle-fit, crow theft, and bead-glow thickens atmosphere and narrows Mara’s option space toward the ultimate sacrifice; closure lands as Charged Poise—her loom now weaves silence into song for distant ears, cost felt in bead-loss and loom-stillness. Causality is lyric, not mechanical, but pattern is taught early (“thread by thread”) and pays off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The orchard/bamboo micro-setting is evoked through loom-creak, amber warmth, and puzzle-dust; these objects constrain tactics (puzzle pieces alter airflow, beads channel sound) and charge the final image of cloth hung in silence. Spatial tracking is clean; no white-room syndrome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Dominant stake—can Mara break the orchard’s silence—tightens with each puzzle click and bead flare; the final weave of silence-into-cloth is a visible, irreversible price that forecloses her keeping the bead. Agency is incremental but unmistakable; coincidence (rummage box arrival) complicates without resolving.</comment>

<question>5</question><question>8.5</question><comment>Theme of transmission-through-loss emerges through loom/thread/spinner lineage rather than statement; the closing image of children laughing with her name on the wind reweights the solitude motif without moralizing. Subtext in gesture (spinning silence instead of wool) is stronger than any overt thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a consistent, amber-lit cadence; perceptual signature favors visio-tactile synesthesia (“sunlight dripped like liquid gold”) that stays plausibly within Mara’s loom-centric worldview. No head-hopping; psychic distance compresses elegantly under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is musical; however, occasional modifier stacks (“stoically sparkling hues of dusk”) flirt with purple, and two paraphrase loops near mid-point dull momentum. No mixed metaphors at closure; final sentence lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fairy-tale tropes (cursed hush, magical bead) are re-angled through textile physics and accumulative puzzle-map; the silence-to-song transmission via woven stillness feels particular to this spinner rather than generic fantasy.</comment>
