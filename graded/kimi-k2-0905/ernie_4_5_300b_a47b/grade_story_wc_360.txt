<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is vivid—his “mind racing with equations” and the tear-fogged goggles embody the arc. Mirroring habit and borrowed personalities shape key beats (confusion tactic, empathy overload). The final renunciation—accepting felt chaos over solved variables—carries visible cost and is causally seeded. Minor slip: “diagnostic” flavor in “emotions weren’t variables; they were wildfires” could be more embodied, but contradiction is dramatized within two lines, limiting damage.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias’s crystallized stance “he didn’t need to borrow…” reweights premise with felt cost (tears, fragment obedience). Causal chain holds: invented poem → fragment dimming → empathy merge → press chaos → stance shift. Orientation clear by line 20; no lens ambiguity. Persistent constraint—fragment now alive in his palm—shapes future. One micro paraphrase loop (“light flickered…light flared”) is non-closure; negligible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Topaz workshop under vanishing stars is sensuously anchored: burnt-sapphire air, suspended shard, ink jars knocked over. Micro-setting—halo fragment—actively constrains choices and charges the final image when it settles into his palm. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly; fragment states evolve (dim → flare → hover → cool obedience). Selective detail favors urgency; no white-room syndrome. Environment mirrors internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can emotion be mathematized?—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens once: fragment merges minds, forcing Elias to pay the price of unmediated feeling. Escalation is causal under lens: ambiguity tactic → fragment defense drop → empathy overload → press失控. Visible cost: his analytical detachment shatters, ink-splattered walls, tear-blinded goggles. No off-stage rescue; coincidence only complicates (fragment’s agency).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: the limits of empiricism in the face of lived emotion. No explicit thesis—insight crystallizes when fragment settles, reweighting prior equations as “wildfires.” Final image (cool shard, obedient yet alive) offers non-literal answer: mastery is surrender. Subtext in gesture—Veyra’s scowl softens—echoes theme without declaration. Resonant ambiguity lingers: he won, yet carries the fragment’s heartbeat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is precise, alchemy-steeped, with controlled lyric swell (“stars bled into the horizon”). Syntax mirrors Elias’s analytic tilt—cumulative clauses—then fragments under empathy surge. No head-hops; POV stays locked. Dialogue minimal but distinct: Veyra’s rasp contrasts with Elias’s measured diction. Filter verbs used sparingly and purposefully. Metaphor density peaks at climax yet remains coherent; pattern taught early via “burnt sapphire” and paid off in kaleidoscope vision.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is propulsive, high-density: each sentence advances image or pressure. Figurative language is purposeful—fragment’s “half-remembered heartbeat” foreshadows merge. No scaffold loops; varied sentence openings. Micro-redundancy “light flickered…light flared” is localized and does not touch closure. Grammar clean; spatial logic exact. Final line lands with imagistic punch. Minor heightened diction (“lucid turbulence”) fits tone and is earned.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: celestial metallurgy + letterpress + mathematical empathy. Conceptual risk—emotion as wildfire equation—pays off via sensory dramatization. Fragment-as-mirror trope is revitalized through print-mechanics and invented language. Setting-specific detail (halo shard from angel battlefield) keeps it from generic steampunk. Ending image feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Could edge higher if societal implications of printable empathy were hinted, but within word limit, originality is strong.</comment>
