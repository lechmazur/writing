<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s hunger for one more curtain-call is vivid, but his interior contradiction—why an immortal echo still craves mortal applause—stays abstract. The synesthetic gift is shown (“apples tasted of autumn twilight”) yet never complicates or costs him on the page; it decorates rather than drives choice. No micro-choice reveals a hierarchy of values under threat; he simply keeps humming until the world heals. Because the final fade is graceful but not renunciatory, the cost feels aesthetic, not existential.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The piece teaches its Accumulative/Textural pattern early—echoes layering into chorus—and holds it to closure. Orientation is swift: ghost, orchard, coin, post-closing hour all land inside 60 words. The tarot coin’s blanking at dawn supplies a visible Conceptual Repricing: the Fool’s journey erased by collective possibility, felt cost encoded in “weight.” One minor lapse: the maze’s dissolution is announced rather than embodied, blurring spatial causality a hair.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Hedge-maze-as-clock, orchard-as-theatre, coin-as-lens—each object is kinesthetically handled and reconfigures space. The garden’s synesthetic palette (“scent of violets and forgotten melodies”) is filtered through Elias’s performer sensorium, never tourist-catalog. The final blank coin charges the image, making the setting a mutable stage rig. Spatial choreography stays clean across the phantom crowd’s convergence; only the maze’s vanishing line lacks tactile staging.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—mend the fractured timeline or remain a looping ghost—arrives early and tightens through each echo-summoned spirit. Each arrival thickens the tapestry, foreclosing isolation as an option; the reversed Wheel coin externalizes the cost. Agency stays Elias’s: he chooses the crescendo that erases his own anchor. Price is legible yet soft: the coin blanks, but Elias simply fades, applause implied not endured.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges as “possibility is a dance, not a door”—never sloganed, reweighted by the coin’s erasure. Subtext lives in synesthetic color-music that turns nostalgia into sensory debt. The flapper’s lavender-cello voice and the poet’s whisper let era-specific loss leak through texture. Final image resists moral; it crystallizes the cost of eternal encore into a single blank disk—an artifact now relieved of story, charged with silence.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person ghost-POV keeps perceptual signature consistent: sound→color, touch→taste, time→texture. Diction (“film-flicker,” “minor-key gravel”) stays within a vaudeville spirit’s lexicon. Rhythm swells and hushes with the melody-line, no drumbeat syntax. Compression is purposeful—“the garden held its breath” teaches the pattern that culminates in “the world held its breath.” No head-hopping; even the flapper’s voice is rendered as Elias hears it.</comment>

<comment>Prose is ear-tested: varied sentence cadence, no filter-verb stacks, high sensory density without purple overload. Opening line anchors voice and stakes in one breath. One metaphor clash—“threads withered before they could bloom”—mixes textile and botanical vehicles, a hairline bruise. Otherwise clean: no loops, no scaffold, no synonym churn; each line advances image or pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The encore-seeking ghost is fresh angle on post-mortem滞留, fused with synesthetic stage magic and tarot-as-technology. Fractured timeline is familiar sci-fi, but here it is rendered as choral hauntology rather than mechanistic paradox. Risky lyric structure pays off: no antagonist, no physical jeopardy, yet pressure accumulates through sensory overload. Specificity of 1923 dancer, 1975 poet keeps the concept from drifting into generic “past voices.”</comment>
