<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is vivid—her “cheerful gloom” is embodied in humming that dissolves into sighs—but the moment of interior contradiction (the micro-choice of pressing seeds into the shard) is under-dramatized; we are told her stance changes rather than watching her body betray her. The final renunciation is earned, yet the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands: Lira’s realization that paths are “released, not forgotten” is a clean Conceptual Repricing that reweights the premise with undeniable emotional cost. Causality holds under the Accumulative/Textural lens—seed pattern → shard memory → pool dissolution. Orientation is anchored by 120 words; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The geode, crater glass, and liquid-light pool are not backdrop but instruments: the glass’s regret-cloud alters Lira’s tactics, and the pool’s dissolution physically enacts the closure. Sensory selection stays tide-washed and prismatic, never touristic. Micro-setting (the obsidian pedestal) constrains the crucial seed-glass fusion beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—why paths vanish—tightens once when Lira forces seeds into the shard and watches the regret clear; this narrows her options from “find” to “release.” Cost is legible: the pool’s images show the bird turning away, fog consuming the path. No coincidence; pressure accrues under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</question><grade><comment>Theme of “release vs. forget” emerges from the seed-map and shard-regret images, never sermonized. Final image of the bird turning away reweights prior material without moral. Subtext lives in the shard’s amber regret pulsing—an embodied judgment rather than stated insight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is tide-washed, salt-crisp: “prismatic whispers,” “molasses left too long in the sun.” Perceptual signature is selective—Lira notices only what refracts memory. No head-hop; psychic distance tightens cleanly into the pool dissolution. Compression (“cheerful gloom”) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with scene needs: long liquid sentences for kneeling contemplation, clipped fragments at the reveal. Zero loops or scaffold; no mixed metaphors. Information density high—“she pressed them into the crater glass, watching as the shard’s cloudiness began to clear” does triple duty (action, sensory, causality).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The “sea-foam recollectionist” who reads volcanic-quartz regret is a fresh synthesis; trope of memory-keeper is rotated into geode-biology. Risky lyric accumulation (seeds → bird → pool) stays coherent and charges the final image. Specificity makes the premise irreplaceable—swap any element and the whole fractures.</comment>
