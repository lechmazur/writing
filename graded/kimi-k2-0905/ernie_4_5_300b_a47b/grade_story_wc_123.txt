<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elias’s meticulousness is shown through tactile recorder business and the rooftop detour, but interiority drifts into tidy self-labeling (“keeper of secrets”) that over-explains the turn. The vial hand-off is a decisive micro-choice, yet the woman’s instant trust feels schematic, blunting status friction. Contradictory impulses appear early (data vs. intuition) but compress into one narrated beat rather than simultaneous scene tension.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: trembling needle → rooftop lateral → vial acceptance → recorder log; each beat tightens options. Closure lands as Earned Stasis—he burns the note, accepting lifelong exposure cost—charged by the recorder’s still dials. Orientation is clean by line 6; no lens ambiguity. The log entry tomorrow is tell-forward, slightly blunting the immediacy of cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Brass recorder, fog tendrils, and flickering perimeter lights are filtered through Elias’s instrument-biased gaze, constraining his rooftop move. The courtyard’s hush returns in the final image, re-weighted from sanctuary to launchpad. Ash-storm macro-setting stays off-page, keeping the zone a vague dark patch; more particulate detail could have charged the vial’s menace.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth vs. official silence—tightens when the recorder screams “Critical” and the woman demands dissemination. One meaningful escalation: the lateral climb physically narrows escape routes and signals intent. Cost is visible—he forfeits anonymity by taking the vial—but the beat ends before we see consequence touch him, so pressure plateaus at exit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of bearing witness emerges through the recorder’s transformation from weather tool to evidence vault, avoiding explicit slogans. The ash-storm as lying government metaphor is understated; the burnt note image re-prices solitude as complicity refused. Subtext in the woman’s rasped “They’re calling it a flu” carries the cynicism without lecture. Final recorder log line risks a tidy moral stamp, slightly compressing ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s instrument-focused perception; sentences tighten under threat (“heart pounding”) then level to calm log cadence, mirroring data brain. No head-hopping; woman’s dialogue stays external, filtered through his ear. Diction stays within meteorologist lexicon—“altitude sensor,” “particulates”—without jargon drift. One filter-verb cluster near vial acceptance could be trimmed for immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is lean, with high double-duty density: “the fog thickened, blurring the courtyard’s edges into a smear of gray” advances both weather and mental state. No loops or scaffold; metaphors (storm of words, silence heavy as a lid) stay coherent. Rhythm accelerates into the zone, then exhales with the match flare. Minor paraphrase at “he’d always nurtured integrity in solitude” could compress.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Storm-recorder-as-whistleblower is a fresh inflection on dystopian secrecy, integrating climate tech with bio-espionage. Lateral rooftop approach sidesteps genre-default alley sneaks. Ash-rain remains background flavor rather than causal world-rule, limiting conceptual payoff. Pigeon tube symbol is elegant but swaps to match-burn erasure rather than evolving, muting surprise.</comment>
