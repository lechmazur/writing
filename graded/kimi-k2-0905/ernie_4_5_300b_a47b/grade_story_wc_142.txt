<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Lira’s interior contradiction—preserve soul vs appease suits—surfaces early and drives the graffiti-map plan, but the final stance crystallizes in a single declarative line (“You can’t privatize that”) rather than a pressured micro-choice; the chip’s tactile presence recurs yet never actively constrains her tactics. Emotion stays embodied in soot-smudged Jax and the torch gesture, giving the ending a collective rather than personal cost. The absence of a visible private concession keeps the arc just shy of earned renunciation territory.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: graffiti code → translated map → Council confrontation → retreat, each beat because/therefore linked. The spiral-square symbol landing as rallying banner provides a crisp visual pivot that reweights options. Closure achieves Charged Poise: carnival still afloat, dual loyalty intact, threat only momentarily repelled—cost is societal, not personal, but legible in the mist-capped barge retreat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Sensory lineup (diesel, fried dough, neon, soot) is filtered through Lira’s planner gaze, anchoring raft-city physics in a single plank walk. The chip’s weight in pocket and raised paint under fingertip micro-locate every beat. Carnival layout evolves from labyrinth to coded banner, showing setting guiding tactics. Final image of gilded barge fading into mist recharges earlier skyline chaos with palpable temporary reprieve.</comment>

<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—carnival autonomy vs privatization—signaled in opening paragraph and tightened when Council barge arrives. Lira’s agency: decoding graffiti → orchestrating visual campaign → public confrontation; each action forecloses fallback to quiet negotiation. Cost is communal (risk of losing home), felt through vendor murmur and torch flare, though personal price (job loss, exile) stays off-page, capping tension just below visceral.</comment>

<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of coded resistance as legitimate order emerges through graffiti translation and chip-as-anchor without explicit thesis. Subtext lives in mural’s dollar-sign eyes and spiral-square repetition, letting collective defiance speak louder than slogans. Final image reframes chaos as curated structure, offering resonant non-literal answer. A hint of sentiment (“it’s a home”) is earned by prior spectacle, avoiding moralizing.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Lira’s perceptual filter—selective attention to foot traffic, paint ridges, chip edges. Syntax is controlled, rhythmic, with purposeful compression (“Council’s leader, a woman with a voice like ice, scoffed”). Dialogue carries indirection: Jax’s “You’re late” implies prior coordination without exposition. No head-hopping; voice remains consistent under pressure.</comment>

<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening, propelling beats without scaffold. Figurative language is sparse and precise (“voice like ice,” “mist-capped barge”), never clustering to obscure causality. Information density high: one line often layers sensory detail, world rule, and emotional tint. No paraphrase loops or register drift; occasional adjective–noun pairs (“gilded barge,” “drowning clown”) serve immediate atmosphere.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Floating carnival as gentrification battleground feels fresh; grafting urban graffiti resistance onto a mobile raft bazaar is a non-obvious synthesis. Transformation test passes—Lira’s spatial-coder skill set and chip talisman are specific to this milieu. Some tropes (fire-eater ally, icy corporate speaker) lean archetypal but are personalized through sensory detail and coded symbolism. Risk level moderate; concept coheres without gimmickry.</comment>
