<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid—her needle-work embodies fear, duty, and awakening—and her micro-choices (kneel, push faster, pocket the key) track a believable shift from avoidance to listening. The “broken mask restorer” identity, however, is asserted rather than dramatized; no cracked mask appears, so the promised vocational lens never shapes action. Elias remains functional cipher, emitting lore but no status pressure; his smoke-like movement is cliché, not earned. Dialogue is terse and goal-driven, yet the climactic line “Now you listen” lands as directive, not crucible—Mara’s assent feels lightly motivated rather than wrung through contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the hush becomes hum, key appears, Mara leaves lighter yet marked—“awake” cost is felt. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: silence-dense object builds pattern, starlight prism refracts meaning, final cadence re-weights stakes. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) secured by line 8; no penalty. One causal wobble: Elias’s “He chose silence to protect…” is retro-diagnosis delivered off-stage; fisherman’s choice never dramatized, so the key’s conceptual cost is slightly under-cranked. Still, the beat lands cleanly under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prism sanctuary is not postcard ornament: glass walls refract decision-light, cold floor forces Mara’s knees, attic box delivers the needle—environment keeps handing tools that alter tactics. Sensory hierarchy favors touch (frayed salt-caked knots) and sight (shifting star-colors), both filtered through restorer’s tactile bias. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly: kneel → sit → stand → exit; no impossible body leaps. One micro-gap: “shadow stretching across the net” implies candle or star source, but light logic never contradicts action. Setting charges final image—the brightened hum is the prism itself re-tuned.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: silence must be broken vs. fear of what voices will say—signaled on page 1 and tightened when Mara admits “I’m afraid.” Escalation is accretive: each loosened knot ups spectral noise, forcing faster needle-work; cost is fingertip ache and rising auditory haunt. No external antagonist needed; pressure is situational-coherent. One visible price: centuries-old net vanishes, key left as relic—Mara forfeits the safety of unfinished stories. The turn is micro but sufficient for 700-word canvas.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—“some hushes are meant to be broken”—emerges through tangible unraveling rather than thesis statement; sanctuary’s final hum is the non-literal answer. Subtext lives in gesture: Mara’s faster stitching equals consent to hear ghosts; Elias’s stillness under blinding flare signals long-awaited release. Avoids moralising; fisherman’s suicide is presented as tragic, not verdict. Silver key reframes prior masks-work as mere mending; listener identity now irreversible—resonance lingers without tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Narrative distance stays tight third; no head-hop. Perceptual signature is tactile-restorer: “frayed edges,” “knots tight as forgotten secrets,” “needle slipping through stubborn knot”—idiosyncratic attention to fiber tension. Rhythm modulates: long reflective sentences early, shorter staccato under flare. Dialogue sparse and distinct: Elias riddles, Mara parries; no convergence under stress. Register stable—no corporate diction; “lucid” in final line is earned payoff word, not imported abstraction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is clean, vivid, loop-free; metaphor vehicles (barnacles, skin, storm) stay consistent with sea-net imagery. Information density high—one sentence often does two jobs: “Each knot held a fragment of a voice…all muffled by time” reveals stakes + texture. No scaffold; paragraph cut test passes. Minor near-miss: “shadow stretched across the net” could imply competing light sources, but image is clear. Final line “She was ready to listen” is taut, resonant, propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fisherman-net-as-memory-prison is fresh angle on haunted-object trope; prism sanctuary that literally refracts silence is inventive micro-setting. Broken-mask-restorer identity promises unique vocational lens but remains conceptual—never activated in scene, trimming boldness. Risk taken: accumulative lyric mode over causal whodunit; choice supports theme and pays off in tonal shift. Overall, specifics feel memorable yet could transplant to another lyric ghost story without breaking—freshness is present, not seismic.</comment>
