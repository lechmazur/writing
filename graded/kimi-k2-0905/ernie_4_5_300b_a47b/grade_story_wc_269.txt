<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lira’s inner contradiction—grief for the reef versus the need to decode the atlas—is vivid in her tapping and sleepless cross-referencing. Kael exists mainly as a foil; his single on-page challenge (“You’re obsessed”) still forces Lira to double-down, so the relationship functions as a crucible. The final choice to sail into the storm is foreshadowed by her dream and the plankton coordinates, but the cost (abandoning the station, physical risk) is more asserted than felt—no bodily friction, no tool loss, no moment of “we may drown.” Interiority stays concrete; no label-speak, but the endurance lacks a visible price on the page, capping the score below 7.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the couple sails off, the station empty, the paths re-light behind them—an image that reweights the premise (the ocean is rewriting itself). Causality holds: atlas → plankton coordinates → decision to follow. Orientation is clear by line 6 (“edge of the atoll”). The “periodically eternal” rule is announced late yet pays off in the final reappearance of the paths, so the latent ambiguity is forgiven. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral; because no body, tool, or relationship price is dramatized, the piece can’t breach 8.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The station, atlas page, and bioluminescent reef function as micro-settings that constrain choice: only one atlas page exists, only the deck offers sight of the glowing coordinates. Sensory hierarchy is biologist-tight—corals “bleeding white,” “cool metal wall,” plankton “spelling out coordinates.” Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves. The final reef image earns a 9+ boost by charging the closure, but the earlier station description lapses into postcard tourism (“solar panels glistening”) without anchoring a choice, holding the score just under 8.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—why paths disappear—arrives early and tightens when the plankton offers live coordinates. The meaningful turn is the decision to abandon the station and sail; it forecloses the safe path. Agency is shared but Lira leads, satisfying causal lens. Cost is conceptual (they may never return), yet no tangible resource is lost or body imperiled on the page, muting the felt price below 8-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: human grief and wonder at an Earth that rewrites itself once we stop forcing carbon into it. Subtext lives in the tapping—language versus silence after the fossil-fuel ban—and in the atlas that outlives the islands. No final moral is stated; the last image of glowing paths behind the boat re-prices the premise without exposition. One hairline slip: “the ocean was healing, but it was also changing” edges toward thematic echo, yet it is embedded in action, not sermon, so penalty stays under –0.2.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited stays interior-locked to Lira; no head-hop. Perceptual signature is strong—her biologist gaze notices skeleton-white corals, sensor arrays, plankton as data. Rhythm mirrors her urgency: fragments (“Three taps, pause, two taps, pause”) interrupt longer, breathless sentences. Kael’s brief dialogue is utilitarian, contrasting with her percussive worldview, a purposeful flattening that keeps focus on her lens. One minor register drift: “periodically eternal” sounds theoretical for a field biologist, but it is brief and concept-motivated, so only a –0.1 nudge.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is varied; sentence openings rotate. Information density is high—each sentence advances image or causality. No paraphrase loops; no stacked metaphors. “Bleeding white” and “lighthouse beam” are the only two metaphors in rapid succession, kept sparse and apt. Final paragraph attempts a summative cadence that flirts with template (“one tap at a time”), but it echoes the opening tapping, so pattern is purposeful, not artifact. No typos or tense slips. Clean enough for 8-band, but the slight cadence echo prevents 9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: post-carbon Earth as time-looping ocean that erases and redraws geography. Coral bleaching witness becomes portal-hunter is a non-obvable role twist. The tapping language-as-silence-currency idea is memorable and specific. Risk is moderate—lyric speculative rather than conventional cli-fi—but the concept is fully committed. Proximity check shows no close echoes. Transformation test fails if you swap coral grief, so originality is genuine; yet the idea-cluster feels adjacent to emerging “climate-ghost” fiction, keeping it just below 8-band ceiling.</comment>
