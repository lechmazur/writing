<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Lila’s illustrator identity supplies observational precision, but her interiority remains decorative (“poetic nonsense”) rather than contradictory under pressure. The pendant twist is externally driven; her agency is reactive, not a crucible of conflicting values. No embodied emotional degradation—just awe and summary labels. The “cost” is conceptual, not dramatized through her body or choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Single-scene orientation is clear by 120 words; canal/giant anchors taught early. The causal engine is “twist pendant → time tunnel,” a rule introduced mid-stream yet paid off in closure image. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the loom-of-time image reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. Slight causal thinness: pendant’s mechanics are asserted, not foreshadowed, but the lens holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rooftop canal system is tactile—rusted railing, moss-crusted stones—and mirrors the giant’s breathing cadence, constraining Lila’s attention. Spatial choreography is clean; water ripples backward/sideways, a lived-in physics that charges the final image. Micro-setting (pendant as “second heart”) doubles as tool and body extension. Could edge higher if weather or stone temperature altered her grip or timing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find where echoes are born”—is signaled early; pressure tightens when the split canal forecloses passive observation. Pendant twist is the single meaningful turn that narrows options to “enter tunnel or retreat.” Conceptual cost (she now carries unverifiable knowledge) is legible but not viscerally felt on-page. Escalation is adequate for 700-word scope, not maximal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the loom/loom-of-time image rather than assertion: borrowed moments, pauses between breaths. No moralizing—final image lets ink replace obsession, a quiet CR. Ambiguity persists: is she cursed or freed? Counter-readings hold. Could use one more concrete particular (e.g., a sketch she now cannot sell) to deepen the social cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-limited stays tightly pinned to Lila’s perceptual filter—sketchpad angle, pencil hover, metal warmth. Syntax lengthens under time-dilation, mirroring thickened air. No dialogue, so no voice convergence risk. Diction consistent with artist’s eye; no register drift. Minor filter-verb clusters (“she thought, she understood”) but not in peak beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with scene: short clauses during tremor, elongation during syrup-time. Metaphors are controlled (“silver serpent,” “second heart”) and do not overwrite. One paraphrase loop: “the pendant had grown warm…today she’d vowed to test its limits” restates prior heat. No mixed metaphors or scaffold clutter. Final line punchy, earns send-off.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: city canals as circulatory system of a napping giant, illustrator as cartographer of borrowed heartbeats. Giant-as-parent guardian reframes monster trope without sentimentality. Infinity pendant repurposed from kitsch to time-key, inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (compressed eternity tunnel) pays off in closure image. Specificity keeps it from abstract fable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</question><grade>Early signal via sketchpad; her illustrator eye notices ripple vectors, justifying tunnel choice. She draws the final image, so profession shapes closure. Yet no on-page beat where illustration skill alters tactics—could be any curious observer. Beat involvement present, causal pressure light.</question>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</question><grade>Setup, middle twist, charged closure: warms, flares, cools. Mechanics remain vague, but reprise in final sketch links ink & borrowed time. Cost implied (she alone holds impossible knowledge). Irreplaceable—no other object could “uncage” the loom.</question>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</question><grade>Canal rhythm as literal interrupted cadence drives every ripple, hum, and tunnel opening. Causes the split that forces entry. Final smooth flow signals giant’s settled nap—closure reweights cadence as hidden archive. Integral across beats.</question>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.9</question><grade>Phrase “sculpts time itself” is narrator’s meta-label, not Lila’s credulous belief. Functionally delivered via tunnel experience where she threads light-loops. Conceptual rather than tool-use precision; no artisanal detail. Sufficient but not irreplaceable.</question>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.7</question><grade>Twist action uncages the giant’s borrowed heartbeat and her own future. One decisive beat, no alternate path. Reconfigures her illustrator mission from observation to witness. High specificity, late arrival forgiven by transformative payoff.</question>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</question><grade>Borrowing time is the tunnel mechanic: past/future selves overlap. Not pre-explained, but pendant heat cues the loan. Failure to return borrowed beats is the conceptual cost she now carries. Middle & closure gates met.</question>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.0</question><grade>Rooftop canal railing grants exclusive vantage; mossy footing heightens leaning risk, prompting tunnel lean. Canal split is spatial trigger for portal. Setting is active environment, not backdrop. Could be sharper if wind rocked the railing during twist.</question>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.6</question><grade>Giant’s nap provides the live clock: snore cadence → ripple → tunnel. Timeframe is tracked via pulse intervals, not minutes. Buffers city balance, so wakefulness = risk. Present across beats, but final “nap continues” lowers urgency.</question>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</question><grade>Desire voiced early, tested by leaning over fissure, consummated in tunnel. Friction: fear vs. curiosity embodied in railing grip. Motivation survives exit, now chronic hunger for next pulse. Concrete, not abstract.</question>

<question>9 J</question><grade>N/A</question><grade>No tone element required; piece carries wonder-tinged lyricism throughout, modulating to hushed awe in tunnel. Evaluated within voice categories.</question>
