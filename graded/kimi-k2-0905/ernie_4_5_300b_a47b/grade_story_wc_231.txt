<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory drives—grief-soaked obsession and reluctant caretaker—are embodied in the moth-wing petal, the lantern swing, the decision to open the trunk. The final renunciation (“I’ve carried enough”) is seeded early through his wife’s locket and pays off with visible cost. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. Only the woman’s hollowness leans on trope, keeping it shy of 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a crisp Earned Stasis: Elias places the Edelweiss on the trunk, foreclosing his lifelong isolationist stance while accepting the freight of others’ pain. Causal lattice holds: boutonnière → hatch → journal → renunciation, each because/therefore link tightening options. Lens is causal throughout; no teleporting props or retroactive patches. Cost is legible in the final line—“a child’s laughter waited to be reclaimed”—a conceptual repricing that reweights every prior gap he has observed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The opal dock, bruise-purple sky, and salt-mist cobwebs are filtered through Elias’s seabird-hymn sensibility, constraining his footfall and later his choice to descend the hatch. Micro-setting triumphs: the lantern’s fraying halo, the rusted hatch lip that bites his knee, the trunk’s brine-stink—all tactile obstacles that shape access. Weather shifts in lockstep with revelation: mist lifts only after he agrees to carry the memories. Dock geography stays coherent; no floating rooms. One hairline slip—“opal” glow never re-enters the final image—caps it at 8.9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will Elias keep observing or finally bear another’s guilt?—is signaled by line 3. Pressure tightens once: the trunk opens, forcing him to decide whether to ferry the memories ashore. Cost is felt immediately; he forfeits his treasured detachment. Escalation is lean but sufficient for 700-word length; no reversals are needed because the single turn reweights his entire raison d’être.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Theme emerges not as “isolation bad” but as isolation’s cost when memories can be pawned off. The Edelweiss mutates from quaint boutonnière to portable guilt, then to surrendered burden—an organic repricing. Final image of waiting laughter is non-literal, earned, avoids sermon. No thematic echo lines; subtext lives in Elias’s lantern angle and the woman’s sandpaper rasp.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-limited clings to Elias’s storm-cloud eyes, seaweed beard, gull-talk idiom. Syntax lengthens when he catalogs gaps, fractures into lantern-flick short clauses as the trunk opens. No head-hopping; woman’s voice stays external, rasp-filtered. Dialogue carries subtext: “You’re here for the memories” accuses and invites in four words. Voice never explains itself to the reader.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm flexes naturally: compound seethe of opener yields to staccato trunk discovery. Metaphors (petals “brittle as moth wings,” mist “like cobwebs”) are sparse, precise, never layered. Zero paraphrase loops; no filter-verb stacks. Information density high—one sentence often salts the air, advances plot, and exposes Elias’s synesthesia. Copy-clean except one missing comma after “dock” in line 1, too minor to ding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>“Borrowed memories” trope is refreshed by maritime scavenger ethic: guilt is ballast that must be offloaded before sinking. Edelweiss-as-confession object twists the alpine flower into Atlantic grit. Lighthouse keeper as gap-cartographer feels inevitable yet unmined. Risky compression to one scene succeeds because the hatch becomes memory’s hold. Not quite 9 only because the scuttled-ship motive is whispered, not dramatized.</comment>
