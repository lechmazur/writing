<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elias’s mapper identity is embodied early—kneeling, tracing, ledger—but the interior contradiction (order vs. craving mystery) is asserted more than dramatized until the final ticket choice. The embodied tremor is present, yet the emotional cost of abandoning his ledger-compass is only implied, not felt in muscle or breath. Micro-choices (slide punch, accept blank ticket) align with motive, but the woman’s pressure is off-stage; we see compliance, not crucible. Earned stasis is credible, but the price is named, not lived on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: shifting cracks → punch → stair → hologram station → blank ticket; each step shrinks Elias’s options. Closure is a Charged Poise: the blank ticket reweights every prior map-line; “Begin” repackages his life-long habit into a single costly fork. Cost is visible—the updated map erases his old certainties in the final image. One minor scaffold: “shouldn’t exist” wall is slightly lucky, but the mechanism is seeded, so coincidence complicates rather than resolves.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Starlit vault, mist-breath, stained-glass dome—details are selective, POV-filtered, and guide bodily movement. The phantom ticket punch functions as micro-setting: its brass dings, weight, and slot-shape constrain the final insertion beat. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions. Light-through-cracks returns in the dome projection, recharging the initial image at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—access to “fortress of unspoken truths”—is signaled early and tightens when the blank ticket offers only one word: Begin. Escalation is singular but sufficient: each arrow narrows the route until the final choice forecloses the safety of his ledger. Agency is present; Elias actively inserts the punch and accepts the ticket. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral; the map’s overwrite is visible, but we do not feel his body pay.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of traded certainty for mystery emerges through image (arrows → ticket → blank map), never sermonized. Subtext lives in the ticket’s silence: “Begin” is invitation and threat. Final reconfiguration invites multiple readings—liberation or erasure—without forcing a moral. The woman’s veil keeps the truth partial, sustaining ambiguity that lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person POV stays tight to Elias’s perceptual filter: cracks are “language,” mist is “breath of a sleeping giant.” Syntax grows shorter under pressure—“He took the ticket”—mirroring heartbeat. No head-hopping; hologram woman remains opaque, as she must. Register is consistent; no filter-verb bloat; rhythm modulates with descent into colder, sharper air.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is varied; sentence lengths contract in the stair-descent beats. High information density: one sentence can set, sense, and foreshadow (“The arrows pulsed with a rhythm that matched his own heartbeat, a trembling certainty…”). No synonym loops or mixed metaphors. Minor scaffold: “his breath fogging the cold air” could lose “cold,” but it is the opening line and stakes mood, not closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Combines cartographer noir with underground starglass hologram—fresh splice. Arrows-in-cracks re-enchants urban decay without exotic graft. The blank ticket as existential passport feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk is moderate; concept stays coherent, not gimmick.</comment>
