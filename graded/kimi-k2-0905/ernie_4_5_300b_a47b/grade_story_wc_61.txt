<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lumin’s ache for fire’s warmth is vivid (“heart ached”), but the decisive shift from ancestral shame to hopeful sharing is delivered in a single expository paragraph (“I’ll share it”) rather than through a tense micro-choice under pressure; the gear is handled but never risks or costs Lumin anything on the page, so the renunciation feels pre-scripted, not earned in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: Lumin plants the gear, accepting the quieter-fire ethic with conceptual cost (ancestral guilt → future possibility). Pattern is Accumulative/Textural; urgency pings accumulate until the final crystallization. Causality stays intact, but the ghost encounter is coincidence-heavy; however, it complicates rather than resolves, so allowable. Orientation is clear by word 80; no penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Petals-as-constellations and mother-of-pearl clouds are poetically rendered and color every beat; the crystalline trees act as micro-setting that physically receives the gear, charging the final image. Selective sensory layering (sound of pings, tactile gear edges) keeps density high without listiness; spatial tracking never slips.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can fire be redeemed without violence?—is signaled early and tightens when the ghost reveals prior destruction; Lumin’s final stance crystallizes with visible cost (abandoning secrecy). No second reversal, but one meaningful deepening suffices; escalation rides the Accumulative pings to the grove confrontation. Cost is conceptual but unmistakable in the last two lines.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Generational trauma and the ethics of light emerge through image (scarred hands, fractal leaves) rather than thesis statements; final “fire that whispers” reweights the opening ban without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers—will the Enclave accept?—inviting reflection. One thematic echo (“generational patterns”) appears mid-text but is dramatized, not asserted, so no penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature skews to synesthetic cosmology (“petals drifted like forgotten constellations”). Syntax stretches into lyrical coils but stays legible; no head-hop. Compression in the ghost dialogue is purposeful and paid off in the closing hush.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Rhythm modulates effectively—long breathy sentences for garden awe, clipped fragments during ping crescendo. Occasional modifier stacks (“shimmered like mother-of-pearl”) flirt with over-richness but never stall propulsion; no loops or mixed metaphors. Clean mechanics, precise pronouns, strong verb choices.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>“Quiet fire” reframes an old trope through sensory inversion (warmth without burn), anchored in a nebula garden that feels indigenous to this tale. Ghost-grandmother risks familiarity but is coded as holographic flicker, avoiding ancestor-ex-machina cliché. Final image of the spinning gear leaves a memorable, specific emblem.</comment>
