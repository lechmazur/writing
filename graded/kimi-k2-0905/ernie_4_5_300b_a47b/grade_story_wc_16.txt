<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s “carefully reckless” tag fuels two visible micro-choices—risking Henrik’s scorn to chase the letter, staying overnight to finish—each with page-cost (stiff back, emptied ink well). Interiority is concrete when she “traces the spine” and tastes mead residue, but the sister silence/backstory is delivered in two expository lumps that mute contradiction-in-scene. The final phone call is a decisive, earned renunciation of avoidance, yet the sister remains off-page, so the relationship-as-crucible pressure is implied, not staged. Still, flaws stay minor; the river/dam metaphor is lived, not labeled, and the glass well’s dwindling ink bodies the price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: faded love letter → river name → tax record → prayer book → mead → wedding vow → Elara dials. Each “because” widens emotional stakes until the manuscript of two sisters refracts her own estrangement, forcing the call. Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost—dawn light, empty ink well, her voice “trembling.” Orientation arrives by line 4; no lens ambiguity. Henrik’s late key is a mild convenience, but it complicates, not rescues, so penalty stays minimal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Archive is evoked through tactile verbs—shelves “sag,” parchment “brittle,” lamp “flicker”—and the ink well’s rune-etched glass surfaces twice to mark time and emotional drain. Micro-setting doubles as tool: the restricted-section key physically gates the final translation, constraining her night-long push. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible postures. While broader world rules (how runes glow) go unexplained, the detail is incidental, not choice-critical, so credibility stays intact.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“restore trust before Mira’s wedding”—is signaled early and tightens through each archival breadcrumb; the manuscript of two sisters acts as the final pressure crucible. Escalation is Accumulative: each discovered promise thickens thematic density until silence becomes unbearable. Cost is visible—cramped body, spent ink, dawn exhaustion—but not persistent; no tactical alteration after the key is handed over, keeping the score sub-8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of language-as-vow emerges organically from plot beats, never sermonized. The love-letter river and sister manuscript reprise the “promise” motif, reweighted when Elara chooses vulnerability. Final image of the glowing ink well reframes earlier mead-brew vow without moralizing. A hairline slip—“symphony of truth” is named twice—but the second instance is internal, not expositional, so only a light tap.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Free-indirect style stays anchored in Elara’s scholarly lexicon—“hydronyms,” “Brythonic,” “runes”—without leaking into Henrik’s gravel voice. Prose rhythm accelerates across the night session via parataxis and clause contraction, mirroring fatigue. Filter verbs minimal; perception is body-based—“throat tighten,” “fingers moving.” Dialogue sparseness fits stakes; no voice convergence at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</question>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—e.g., “She unsnarled the first knot… its script so faded it resembled lace” shows action + image. No synonym loops; metaphors (river/dam) stay coherent. One mixed image—“static of forgotten tongues”—but it’s early, low-pressure. Closure beat is clean, no scaffold. Opening line is crisp; final line reinvigorates “before paths diverge” with cadence shift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</question>
<comment>“Extinct language as lived promise” is a fresh synthesis; the archival breadcrumb logic feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk is moderate—quiet night, no antagonist—but the emotional wager is large enough to justify the scale. Tropes (estranged sister, magical heirloom) are personalized through linguistic method, not checklist. Could edge higher with a sharper external obstacle.</comment>
