<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s “precisely playful” analyst-artist duality is shown through concrete gestures—tracing the wafer, pocketing the warm seal—yet most interiority is narrated summary (“her thoughts raced”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The climactic recognition that foresight and hindsight are twin lenses is declared, not dramatized; we are told she “understood” rather than shown a micro-choice that costs her something on the page. Still, her arc from decoding relics to becoming the directive’s architect is clear, and the final image of her dancing with storms retroactively pays for her earlier passivity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: storm energy, seal heat, and dream fragments accrue until Mara’s stance crystallizes. Closure lands as Charged Poise—she pockets the glowing seal and walks out—reweighting decay into generative soil with felt conceptual cost (“the bunker’s walls softening into soil”). Orientation is secured within 120 words; no causal breaks, though the hologram’s off-stage voice is lightly convenient. One minor ellipsis: how the seal physically projects a hologram is skipped, but the effect is pattern-consistent and does not touch the final image.</comment>

<comment>The vine-draped bunker functions as both coffin and cradle: vines muffle sound, leak rain, and ultimately digest the concrete. Selective sensory economy—“faint scent of bergamot and iron” from heated wax—charges the micro-setting. Spatial choreography stays clean; candle, seal, and table maintain coherent positions. The final image of walls softening into soil is the 9+ gate pass, recharging every earlier decay motif.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—“why paths choose walkers”—is signaled early and re-posed by the hologram. Pressure deepens via accumulative texture: storm → seal → dream → recognition, each layer narrowing options toward acceptance rather than escape. No external antagonist, yet internal conflict escalates from curiosity to stance crystallization. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral—she accepts responsibility for rewriting the directive—but the price could be sharper on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: decay as compost for rebirth, order/chaos as twin lenses. No overt thesis statements; the final image of footprints echoing “in the rhythm of rebirth” reweights prior decay without moralizing. Subtextual silence around who issued the original directive invites lingering ambiguity. Minor deduction for the hologram’s slightly expository “you were chosen” beat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric achieves a consistent rhythmic signature—“vines clawed through cracks,” “rain lashed the vines”—with controlled cadence matching storm crescendo. Perceptual signature is character-specific: Mara notices fractal patterns, animal tracks, iron note in wax. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. Filter verbs are minimal; free indirect style stays clean. The final sentence’s hymnal cadence is earned by prior pattern.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often layers sensory, symbolic, and causal work—“The wax melted, releasing a faint scent of bergamot and iron” advances atmosphere while cueing the hologram. Figurative language is sparse and coherent; no mixed metaphors. A single paraphrase loop:“decay mirrored…fragility mirrored…” costs −0.2. Otherwise rhythm breathes with scene needs, and no artifact touches the closing beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Synthesizes familiar eco-collapse + dream-quest tropes through specific bunker relic and lucid-dream mechanics. The “decaying directive” as seed rather than failure is a fresh inflection. Risky storm-as-amplifier choice pays off in closure image. Transformation test passes: story would collapse without seal-dream integration. Minor proximity to “chosen one” hologram keeps it sub-9.</comment>
