<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s undercover motive is clear, but her interiority oscillates between researcher detachment and mystic surrender without a visible micro-choice that tips the scale; the metamorphosis is imposed by the arrowhead rather than catalyzed by a conscious, costly decision. The “bitterness → cosmic joke” stance is asserted, not dramatized in a beat where she risks anything. Result: credible arc, but the final stance feels lightly earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the spiral etched on the arrowhead reweights her mission from observation to participation, and the cost is felt—“not as a researcher. Not anymore.” Causal lens holds: each beat (arrowhead pulse, confession static, metamorphosis) tightens options under a because/therefore chain. One micro-drag: “she’d return… but not as a researcher” is summary, not dramatized beat; still, the image is charged and irreversible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Underground garden is tactile—moss-caked roots, mushroom stool, copper-wired phone—and constrains action: proximity to soil enables the metamorphosis. Sensory hierarchy skews visual; sharper petrichor/metallic air could tighten POV bias. Spatial choreography clean; no orientation debt. The arrowhead as micro-setting charges final image, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will Elara preserve human identity or surrender to harmony—is signaled early and tightens when the static forces metamorphosis. Escalation is causal: each confession thickens static → arrowhead heats → transformation. Cost is visible: loss of researcher identity, bark-skin, layered voice. One beat short of 8.8: no tangible forfeiture above-ground (job, sister) is shown on page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—knowledge vs. ecstatic surrender—emerges through image chain: arrowhead (human tool) vs. spiral (open-ended nature). Subtext in Herbalist’s laugh: “wind chimes in a storm” fuses beauty & threat. No final moral; resonance lingers in open spiral. Frostbitten hope is tone, not thesis. Avoids explicit “cosmic joke” echo at end, evading thematic-label penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice: compressed, sensuous, slightly academic—“petrichor, maybe, or the metallic tang of secrets”—fits botanist POV. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for awe, fragments under transformation (“Metamorphose. Via the static.”). No dialogue to test distinction; internal idiom stays consistent. Filter verbs minimal; perceptual signature vivid. One template cadence: “She’d… She’d… She’d…” but brief, doesn’t blur closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Figurative density high but patterned—arrowhead as second heartbeat, confessions as shards—pays off in closure. No mixed metaphors; vehicles stay physical. One scaffold: “She’d return… She’d return…” repeated anaphora could trim. Information density strong; sentences multitask. No artifact touches final image; momentum carries to spiral. Clean grammar; strong verbs anchor transformation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: cryptid contact via static confessions through retro phone grounds cosmic horror in retro-tech. Arrowhead as tech/shamanic fuse feels specific. Risk: mystic metamorphosis could slide into familiar eco-uncanny, but bodily bark and open-spiral twist it. Not transformative enough for 8.5—premise echoes Annihilation-adjacent zones—but execution is particularized.</comment>
