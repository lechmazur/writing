<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory tug—need to outrun paternal deceit yet echo his storytelling—drives every beat; the twin-figure moment crystallizes this. Interiority stays embodied (“lattice’s edges biting into his palm”). Final renunciation of corpse-hunt for self-authored story costs him certainty and is cued by prior hallucinated twin. Voice never slips into diagnostic self-talk.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: lattice, scuffs, copperlight accrue density until silver chamber re-prices meaning. Closure—lattice clink + reef view—earns Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias accepts narrative responsibility at visible cost (bodies still unfound). Orientation lands by line 3; spatial logic clean. Single causal hiccup: identical twin appears without prior seed, but pays off thematic doubling so waived minor.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Jagged reef/lighthouse skeleton, copperlight bleeding walls, lattice as micro-setting all constrain movement and image. Sensory triage—salt, rust, metal bite—mirrors Elias’s fevered filter. Final reef vista recharges “bodies” dread, feeding RR. Environment materially shapes hover path and final stance; no white-room lapses.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: replace father’s lies with lived truth before corpses surface. Pressure tightens when lattice blooms and twin demands story completion; Elias’s choice to plant lattice beside father’s rusted one visibly forecloses denial. Cost—ownership of inevitable corpse discovery—made legible in final reef gaze. One meaningful escalation suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme: authorship as inheritance vs. self-forgiveness. Emerges via lattice-as-pen metaphor and charged echo of “chasing hush.” No moralizing; final laugh through keyhole offers oblique wisdom. Subtext in ghost’s silence at end signals grudging approval, reconfiguring generational guilt.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s synesthetic lens (“copperlight repose,” “sound like wind through a keyhole”). Rhythm swells then compresses with emotional temperature. No head-hop; diction salty, metallic, child-of-lighthouse authentic. Dialogue sparse, carries subtext; hooded twin’s rasp distinct from father ghost’s brine-hiss.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Succinct high-density lines (“lattice…twisted like a question”). Metaphor clusters taught early; no mixed vehicles at closure. One scaffold paraphrase spotted (“tightened”/“tightening” within two lines) but outside climax. Pacing breathes correctly during hover. Read-aloud ear test passes; final keyhole simile lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: lighthouse-as-prison + confessional lattice = penitentiary sacrament. “Chasing hush” reverses wolf-fable into metaphysical quest. Twin apparition risks cliché yet serves generational doppelgänger theme. Risky lyric hover sustained without physics explanation because magic rule taught early and repaid in final image.</comment>
