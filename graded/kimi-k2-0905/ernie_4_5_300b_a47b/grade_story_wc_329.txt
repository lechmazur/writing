<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira’s longing is vivid—her bleeding fingers, moth-wing hands—but the interior contradiction between “reawaken beauty” and “let chaos hold order” is asserted, not dramatized. The locust-shell heartbeat is original embodiment, yet the final leap to “trust chaos” feels lightly earned because no prior choice shows her risking failure on that belief. Still, her micro-choices (pressing shell to crack, playing past snapped string) visibly cost her body, satisfying the 9+ quick test for endured price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the orchard’s re-wilding and Lira’s broken violin crystallize a new stance whose cost is the statues’ crumbled emptiness and her own blood on the bridge. Causal chain holds—shell vibration → core flicker → geyser → cracks—tightened by one meaningful escalation. Orientation is clean by line 5; no lens ambiguity. The −0.4 non-closure cap applies: while the final image reweights meaning, the story does not foreclose future threats, keeping it shy of 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Glass sky-bridge, metallic peaches, crystalline cores—each detail is filtered through Lira’s tactile use (shell pressed to stone, sap smelling of memory). The locust shell acts as micro-setting that constrains her final tactic, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is flawless: bridge tremor, geyser under roots, statues lock in place. Only the orchard’s eastern wall remains a floating landmark, preventing the last 0.3.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“reawaken beauty”—is signaled early and tightens when the first statue crack forces her to risk the shell. Agency drives every beat: she chooses to play past bleeding, to blow the shell like a flute, to accept the bridge’s tremor. Cost is visceral (snapped string, blood, empty sockets revealed), but the escalation is single-arc; no secondary reversal raises the ante further. Sufficient for high band, not exceptional.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the price of control is emptiness, the price of freedom is fragility. Subtext lives in the statues’ hollow sockets and the orchard’s honeyed sap—no moralizing required. Final image of the bridge “trembling in anticipation” reweights the premise without stating a thesis. The locust shell’s shift from secret to catalyst supplies the charged callback that lifts it above mid-band.</comment>

<comment>Third-person lyric stays locked to Lira’s perceptual lens: “grass sang a song Lira had never heard.” Syntax lengthens under pressure then fractures into short clauses at the climax, mirroring the snapped string. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. The diction (“resonantly soft,” “tarnished wonder”) is consistent and purposeful, earning the high band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene tempo: long cadences for orchard dusk, staccato fragments as statues crack. Metaphors are coherent—peaches “like captured sunsets” returns as “peaches fell like tears,” creating echo without loop. No synonym churn or filter-verb stacks. One mixed image—“cloud of iridescent dust that swirled into the air, settling on the statues like a curse”—is minor artifact; does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of locust-shell bio-rhythm + stone-core magic + violin lullaby feels inevitable yet fresh. Risk is taken: a 740-word lyric arc that resolves in iridescent dust instead of battle, trusting image over exposition. The orchard’s re-wilding reframes classic “order vs. chaos” through tactile sound-work rather than ideology. No derivative premise guardrail applies; transformation is complete.</comment>
