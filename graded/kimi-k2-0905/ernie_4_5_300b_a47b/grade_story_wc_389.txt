<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Kael’s interior contradiction—yearning for isolation yet magnetized by the storm’s voices—is dramatized in scene through micro-adjustments of dials and palm-on-glass tremors. The embodied cost (aching joints, gritty laugh) makes his shift from passive listener to active prism credible. No secondary character on-page, so relationship crucible absent; lone-POV focus stays sharp. Final renunciation of fear is earned by prior causal chain: static → prophecy → self-revelation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each tuning of the radio tightens knowledge and narrows options until the prism mechanism literalizes the “split.” Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—Kael re-weights the storm from threat to instrument, cost legible in the sand defying gravity. Orientation anchored by word 70 (“observatory’s cobalt glass portico”). No teleporting props; hourglass state tracked throughout. Slight over-reliance on lyric summary between beats keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cobalt glass, hourglass, and radio rig function as micro-setting that literally constrain final tactic—prism refraction requires their physical arrangement. Storm altitude is more than postcard; wind howl and glass vibration decide timing of mirror activation. Sensory hierarchy skews auditory/tactile, matching Kael’s engineer-ear. Final image of glowing portico recharges opening “drowned skies” hue, now internally lit—setting charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—wrest a usable future from dead voices—signaled early. One meaningful tightening: the third-eye riddle forces invention of prism trick, foreclosing retreat to mere listening. Cost is visibility—he becomes the lightning rod the city will fear. Agency is continuous (tuning, writing, activating mirrors); no coincidences resolve tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: knowledge demands embodiment—one must become the conduit, not just the receiver. Storm-as-language and glass-as-prism motifs accrue pressure rather than decorate; their final fusion reconfigures meaning. No moralizing sentence mars ending. Ambiguity lingers: will the city below embrace or burn? Complexity preserved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person intimate maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is engineer-auditory (“frequencies called,” “static resolved into hymn”). Diction stays within Kael’s lexicon—no academic drift. Rhythm accelerates with shorter clauses during mirror activation, mirroring heartbeat. No dialogue, hence no voice contamination.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density: “jagged fingers streaking the night with electric blue” does three jobs in eight words. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or choice. Metaphors stay coherent—storm as language, glass as prism, sand as time—no mixed vehicles. Final line (“symphony of thunder and fractured radio waves”) lands with cadence match to opening, earning its lyrical swell.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Storm-harnessing precursor civilization is familiar sf territory, but execution pivots to interior engineer-mystic fusion that feels fresh. Prism-instead-of-telescope mechanic is specific and non-obvious. Risky lyric density mostly paid off; lacks single knockout freshness to reach 9.0.</comment>
