<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is concrete—her ear pricks, her brow furrows, her hands ache—yet her contradictory impulses (curiosity vs. duty) stay verbalized rather than enacted in split-second body choice. The moment she “grins” at the sharper bell tone instantly shows embodied emotion, but the later stance shift back to “humble” reads more label than cost. No genuine flaw complicates her final maestro beat; the cost is atmospheric, not personal, so the arc feels competent rather than crucible-forged.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: frayed rope → glue stiffening → muted test → secondary rope → new tone → agitates storms → rhythmic duet → clouds calm. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the bell hangs silent but the solstice hush is now “forged,” a visible reconfiguration with felt atmospheric cost. Orientation arrives by word 60; no lens ambiguity. The persistent constraint (rope timbre rules the sky) shapes every tactic and the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The windblown sanctuary above clouds is not backdrop but instrument: rope, pulley, stone sundial, arched windows all constrain Lira’s moves. The bell’s lip, the secondary slick rope, the thick air density—each tactile detail alters her next experiment. Final image of rope texture “rough but familiar” recharges the opening dangle, crystallizing the maestro-becoming. Micro-setting (tower chamber panel) literally hides the tool that flips the plot.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can one tester’s listening prevent premature storm rage—tightens when the new tone stirs clouds, foreclosing the option to remain passive. Escalation is causal: bell agitates → must re-pattern → arms ache as price. No abstract stakes; every beat tests the acoustic rule-set. Cost is visible (aching arms, softened cloud edges) and reweights future listening duty.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges as “listening as composition”: the sanctuary is a conductor, the storm a chorus, the self a maestro—yet this insight is voiced by Elder Veyra, a mild thematic echo. Otherwise the meaning accrues through tactile acoustics and atmospheric response, avoiding moralizing. Final image of rope texture offers quiet conceptual repricing: mastery is rough familiarity, not triumph. Ambiguity lingers—storms will shift again—keeping the theme open.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person close keeps to Lira’s perceptual filter: “ears prick,” “brow furrow,” lexicon of sound and wind. Rhythm compresses under pressure—“She tugged…clacked…rushed”—then lengthens during the calming duet, mirroring breathing clouds. No head-hopping; Elder Veyra’s dialogue is spare, subtextual. Syntax stays within credible siren-tester diction; no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sentences carry double duty: “The sound died too quickly, swallowed by the thick air” advances plot and conveys density. One scaffold loop: “She’d spent years tracking…Today was zero hour” could compress. Metaphors stay coherent—bell tone “like a knife,” clouds “fractal patterns”—no mixed vehicles. Final paragraph cadence slows into earned stasis without artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Storm-tuning via cathedral bell is fresh, yet “architects harmonized with sky” flirts with familiar eco-fantasy. Specificity of glue-stiffened hemp damping partials gives acoustic nerd bite. Transformation test passes: swap rope for generic lever and the sky-response logic collapses. Risk is moderate—lyric acoustic sf—but execution stays coherent, not gimmick.</comment>
