<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Kael’s dreamlessness is stated, not dramatized; the coat-of-light gift externalizes change instead of forcing him to pay an internal cost. The final beat—“for the first time, Kael dreamed”—is declarative summary; we feel no bodily shock or contradiction. Interiority stays generic (“chest ached”) and never shows conflicting impulses under pressure. The woman’s flickering presence is vivid but functions as oracle, not crucible; thus Kael’s turn feels assisted rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands: the ticking clock and newborn sparks give a legible Decisive Change with conceptual cost—the archive’s survival now depends on a formerly dreamless guard. Causality is thin: “become occasionally everywhere” is asserted, not linked to prior freight-guard skills or constraints. Orientation is waived; the lyric disorientation pays off in the final image. One meaningful tightening occurs when Kael twists the hands, but the middle lacks intermediate beats that narrow options under pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The glowing dune, crystalline towers, and bioluminescent sand are tactile, sensory, and immediately constrain movement (sinking boots, pulsing ground). The chess clock’s etched “language of waves and particles” is a micro-setting object that charges the final image when it restarts. Selective detail—“smell of burnt honey and static”—filters through Kael’s guard-trained attention. Spatial choreography is clean; the woman leaves no footprints, a subtle status cue that never needs explaining.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“cultivate the sparks or lose imagination forever”—is signaled early and crystallized in the soap-bubble tower. Pressure escalates once: sand dims → Kael chooses to twist the clock → sparks ignite. However, the middle lacks successive complications or resource losses; the woman’s exposition substitutes for mounting obstacles. Cost is conceptual (archive’s future) rather than viscerally felt by Kael, limiting high-band entry.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme—dreams as renewable infrastructure—emerges through image (forest-roots tangling stars) rather than statement. The final re-pricing is strong: a freight guard who never dreamed now wears a coat of light, implying stewardship without moralizing. Subtext flickers in the woman’s coat left behind, a quiet transfer of responsibility. Occasional abstractions (“wave function,” “unlit corners”) flirt with thesis-speak but are offset by sensory grounding.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Kael’s perceptual filter; diction—“bioluminescent,” “static,” “freight”—suits a guard who catalogs sensations. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for dune walks, staccato beats when the clock is handled. The woman’s dialogue is oracular but rhythmically distinct from Kael’s interior. No head-hopping; POV distance holds through the final coat-handover.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is vivid yet disciplined: “sand that pulsed like a heartbeat” does double sensory duty. No loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances image or stakes. One mixed metaphor—“fractured lullaby of heat and light”—is permissible in lyric mode. Filter verbs are minimal; strong verbs (“erupted,” “tangling”) propel the final paragraph. Clean copy; no grammar slips or spatial contradictions.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The dream-archive as arboreal infrastructure reframes climate grief into speculative hope without sermons. A chess clock measuring “the moment between choices” is a fresh temporal object; its restart becomes the story’s heartbeat. Risk: lyric compression could have collapsed into gimmick, yet sensory specificity keeps it grounded. The synthesis feels inevitable—guard + archive + broken clock = new growth—achieving transformation, not novelty for its own sake.</comment>
