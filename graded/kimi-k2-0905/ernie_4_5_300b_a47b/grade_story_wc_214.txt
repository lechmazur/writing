<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Zara’s interiority is rich—calloused hands, dawn-glass lantern, spiritual curiosity—but the “cosmic janitor” tag never constrains or enables a concrete choice; her walk to the crater reads as poetic inevitability, not a micro-choice under pressure. The final smile at Veyra is the first visible cost, so renunciation is earned, yet the emotional arc leans on abstract empathy rather than a forked decision with stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative lens: the repeated motif of “listening to silence” accretes until the lantern’s dimmed glow + captured stardust reweights the premise—science versus spirit—into a Charged Poise with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation is swift; causality is lyric, not plot-driven, and the final image lands the RR cleanly under the Accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Plateau, obsidian shards, bones, domes etched with constellations—each detail is filtered through Zara’s spiritual attentiveness and constrains her barefoot trek. The yellow lantern glass functions as micro-setting, its glow guiding path and final image; weather is cosmic, not meteorological, and remains consistent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: the courage to let go / embrace vulnerability via stellar dissolution. Pressure tightens once: the fracturing meteor → walk → crater → lantern dimming; cost is conceptual (loss of starlight, acceptance of transience) rather than tangible, sufficient for this length but not viscerally felt on the body.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of “flourishing stillness” emerges through the accumulating hush between meteor bursts; final lantern-glass speck reframes silence as active receptacle, avoiding overt moralizing. Subtext in Veyra’s cracked facade supplies social irony without explicit statement, satisfying complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains consistent cosmic-reverent diction; perceptual signature is Zara’s spiritually attuned sensorium. No dialogue to fail; prose rhythm breathes with aurora imagery, no register drift. Filter verbs (“she believed”) are minimal and voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Figurative language is dense—almost every sentence carries a metaphor—but the pattern is taught early (“sky hung low…stars burned so close”) and paid off in the final star-speck, so density penalty waived. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; sentences vary in length and cadence. Opening and closing lines are precise and image-driven.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The “cosmic janitor” trope is inverted: no broom, no comic relief—instead a mystic listener whose tool is antique science relic turned spiritual compass. Fusion of astronomy with inner cartography feels fresh; risk of lyric stasis is accepted and lands cleanly. Little overlap with familiar meteor-wish clichés.</comment>
