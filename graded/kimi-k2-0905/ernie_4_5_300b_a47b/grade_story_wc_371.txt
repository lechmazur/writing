<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elias’s quiet, watching nature is credibly particular, but interiority stays on the abstract side (“he understood,” “he smiled, understanding”) rather than embodied contradiction. The single micro-choice—planting the seed—earns mild cost yet feels more emblematic than urgent. No genuine flaw complicates the act; the arc is gentle acceptance rather than pressured change. The absence of an on-page second character keeps status/relationship bullets inactive.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration: the garden becomes a living map of fractures in creeping normality, and the sunflower seed reweights meaning without exposition. Causality is light, mostly associative; the Accumulative/Textural lens is internally coherent and sustained. Orientation is clear by 65 words; no penalty applied. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, but the final image carries undeniable conceptual repricing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The tea house, bread, and courtyard are sketched with selective sensory strokes (“damp earth and jasmine,” “green flames”) filtered through Elias’s skewed attention. Setting subtly guides choice—he plants where someone else already cracked the stone. While no prop or micro-setting directly constrains the final beat, the courtyard’s evolving saplings reconfigure meaning at closure, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial tracking stays clean; no geography drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding the sacred inside eroding normalcy—is signaled early but remains contemplative; pressure escalates only through quietly blooming saplings. The single tightening is the swap of vanished bread for sunflower seed, a conceptual rather than tactical narrowing. Agency is gentle attention, renouncing despair rather than risking anything concrete; cost is oblique. Coincidence (old woman’s arrival) complicates but does not resolve, keeping lens coherence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of “creeping normality as map of fractures” emerges through concrete pattern—bread, saplings, seed—never thesis. Final image reconfigures absolution as iterative gardening, avoiding moral tag. Subtext lives in gesture: touching soil instead of Eucharistic bread. Complexity is present yet stays modest; counter-readings linger but feel gentle rather than gnarled.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person close keeps perceptual signature consistent: Elias clocks flickers, paler roses, yellowed screens. Rhythm breathes with longer reflective sentences then tightens when he digs. No dialogue to distort voice. Filter verbs appear but stay character-colored (“he noticed,” “he thought”) rather than intrusive. Diction remains within plausible lexicon; no register drift at climax.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm with varied sentence openings. Occasional template cadence (“he…”, “the…”) but not clustered under pressure. Two adjacent near-paraphrases (“heuristically gentle,… cautious” / “approached the unknown with caution”) dock −0.2. Metaphors stay coherent; no mixed vehicles. Density is solid—each sentence either advances image, stakes, or atmosphere. No artifact touches closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis links guerrilla gardening to sacred archaeology of the everyday; premise avoids stock dystopia or mystic bakery cliché by keeping magic minimal and metaphoric. Transformation test fails—core arc could survive with different “impossible” object—but specificity of vanished bakery stamp and sunflower seed lends local irreplaceability. Risk is quiet, not gimmicky. Emotional truth feels lived rather than borrowed.</comment>
