<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clara’s interiority is concrete—breath fogging glass, quill cramping—yet her skeptic→wonder shift is slightly under-cooked: the tile’s first memory-dump is accepted with only a generic “heart racing,” no embodied contradiction. Aelia’s courage is relayed as retrospective summary rather than dramatized micro-choice, so the kinship feels inferred, not pressured. Still, the final pocketing of the tile is a tangible, cost-carrying endurance that earns its quiet poignancy.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Clara’s copied patterns discharge the tile’s burden, reweighting her stance from dismissive observer to guarded wonder; the whales’ softening song provides audible cost. Causal linkage is light—tile activation is accidental, not a choice—but under an Accumulative lens the density of mirrored stargazers and whale hymns lands cleanly. Orientation is secure by word 60; no teleporting props. One tightening beat suffices; escalation is present but gentle.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Indigo sky, cliff-hum, moss-clogged tile, cramp of ink-stained fingers—selective sensory triangulation keeps the tower and tile active as micro-setting that constrains transcription posture and frames the final pocketing. Whale-song pitch-shift is used as diegetic clock rather than decorative atmosphere. The telescope, inkpot, and grooved square are handled repeatedly, evolving from tool to conduit to talisman, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—intellectual integrity versus hunger for wonder—is declared early; pressure escalates once when memory incursion forces Clara to keep writing or break the spell. Cost is present (cramped hand, warmed tower air, softened skepticism) yet remains low-impact; no option is permanently foreclosed. Sufficient for length, but not scalp-prickling.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: transmission of curiosity across ostracized women, knowledge as lineage rather than proof. No reader-moralizing; final image of tile in pocket silently re-prices the premise. Whales and star-maps recur with shifting emotional valence, but symbolism stays sub-textual. Complexity is present—wonder and rigor coexist—yet resonance is gentle rather than searing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited clings tightly to Clara’s perceptual filter: “breath fogging the glass,” “quill a blur,” whale-song heard as “distant hymns.” Syntax modulates from clipped observational notes to longer, liquid clauses mirroring entranced transcription. No dialogue, hence no voice convergence issue. Register remains within an urban-skeptic stargazer’s lexicon; no academic drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong read-aloud cadence: sentence length varies, paragraph cuts are crisp. Occasional soft scaffold—“she realized,” “she thought”—but never in peak beats. Metaphors are spare and coherent (“songs meant for ears long gone”). One paraphrase loop: “transcribe the symbols… letting her hand move through forgotten patterns” restates the prior sentence’s gist, a −0.2 artifact. Otherwise propulsion stays high; no mixed metaphors or register slips.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Familiar tropes—mystic object, ancestral memory, lonely astronomer—are refreshed by whale-migration sonic clock and the tile’s transcription act as technological interface to magic. Dual-timeline parallelism is implicit rather than schematic, avoiding pat “we are alike” dialogue. Specificity of ink-and-quill ritual against hydrophone-ready whale hymns gives the fusion a local signature. Not breathtakingly new, but sufficiently particularized.</comment>
