<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is textured—“the hollow where her courage used to live”—and her decision to vouchsafe the codes is embodied in kneeling, quill-in-dirt action. Yet contradictory impulses stay mostly sequential (dream memory → present resolve) rather than simultaneous; the final stance crystallizes but the cost is more asserted (“the real journey…had only just begun”) than dramatized on-page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: dream prompt → pillbox coordinates → bluff transcription → resolve to seek truth. Closure is Charged Poise—“she walked in the silver hush, her steps lighter”—reconfiguring options with felt cost (she has burned anonymity to leave the message). Orientation is clear by line 15; only minor scaffold in the “three weeks earlier” flash frame.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Zephyr Bluff’s mist, iron railing, and gravel patch are tactile and filter through spy-trained attention; the pillbox and quill serve as micro-setting that charge the final image. Weather (spring tilt, meltwater) is repeatedly invoked but does not physically constrain choice or tighten stakes—decorative rather than tactical—so falls short of 9-band gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—deliver the code while evading exposure—is signaled early; one meaningful tightening occurs when she chooses permanent transcription in soil, forfeiting retreat. Agency is present yet external pressure (antagonist presence, weather deadline) remains abstract; cost is conceptual rather than viscerally felt on-page, capping escalation below 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of “unused courage” emerges through pillbox transmission ritual rather than statement; final image of lighter steps reweights earlier spiral-symbol without moralizing. Subtext in father’s marginalia is elegant, but theme is somewhat monolithic—no competing value to complicate the courage arc—keeping it shy of 9.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person intimate sustains a consistent lyrical-spy diction—“codes in accumulated snow,” “silver hush”—with rhythmic control that modulates under pressure. No dialogue to test speech distinction; perceptual signature is strong (cold iron, pipe-tobacco memory). Filter verbs minimal; only minor cadence echoes (“mist…silver hush…silver hush”) prevent 8.8+.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies, openings avoid template, metaphors stay coherent; a few adjacent near-paraphrases (“promise of renewal” / “spring was coming”) and soft abstract nouns (“uncertainties,” “brokenness”) slightly dull edge. Information density is high; no scaffolding or simultaneity errors; closing line lands cleanly on image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Combining spy tradecraft with thawing-code metaphor gives fresh inflection; however, the “burned spy confronts dead parent’s legacy” frame is familiar, and the bluff-as-liminal-space trope is common in literary thrillers. Specificity of ink-into-soil transmission rescues it from template, but not enough transformative risk for 8.5+.</comment>
