<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s grief over Lira is concrete—his trembling hands, the whispered answer to her final question—and his micro-choice to name the monsters anyway crystallizes his hierarchy of values. Interiority stays specific to a reaper who no longer reaps: “the reaper’s heart, once broken, now beat with distant intimacy.” No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene, so the arc is linear rather than torn, capping the score below 8.8.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the atlas page absorbs the monsters, the prism extinguishes, and Elias exits with “the ache of knowing”—a legible cost under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is sound: prism → light → naming → dissolution, each step because/therefore. The orientation anchor (who/where/when) is clear by line 4; no penalty applied.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The observatory’s dusk light, rust smell, and cracked marble ground every action; the prism’s cold weight and the page’s new heft constrain Elias’s final choice. Micro-setting—the atlas page itself—becomes the closure vessel, satisfying the 9+ gate. One missed opportunity: the wax cylinders are heard, not handled, so their physicality never alters tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“give names to nameless fears”—is signaled early and tightens when the echoes beg “Do not name them,” forcing Elias to risk re-awakening the monsters. The single deepening (naming → absorption) carries visible cost: the page grows heavy, the prism flares out. No secondary trade-off complicates the arc, keeping escalation efficient but not multi-layered.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sacrifice emerges through refracted light and the named/absorbed monsters rather than any thematic statement; the final ache reweights the premise without moralizing. The atlas page’s shift from anonymous terror to contained memory offers a resonant, non-literal answer to “what’s on the other side?” One slight abstraction—“the echo of sacrifice”—is spoken by the chorus, not the narrator, so the thematic echo feels earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual filter: dust, rust, amber streaks, the prism’s cold facets. Syntax lengthens under pressure—“The observatory’s air thickened, the temperature dropping”—then snaps short at exit, mirroring his resumed stride. No head-hopping or register drift; the distant intimacy tone is maintained through selective sensory narrowing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is lean and image-dense: “stone walls streaked with the amber light of dusk” does triple duty for time, place, and mood. One scaffold loop—“echoes began as whispers… the whispers grew louder”—repeats the noun without new pressure; a −0.2 artifact keeps the score sub-8.8. Otherwise rhythm varies, verbs stay strong, and no mixed metaphors muddy the climax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>The reaper-turned-cartographer who names fears into extinction feels fresh, yet the wax-cylinder-to-monster pipeline leans on familiar cosmic-horror scaffolding. Specificity of the prism method and the atlas page’s iridescent scales transform the trope enough to avoid derivation penalty. A bolder risk—perhaps a failed naming that scars Elias—could have pushed originality above 8.5.</comment>
