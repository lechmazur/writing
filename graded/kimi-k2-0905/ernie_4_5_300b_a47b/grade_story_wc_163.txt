<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority drifts into atmospheric summary (“a feeling she’d long associated with the surface world”) rather than embodied contradiction. The burnt feather is handled twice but never tests or crystallizes a decision; her final stance is acceptance without visible cost. No micro-choice under pressure tightens her state; she observes, then smiles. Lacks earned stasis or charged poise.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Closure is a gentle Charged Poise: the shared exhale reweights belonging from abstract wish to collective moment. Causality is accumulative/image-driven; the alignment arrives externally, not because of Mara’s acts. The lens holds, but the cost is diffuse—loss of solitude rather than a foreclosed path. Timed sunrise acts as soft boundary, not tightening constraint.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Underwater dome, decaying corridors, and bioluminescent flora are concretely filtered through Mara’s star-mapping gaze. Selective sensory triage—pressure on glass, algae swallowing walls—guides attention rather than cataloguing. Burnt feather’s charred edge catching glow is micro-setting that charges final image. Spatial choreography stays clean; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—proving underwater skies exist—stays internal and observational; no live option is foreclosed. Alignment deepens texture but does not test Mara’s ingenuity or risk failure. Escalation is atmospheric, not causal; tension plateaus rather than tightens. Cost is diffuse wonder, not a priced trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of belonging emerges through light-pattern imagery rather than thesis. Final image of “shadowseam wonder” reconfigures isolation into shared witnessing. Avoids overt moral; ambiguity lingers about whether rhythm is projection or discovery. Slight sentimental lift in “rhythm worth dancing to” but stays within earned tone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature is astronomical, noting constellations and pulses. Syntax stays controlled, with rhythmic variance mirroring light cadence. No head-hopping; researcher voices remain external. Compression in “Tonight, we’ll share an exhale” teaches ritual pattern early.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical but disciplined; figurative language stays tethered to marine optics. Occasional soft filler (“softly ingenious,” “gentle hand against glass”) drifts toward template cadence. No mixed metaphors or loops, yet density drops in mid-section during researcher gathering. Closure line lands clean without scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Underwater star-mapping is fresh angle; bioluminescent flora syncing with surface stars gives non-obvious image. Conceptual risk—quiet accumulative awe instead of plot reversal—pays off tonally. Some phrasing edges familiar lyric templates (“forgotten places,” “light that filtered”). Transformation is present but modest.</comment>
