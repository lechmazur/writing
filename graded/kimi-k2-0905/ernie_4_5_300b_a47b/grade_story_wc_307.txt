<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—mentor vs. guardian of secrecy—are alive in every beat; her decision to let Lira struggle is dramatized, not declared. The spiraling ripple that triggers Lira’s “becoming” is the earned payoff of this withheld facilitation, with felt cost in Elara’s own unspoken loneliness. Interiority stays sensorial (“silver hair catching starlight”) rather than diagnostic. Minor slip: Lira’s interiority is reported rather than embodied, so the crucible is slightly lopsided.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the spiral ripple re-weights the entire rule-set—vanishing is re-defined as *arriving*—with visible cost in Elara’s relinquishing of omniscient control. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each stone-throw densifies the pattern until the helix break crystallizes new knowledge. No teleporting props; the obsidian stone’s glow tracks causally. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by line 4 and are never violated.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The magnetic grotto’s hum, the floating platform’s vibration, and the bioluminescent moss are not backdrop but tactical instruments that constrain how trance is entered and how time folds. The obsidian stone’s pulse is handled in three beats, its final sink re-configuring meaning. Sensory hierarchy skews visual, but the kinetic pull of magnetism and the tactile moss keep it from white-room syndrome. Environment directly shapes the culminating spiral image—qualifies 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—control of revelation—tightens when Elara refuses to verbalize the spiral’s meaning, trading immediate clarity for Lira’s deeper arrival. The helix ripple is the single decisive intensification that reweights options under the Accumulative lens. Cost is legible: Elara accepts the loneliness of never being understood in real time. Could edge higher if a tangible resource (time, health) were visibly forfeit, but the conceptual forfeit is on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without dictation: withheld knowledge as love, vanishing as genesis. The spiral image offers a non-literal answer—appearing is the deeper form of vanishing—reconfiguring prior fractals. No final-paragraph moralizing; silence itself is the thesis. Ambiguity lingers: is Elara liberating or abandoning Lira? Complexity is embraced, not balanced away.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays latched to Elara; perceptual signature is unmistakable—starlight as liquid mercury, magnetic grotto as breath. Syntax mirrors backward-aging youth: cadences grow lighter, more curious toward the end. No head-hop; Lira’s interiority is reported through Elara’s filter, a minor modesty lapse but consistent within Elara’s observational mode. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with trance—long sentences swell, then fracture at the helix moment. Mixed metaphors are avoided; “starlight pooled like liquid mercury” is precise, not purple. No synonym churn or template cadence; each sentence advances pattern or pressure. Information density high: one line often does image, motion, and emotional tilt.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: time-travel as inward collapse, mentor-student via purposeful silence, stone-skipped fractals as pedagogy. The delayed-revelation structure itself is the innovation—teaching *withholding* as love. Risky choice to make climax a visual pattern rather than verbal explanation, yet it lands cleanly. Not a stitched prompt response; vision feels singular and committed.</comment>
