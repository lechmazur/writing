<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lirael’s grief for her brother and chronicler’s detachment are cleanly dramatized; the moment she lets the prism’s light “warm her” embodies the decisive surrender of detachment. Interiority stays concrete, though the brother’s voice remains off-stage; a single hairline slip keeps this from 8.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: telegram → prism → temple hologram → acceptance → wall etching; each beat narrows options under the chosen lens. Closure lands on-page—“a lullaby in her brother’s handwriting”—with felt cost; the prism’s constraint shapes every tactical move. Micro-turn at the hologram floor perfectly tightens the stake.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The frosted dome, brass sextant, and variable-star prism are tactile, bias-filtered, and directly constrain action; the prism doubles as micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory selection stays urgent and narrow; no orientation debt. The silver-moth observatory satisfies the 9+ gate by shaping tactics and final charge.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</question><comment>Dominant stake—decode shifting temple to recover brother—tightens once when glyphs stabilize only after she absorbs others’ grief. Cost is visible: she accepts the burdens etching into her skin. No冗余 reversals; one meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Theme of empathy-as-translation emerges through glyph absorption rather than assertion; the final lullaby offers resonant, non-literal answer. No sermonizing; ambiguity lingers about what “carrying” will cost long-term.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Voice is lyric, compressed, pattern-taught early (“silver moth trapped in amber”) and paid off in the amber dawn. Perceptual signature is astronomer-poet: light bends, gears whirr, equations fog. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens under pressure. Minor over-prettiness in one clause keeps it sub-9.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</question>
<comment>Rhythmic control and high density; sentences carry double duty. One mixed metaphor (“light pooling like melted silver”) is a hairline slip that does not touch closure. No loops, scaffold, or template cadence. Read-aloud ear test passes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Variable stars as empathy mirrors is a fresh synthesis; celestial cartography plus dream archaeology feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (lyric causal arc) heightens coherence rather than gimmickry. Premise is transformed through grounded specifics, not checklist tokens.</comment>
