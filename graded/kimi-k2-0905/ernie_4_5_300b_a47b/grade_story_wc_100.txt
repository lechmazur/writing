<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elias’s “inadvertently stubborn” nature is stated but never complicates choice in-scene; his turn from resisting revival to embracing stewardship is summarized. The interior contradiction between burying secrets and resurrecting them is asserted, not dramatized under pressure; only in the final line does he articulate the shift. Embodied emotion is vivid early (“hands trembled… salt-crusted ink”) but flattens to exposition once underwater. Micro-choices (welding glass, atlas-mending) are generic proxies for transformation; the cost is declared, not felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): “rest is here now” reweights stillness as beginning, with conceptual cost of lifelong commitment visible. Pattern of lens/light/book imagery taught early; cadence shift at final beam reprises and crystallizes meaning. Orientation clean at 120 w. Causality break slight: shift from refusal to lifelong stay occurs off-page between paragraphs; no intermediate beat shows the hinge.</comment>

<comment>Brine, kelp, silt, molten resin—tactile, POV-filtered details resist tourist catalog. Dome library’s spiral shelves and floating books are rendered through goal-directed scavenging, not static tableau. Micro-setting of fractured lens constrains welding tactic; gold-leaf scars mirror character healing, charging closure image. Spatial choreography tracked cleanly during descent and dome entry; no impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</question>
<comment>Single dominant stake: can rest be permanent without resurrection of what was buried? Pressure tightens when lens repair becomes gateway to that possibility. Escalation is textural: each shard mended increases density of “distress signal” motif until beam finally reweights option—stay vs. surface. On-page cost: lifelong exile stated, but decision itself happens in narrative summary; hence cost legible yet not viscerally paid in-scene.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</question>
<comment>Theme—rest as active stewardship, not terminus—emerges through beam image and atlas-mending gestures rather than thesis line. Stillness redefined from coffin to library; ambiguity accepted without moral tag. Subtext in Marisol’s tidepool whisper and gold-leaf scars transmits idea that brokenness can guide. Final image’s “chased stillness” offers resonant conceptual reprice; earlier goldfish burial memory seeds same question, paid off at end.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited anchored in Elias; perceptual signature consistent—undertaker lexicon of coffins, shovels, embalming fluid. Rhythm modulates: terse clauses underwater, longer cadence during beam activation. Filter verbs minimal; sensory verbs (“tasted of brine”) kept immediate. Dialogue sparse, subtextual: Marisol’s “You’re late” carries centuries of pressure. No head-hopping; Marisol’s interior accessed only through Elias inference.</comment>

<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies; paragraph cuts tight—each advances knowledge or stakes. Metaphors selective: “spider’s web” lens, “tidepool whisper,” no overcrowding. One paraphrase loop: “city is a coffin too / this place is a coffin” could compress. Otherwise clean propulsion, strong verbs, no scaffold. Copy-edit clean; pronouns stable.</comment>

<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fusion of undertaker, lighthouse lens, drowned library creates fresh mythic space. Stubbornness trope given marine twist; resurrection motif inverted—revive knowledge, not bodies. Risk: centuries-old magical caretaker verges on fantasy cliché, but grounded by occupational specificity. Synthesis feels inevitable: grief work → signal repair → stillness as vocation.</comment>
