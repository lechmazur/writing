<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elio’s “quietly persistent” trait is shown through tactile searching and wordless singing, but interior contradiction is only hinted at; the final choice to sing feels gentle rather than costly, so the arc stays light. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A. Micro-choices are present (kneel, pocket shard, open ivy door) yet none force a visible trade-off; the halo fragment warms but never cuts or compels sacrifice. Earned stasis is implied—he leaves without reclaiming the train—but the cost is atmospheric, not embodied.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: images (mist, dust, wildflower circle, fountain ripple code) layer until the courtyard reconfigures meaning. Orientation is swift: “abandoned circus train… overgrown yard” anchors by line 3. The halo fragment functions as a CR device—its glow re-prices silence from void to fertile ground, and this lands on-page. Causality is lyric rather than because/therefore, but pattern is taught early (“interpret silence as possibility”) and paid off in the final image of song completing the space.</comment>

<comment>Sensory triage favors hush and glints—rust flakes, cool shard edges, sun-warmed metal—each filtered through Elio’s carpenter reflex. The carousel skeleton and ivy-curtained door are sketched with spatial economy; bodies track cleanly from train interior to courtyard circle. Micro-setting succeeds: the halo fragment’s crescent curve literally orients Elio to the fountain’s ripple pattern that “only he could read.” No occupational error or anachronism; weather is static mist, but it serves tone rather than choice, so just below 8.8 gate.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—“find beauty in quiet”—is declared early; pressure accrues atmospherically rather than through narrowing options. The only tightening is the moment wind bells fall silent under his song; this is a cadence shift, not a trade-off. No visible price is paid: shard warms but doesn’t wound, flowers rearrange but impose no cost. Escalation is textural (mist → playful mist → embracing mist) rather than causal; fine for Accumulative lens but keeps score shy of 8.0 band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme—silence as generative medium—emerges imagistically; no explicit thesis is spoken. The fountain’s ripple “language” and wildflower circle reweight the prompt’s “misting hush” from elegy to germination. Subtext stays in gesture: he sings rather than proclaims, letting silence answer back. Final image resists moral, but the concept stays gentle; lacks the conceptual bite needed for 9-band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person close adheres to Elio’s taciturn filter: diction limited to carpenterly terms (“crescent moon” shard, “tarnished brass”). Rhythm mirrors hush—long vowels, comma pull-outs—then tightens when shard bites skin. No dialogue, so voice convergence N/A. Pattern of elision (“a language only he could decipher”) is taught early and paid off in ripple code, keeping control under lyrical pressure.</comment>

<comment>Read-aloud cadence varies: short declaratives (“He tucked it into his pocket”) alternate with image-rich extensions. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds either sensory data or causal impetus. Metaphors stay internally coherent (“broken toy” train, “mouse’s whispers” boots). Minor pocketed filter verbs (“seemed to listen”) are voice-motivated; they sustain the tentative atmosphere rather than dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Combines three well-mined tropes—abandoned circus, found relic, secret garden—but re-anchors them in sensory carpentry and non-verbal music. The “halo fragment” as cipher rather than MacGuffin offers fresh inflection. Risk is moderate: lyrical accumulative structure over causal plot, but coherence holds. Not radically new, yet specific tactile detail keeps it from generic echo.</comment>
