<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Lirael’s interiority is lyrical but abstract—“unspoken truths,” “living archive”—so her motives feel declared rather than embodied. No contradictory impulse is dramatized; the dance is pure resolve, never doubt. Still, her body-as-loom is consistent, and the ending’s lighter gait shows a visible cost of effort. Enough specificity to hit the 7-line but not the 9-gate.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the dance progressively densifies light/echoes until the final prismatic cascade. Closure = Charged Poise: the harvested orbs swirl around her, re-weighting her stance with felt but unpaid social cost (she now carries disobedient voices). Orientation is nailed in paragraph-2; no因果 breaks. The slight lag is that the “threads” mechanics are metaphor-only, never tested against failure.</comment>

<comment>Prism sanctuary acts as micro-setting: its refracting glass physically guides her dance path and dictates the color-fragment payoff at the end. Snow courtyard supplies hush and crunch-rhythm that matches heartbeat. Sensory triad (cold, glass-refraction, foot-crunch) stays purposive; no exposition dump. The 9-gate is missed only because the sanctuary’s physical rules (how threads are literally anchored in glass) stay vague.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—liberate echoes vs. conformity lullaby—is clear by line 8. Escalation is accumulative: each dance pass brightens threads, deepening stakes until the snap. Cost is visible fatigue (breath faster, lighter exit) and implicit social risk of carrying subversive memories. No live option is foreclosed on-page, so stays below 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of art-as-resistance emerges organically from her bodily poetic vs. lullaby, never sermonized. Final image of falling snow as “testament to the quiet defiance” reweights earlier flakes from pretty backdrop to ideological witnesses. Avoids moralizing; lets prismatic light do the talking. Lacks one sharp ironic twist to push higher.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric close, stable throughout. Distinct perceptual signature: light fractures, flakes “like whispered secrets,” body as archive—no tourist catalog. Rhythm modulates: long hypnotic sentences for dance, short bursts at snap. No dialogue, so voice purity uncontested. Occasional abstract loft (“unspoken truths”) keeps it from 9+.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>High density: each sentence layers image-action-theme. Metaphors stay consistent (loom, threads, prisms). No loops or scaffold; no mixed vehicles. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with dance tempo. Slight over-lyric in “liquid sunshine” is the only hairline slip.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fuses Snow-White glass palace with courtesan-as-poet-loom—fresh synthesis. Conceptual risk: dance = memory-unraveling ritual works because closure pays off visually. Not radically new, but specificity of refracted shards as liberated voices feels inevitable in hindsight. Enough individuation to edge upper 7s.</comment>
