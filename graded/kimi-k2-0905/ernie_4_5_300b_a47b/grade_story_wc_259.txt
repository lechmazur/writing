<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Lirael’s interiority is vivid—her contradiction between hunger for truth and fear of corruption is embodied in trembling hands and the veil she uses as armor. The micro-choice to press her palm to the pagoda crystallizes her hierarchy of values. Yet Kael functions mostly as a fear-fog mouthpiece; his absence after the hummed pagoda feels like a missed status/relationship crucible rather than earned escape. Cost is present—she accepts the “warm, alive” light that clings to her skin—but the final beat remains more image than irreversible forfeiture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: Lirael’s renunciation of innocence reweights the premise—she steps into the unknown with the gold light still clinging to her, a Charged Poise that forecloses retreat. Causality holds under Accumulative lens: each swirl of nostalgic dust intensifies the archive’s refusal to be tamed, culminating in the pagoda’s hum. Orientation is anchored by word 50 (“bronze prism pagoda at twilight”). One pressure drop: Kael’s exit is unmotivated, a soft teleport that momentarily thins causality but does not break the dominant lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The archive is rendered through tactile selectivity—dust motes, lichen-on-stone, serpent carving—each detail filtering Lirael’s scholar-eye. Twilight’s slant and the pagoda’s shifting constellations constrain her gaze and later choice to touch. Spatial choreography is clean: she kneels, traces, steps back, walks deeper; no impossible positions. Micro-setting (the veil as armor) charges the final image when the gold light pools at her feet, meeting the 9+ gate by materially shaping the closing beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—access forbidden knowledge without being pattern-corrupted—is signaled early. Escalation is textural: each new carving rearrangement thickens the archive’s resistance, narrowing her options until the hum forces a tactile test. The price is visible—the light physically clings, implying irreversible contamination—but the beat stops just before we see how it alters her next move, so cost is felt but not yet tactics-changing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without sermon: knowledge as seductive seed rather than tomb. The serpent ouroboros and saffron veil recur as shifting symbols—patterns once avoided become embraced, reconfiguring “innocence” as cowardice. Final image reweights earlier nostalgia atoms from passive dust to active gold that adheres—conceptual repricing achieved. One soft echo: “anguished joy” is named, not dramatically earned, a micro-tell that keeps this just sub-9.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Narrative distance stays tight to Lirael’s scholar-perception—constellations are “forgotten,” dust is “atoms of nostalgia.” Syntax lengthens under stress, then fractures: “Warm, alive—” em-dash mirrors the hum’s jolt. No head-hopping; Kael’s interior is inferred only through her reading of his fear. Diction stays within her saffron-dye lexicon; register never drifts into academic filler.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is controlled: paragraph breaths swell with light, then tighten into single-line crescendo. No loops or synonym churn; each metaphor (liched dust, serpent eating tail) is used once and repurposed in closure. One mixed vehicle—“sour and metallic” for a spoken word—barely bruises clarity. Information density high: one sentence often carries sensory, emotional, and mythic freight without scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The “archive that resists categorization” freshens the tired lost-civilization trope; the pagoda as living seed rather than mausoleum supplies conceptual twist. Risk—lyric accumulative structure—pays off when gold light pools to reweight nostalgia atoms. Kael’s cardboard function and the unnamed elders lean on archetype, preventing higher band. Specifics (saffron veil, bronze prism) prevent generic swap-out, keeping originality solidly in the 8-zone.</comment>
