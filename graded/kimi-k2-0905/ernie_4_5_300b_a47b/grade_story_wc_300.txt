<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias is sharply particularized through sensory-filtered perception and occupational habit; his micro-choice to place the pearl is embodied, irreversible, and charged with visible cost (the pearl dissolves, his life purpose pivots). The only slack is a trace of therapeutic self-label (“I was a conduit”) mid-rapture, but interior contradiction hums throughout and the final stance is causally earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of crystal, pearl, shell, and shared regret layers to a single Resonant Reconfiguration—Elias’s inspection mission reframed as pastoral connection. Orientation anchors within 40 words; transitions are seamless; the spiral-shell confession lattice is taught early and paid off in the luminous crown image with undeniable conceptual cost (bunker walls everywhere thin).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Crystal caves act as micro-setting that literally guides the climax—spiral geometry forces the pearl placement; quartz veins supply both light and conduit for global release. Sensory triage (sound, warmth, pressure) is filtered through Elias’s subterranean profession; the crown image constrains the final stance and reweights “latent radiance” from metaphor to world event.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—dissolve isolation walls—signalled in paragraph 1 and tightened once when the spiral demands the pearl sacrifice; cost is visible (loss of relic and vocation). Agency is attention/renunciation rather than combat, perfectly sufficient for an accumulative arc; escalation rides density shift, not causal reversals.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete recurrence: bunker → crystal tomb → cathedral; confessions move from buried shell to airborne song. No moralizing; final image re-prices “inspection” as communion. Subtext of etched regret vs. shared resonance is carried by object handling, not commentary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays strictly inside Elias’s perceptual syntax—light that “wasn’t light,” respirator hiss, pearl warmth in veins. Diction is precise, never purple; rhythmic lift in crown moment mirrors heart-rate without drum-beat monotony. No dialogue, so voice purity is unbroken.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or emotional density. Metaphors are internally consistent (veins/heartbeat), no mixed vehicles. High information twinning—“walls weren’t just walls; they were veins”—but each clause adds new pressure, not filler.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Post-apocalyptic bunker inspector + bioluminescent confession network feels fresh; transformation of survivalist genre into communal liturgy is non-obvious. Risk of lyric abstraction is taken yet grounded via occupational detail; no derivative echo of famous cave sequences.</comment>
