<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Alaric’s exile, chess metaphor obsession, and “thoughtfully precise” trait are dramatized through the tactile handling of the basalt stone and the micro-choice to plant the star-seed; the memory of Lira crystallizes his pedagogical drive and anchors the final renunciation with visible cost. Interior contradiction is present—hope vs. exile—but the star-mage’s appearance ventriloquizes his epiphany, blunting the full weight of earned self-confrontation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the covenant is revealed as living pattern, the queen-diagonal maps onto the Shattered Sword constellation, and the mirror-leaf sapling reweights “beauty in the difficult.” The lens is Accumulative/Textural: stone, eclipse, chessboard sky tighten into a single cadence shift. Causality holds: every image is seeded early and paid off in the final image; cost is legible in the exile’s tear and the irreversible planting.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The magnetic nexus’s warped compass and violet twilight are filtered through Alaric’s tutor gaze—every detail is selected for how it might encode chess moves. The basalt dent itself functions as micro-setting: its crescent shape literally guides the key-turn, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is immaculate; the seed is planted exactly where the stone lay, closing the loop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—“decode the covenant before simultaneous eclipse”—tightens when the dent glows and the queen-diagonal carves the night into a chessboard, foreclosing abstract theory and demanding embodied act. Agency is crystallized: Alaric chooses to plant the star-seed, accepting perpetual exile as tutor-gardener. Cost is visible: the tear, the irreversible planting, the mirror-leaves that will forever refract his loneliness.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the return of the queen-diagonal metaphor: constraint as generative, brokenness as direction. No character articulates the thesis; the sapling’s fractured-mirror leaves silently reweight the idea. The covenant’s beauty is left ambiguous—scholarly order or star-mage mysticism—inviting lingering reflection without sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person close sustains a lyrical, chess-laced diction—“constellation of the Shattered Sword,” “queen moves diagonally”—that feels native to an exiled tutor. Rhythm accelerates into short declaratives at the click of the stone, mirroring heartbeat sync. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero; the star-mage’s speech is brief, choral, and mythic rather than conversational.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm alternates between long, sinuous sensory clauses and curt fragments that mimic breath-hold before moves. No loops or scaffold; every sentence either advances image or escalates pressure. Figurative language is sparse, precise, and coherent—no mixed metaphors, no filter-verb clusters. Final line lands on concrete image that recharges earlier motifs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The fusion of chess strategy, geomancy, and eclipse astronomy feels inevitable yet fresh; the queen-diagonal as cosmic compass is a specific, non-obvious synthesis. Risk is taken: quiet lyric closure instead of spectacle, yet the mirror-leaf sapling makes the abstract covenant visceral. No derivative echoes; the Shattered Sword constellation is invented, not lifted.</comment>
