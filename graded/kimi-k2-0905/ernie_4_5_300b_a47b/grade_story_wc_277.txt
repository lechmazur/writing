<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clara’s contradictory motives—idealism vs. dynastic loyalty—are dramatized in the moment she palms the sharp nib and decides to research. The embodied tremor of her hand and the memo’s paternal betrayal ground her pivot; cost is the cut skin and severed filial myth. Endurance (continued testimony, op-eds) shows earned stasis, though late-line “truth is a compass” drifts toward epigram. Interiority mostly stays concrete; a hairline slip is the compressed jump from discovery to congressional testimony.</comment>

<comment>Causal chain: midnight call → discovery of annotated memo → journalist hand-off → public exposure. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the dome’s sunrise image recasts her lifelong star-mapping as evidence against, not for, the family. Cost is legible—the nib wound, ostracized mother, dismantled fortune. Single transition (night→dawn) is clean; orientation anchors within first 120 words; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The observatory’s grinding gears, rosewood desk constellations, and coffee-stained margin act as micro-setting that constrain search methods and timeline. Cloud-top locale legitimates isolation yet never blocks credible logistics. Spatial choreography holds as Clara crosses from telescope to library to desk. Weather (pink dawn) mirrors thematic inversion but avoids overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—moral integrity vs. family loyalty—tightens when the father’s margin command literalizes the environmental crime. One decisive deepening: coffee-stain memo forces trade-off between silence and act; price is instantaneous blood from nib and later social exile. Escalation is causal under lens; no convenience plotting. Closure in Q2 satisfies cost requirement.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of inherited guilt emerges from specific artifacts (nib, memo) rather than assertion. Final “sunlight” reweights earlier star-metaphor, accomplishing Conceptual Repricing without moralizing. Ambiguity remains: mother’s tears, lawyers’ threats, imply no neat absolution. No thesis statement in last paragraph; resonance arises from image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly glued to Clara’s perceptual filter (“gears grinding like a celestial heartbeat” = her idiom). Syntax flexes under stress—short, staccato clauses during memo discovery, longer tracking sentences at dawn. No head-hop; diction within plausible heiress-astronomer lexicon. Filter verbs minimal and purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: “coffee stain” line simultaneously reveals bribery, paternal duplicity, and tactile clue. Rhythm modulates—paragraph length breathes with investigative frenzy vs. dawn stillness. No synonym loops; metaphors consistent (orbit, stars, light). Clean grammar; no scaffold. Final line (“dance in their gravity”) is earned, not purple.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Familiar “heiress exposes dynasty” frame is refreshed by astronomer POV and proof-by-contradiction method. Nib-as-excalibur is specific; star imagery fused with moral inversion supplies freshness. Transformation test fails—dynasty could be oil/tech with minor swap—so not quite 8.5. Still, voice specificity and scientific metaphor lift it above template.</comment>
