<comment>Mara’s interiority is concrete—her chalk pouch, the way she “traces” the tile, the micro-choice to press it into the wall. The “lilac unease” is a label, but it is quickly grounded in bodily tension and later traded for “quiet determination,” so the epiphany feels earned. Flaws are hinted (whimsy vs. obsession) but stay mild; the cost is conceptual (she forfeits observer safety) rather than relational or material, acceptable at this length. Voice stays coherent and specific; no head-count or status issues.

<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the holographic reveal reweights the grotto from “silent refuge” to “living language,” and the cost is the irrevocable shift in Mara’s stance—she can no longer merely document. Causal lens holds: drawing → tile response → mandala key → wall slot → silence breathes → ceiling vortex, each step because/therefore. Orientation is crisp by line 8; no lens ambiguity at end. Accumulation cap: −0.3 for a single soft reset—whispers “cease abruptly” without showing Mara’s moment of fear, slightly dampening cost visibility. Still, the final image of her drawing on the wall carries undeniable charge.

<comment>Grotto as micro-setting constrains every move: acoustics dictate whispers, tile depressions guide the slotting, sand surface enables the mandala key. Mist, glow, and resonant hum evolve with beats; spatial choreography is clean—Mara kneels, stands, presses, draws. Environment mirrors internal shift from claustrophobic mist to breathable silence. No setting artifact touches closure; tile flake functions as charged object.

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“can she decode the hush without destroying it?”—is signaled early and escalates through mandala tuning, tile urgency, and the ultimatum “interject.” One meaningful tightening: when the tile’s glow synchronizes with her chalk, silence becomes conditional; refusal is impossible without losing the grotto. Cost is conceptual (loss of outsider status) rather than visceral, visible in the final chalk stroke. Under causal lens, escalation is clean; coincidence absent.

<comment>Theme—“listening is collaborative creation”—emerges through pattern, silence, and chalk rather than assertion. Subtext in the shift from “document” to “draw on the wall” is understated but legible. Final hologram reprises earlier sidewalk galaxies, reweighting art from escapism to dialogue. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers about what the grotto will now demand.

<comment>Third-person close stays locked to Mara; perceptual signature filters every detail through artist’s eye (color as cerulean, patterns as galaxies). Rhythm modulates: short pulses for tile flickers, longer cadence for mandala spiral. No filter-verb clusters; diction (“ephemeral galaxies,” “lilac-hued glow”) sits inside her whimsical lexicon. Dialogue absent; voice coherence under pressure excellent.

<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; no template cadence or synonym loops. Information density high—“tile flake hovered…synchronizing with the rhythm of her chalk” does triple work. One mixed metaphor: “silence began to…breathe” is forgiven because it pays off the living-language concept. No scaffolding in final third; closure image clear.

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: sidewalk artist + acoustic grotto + emergent silence as living code. Sand mandala as cryptographic key is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risk taken in making silence the antagonist pays off. Slight deduction for echo of “patterns teach the universe” trope, but chalk-as-language keeps it specific.
