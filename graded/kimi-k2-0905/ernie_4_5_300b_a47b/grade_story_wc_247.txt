<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael’s contradictory pull—yearning to be remembered yet fearing exposure—drives every micro-gesture; the camera-touches and signed “listening” beat embody his grandmother-inherited flaw. The final smile costs him: he forfeits anonymity and accepts tomorrow’s amnesia, earning the quiet renunciation. Interiority stays concrete, never drifting into label-speak; “silence has a shape” is shown via fingertip choreography. One hairline slip: the fisherman’s late rough voice is the only voiced line, slightly diluting Kael’s deaf-universe texture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Kael’s dawn solitude crystallizes the price—tonight’s communion will vanish with the tide, and he knows it. Each beat obeys Accumulative linkage: silence → mapping → violin → collective awe → morning erasure, tightening the stake of being forgotten. Camera-to-heart sign at end reweights the premise: filmless capture outlives film. Orientation, lens, and cost are unmistakable on the last line.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Moonlit dock, salt-slick planks, and the camera’s worn leather constrain every gesture; the harbor’s geometry dictates where bodies can gather and where Kael must stand apart. Sensory hierarchy aligns to Kael’s synesthetic gaze: he smells “liquid silver,” sees creaks as notation, tactile-camera brass warms against his chest—details filter through his translator-poet bias. The micro-setting of the filmless viewfinder becomes the crucible: when he sights the moon, the framing literally determines the music’s key. One minor drift: town topography (“edge,” “shadows,” “dock’s edge”) could be triangulated earlier.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“when no one remembers you, silence becomes a prison”—is signaled in para-1 and tightened when the fisherman asks “Play that again,” proving Kael’s silence-map has breached the town’s forgetting. The violin’s rising scale is the visible price: Lira’s bow pays out Kael’s emotional credit, foreclosing his safe invisibility. Agency stays with Kael: each faster sign accelerates communal listening, not deus-ex-moonlight. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves the tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the inverse of ephemerality: to be unheard is not vacancy but raw material for shared art. No character articulates the thesis; instead, the final camera-press against Kael’s heart reprises the opening “no film” with new weight—tonight’s song is the only exposure he’ll ever develop. Subtext in Lira’s trembling hands asks: who owns silence once it’s played aloud? Joyful sorrow tone modulates from minor to major and back, resisting tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate adopts Kael’s gestural cadence—“his signs were fluid, each movement a note”—syntax mirrors sign-flow, no filter-verb clutter. Dialogue is purely tactile: signed “Listening” carries subtext of seductive endangerment. Perceptual signature is synesthetic and deaf-centric, distinct from Lira’s auditory lens. Voice modulates: shorter clauses under peak music, then widens to lyrical sentence-river at dawn.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: opening sibilant shimmer yields to staccato bow-flicks, then dawn-long exhale. Metaphors stay internally consistent—moon as silver negative, waves as staff lines—never crowding a single sentence. Information density high; one line can split time, reveal motive, paint glow: “He aimed it at the water, framing the moon’s reflection in the viewfinder.” Minor scaffold: two adjacent “the”-openers mid-paragraph, but no loop obscures closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Premise—“translator of silence shoots filmless camera to score moonlight”—is fresh yet inevitable. Deaf advisor & hearing violinist invert the Orpheus myth: Eurydice (town memory) is briefly led upward by song, then vanishes at dawn with no glance. Risk of sign-language choreography as literal magic pays off because causality is emotional, not mechanical. Specificity: worn leather case smooth from years of throat-touching; this lived detail keeps concept from reading as gimmick.</comment>
