<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is vivid—her fingers “tracing the cracks,” the restlessness of acute hearing—yet the moment she decides to “break” the silence is more declared than embodied; no contradictory impulse or visible cost accompanies the shift from grief to gift. The final gesture of holding up the bowl reads as symbolic rather than a micro-choice that forecloses a path. Still, her embodied perception and the violin’s damp strings keep her convincingly particular.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the bowl’s warmth and the crowd’s tentative murmur reconfigure silence from wall to threshold, with conceptual cost—the music can never again be only private. Causality under Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each note swells in the copper curve, density increasing until the chronically hush is repurposed. Orientation is clean by line 5; transitions are single-scene. Cost is legible in the final image—“warm to the touch, alive with vibration.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sunken greenhouse, salt-fogged glass, and shipwreck hulls are tactile, pressure-relevant: the glass amplifies drips that Lira uses acoustically. The bonfire’s flicker is filtered through collective faces, not catalogued. Spatial choreography stays coherent as she moves from kneeling inside to holding the bowl aloft outside. The orchard’s soil-scent anchors time (after-burn regrowth) and feeds theme of rebirth.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transforming chronic hush into communal possibility—is signaled early and tightens when the first note sinks into the bowl, narrowing options: she must finish the ritual or entrench the wall. No antagonist is needed; the pressure is acoustic–social. Escalation is textural: each phrase swells, crowd falls silent, bowl glows. Cost is felt—her music is no longer a private unbinding—but price could be sharper (e.g., physical tremor or broken string).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through images—cracked wood, tarnished bowl, charred twig—not thesis: beauty in the unfinished is shown when imperfect violin and burnt offerings co-sound. The final line’s “light in the ash” reweights prior losses without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture—residents stepping forward, testing the air—rather than exposition. Ambiguity remains: the silence could fill again, keeping complexity intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Lira’s perceptual signature—“the way the greenhouse’s glass amplified the drip”—with synesthetic specificity. Syntax flexes under pressure: clause-laden acoustics calm into the declarative “The bowl doesn’t hold silence,” mirroring release. No head-hopping; crowd murmur is heard, not interpreted. Register remains within her plausible lexicon; no corporate intrusion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and opening, propelling the ceremonial arc; only minor scaffold—“the way her music seemed to pool”—slips into abstraction. Mixed metaphors avoided; glass cathedral is singular and earned. One paraphrase loop: “quiet grief of the harbor” echoes “chronic hush” without new pressure. Otherwise, density is high—salt, soil, ash layered in single beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Premise—violinist amplifies post-burn silence through antique bowl amid shipwreck greenhouse—feels fresh yet inevitable; ruin-as-orchestra reframes eco-grief. Tropes (mystic artifact, communal bonfire) are grounded in acoustic mechanics and communal ritual rather than magic shortcut. Specificity of echo-harbor violinist and salt-fogged orchard prevents generic transplant. Risk is moderate; a sharper personal cost would push higher.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setup in first paragraph; her decision to hover violin over bowl drives midpoint turn; closure carries the warm bowl aloft—cost is communal exposure of once-private music. Irreplaceable: only acoustic perception lets her exploit greenhouse echo.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Bowl handled in three beats—placed, vibrates, lifted—each reweights meaning from silence-holder to potential-amplifier; final image depends on its literal warmth and communal offerings. No swap object could acoustically amplify and culturally collect.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Chronic hush shapes stakes from first line; violin seeks to unbind it; crowd silence is the test—success redefines hush as threshold. Not merely thematic; it alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Acute hearing enables tactic of exploiting greenhouse drip and hull creaks; no cost is dramatized (no headache or overload), limiting upper band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Unbind action threads every beat—first note, swelling phrase, final communal weave—turning grief into possibility. Removing it collapses the arc.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Bonfire tradition is early signal, provides audience and firelight for bowl glow; mechanics matter as cover noise that falls away. Could swap to lantern yet loses anniversary weight.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Greenhouse acoustic shell and shipwreck hulls amplify sound, enabling bowl resonance; spatial choreography tracks clean. Setting is active participant, not backdrop.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Post-burn timeframe primes soil regrowth scent and annual bonfire; tightens decision window to anniversary night. No live clock beyond that ritual beat, so mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Motivation declared early; tested when she risks private grief in public bowl; fulfilled when ash-stained offeringsaccept unfinished beauty. Friction present—no guarantee crowd will respond—so earns score.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Magnificent simplicity is seeded in “cathedral” image, sustained through single ritual arc, culminates in unadorned final line. Tone modulates from solemn to luminous without clutter.</comment>
