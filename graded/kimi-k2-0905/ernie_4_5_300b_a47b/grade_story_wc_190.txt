<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her shoulders carry tension, her breath catches, her grip tilts the vial—but the “teach silence how to comfort” motive is declared rather than dramatized as a contradiction she must act out. No secondary character appears, so status crucible and voice distinction are N/A; micro-choices (tilting the vial, rerouting tomorrow) are present yet low-stakes because no live passenger or social cost is risked on-page. The earned insight is credible, but the cost is purely internal and intellectual; the story never forces her to gamble reputation, income, or safety, so the closure feels lightly rather than viscerally paid.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the train-whistle echo → deepening quiet → vial stillness forms a coherent cadence shift that reweights the premise. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3; no causality breaks. Closure is a Charged Poise: “the quiet had always been waiting” crystallizes options without soft reset. Cost is conceptual—she will guide others through silence—yet lacks a tangible, foregone sacrifice, keeping it just shy of 9-band intensity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prism terrace is rendered through motion—“gondola cut through water so clear it mirrored the terrace’s kaleidoscopic spires”—and the storm-glass vial acts as micro-setting that constrains her final insight. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven: visual refractions dominate, but lap-water sound and moonlit chill are selective. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions. The environment does not alter tactics beyond offering emptiness, so it charges the image but stops short of 9+ constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—learning to “teach silence how to comfort”—is signaled early; pressure tightens when the vial abruptly stills, reconfiguring her knowledge. Escalation is accretive, not causal-oppositional; no external antagonist or tangible loss is risked, so cost remains atmospheric rather than visceral. The final image forecloses nothing concrete; it deepens concept, satisfying the lens but limiting band entry.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: silence as presence, not absence. The storm-glass shift from swirl to stillness reweights the motif without authorial commentary. Final line offers resonant, non-literal answer. No moralizing or thesis statement; avoids pseudo-profundity. Slight deduction for abstract cost keeps it below 9.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person close stays locked to Elara’s perceptual filter; diction is lyrical yet precise—“lap of water against the gondola’s hull,” “liquid fractals.” Rhythm mirrors hush: long vowels, sparse hard consonants. No head-hopping or register drift. Voice is consistent, distinct, and atmospheric without purple overload.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is loop-free, high-density; figurative language is selective and paid off (“storm glass had become a prism”). No filter-verb stacks or template cadence. Opening and closing sentences are ear-tested and propulsive. Minor overwrought phrase—“vaulting hush that made the air itself seem to hold its breath”—is the only hairline slip touching closure-adjacent beat, preventing 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fantasy gondola-plus-storm-glass conceit refreshes the familiar “quiet revelation” arc. Specificity of prism terrace and noise-monitoring method feels bespoke; removing either would collapse the piece. Conceptual risk—silence as teachable entity—is fully committed to. Lacks a second inventive twist or social dimension that would push it into 8.5+ originality band.</comment>
