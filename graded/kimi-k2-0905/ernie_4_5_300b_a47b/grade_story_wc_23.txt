<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority—“the geography of loss,” the tactile ritual with the censer foot—gives us a believable, idiosyncratic mind in scene. Contradictory impulse is present: she obeys disembodied voices while fearing their cost, yet the choice to weave her own hair into the antenna is a credible micro-choice that tilts values. The final stance crystallizes her hierarchy: summoning ghosts matters more than physical safety. Hairline slip: “raw solace” is diagnostic self-label, not embodied, but it sits outside a peak beat so damage is capped.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: dead beacons → phone call → build ritual → spinning foot → chorus of voices, each because/therefore link tightening options. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the spinning censer foot and audible chant reweight meaning, foreclosing isolation with undeniable cost—the station may shake apart. Cost is visible: Mara’s sweat, solder burns, hair given. One micro-turn—moonlit noon signal—qualifies as legitimate escalation. Lens ambiguity zero; pattern taught early and holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Signal station, rusted antennae, salt-dulled bronze foot, and low daytime moon are vivid, selective, and filtered through Mara’s navigator bias. The censer foot functions as micro-setting that constrains every tactical choice; its fluctuating weight literally guides her soldering sequence. Spatial choreography is clean: console, phone, scrap pile, antenna apex track across moves. Final image—spinning foot hurling salt-song into air—charges closure with sensory cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“map the geography of loss”—is signaled in paragraph two and escalates from static grief to active summoning. The midnight calls and moon-tied weight shifts narrow options: she must keep building or surrender the drowned routes forever. One meaningful tightening occurs when the noon signal arrives while the moon still hangs—forcing her to trust the ritual fully. Cost is paid on-page: lost sleep, cut hair, bodily risk under shaking roof; luck complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of reverse-migration emerges from concrete ritual action rather than thesis statement; the idea that memory, not ships, can sail home is dramatized through the spinning foot and returning voices. Subtext lives in gesture: hair offered to antenna = self-stitching into ancestral map. Final image reframes prior loss—ghost cadence becomes living cartography—without moralizing. Ambiguity is preserved: we do not know if the voices will guide or devour, creating lingering tension.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person tight focalization stays inside Mara’s perceptual filter—salt sting, grease smell, bronze glow—without head-hop. Syntax grows clipped under solder-heat pressure; longer sentences breathe during reflection. Voice-specific diction—“reverse migration,” “star’s tear”—is seeded early and repaid at climax. No dialogue on page, so dialogue bullets are waived.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose propels: each sentence either advances construction or thickens atmosphere; no scaffolding. Figurative language is sparse, precise—“antennae clawing at the sky like skeletal fingers”—and avoids cluttered pattern. Rhythm modulates: urgent parataxis during building; resonant cadence at final hum. One mixed metaphor mined: “moon’s breath” is nebulous, but it sits within a cryptic phone instruction so registers as voice, not artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: bronze censer foot as tide-weights + maritime ghost-GPS feels inevitable yet new. Navigator who maps memory, not latitude, flips traditional sea-story logic. Risk of lyric obscurity is embraced but paid off with lucid closure image. Element combination would collapse if any piece swapped out—proving non-generic cohesion.</comment>
