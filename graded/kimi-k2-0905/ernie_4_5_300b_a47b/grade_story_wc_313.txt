<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Mara’s watchful vigilance is concrete—boots on gravel, flashlight beam slicing dark—but her interior contradiction (guard duty vs. memory-keeper) stays summary. The moment she lays her own photo beside the ghosts, a micro-choice finally embodies the “precisely humane” trade-off, paying the cost of shared stewardship. Prior beats lean on label-speak (“chest tightened”) rather than embodied emotion. Daughter’s entrance is too late to test status dynamics; still, the final stance crystallizes with visible price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mara’s added photograph reconfigures her role from solitary watcher to co-guardian of memory, cost felt in the act of relinquishing private grief. Causal chain holds—label→photos→daughter→shared custodianship—though beat spacing is accelerando. Orientation is clean by line 6; no lens ambiguity. One soft micro-turn (daughter’s reveal) is acceptable; it complicates without resolving. Persistent constraint: the failing dam keeps future pressure real, anchoring the new pact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Midnight ridgeway, twilight violet, and the reservoir’s skin create a selective sensory palette; gravel crunch and mossy glass keep touch alive. The sapphire label returns as micro-setting that literally directs Mara’s path; its glassy surface refracts both color and meaning at closure. Spatial choreography is clean—gate, slope, churchyard, waterline—all tracked without drift. Environment subtly mirrors internal state: receding water = surfacing memory. Meets 9+ gate: label charges final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—town’s survival versus memory’s survival—is signaled early and tightened when the dam’s failure resurfaces foundations. The photograph trail is the agency engine: each laid image narrows Mara’s private archive into a shared one. Cost is conceptual but legible—she forfeits sole custodianship, embracing future accountability. Escalation is single-cycle yet sufficient for 700-word frame. No coincidence resolves; daughter’s arrival complicates, then Mara elects partnership.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of communal memory versus erasure emerges through the photograph trail rather than assertion; no final moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture—laying a photo is an act of surrender, not explanation. Liqueur color and label accrue symbolic weight organically, reweighted when Mara replicates the toast with images instead of poison. Ambiguity lingers: shared stories may not save the town, but they now have guardians. Emotional after-effect is concrete—reader feels the pact form in the dark.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person close stays anchored to Mara’s perceptual filter: she notices color as a warden, sound as a listener, silence as warning. Syntax modulates—long sentence for reservoir history, staccato for flashlight cut. No head-hop; daughter’s interior remains opaque, as must be. Sapphire, “crystal glass,” “broken teeth” supply sensory diction without purple overload. Rhythm supports pressure: final paragraph shifts to lighter cadence mirroring the women’s shared breath.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is lean and dual-purpose; “boots crunch gravel” advances both setting and character. One paraphrase loop—“town’s survival against the weight of the lake behind her” repeats prior gist minus new pressure (−0.2). Mixed metaphor risk—“reservoir flooded the valley below” vs. “waters rose” is coherent. No filter-verb stacks; figurative language stays sparse, precise. Closure sentence breathes cleanly, no artifact touch. Density high; momentum sustained.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Flooded-town-resurfacing is familiar, but linkage of dam safety to memory stewardship feels fresh. Sapphire liqueur as both artifact and metaphorical poison repurposes a stock color into specific heritage. Photograph trail converts exposition into ritual procession. Risk taken: ghost-daughter appears late, yet pattern teaches that memories surface when water recedes, so entrance feels inevitable in hindsight. Emotional specificity—Mara’s father/Elias argument photo—grounds universal theme.</comment>
