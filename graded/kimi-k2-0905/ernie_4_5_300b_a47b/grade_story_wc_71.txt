<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is vivid—“she’d spent years cataloging the subtleties others missed” roots her lens—but contradiction under pressure is only lightly sketched; her decision to sanctify feels more conceptual than costly. The “inadvertently profound” self-tag is diagnostic-speak that flattens voice at the exact beat where embodied complexity is needed. Micro-choices exist (placing each object) yet don’t tighten stakes visibly; the arc is more ritual than irreversible renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of displaced-object finds culminates in a hush-anchoring tableau; the ripple of light is a clean Conceptual Repricing that makes “alive houses” undeniable. Orientation anchored within first 120 words; causality stays internal and legible. Cost is present as atmospheric shift rather than tangible sacrifice, so closure lands softly rather than irresistibly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Select sensory detail—“window frame leaned half an inch too far,” “amber haze”—conveys POV bias and spatial intimacy. The bay itself is more mood-board than tactical constraint; environment never endangers or materially shapes Lira’s ritual. Orris root shard acts as micro-setting and charges the final image, satisfying micro-setting gate for 9+ eligibility.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“to understand why some houses feel alive”—is declared early, but escalation is accumulative, not menacing; pressure remains ambient. Objects accumulate rather than threaten, so tightening is pattern-deepening, not option-narrowing. No visible price is exacted from Lira; glow spreads consequence-free, keeping cost conceptual rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of quiet displacement and latent aliveness emerges organically through image rather than assertion. Final sanctification reweights earlier cataloging into metaphysical stewardship, achieving modest resonance. Avoids overt moralizing, though “inadvertently profound” flirts with self-labeling and slightly blunts subtext.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited voice maintains steady perceptual signature—amber daydreaming streetlights, dock creak rhythms—without head-hop. Syntax remains controlled, but metaphors lean toward soft abstractions (“mask of calm”), muting distinct texture. Dialogue absent, so no register issues. Overall, a serviceable lyrical voice that could sharpen diction for higher band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is fluid; sentence openings vary naturally. Occasional scaffold—“It wasn’t the object itself that intrigued her; it was the way…”—repeats without new pressure. Mixed metaphors rare; “hush wasn’t emptiness; it was potential” lands cleanly. Filter verbs light; most description is anchored via tactile placement. Minor synonym drift around “quiet/hush/silence” but never clouds causality; closure beat is clear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Premise—domestic displacement sanctifies architecture—is fresh, not trope-laden. Risk is quiet rather than bold; story chooses meditative lyric over high-stakes subversion. Specific sensory cataloging (leaning window frame) individualizes the concept. Synthesis feels inevitable, though not startlingly original.</comment>
