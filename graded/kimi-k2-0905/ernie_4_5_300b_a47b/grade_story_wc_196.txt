<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s ache is palpable in embodied details—finger on the folder, breath catching—but the promised “contradictory impulses” never collide in-scene; he observes rather than chooses until the final quiet vow. The interiority is rich yet static; no micro-choice risks anything before the last sentence, so the arc is more mood than transformation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the button re-weights emancipation’s promise for the nameless, charging Elias’s new folder with felt social cost. The accumulative/textural lens holds—dust circles and grime patterns tighten meaning—but the causality of “eight-years-later button → must write” is asserted, not dramatized, keeping it just shy of 9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The mildewed file room is sensuously alive—bowing shelves, smudged tin-cup circle—and the button micro-setting steers the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Dust is never mere atmosphere; it records absent hands and guides Elias’s gaze, turning archival decay into ethical imperative.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes (giving the forgotten a name) are signaled early and deepen when the button contradicts the 1873 file, tightening historical erasure as pressure. Yet the escalation is intellectual, not tactical—no live option is foreclosed—so the cost is conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through pattern: buttons, dust, and unnamed files refract emancipation’s unkept promise, culminating in the quiet insurgency of a new folder. No moral is stated; the image of Elias writing reweights “small kindnesses” as archival resistance, though the beat is brief.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person close tracks Elias’s cataloguer-perception—selective attention to grime patterns, brass tarnish—without filter-verb clutter. Syntax remains steady, but a perceptual signature (“language of neglect”) permeates every clause, and the final cadence slows to mirror reverent wonder.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: one sentence layers mildew, forgotten years, and bowing shelves. No mixed metaphors, only one template-cadence run (“the way…” triple) that is pattern-taught and paid off; the final clause “heart full” skirts label-speak but survives on context.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The archival dust-reading conceit freshens post-emancipation historical fiction; button-as-absence is novel. Risk is moderate—quiet lyric rather than twist—but the synthesis of bureaucratic minutia and Black historical memory feels specific and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
