<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara’s “archivist” label is vivid—she handles ink, seal, and parchment in tactile beats—and her braided-rope micro-choice directly re-opens the door, so agency is visible. Yet her interiority drifts into thematic summary (“translate chaos into order”) rather than moment-to-moment contradiction; the final beat shows no new flaw cost, only a tidy self-coronation as “weaver of timelines,” so the change feels announced, not embodied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly under a Causal lens: the re-braided rope causes the door to open and the scroll’s discovery reweights her purpose. Orientation is anchored by 120 words; the single transition into the corridor is legible. Cost is present but thin—only the chill and sparks—so the cap stays below 8.8.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The clock-tower mechanism room is rendered through touch (vibrations, squeaking hinges), smell (aged parchment, iron), and micro-props (seal crest, braided rope) that literally gate progress; spatial choreography tracks cleanly. The corridor and chamber are sketched quickly, but the rope/tool reappears to charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—“access lost knowledge”—is signaled early and tightens when the gear jams; her rope tweak is a visible, reversible act that narrows options. Cost is mild (sparks, chill) rather than lasting; escalation is single-step, acceptable for length but not piercing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>“Fables of absence” emerges organically through the scroll title and the chamber’s displaced histories, avoiding explicit moral. The final image of merging torchlight into a beam offers quiet resonance, reweighting absence as navigable rather than empty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person close stays locked to Elara; perceptual signature is scholarly—“schematics creaking,” “symbols resembled braids.” Syntax is controlled, but occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”) slips in outside her idiom; no dialogue to test distinction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is clean, varied in rhythm, and high-density: one sentence often layers gear-sound, scent, and thought. No loops or mixed metaphors; one filter-verb cluster (“she realized”) is minor and outside the final third, so 9+ is not barred.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The “door that shouldn’t exist” inside a clock-tower mechanism is a fresh portal variant; the braided-rope-as-temporal-key transforms a familiar conceit through archival mechanics. Risk is moderate; the concept feels specific to Elara’s profession, though the beat could transplant to another scholar with minor edits.</comment>
