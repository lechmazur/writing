<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marcus/Kael’s synesthetic perception is vividly embodied (“the violet of regret in a widow’s veil”) and directly steers his scavenging choices, turning each fragment into a micro-choice that edges him toward reclaimed identity. The locket moment crystallizes a credible before/after with felt cost: “He pressed the locket to his chest, its metal cold…”—a tactile renunciation of the Kael persona. Interior contradiction is present but compressed; a hair more counter-impulse mid-scene would have pushed to 8+. Still, the arc from erased void to named vengeance is cleanly earned.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a decisive conceptual reprice: the locket photo proves Marcus alive, instantly reweighting every fragment he has hoarded. Causality holds under an Accumulative lens—each story-fragment thickens the texture of memory until the mosaic snaps into identity. Orientation is anchored by word 70 (“salt tang of the harbor”), well within the 120-word guardrail. One minor loop—“the tide retreated, leaving the labyrinth slick and gleaming” repeats the earlier tide motif without new pressure—stops this at 8.4.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Container labyrinth is not postcard backdrop: shifted geometry (“left at the rusted hatch, right past the broken seal”) steers his path; tide-clock narrows scavenger windows; diesel/decay smells tighten atmosphere. Micro-setting succeeds—poison label in pocket and locket against chest act as portable environments that charge final image. One sensory over-indulgence—“steel mountains that clawed at the bruised sky”—leans purple, preventing 8.5.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—recover erased identity—signals early via death certificate. Escalation is textural: each fragment layers density until locket photo forces a conceptual reweighting; cost is the loss of the protective anonymity Kael enjoyed. No visible trade-off of tools or stamina, so lacks the 8.5+ price gate, but the epistemic narrowing is clean under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Theme—memory as mosaic that can be stolen or restored—emerges through action, not sermon. Subtext in “Not for the remembering” poison line ironically becomes exactly what Marcus uses to remember. Final image of tide-mouth reframes harbor from threat to witness, offering resonant ambiguity. A hair more paradox in the last line could have lifted higher.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person tight stays inside Marcus/Kael’s synesthetic filter without head-hop. Diction—“salt tang,” “flaking paint,” “gritty”—is concrete, harbor-true, and rhythmically varied. No dialogue to test, but internal monologue avoids therapy-speak. Perceptual signature is consistent and distinctive; no register drift or filter-verb clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings rotate; no template cadence. Information density high—one sentence often does scene-setting, sensory cue, and motive pulse. Two adjacent “the tide” mentions create micro-loop; otherwise zero scaffold. Figurative language is selective, not stacked; mixed metaphor watch clear. Final line propels with image, not exposition.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Synesthetic scavenger who pieces identity from overheard dock myths is fresh angle on amnesia trope. Container labyrinth as shifting memory palace is specific and memorable. Transformation test passes: swapping harbor for generic city breaks logic. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off; could edge 8+ if one fragment backfired tactically on Marcus.</comment>
