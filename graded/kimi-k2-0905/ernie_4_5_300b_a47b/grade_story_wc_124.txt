<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lirael’s interiority is vivid—her “aromatic caution” is shown through flinching at cedarwood and trembling before the vial—and the final micro-choice to inhale despite risk crystallizes her arc. Yet the causality of that final beat leans on external magic (UV reveal) more than prior flaw-compounded mistakes; the only cost is retrospective tears, not a foreclosed path. The inherited-grief revelation is emotionally specific but lands as epiphany rather than earned renunciation. Still, her perceptual signature stays consistent and the embodied emotion avoids therapy-speak, keeping the portrait above mid-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: scent-images layer until the ultraviolet cascade reweights the stake from “why do I grieve?” to “grief is love’s proof.” The closure is a Charged Poise: the final walk-home image reconfigures stance—she breathes city air without flinch—undeniable conceptual cost. Causality is soft: the UV method appears as a late deux-ex-machina rather than a constraint that shapes prior tactics, preventing 8.8+. Orientation is clean by word 60; no teleporting props. One shard only; default scope met.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The greenhouse is sensuously anchored—glass panes “filtering afternoon light into prismatic streaks,” vines “clinging to life only behind these walls”—and the crystal vial’s faceted gleam functions as micro-setting that constrains the final choice to inhale. Spatial choreography is stable; Lirael’s hand movements track. Sensory hierarchy respects her vocation: scent precedes sight. Weather is irrelevant inside glass, but the UV-triggered color storm evolves the environment causally. The extinct-plant rule-set stays consistent. No fact errors; no static postcard description.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncover why smells wound—signals early. Escalation is textural: each scent layer deepens emotional density until the lavender-floral memory wave forces the stance shift. Agency is present—she uncorks and inhales—but the UV method is externally supplied luck, not a tactic shaped by prior pressure, capping high-band entry. Cost is felt (tears) yet doesn’t foreclose a live option; she leaves freer, not cornered. One meaningful tightening suffices for length; coincidence complicates but doesn’t resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: grief as inherited love, not pathology. No explicit thesis lines; the final image of breathing city smoke without flinch reweights earlier scent-aversion into acceptance. Subtext operates through silent handling of the vial and the choice to inhale—gesture over declaration. The perfume-as-memory-bridge motif recurs with shifting emotional charge, satisfying the “returning image that shifts meaning” path. Avoids sentimentality; complexity lingers in the ambiguity of whose memory she tasted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-limited single POV holds without leakage; perceptual signature is scent-leaning and synesthetic—“crystal shadows dancing across walls” mirrors interior chromatic emotion. Syntax modulates: longer humid sentences in greenhouse, shorter inhaled fragments during reveal. No dialogue to judge. Free-indirect style is clean; no filter-verb stacks. Diction stays within Lirael’s plausible lexicon; “prismatic,” “bioluminescence” fit her trade. Rhythm accelerates into the inhalation beat then exhales with the final sentence—controlled cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High information density: one sentence often layers ambiance, physiology, and emotional charge. No paraphrase loops; occasional metaphor (“silver vapor…like a ghost”) is singular and apt. Sentence openings vary; paragraphs breathe with beats. One scaffold near end—“she’d always thought…now she saw”—is strategic compression, not artifact. No tense drift or simultaneity errors. Read-aloud ear test passes; closing line lands with cadential punch. Minor elevated register in “conceptual repricing” phrase is narrator, not POV slip, hence forgivable.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Premise—extinct-plant greenhouse whose scents preserve lost memories—is fresh but not unprecedented; execution particularizes via UV-reveal botany and lantern broker vocation. Transformation test: swap scent-memory for sound-memory and the emotional logic collapses, proving specificity. Risk taken in quiet lyric ending rather than plot twist; coherence holds. No close echoes of famous scenes. The inherited-grief angle offers non-obvious emotional calculus. Could push further into occupational detail for higher band.</comment>
