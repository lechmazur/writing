<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lira’s “shrewdly innocent” paradox is dramatized in the moment she touches the coral and then again when she places it on the table; both beats show contradictory impulses in-scene and carry a visible cost (risk of appearing naïve vs. need to broker hope). Interiority stays concrete—coral ridges bite, mist swallows words—without diagnostic labels. The final renunciation—offering the coral as talisman—grows directly from earlier micro-choices and forecloses her earlier stance of passive translation. Only the general’s single-line reaction keeps this from full 9-band integration; we’re told, not shown, his shift.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the coral placed between factions crystallizes new options with undeniable conceptual cost—she has staked her credibility on a fragment of ruin. Causal linkage holds: because she decrypts the cast, therefore she re-weights language, therefore she risks the coral at the table. One minor scaffold—three “she wondered” sentences in 30 words—does not touch the final image. Orientation (who/where/when) is anchored by line 70; no debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Atrium mist, coral fragment, and child’s cast function as micro-setting: the coral’s sharp ridges literally constrain how tightly she can grip it, and the mist blurs sightlines so she must translate touch rather than visuals. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—translator’s ear for whispered ocean, tactile polyps—not tourist catalogue. Spatial choreography is clean: bench → condensation tracing → rafters for the hanging cast. Final image of cast-as-flag recharges the object without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</question><comment>Dominant stake—“can language regrow from rubble?”—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightens once: decryption of the cast → coral offered at table. This single deepening narrows her options from passive translator to active gambler, with felt price (potential ridicule, professional risk). Cost is visible on-page: the coral’s bite marks her palm and her voice cracks when she speaks. No reversal, but under Accumulative/Textural lens the density shift suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete particular of a bombed reef and a child’s cast; no abstract thesis is stated. The final image—cast hanging as “flag of fragile hope”—reweights earlier doodles without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture: touching coral ≈ touching shrapnel of language. The lotus-hearted ache stays implicit, never named again after intro. Only the widow memory risks thematic echo, but it is brief and grounded.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is translator-precise: “landmine metaphors,” “frayed rope,” syntax mirrors her habit of turning nouns into bridges. No head-hopping; distance remains close third. Rhythm accelerates under pressure—single-line paragraphs during coral placement. Filter verbs (“she felt”) are rare and voice-motivated. Diction stays within her plausible lexicon; “lotus-hearted” is coined once and left to resonate. Minor cadence echo in two “she wondered” lines is the single blemish.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sentences carry double duty: “The coral’s grooves mirrored the smudged pencil marks” fuses object, theme, and visual in one stroke. No paraphrase loops; each metaphor extends the last (“sharp things can carve new paths” logically follows scarred general’s touch). Opening and closing lines are image-anchored, not abstract. One mixed vehicle—“mist curled like a ghost’s fingers” beside “anesthetic kicked in”—is momentary and does not cloud closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The peace-talk translator who decrypts a child’s cast with brain-coral in a misty atrium is a fresh synthesis; not a stock scenario. The coral-as-talisman reconfiguration feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk is taken: lyric condensation (“the ocean heals in whispers”) could slide into sentimentality, but it is earned by prior tactile handling. No close echoes of famous scenes; the final table placement reverses expected podium rhetoric.</comment>
