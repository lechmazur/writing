<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Kael’s interiority is concrete, embodied, and contradiction-rich: “furiously tranquil” is lived, not labeled. The envelope/timetable object anchors micro-choices—open, read, write back—each with visible cost (ash-choked filter, aching scars). Renunciation of masked poetry is earned: he seals the new poem with wax from his sole light, foreclosing anonymity. No head-count or relationship pressure on page; single-POV focus stays tight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the sealed poem crystallizes both stance and risk—publisher gamble under Ministry threat—cost felt in the storm-lit wax seal. Causal chain intact: envelope → cartographer’s poem → mirror moment → Kael’s counter-poem. Orientation anchored within 120 words (observatory, storm, gas-mask). Lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of “rarefy” images tightens until final reweighting.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Storm-shaken observatory constrains every move: dome groans, lantern flame flickers, viewport leaks—environment forces the timer’s click and the wax seal. Darkroom timer recurs as micro-setting that paces breath and final writing; its red glow charges the closing image. Body-as-setting noted in scar topography and mask cracks. No spatial drift; weather directly shapes the vigil’s pause and the poem’s birth.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—unmask poetry versus Ministry erasure—signaled early. Tightening occurs when cartographer’s poem reframes scars as maps, narrowing Kael’s options to bare-all or stay silent. Cost: he risks capture by mailing uncensored poem; storm and wax seal embody that price. Agency drives turn: reading → writing → sealing. No external coincidence; escalation is interior deepening under observable threat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete pattern: “rarefy” moves from cartographer’s charcoal scrawl to Kael’s lived poetics. Final image—storm kissing raw wonder—reweights earlier masked hiding without moralizing. Subtext in envelope’s silence and timer’s ticks; no thesis statements. Emotional aftereffect lingers: reader maps own scars in the cleared air.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is poet-caster: compressed, rhythmic, metaphor-dense yet legible. “Sky’s fury demanded a different kind of vigil” teaches the lyrical cadence early. Filter verbs scarce; perception is embodied (“ash-clogged filter,” “puckered line”). No dialogue, so no convergence risk. Final line cadence mirrors opening storm breath, completing taught pattern.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density: timer’s red heartbeat doubles as metaphor and tool; envelope sheet is “singed”—one word carries burn risk and legacy. Metaphor chain (storm=beast, clouds=mercury) stays coherent, no mixed vehicles. Minor template cadence in “When masks slip… When scars speak…” but it’s pattern-driven, paid off. Read-aloud rhythm varies; paragraph cuts crisp.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: censored poet + star-map scars + darkroom timer = new cartography of pain. Premise twisted through tangible objects and interior rarefaction. Risk in lyrical compression pays off; closure legible. Not derivative—no familiar plot echo. Specificity of bus timetable as envelope carrier is idiosyncratic and memorable.</comment>
