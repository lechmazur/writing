<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mara’s skepticism-plus-curiosity is etched in tactile micro-choices (testing thorns, palming the tooth) and a credible internal split between needing proof and fearing what she’ll find. Elias’s re-appearance carries visible cost—lined face, “voice rough with disuse”—and their shared history is evoked in one deft clause about getting lost as kids. The closing forgiveness is earned: the fountain’s re-flow parallels the re-alignment of their relationship, and her final line accepts complicity. Missing the 9-band because the “shrewdly innocent” adjective pair is never dramatized in a moment that forces a concrete trade-off.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds cleanly because each beat is a because/therefore link: substitute body → village panic → Mara’s return with tooth → fountain re-alignment → path opens. The climax is a decisive physical act (placing both teeth) that re-lights the fountain and re-opens the maze; cost is visible—Elias’s aged grief and the permanent slice on Mara’s thumb. Orientation is anchored by word 40; no teleporting props. Closure avoids explain-everything drift; the garden simply forgives, a quiet Charged Poise that reconfigures their options without forced exposition. A 0.1 shave for a micro-loop in mid-story description keeps it from 8.8.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Garden and maze are sketched with sensory economy—“ivy and honeysuckle hum,” “basin choked with moss”—and the tooth operates as micro-setting that constrains the final ritual. Spatial choreography is flawless; bodies track from gap to fountain to exit without drift. The fountain’s resurrection supplies the 9-band gate (environment charges final image), but the hedge itself never tightens tactical choice beyond ambience, keeping it just shy of 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“can certainty be stitched back together?”—is signaled early and tightens once: the act of placing the two teeth either heals or fractures reality. Escalation is single but meaningful; the garden’s hum rises to a shudder, foreclosing retreat. Cost is legible—Elias’s sacrificed years and Mara’s cut thumb—but the price is not re-paid in the final beat, capping it under 8.2.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete act of bone-setting: dislocation demands realignment, whether joints, memory, or identity. Subtext is carried in gesture (two teeth, worn vs. jagged) rather than thesis lines. Final image reweights “mistakes as constellations” without moralizing, achieving Conceptual Repricing. A shade less ambiguity than the top band prefers keeps it at 8.4.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays pinned to Mara’s skeptical perceptual filter—“her fingers brushing the thorns as if testing reality.” Syntax grows clipped under pressure—“Bone setting,” she murmured—mirroring the click of recognition. Elias’s dialogue carries distinct gravelly idiom; no POV leakage into his interior. A faint rhythmic echo in “the garden… it asks for sacrifice” is voice-motivated and forgiven.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Zero loops, no mixed metaphors, high density: every sentence advances stake or aura. Figurative layer is spare but precise—“certainty frayed at the edges.” Fountain resurrection is rendered in concrete verbs without purple flourish. Final sentence lands with variegated rhythm; no artifact touches closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fairy-changeling trope is flipped: the tooth is not a portal to faerie but a keepsake of shared human fracture. Bone-setting as metaphor for existential re-alignment feels non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Specificity—crumbling fountain, honeysuckle hum—grounds freshness without twee overload. Risk is moderate; could push further if the garden’s rules exacted a steeper surprise.</comment>
