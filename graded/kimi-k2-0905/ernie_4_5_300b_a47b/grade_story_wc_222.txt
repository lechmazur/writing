<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Kael’s “chivalrous thief” label is declared, not dramatized; no greedy victim or needy beneficiary appears on stage, so the trait stays ornamental. Interiority is limited to heroic self-talk (“guardian of wonder”) without contradictory impulse or embodied cost. The only micro-choice—swap the king—succeeds frictionlessly, so no flaw compounds and no earned renunciation occurs. The arc is static competence, not tested character.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: wrong sky → ritual swap → sky healed. Orientation lands by word 60; no head-count or geography drift. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the swapped silence vial reweights the premise—but the cost is abstract (no personal loss or lingering constraint), so the Decisive Change feels weightless. Lens holds as Causal throughout.</comment>

<comment>Icebound spire, moss carpet, bioluminescent fungi, and the brass sundial lid are vivid, sensory, and filtered through Kael’s professional eye. Spatial choreography is flawless across the narrow ledge, window slit, and chessboard. The setting constrains the final image: the spire’s harmony hums after the swap, charging the closure. One minus: the cloud-city Aetheria is named but never seen or felt, keeping environment from full 8+ leverage.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prevent spire collapse—surfaces early and tightens once: the violet sky darkens to black, forcing faster swaps. Escalation is single-step, not iterative; no resource lost or option foreclosed on-page. Agency is present but frictionless—every replacement succeeds without adaptation. Cost is external (city saved) rather than internal or tactile, so pressure remains moderate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of “embrace the unknown” emerges through the silence vial and starlight drops, avoiding explicit moral. The chessboard-as-cosmos motif is fresh, yet the epiphany line (“courage to swap the familiar for the mysterious”) articulates the thesis in final paragraph, triggering minor −0.4 for thematic echo. Subtext is otherwise implied through object choice rather than stated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Kael with perceptual signature: “breath fogged,” “gloved hands,” “sundial warmed.” Syntax is clean, rhythmic, and avoids filter verbs. No dialogue, so no voice convergence issue. Diction skews slightly writerly (“otherworldly light,” “sacredly playful”) but remains consistent to romantic-heist register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</question>
<comment>Prose is lean, tactile, and propulsive; sentences vary in length and openers. Only minor loop: three “swap” sentences in rapid succession create faint template cadence (−0.2). Metaphors (dagger of frost, liquid starlight) are fresh and non-contradictory. No scaffold, no purple patches, no clarity drag at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</question>
<comment>Heist-via-enchanted-chessboard is a fresh synthesis of fantasy and caper tropes. The silence-in-a-vial and sunrise shard are specific, non-generic magical MacGuffins. Risk is moderate—no structural experimentation—but particulars (sundial crown, teardrop pawn) feel bespoke rather than checklist. Transformation test: swap chess pieces for tarot cards and the whole plot unravels, proving irreplaceable texture.</comment>
