<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Kael’s “spatially gifted” label is announced but never exploited under pressure; his only decisive move is to retune the laser to Lira’s voice frequency—an external prompt, not an earned interior turn. Interiority drifts into thematic paraphrases (“physics of letting go”) rather than embodied contradiction. The final nod is understated, but the cost of surrender is asserted rather than dramatized through bodily or relational stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: laser frequency → barrier shift → column softening → farm re-permeabilized. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the dissolved barrier reweights the security paradigm with visible ecological upside. However, the “dying heart” stakes are declared late and the price (what exactly is lost?) is only gestured at, keeping cost just legible but thin.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The bioluminescent farm is textured through Kael’s scanning gaze—fractal light, fungal canopy, spore pods—each filter of detail doubles as world-rule exposition. Spatial choreography stays clean across the single scene; the permeable barrier as micro-setting directly constrains every tactical move. The final image of gentle spore-rain re-illuminates the earlier glow, completing an accumulative/textural loop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—barrier survival—starts ambiguous (“afraid”) but sharpens when the column lattice literally trembles. One meaningful tightening: Kael’s frequency match fuses personal obsession with system salvation, foreclosing the option to reinforce rigid shields. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral; the farm gains permeability but what Kael forfeits (intellectual arrogance?) remains abstract, capping intensity at the 8-band door.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of surrender-as-strength emerges through biological metaphor rather than thesis statement—mushrooms thrive once shields drop. Subtext resides in the shifting light: fear-bright → harmonious steady glow, reconfiguring meaning without moralizing. The quiet wildfire metaphor hints at unstoppable but gentle change, creating lingering ambiguity about security vs. openness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Narrative voice stays tight to Kael’s sensory-technical filter—fractal optics, quantum symbols—without sliding into exposition dumps. Rhythm modulates: clipped procedural observations accelerate during laser tuning, then lengthen into lyrical cadence at spore-rain close. Distinct perceptual signature achieved through spatial metaphors and light vocabulary that recur and reprice at the end.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is generally varied; however, several “barrier”/“light” repetitions within single beats verge on synonym loops (−0.3). Metaphors stay coherent but stacked in places (“mycelium threading through soil”) risking minor purple tint. No scaffolding sentences or template cadence, and the closing image lands clean, so penalty stays modest.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The bioluminescent security farm feels fresh—quantum-etched fungal firewall is not a trope mash-up seen elsewhere. Surrender-as-physics concept reframes classic “break the system” beat into ecological collaboration. Specificity of quantum symbols and spore-pod choreography keeps the idea from drifting into allegory, though the emotional payoff is more cerebral than gut-level.</comment>
