<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses—destructive fire as tender rescue—stay active in every beat; the final tear-painted restoration crystallizes the cost of her promise. Interiority is concrete (“calloused hands,” “volcanic tenderness”) rather than diagnostic. The only slip is a slight over-articulation of the archive-as-garden metaphor in the grandmother’s quoted line, nudging toward thesis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the healed portrait reconfigures the archive from tomb to living garden, with the tear’s ink as visible cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each painted glyph layers density until the final image reweights meaning. Orientation is clean by 80 words; the single mosaic shard (three-day ellipsis) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The archive’s dust-choked halls, acid-eaten canvas, and obsidian ink are filtered through Mara’s restoration gaze; every sensory note guides her next mark. The spiral-gold brushstroke in Elara’s eye functions as micro-setting that constrains the final recognition. Spatial choreography is flawless across chambers.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keep the promise to keep stories alive—tightens when each act of “vandalism” actually risks erasing more history if she misreads the tapestry. The midpoint shift from theft to co-creation (painting symbols rather than stealing them) narrows options under the Accumulative lens. Cost is legible: the grandmother’s face re-forming costs Mara her anonymity and her last vial of ink.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the reframing of destruction as cultivation; no character states it outright. The obsidian tear reprises the soot smudge, reweighting fire from erasure to germination. The ending invites counter-readings: is the archive truly alive or is Mara projecting grief? Complexity lingers without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Mara’s perceptual bias—she notices thread counts, acid halos, and the “hum” of stories rather than architectural facts. Syntax lengthens under tenderness (“her fingers traced the charred edges”) and compresses during trespass (“She moved from room to room”). No head-hop or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “flames had licked away the artist’s face” carries sight, sound, and tactility in one stroke. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphor. The single elevated phrase—“archive where knowledge was not stored but alive”—is earned by prior sensory grounding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The lending-library arsonist who burns to cultivate is a fresh synthesis; the tapestry-to-portrait glyph trail feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk is taken in treating vandalism as tenderness without moral hedging, and it pays off in the final tear. No trope recycling or familiar set-piece echoes.</comment>
