<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara’s refusal-to-let-silence-win motive is declared early and restated rather than tested; the single decisive choice (shatter the insulator) is vivid but arrives without interior contradiction or visible trade-off, so the arc feels inevitable, not earned. Still, her embodied listening-through-bones and bleeding fingernails give tactile cost, keeping her above abstraction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the grove’s new “heartbeat” reweights the premise with undeniable social cost—music now lives in wind and moss. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each porcelain strum thickens texture until pattern break (shatter) re-configures meaning. Orientation is clean by 120 words; no因果 gaps. Cost is the insulator itself and Elara’s bloodied hands—both on-page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The porcelain insulator functions as micro-setting: its glaze, weight, and eventual fracture literally constrain every tactic and charge the final image. Alder leaves as “eager listeners” and moss that “cradles sound” give sensory specificity without tourist-catalogue overload. Spatial choreography is immaculate—no phantom limbs or teleporting shards.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prove sound can exist inside silence—is signaled in paragraph one and deepens through each strum. Escalation is accumulative: density of vibration, foliage, moss, then the single decisive intensification (shatter) that reweights stakes. Cost is visible—bled nails, broken relic—so pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the tactile metaphor of “empathy in motion”: translating another entity’s pain into audible beauty. No final moralizing; the last image of hedgehog waking to “a new song soft as a heartbeat” lets resonance accrue through particulars. Ambiguity remains—will the grove survive human ears?—inviting reflection without thesis statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a hushed, musical cadence that modulates with each strum. Perceptual signature is distinct: Elara reads cracks as “sheet music,” feels vibration “in her marrow.” Non-standard elements (trees “clapping like hands”) are taught early and paid off in the swaying amphitheater climax; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is sentence-level music: varied rhythm, breath-length paragraphs, high information density. Figurative language is selective—“spines vibrating faintly”—and never clutters high-pressure beats. Zero synonym loops or template cadence; only a single paraphrase loop (“the grove held its breath… siskins paused mid-flight”) forgiven for cinematic pacing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The conceit of “tree-song sculptor” is fresh, yet the hedgehog-clock and porcelain relic keep it from drifting into abstract eco-fantasy. Stress-cracks-as-notation feels inevitable in hindsight; risk lies in the quiet ending, which succeeds because the final hum is charged with conceptual cost. No derivative echoes; specificity anchors universals.</comment>
