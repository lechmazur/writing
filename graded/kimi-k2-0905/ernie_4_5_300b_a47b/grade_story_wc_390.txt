<comment>Elias’s interiority is concrete—his gloved hands on the dial, sweat in his collar—and his contradictory gear-head vs. bone-deep mystic impulses collide live in scene. The micro-choice to match the ghost’s wail with the resonator crystallizes his hierarchy: family duty > self-preservation. The earned cost is legible—he staggers, vision blurs—yet the “logically emotional” label is announced rather than dramatized, blunting flaw complexity. Ghost’s bow feels slightly convenient, capping motivation below 9-band.</comment>

<comment>Causal lens holds: each beat (frequency drop → ghost arrival → sonic counter) tightens options. Orientation anchored by word 60; no debt. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration: the key’s song stabilizes, Elias pockets it with trembling legs—cost felt. One micro-turn (ghost软化) is earned, not luck. Missing a persistent price that shapes tomorrow’s tactics keeps it under 9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Drift-ice marina is lived-in: planks crunch, resonator whirs, ice creaks under knees. The portable sonic tool functions as micro-setting, constraining every tactical choice. Color-stroke “azure-coat” repeats like a beacon, charging final image. Golden sunset is tracked to last-light deadline, tightening clock—meets 9- gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—key’s vibrational balance—signaled in para 1; sunset clock tightens once. Protagonist agency drives escalation: dial twist → sonic duel → stance crystallization. Cost visible (collapse, sweat, clatter) but second beat of loss (tool damage, stamina) only implied. Meets 8.8− threshold; lackspersistent constraint that would push 9.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges: “harmony over lock” from action, not sermon. Bridge metaphor reweights when ghost bows, echoing Elias’s earlier insight. No final-paragraph moralizing. Slight conceptual convenience—ghost instantly accepts harmony—keeps it shy of 9.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual filter: “sound slicing through his skull,” legs burn. Syntax grows staccato under sonic assault; longer clauses return as peace resumes. No head-hop. “Sonic absolution” phrase is narrator-level, not POV, a tiny register slip.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High-density lines carry triple duty: “His hands, gloved in cracked leather, adjusted the frequency dial” = tactile, backstory, action. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Rhythm flexes with battle tempo. One filter-verb cluster (“seemed to hold its breath”) is ornamental, not in closure beat. Clean enough for 9−.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: lighthouse engineer + sonic exorcism + crypt key as tuning fork. Genre tropes (ghost guardian, family relic) are re-cast through acoustical science. Risky concept stays coherent; final image of guardian walking away humming is memorable. Lacks one more unforeseen implication to breach 9.5.</comment>
