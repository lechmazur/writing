<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Interiority is evocative—“tarnished silver” eyes, dice as compass, ozone-tasting air—and Kael’s contradictory impulse (motion as surrogate for silence) stays live. Micro-choices are dramatized: counting loops, rolling the chipped die, the fist-rupture, the final refusal to grab the orbiting dice. Earned endurance costs him the only talisman he still possessed, visible on the page: “Let them be.” Flaw remains present (cheating past) but does not complicate the final beat; grim optimism is asserted more than embodied in speech cadence. The 42.7 % figure is the single diagnostic-speak intrusion in an otherwise visceral interior monologue.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the staircase keeps breathing, Kael keeps climbing, but meaning flips—possession is replaced by witnessed perpetual motion, final image “pinpricks of light.” Causality holds under Accumulative/Textural lens: each die appearance, ozone taste, and charcoal proof thickens pattern until the rupture crystallizes the stake. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) are late (~140 words) but the deliberate disorientation is taught and echoed in closure, so Orientation Test is waived. Cost is unmistakable: “He’d captured what he came for, not in his hands.” No meaningful escalation before the rupture beat; single intensification suffices for this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Staircase operates as micro-setting—its vanishing steps literally constrain footing and tactics; the dice orbit inside its curvature charges the final image. Selective sensory palette (shimmering parchment stone, metallic groan, ozone-regret air) is filtered through Kael’s bias toward aged, academic textures. Spatial choreography is clean: dice thrown, reappear, hover at an exact orbital radius. Two minor slips—“aged parchment” and “tarnished silver” verge on cross-metaphor clutter but do not stall momentum. Environment does not merely mirror interiority; it supplies the rupture surface that enables the perpetual loop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capture the texture of loss via endless motion—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: rupture beat forces trade-off between owning the dice and witnessing their self-sustaining orbit, final cost visible. Agency is Kael’s throughout: pacing, counting, rolling, punching. Under Accumulative lens, density of die appearances, proofs, and taste repetitions reweights the stake until the last image. No secondary opposition or reversal; single meaningful intensification suffices but keeps this category below 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: possession versus participation, motion as commemoration rather than cure. Subtext resides in gesture—hand that slams stone then opens empty. No character articulates thesis; the ending image reconfigures meaning without moral. Ambiguity is productive: reader left to decide whether Kael is healed or merely synchronized to his prison. Minor dock for “42.7 %” numerical abstraction, which momentarily lectures rather than dramatizes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Kael with no head-hop. Diction is scholarly-tactile—“shimmered like aged parchment,” “texture of that loss”—matching his mathematic-poet profile. Rhythmic control under pressure: short declaratives during rupture (“The step beneath him ruptured—not into shards…”) accelerate heartbeat without syntactic monotony. No dialogue to evaluate; internal voice remains coherent. Perceptual signature is consistent: numerical proofs, dice weights, ozone taste all filtered through a mind that quantifies grief.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High information density: each sentence advances setting, object lore, or interiority. No scaffold loops; sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts create visual rhythm. Mixed-metaphor risk (“aged parchment” stone, “tarnished silver” eyes) is minor and does not recur in climactic beat. Figurative language retreats during rupture, giving clarity. Copy accuracy clean. Opening line anchors voice and stake; final line offers resonant image recharging dice motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Combines grief-quest with Escher topology; perpetual motion sought as emotional mirror is fresh angle. Dice flaws and charcoal proofs particularize familiar “infinite stairs” trope. Concept follows own logic: rupture creates orbit, orbit denies possession—implications respected. Final risk—letting dice recede—earns poignancy. Slight echo of Borges/“Library of Babel” keeps score sub-8.8.</comment>
