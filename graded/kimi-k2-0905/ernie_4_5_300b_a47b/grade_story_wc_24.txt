<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lorn’s interiority is tactile—the filed key biting his palm, the backward count as a ritual—but his motives stay abstract: we’re told he “suspects” clocks measure silence, yet no contradictory impulse forces a visible trade-off. The climactic insight (“clocks measure longing”) is lovely but declared, not dramatized through a micro-choice that costs him something on the page. Because the final stance is epiphany rather than irreversible action, the character beat feels slightly under-cooked for 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The piece runs Accumulative/Textural: the backwards count tightens pattern until the fjord-clock surfaces and reweights the premise. Orientation is clear by line 5; causality is not the engine, but the cadence shift from 100→1 delivers the required tightening. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—time reframed as longing—with the key’s razor edge still in pocket as persistent constraint. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, which keeps it just shy of 9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The horizon station, brass hydraulics, and salt-streaked walls are filtered through Lorn’s professional eye; the fjord’s mirror-surface becomes a clock-face, integrating setting into concept. The mantle clock key acts as micro-setting: its shifting constellations and razor teeth constrain how he handles it and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no anchor drifts.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Dominant stake—understanding what clocks measure—is signaled early and deepens through the counting ritual. The fjord-clock reveal is a pattern-break that reweights meaning, not a causal reversal driven by Lorn’s choice; pressure escalates texturally. No visible price is exacted from Lorn, so the tightening is intellectual rather than tactical, capping the upper band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges concretely: time-as-longing is earned by the backwards count and the seabed clock’s retrograde motion, avoiding overt thesis. The final sentence’s razor-edge image reprises the grandfather’s blade maxim, giving lyrical closure. Complexity is respected—no moral is handed down—yet the insight is slightly diffuse because Lorn pays no personal cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Lorn’s sensory filter; diction (“hydraulic clock shepherd,” “mica-lined compartment”) is precise and vocation-specific. Rhythm modulates with the countdown, compressing syntax under pressure. No head-hop or register drift; perceptual signature is consistent and memorable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Prose is lean, image-dense, and mostly loop-free; occasional metaphor clustering (“blade you sharpen,” “razor edges,” “razor-edge image”) is purposeful motif reinforcement rather than accidental churn. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge voice. No scaffold or paraphrase loops dull the climax; one hairline slip—“the fjord quiet made his eyes water” approaches cliché—keeps it sub-9.</comment>

<question>8</question><question>8.6</question><comment>The hydraulic-countdown-to-seabed-clock reveal is a fresh synthesis of steampunk and lyric meditation; “time measures longing” feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk is taken with the backwards-count ritual, paid off by the mirrored sky/fjord clock-face. Specific occupational detail (mica-lined watch chamber, brass pressure dials) grounds the conceit in lived craft.</comment>
