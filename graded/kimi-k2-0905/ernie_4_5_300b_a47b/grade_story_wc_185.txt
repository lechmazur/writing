<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The mapkeeper’s interiority is textured through bodily resonance (“her ribs ache”) and micro-choices (pressing the stone to the spiral). Her flaw—obsessive attunement to lost sound—drives every beat and is paid for in physical pain and exhausted stillness at the end. No contradictory impulses are staged simultaneously, so the 9+ gate isn’t cleared, but the single-POV arc is credible and fully earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Causal lens holds: because she kneels, traces, presses, the bloom manifests and re-silences the caves. The spiral ice wall acts as persistent constraint; the final “quiet so profound it felt like drowning in velvet” is a Charged Poise that reweights all prior noise. Cost is legible in her aching ribs and creaking joints—visible price on the last page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The caves’ sonic physics—ice that melts into sound, spirals that channel energy—are learned through action, never lectured. Micro-setting (echo chamber stone against her sternum) literally channels the climax; environment and tool are inseparable from the choice. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no impossible positions or drifting anchors.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Single stake—restore silence—tightens via the stone’s accelerating pulse and the rising static storm. One meaningful deepening: the ice spiral’s vibration turns observation into summoning, narrowing options to “conjure or be drowned.” Cost is felt in bodily pain and translucent energy beings; no second reversal, but the escalation cleanly forces the bloom’s creation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the sonic ecology itself: silence as living, cultivable, precious. No character utters a thesis; the final lullaby is the argument. The reweighted bloom—once myth, now tool—reconfigures meaning without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: the beings remain, half-tamed, leaving the cost of future noise possible.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays inside the mapkeeper’s perceptual bias—sound textures, tactile frost, bone resonance. Compression (“hammered repose”) is taught early and paid off in the final creak of her joints. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens under sonic assault, then widens into velvet quiet. Rhythm mirrors pressure—short clauses during static storm, longer sighs at hush.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry triple duty: “The cracks began to vibrate, their edges blurring as if the ice were melting into sound” advances action, sets visual, and cues physics. No scaffold loops; figurative language is spare, each metaphor grounded in cave acoustics. Register never drifts above the mapkeeper’s sensory lexicon. Final line cadence—“the harmonic caves were whole once more, their song reborn”—resolves by image, not explanation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>“Bloom of hush” redefines familiar trope of magical flower into sonic void; ripple-mark mapkeeper is a vocation never seen before. Risk in sonic world-building pays off because rule-set stays coherent. Energy beings as “living static” transforms alien-invasion cliché into audible weather. Closure depends on these exact invented mechanics—swap any element and the cave’s rebirth collapses.</comment>
