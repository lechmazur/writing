<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid—“each fissure a timeline”—and motives stay tethered to grief-rage, but the epiphany “she was a seer. A disrupter” arrives as label, not dramatized turn. Micro-choices (slam console, step into node) show hierarchy of values, yet the shard’s hold on her palm is repeated without new charge. Cost is felt, but the final self-definition is asserted, not earned by visible loss.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: shard-pulse reveals veins → node → she enters. Closure lands as Charged Poise: new crystal, vanished observatory, undeniable conceptual cost—she can now “see” nodes. Orientation anchor at 90 words is clean; no lens ambiguity. Deduction for slight explanatory overload in Orion’s late warnings that don’t alter tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Floating glass observatory, ozone reek, fractal shadows underfoot—details are selective and mirror her cracked state. Micro-setting of the shard in palm charges the final image when it re-crystallizes. Spatial track across crater remains coherent. Environment shapes choice: glass floor cracks push her toward the node.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find where unused potential pools”—is signaled early and tightens when the node threatens implosion. One meaningful deepening: she renames potential as “anger…grief” and steps inside, narrowing options. Cost is visible—observatory erased—but external rather than bodily. Agency remains hers; no off-stage rescue.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete refrain of “intangibly tangible” and the re-crystallized shard; no final moralizing. Grief-as-fuel is implicit, not preached. The closing grin complicates bleakness, letting ambiguity linger. Avoids tidy thesis, but epiphanies lean on voiced abstractions once.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person tight stays locked to Elara; perceptual signature—“smoldering crater where her wedding had been”—is specific and rhythmic. Syntax compresses under pressure: “The node screamed.” No head-hopping. Dialogue (sparse) carries subtext: “Caution’s overrated” crystallizes stance. Free indirect clean; no register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with scene tempo; short bursts during node entry, longer coils for crater descent. Information density high—“veins of light stretching into the horizon” does triple work. Minor scaffold: “the hunt wasn’t over. It had just begun” is paraphrase; “she felt alive” is label-speak. No metaphor clash; visuals stay coherent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Freshens grief-driven apocalypse by fusing quantum-trauma theory with geode talisman. The “unfiltered awakening” trope is grounded in ash-taste and shard edges, not abstraction. Risky second-person address from Orion is kept brief, serves tension. Final image of walking star-lit veins feels specific to this story, not canned.</comment>
