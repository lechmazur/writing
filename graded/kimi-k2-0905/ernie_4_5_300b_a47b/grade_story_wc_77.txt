<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara’s fear-and-lie paradox is dramatized through the clasp beat, giving us embodied cost. Yet her interiority slips into label-speak (“Your power is an illusion”) that flattens the peak beat. Vey’s opaque motives keep him from exerting crucible pressure; he watches rather than alters. The earned shift in the clasp’s glow lands, but the emotional price feels under-cooked because the prior beat was told, not shown.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: curse → cloak → paradox → thread → new light. Closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost (seared hand, steady glow). Orientation is clean by word 80. The dream-dictionary rule is introduced late yet still governs the final tactic, so causality survives. No persistent constraint is established post-victory, keeping the win from feeling priced.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Funhouse mirrors, condensation, ozone, and moth-residue create a tactile, single-scene crucible. The cloak clasp serves as micro-setting that constrains the final grab. Selective sensory triage (visual, haptic, acoustic) mirrors Mara’s narrowing attention. Spatial choreography stays coherent; no floating bodies or impossible moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“trick fear into revealing its weakness”—is signaled early and tested in one decisive tightening: the lie-paradox. Agency drives the turn; coincidence plays no role. Cost (burnt palm, luminous clasp) is visible but not carried forward as a tactical limiter. Escalation is linear, not deepened, so pressure plateaus rather than spikes at the end.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Theme—fear as consumable illusion—emerges through the carnival mouth image and the lie-feed beat. Subtext resides in Vey’s cold smile rather than exposition. Final line (“The one that survives”) offers a Charged Poise that reframes survival itself as morally ambiguous. No moralizing sentence intrudes, but the theme’s complexity is more asserted than dramatized in aftermath.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Mara’s fractured-glass perception. Syntax tightens under stress (“breath hitched,” “clasp biting palm”). Vey’s diction remains colder, flatter, creating minimal but audible voice distance. No head-hopping or filter-verb clusters. The lyric compression (“peeling paint and twisted mirrors”) is taught early and sustained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; sentences vary in length to match pulse. No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated diction (“repulsive allure,” “conceptual repricing”) nudges toward thesaurus territory but stays within Mara’s aestheticized gaze. One scaffold clause (“the thing before her was a grotesque mosaic…”) could trim without loss. Otherwise clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Photographic-curse + funhouse + paradoxical dream-dictionary yields a fresh fusion of body-horror and logic-puzzle fantasy. The “feed the carnival a lie” rule inverts standard exorcism beats. Cloak-as-tech and Vey’s survivalist epigram feel specific to this piece. While carnival and cursed-mirror tropes are familiar, their combinatory logic and the lie-paradox resolution avoid cliché.</comment>
