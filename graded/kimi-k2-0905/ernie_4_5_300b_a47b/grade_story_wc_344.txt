<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael’s want to “learn the rhythm of repair” is stated early and re-anchored to filial memory, but interiority stays general (“weight of that legacy”) and no contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene; the moment of triumph carries warmth yet no micro-choice reveals a cost or risk that would sharpen contradiction under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: decipher → Hall of Mirrors → false reflection → dissolve → prize; orientation (who/where/when) is secured by line 3 and the lock-opening beat delivers a Decisive Change with felt emotional cost (“connection to the past…mend what was broken in himself”). Lens holds; no meaningful tightening or price beyond the sentimental recognition, so it stays below 8.8.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Ice-bound shelves, frost-rimed mirrors, and the crescent lock provide tactile, POV-filtered specificity; the “hauntingly bright” aura is shown through glare on cracked glass and the singing mirror edge, integrating sensory detail with action. Setting never blocks or enables a choice in a way that alters tactics, so it misses the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade>
<comment>Single stake—retrieve the gears—is clear; pressure is atmospheric (cold, eerie portraits) rather than escalating through narrower options or higher cost. The only reversal is the mirror dissolve, which is a puzzle solved by pre-carried liquid light, not a tightening trade-off; consequence remains emotional, not tactical, so escalation feels static.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of “mending time/memory” emerges through mirrored selves and inherited tools, but the final paragraph articulates the moral (“even the most broken things could be made whole”) outright, muting subtext. Resonance is pleasant yet lands via statement rather than image reconfiguration, keeping it shy of higher bands.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; diction favors precise sensory nouns (“frost-kissed portraits,” “brass and silver cogs etched with runes”) and rhythmic variation. No dialogue to test voice distinction, but narrative voice stays particular to Kael’s locksmith perception; occasional mild elevation (“driftwood nostalgia”) is consistent with lyrical intent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid and largely free of loops; figurative language is restrained and scene-driven. One scaffold pair (“He didn’t know what challenges awaited, but for the first time in years, he felt ready…”) states the obvious after the emotional peak; minor but noticeable, preventing a higher score.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Combining lunar-eclipse locksmith, frozen sky-library, and memory-warping mirrors yields a fresh atmospheric package, yet the quest structure and father-legacy beat are familiar fantasy templates. Specificity of liquid light and crescent lock adds local color, but the narrative does not risk subverting the template, so originality feels moderate.</comment>
