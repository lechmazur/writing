<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is sharply particularized through the thread/needle body metaphor and her sensory-filtered memories; the final swallow is earned because her attention has already re-priced “cure” as “catalyst.” Lumen’s motivation stays abstract—its kindness is asserted, never contradicted, so no interior contradiction operates in-scene; the statue functions more as oracle than character. The emotional cost is visible (she drinks, garden breathes), satisfying the 9+ gate for this category, but the living statue falls short of full characterhood.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the drink is a Conceptual Repricing—Mara’s quest flips from “retrieve cure” to “become vector,” with felt ecological cost. Causal chain holds: thread pry → ampoule free → ingestion → blight recedes. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; the garden’s blooming density re-weights stakes. Cost is on-page in the final breath-like shudder; no orientation drift past 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Bioluminescent algae, obsidian statue, coral beds—details are filtered through Mara’s diving perception and narrated via tactile action (kneeling in silt, gloves slick). The garden’s laboratory logic is learned late yet still guides choice; spatial choreography tracks cleanly as she threads cracks. The micro-setting (ampoule pressed under pedestal) constrains the climax pry and charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate. A single overripe phrase—“liquid starlight”—is offset by surrounding specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—heal the ocean—signals early and tightens when the ampoule is revealed as catalyst, not cure; the tightening forces Mara to assume guardian role. Escalation is textural: each blooming coral patch visually reweights cost under her skin. Agency is present—she chooses to drink—but external confirmation of blight receding is off-page, muting full 9-band price visibility. Still, the shift from passive seeker to active vector satisfies Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>“Welcome nuance into a certainty” emerges through concrete reversal: grandmother’s death becomes transformation, cure becomes stewardship. Subtext works in gesture—thread as familial tether, foxglove poison flipped to serum—without overt thesis statements. Final image of secret garden pulsing alive re-weights meaning without moralizing, satisfying Q5’s 9+ demand. Minor echo of “nuance” sentiment in closing thought nicks perfect score.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited hug-close to Mara; perceptual signature skews tactile and aqueous, syntax lengthens during awe, contracts during pry. No head-hopping; Lumen’s telepathy is rendered as imagistic projection, keeping distance. One register slip—“liquid starlight” drifts into stock lyric—but overall rhythmic control heightens pressure. Distinct idiom differentiates Mara’s grit from Lumen’s impressionistic pulse.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is generally lean; high info density: “threaded her fingers into the fissures” does tactile and action work simultaneously. Minor scaffold: “garden’s true purpose: not a tomb, but a laboratory” is useful compression, not redundancy. Mixed metaphor check clean; no filter-verb stacks. Final third avoids figurative muddle; one “shuddered, as if breathing” is earned, not strained. Overall momentum breathes with scene tempo, qualifying for 9-band but for isolated ornamental phrase.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Living obsidian telepath statue, memory-thread, foxglove-glass serum—specific synthesis feels fresh yet inevitable. Risk of underwater magical laboratory is high but justified through consistent ecological stakes and earned grandmother reveal. Garden-as-lab reconfigures familiar “lost city” trope into climate-catalyst parable. Not quite a 9 because the blight cure concept edges toward eco-fantasy template; still, the nuance-over-certainty moral twist is non-obvious.</comment>
