<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and specific—"polish until the stone weeps" shows embodied craft—but the brother’s absence keeps relationship pressure off-stage; the final stance-crystallization ("I’m not afraid") is earned yet costs are more conceptual than visceral, capping the 8-band. Still, contradiction ("laugh…brittle as winter ice") and micro-choice (pressing the gem) track cleanly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: grief → basilica trick → lantern craft → shadow confrontation. One tightening beat—lantern flares, spires shed shards—narrows options and visibly pays the cost (her trembling fingers, dissolved shadow). Closure is Charged Poise: she forecloses retreat, claims next crane; cost is legible in the charged "ready" smile.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Floating tea garden, basilica’s paradoxical motion, and moonstone bowl act as micro-settings that constrain her ascension/descent craft; final image of ascending-star shards re-uses basilica spires, passing the 9-gate test. Sensory economy is tight—lavender smoke, gem facets—filtered through lantern-maker priorities; no orientation drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—transform grief into flight—signaled early; escalation arrives when lantern-light turns cranes airborne, foreclosing private grief in favor of shared sky-magic. Price (exposure to shadow, trembling) is visible; coincidence absent. One meaningful tightening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme—grief folded into flight—emerges through lantern / crane recurrence, never sermonized. Final non-literal answer: ascending shards = transformed sorrow, "ready for next shadow." Resists tidy moral; ambiguity lingers in whether new lanterns will suffice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate stays locked; perceptual signature is tactile-gem, star-counting, basilica-as-body. Rhythm modulates—long loamy clauses vs. shard-burst fragments—mirroring wax/wane of light. Compression ("Dreams are just grief with wings") is taught early, paid off in crane flight; no voice drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>High density: "polish until the stone weeps" does image + method + emotional bleed. No synonym loops; metaphors consistent (light, folding, flight). Minor scaffold—"the lantern maker…" repeated opening three sentences—dulls slightly but never touches closure; still below 9 due to that micro-repetition.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Floating tea garden + dream-recording lanterns + origami grief-cranes synthesize into fresh constellation, but "shadow detached" remains generically capitalized Evil; more specificity on its nature would sharpen risk. Nonetheless, inversion of descent/ascent as emotional technology feels non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
