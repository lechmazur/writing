<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s vocation—writing obituaries for the living—gives her a sharp, specific lens, and her kneeling to “listen” to the thread is a vivid micro-choice. Yet the interior contradiction promised by the premise (chronicling absences while craving presence) is stated more than enacted; we never see her tempted to break her own rule, so the arc feels pre-decided. The embodied emotion is strong (“chest ached with lonesome splendor”), but the vanished woman remains a gentle projection rather than a pressure that forces Elara to reorder her map. Earned stasis lands, but the cost is poetic rather than tactical—acceptable at this length, yet not wrenching.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each textured return of the silver thread thickens the pattern until the final “map of lives restored” re-weights the stake. Orientation is clean—garden, twilight, thread anchor by line 4. The single causal micro-turn (thread hums → vision appears) is thin, but the design is lyric accumulation, not because/therefore. Closure is a legitimate Charged Poise: the thread’s glow reconfigures Elara’s vocation from chronicling to walking, with the felt cost of perpetual loneliness legible in “she would spend her life solving.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The garden is rendered through tactile micro-details—moss, jasmine scent, carpet weft under fingers—each filtered by Elara’s taxonomic gaze. Spatial choreography is immaculate: kneel → brush → unroll → follow back. The thread functions as micro-setting that literally guides her exit, satisfying the 9+ gate. Weather (autumn wind) is used as promise rather than backdrop, charging the final beat without clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</question><comment>Dominant stake—map the geography of healing—remains coherent. Pressure escalates by accretion: each sensory layer (scent, vibration, vision) deepens the density of absence rather than narrowing external options. The only tangible cost is the lifelong, solitary commitment stated at the end; because it is declared, not dramatized, the price feels conceptual rather than visceral. Still, the tightening inside the lyric pattern is sufficient for sub-800-word scale.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: writing as suturing, absence as connective tissue. The final image of “map of lives restored” offers a non-literal answer—obituaries become cartography, healing is an endless walk. No moralizing; the wisdom is encoded in the thread’s shimmer. The lonesome splendor tone itself becomes the thematic residue, lingering past the last line.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Elara’s perceptual signature—“ink-stained fingers,” “vividly descriptive prose”—without slipping into authorial tour-guide. Syntax lengthens under awe, tightens during inscription, mirroring emotional cadence. No dialogue, so voice carries all subtext through diction (“syllable in a poem she could not finish”). The elevated diction fits a woman who weaponizes language; register never drifts.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is supple; paragraph breaths match the garden’s dusk cooling. Occasional modifier stacks (“lonesome splendor of the shadowed garden”) flirt with purple but are saved by sonic payoff. One scaffold loop: “thread by thread, obituary by obituary” restates the same parallelism twice—minor. No mixed metaphors; vehicles stay textile-centric. Closure line is clean, propulsive, and artifact-free.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>The conceit—obituarist for the living mapping grief via carpet thread—feels fresh, not a prompt recombination. Specificity of craft (“weft a syllable”) transforms the familiar haunt into textile metaphysics. Risk is moderate: lyric accumulation over plot, but coherence holds. The vanished-woman trope is offset by Elara’s inverse vocation; inversion supplies the non-obvious angle.</comment>
