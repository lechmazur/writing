<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lirael’s want—recovering unspoken words—anchors every beat, but interiority tilts toward poetic commentary (“cryptic medium,” “fierce tenderness”) rather than on-page contradiction; the shard warms and smoothes as tactile micro-choice, yet no interior impulse clashes with the act, so the beat advances texture more than psyche. Reflection blocks (peatsong, cathedral memory) stay ≤20% and cue present stimuli, satisfying BRR, but the single decisive micro-choice—kneeling to read leaf-messages—restates motive rather than testing it; cost is atmospherically implied, not dramatized, capping full authenticity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: condensation-letters function as pattern-break that reweights sorrow into tangible beauty; closure is Charged Poise—Lirael exits lighter, shard now smooth—cost legible as irreversible farewell to regret. Orientation clear by 120 wds; no teleporting props; single transition (dusk→dawn) is marked by moonset and fade of songs. Spirits’ music supplies causal texture: because song swells, droplets form; because droplets dissolve, she accepts impermanence. Shard glow → soil is the priced constraint that shapes tactics and final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mangrove roots/water function as micro-setting that literally guide her exit; spirits’ spatialized song constrains attention—she must pause, kneel, listen. Sensory hierarchy obeys swamp logic: peat suction, briny air, moon sheen on leaves; POV filters out fauna to foreground “ancient fingers” and condensation. Spatial choreography clean: shard placed, palm to earth, trace of letters, rise at dawn. Tool (shard) charges final image when its worn edge mirrors softened grief. No occupational detail required; world rules stable.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</question><comment>Single dominant stake: convert unsaid into witnessed apology. Escalation is density-based: droplet-words accumulate until emotional threshold is crossed; no external antagonist needed. Tightening occurs when moon sets—time window forecloses further readings—forcing acceptance of fragmentary messages; this is visible cost. Agency remains hers: she chooses to trace then release each letter, forfeiting completeness for communion. No reversal, but deepening sufficient under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from image chain: broken cathedral spout → fragmented apologies → smoothed shard = enduring love despite fracture. Subtext in gesture: tracing then letting dissolve = ritual of release without verbal thesis. No explicit moral; final line “Go. Live. Speak.” is imperative from spirits, not narrator, so avoids thematic echo penalty. Wisdom earned through sensory ordeal rather than platitude. Ambiguity lingers: we never learn addressees of letters, keeping universality without vagueness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Third-limited adheres to Lirael; diction stays within mythic-lyric register consistent with “cryptic medium.” Metaphor cadence (“roots clawed…ancient fingers”) is patterned early and paid off when roots rearrange to guide exit, satisfying experimental tolerance. No dialogue, so voice purity uncontested. Rhythm swells/ebbs with song intensity; paragraph lengths mirror tidal breathing. Psychic distance tightens during condensation reading, then widens at dawn—intentional shift. Filter verbs (“she believed”) are minimal and voice-motivated.</question>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: long anaphoric sentences under song, staccato “Show me” at apex, gentle close. Figurative language dense but coherent—water, light, stone vehicles interlock without self-contradiction. No scaffold loops; every sentence advances image or pressure. Occasional elevated Latinate diction (“ephemeral,” “alabaster”) slightly over-ornate for swamp grit, but stays within established lyric register. Opening and closing lines are strong image anchors; condensation paragraph is high-density without clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Mangrove-as-liminal-post-office is fresh synthesis; spirits as choir of regret transmission rather than threat avoids swamp cliché. Condensation-letters innovate standard ghost-message trope by medium (leaf panes). Gargoyle shard repurposed from city ruin to portable absolution tool. Conceptual risk: lyric stasis over plot, but coherence maintained. Emotional specificity of “moment before deciding” anchors universality. Does not push formal boundaries further; hence not 8.5+.</comment>
