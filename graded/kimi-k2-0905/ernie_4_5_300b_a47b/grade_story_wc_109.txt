<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—yearning to map silence while fearing its absorption—surfaces only in abstract rumination; no embodied cost is paid. The final “smile” is unearned because the only prior struggle is the paper “resisting,” not her own psyche. Mild obsession stays verbal; it never complicates her micro-choices or produces a visible mistake. Closure qualifies as Earned Stasis (she keeps the scroll, foreclosing return to ordinary oracle work), but the price is asserted, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the map glows, the fort darkens, and silence is now portable—an undeniable conceptual cost under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is interior but coherent: each summarized silence thickens the texture until the map becomes autonomous. Orientation is swift; place, time, and lone actor are fixed by line 3. One minor loop—“the silence that thrummed… the silence that waited”—dulls the final cadence but does not rupture the lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The ridge fort’s crumbling arch and wind-gnawed stone constrain her bodily crouch and protect the ink from gusts; environment literally shapes the drawing act. Pebbles, mortar gaps, and the single vanishing star recur as tactile anchors, not postcard filler. Gold flakes shedding onto the rock function as micro-setting that charges the final image with stolen starlight. Weather remains coherent: residual storm hush is the very material she harvests.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can Mara render the unrenderable silence before the last star dies? Pressure escalates by accretion—each silence-layer narrows temporal margin, not physical space. No external antagonist is needed; the paper’s resistance and the star’s clock supply coherent friction. Cost is conceptual but legible: she trades the living night for an artifact that replaces it, foreclosing ordinary oracle work.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: art appropriates absence only by diminishing the lived world. Subtext resides in the image of gold leaf becoming starlight that no longer exists outside the scroll. No character moralizes; the final glow reweights earlier “ambered hush” as consumable resource. Ambiguity lingers—has she preserved or annihilated the silence?—without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays inside Mara’s perceptual filter—mortar cracks read as sea-language, ink smells of crushed shell. Syntax lengthens and contracts with breath units, mirroring the hush she tracks. No head-hopping or filter-verb clutter. Diction remains within a coastal oracle’s lexicon; the single neologism “ambered” is motivated and taught early.</comment>

<comment>Sentences carry triple duty—image, atmosphere, and forward motion. Metaphors are few but precise: “stone teeth gnawing at the wind.” One scaffold cluster—“the silence that thrummed… the silence that waited”—repeats noun + relative clause; it is the only loop. No mixed vehicles or register drift. Final paragraph slows rhythm to match the star’s wink-out, then snaps closed with the scroll roll.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Mapping silence as palimpsest rather than void feels fresh; the conceit is pursued to its logical endpoint—portable darkness that replaces the sky. Tropes of oracle and storm-battered fort are revitalized through tactile specificity and conceptual cost. No derivative echoes of famous scenes. Risk in abstract stakes is fully committed to, not hedged.</comment>
