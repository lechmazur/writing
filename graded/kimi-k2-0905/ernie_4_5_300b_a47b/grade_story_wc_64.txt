<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s curiosity about “the shape of intentions” anchors every tactile choice—kneading soil, tracing threads—so her final decision to rebury the case feels like the inevitable collision of blithe patience with discovered responsibility. The only slack is the off-stage arrival of the chess-clock beat; we’re told she pauses, not shown her body jolting at the sound, so the moment doesn’t quite crystallize contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The tapestry decoding delivers a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the same threads that seemed decorative become a temporal map, reweighting Elara’s gardener role into “gardener of time.” Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than strictly because-therefore, but the final image of reburying the case carries visible cost—she now carries knowledge she can never share with the living—so closure lands with felt price under an Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The cobalt silo’s oculus, marigold roots, and frayed thread constellations are selectively filtered through Elara’s calloused fingertips; each sensory tier constrains her next micro-movement. The velveteen gloom isn’t just mood—it’s the literal working light that limits how far she can see into the border labyrinth, making environment an active participant in the decoding.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—decipher or bury the tapestry’s secret—tightens once when the knight-thread mirrors the expired chess clock, converting a static artifact into live temporal pressure. The escalation is single but sufficient for the length; the price is conceptual rather than physical, paid when she accepts “the silence between moves” as perpetual guardianship, foreclosing the option to display her discovery.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges obliquely: burial is not forgetting but compassionate archiving; silence is a move, not an absence. The final phrase reconfigures the chess metaphor into a meditation on historical agency without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers—should the living hear the echoes?—and the story refuses to answer, letting the thematic question stay porous.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays inside Elara’s perceptual orbit: “her fingers calloused from decades” anchors voice in tactile memory, while diction like “velveteen gloom” and “uncharted echoes” is poetic yet consistent with a gardener who names soil textures nightly. No filter-verb stacks or register drift; rhythm breathes with the slow kneading of earth and thread, tightening only when the final thread is read.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm alternates between long, soil-heavy clauses and short luminous fragments (“1899,” “Alistair”) that mimic thread-snips. Metaphors stay physically coherent—threads equal voices, constellations equal dates—so no mixed-vehicle clutter. Zero paraphrase loops; each paragraph advances either discovery or cost, culminating in the spare final line that lets the stars shimmer without exposition.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The chess-clock-as-time-capsule is a fresh graft onto cemetery lore; pairing it with tapestry cartography feels inevitable yet unexampled. Risk is quiet—lyric accumulation over plot pyrotechnics—but the synthesis of gardener, silo crypt, and fabric map is specific enough that swapping any node would collapse the conceptual engine. Freshness resides in reframing burial as active spool-work rather than static rest.</comment>
