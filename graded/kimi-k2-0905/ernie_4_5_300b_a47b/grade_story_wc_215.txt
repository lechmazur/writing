<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Elias’s solitude-sought silence turns to compelled speech at the climax, a credible renunciation of his life-long stance; the shift is prepared by steady interiority (“the weight of unspoken words”) and micro-choices at the box. Emotions stay embodied (trembling hands, breath catching) rather than diagnostic. The only gap: we never see a moment where silence costs him something concrete before the ghosts arrive—his flaw is stated more than dramatized.</comment>

<comment>Accretive/lyric lens holds: each return to the glass box tightens the pattern until the “Speak” pulse breaks it, delivering a Charged Poise that reweights silence vs. speech. Orientation anchored by word 80. Causality is soft—why today does the box glow?—but the coincidence is complication, not resolution, so allowed under lyric logic. Cost is palpable: the shattering scatters both artifact and ghosts, foreclosing retreat to muteness.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Desert and derelict hives are sketched with heat-baked specificity (“cracked earth baking under a sun that had forgotten mercy”) and supply a felt scarcity that justifies Elias’s reticence. The hut’s defiant roof and the ever-present dust act as micro-setting, constraining his daily ritual. Only the glass box attains object-as-setting status; the wasteland itself never actively narrows his tactical choices—hence no 9+.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Single dominant stake—preserve vs. release silence—tightens when the box’s glow forces the first audible word. Escalation is accretive: each spectral visitation thickens atmosphere rather than threatening bodily harm, but the final “Speak” undeniably forecloses the option of lifelong silence. Visible price: the box’s destruction and ghostly dispersal leave Elias acoustically naked in the wasteland. Could use one earlier moment where silence visibly costs him (missed connection, hazard), but sufficient for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: speech as survival, not indulgence, in a world already stripped of life. The stained-glass memory montage reweights the covenant from beekeeper/land to living/dead, resolving in conceptual repricing—words as seeds scattered across ruin. No moralizing, only image. Slight sentimentality brushes the child/flower tableau, but the final scatter of shards converts nostalgia into necessary rupture.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person hovers at an intimate psychic distance that lets syntax grow parched and elliptical, mirroring Elias’s dehydrated reticence. Selective detail (“dust settled in its crevices”) shows a mind trained to notice minutiae instead of horizons. No dialogue required; the one spoken word lands as seismic rupture of voice. Rhythm accelerates into fragmentation at the shatter, then exhales—clean control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is spare yet textured; no loops or scaffold. Figurative layer is disciplined—“sun that had forgotten mercy” is the single intensifier in an otherwise concrete paragraph. High information density: each sentence either moves Elias’s body, re-anchors the box, or filters sensory data through his drought-sharpened priorities. Final image of airborne shards glinting “like stars” supplies luminous closure without metaphoric clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Post-apocalyptic bee-ghost parable risks familiarity, but the muteness-to-speech arc and the covenant twist (land ↔ keepers ↔ dead) feel freshly assembled. The stained-glass box as memory capsule is a specific, memorable pivot object not seen elsewhere. Risk is moderate; no structural gymnastics, but the lyric accretion trusts reader patience and pays off. Could push further into ecological weirdness for higher originality.</comment>
