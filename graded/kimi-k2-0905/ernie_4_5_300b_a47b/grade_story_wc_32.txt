<question>1</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Kael’s “stoically sensitive” trait is dramatized through contact with the crozier: the ivory bites, he bleeds, he still presses on—embodied cost under pressure. Interiority stays particular (“the phrase tasting of rust,” “truthsayer of his own marrow”) and avoids label-speak. The final self-wounding choice is causally prepared by earlier failures and the mentor’s voiced paradox, yielding Earned Stasis with visible scars. Cap at 8.7 because the single-POV isolation means no status crucible or relationship shift to deepen the beat further.</comment>

<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Causal chain holds: broken relic → successive approximation attempts → vivifying self-sacrifice → nexus bloom, each beat narrowing options and raising cost. Closure lands on-page: the fused crozier hovers, Kael’s hands are “scarred, his mind frayed,” paying the felt price. The Orientation Test is met within 60 words; no lens ambiguity. Persistent constraint—his maimed hands—shapes any future alchemy, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Ember nexus’s “crimson glow seeping through cracks” and “reversed storm” of ash are selective, pressure-responsive visuals; the crozier itself operates as micro-setting that constrains every tactical move. Sensory hierarchy tracks Kael’s exhaustion: smell of scorched skin, stone-numbed knees. Final image (“frozen in twilight’s embrace”) recharges prior “twilight” cue, meeting the 9+ gate by charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—interrupt stifling destiny via creative destruction—tightens when each failed approximation burns his skin and the last option demands self-essence. One meaningful reversal: from mending the relic to mending himself into it. Cost is visceral and accumulative; the price alters later tactics (scarred hands). Only a hair’s-breadth from 9+ because external antagonistic force stays abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the specific alchemy cycle rather than slogan: “creative destruction” is tested on the ivory, then on his flesh. Final image reframes Veyra’s “order is a cage” into a crystallized moment where the cage door is blown open by scar-tissue. Avoids final-paragraph moralizing; resonance is imagistic. Complexity acknowledged—freedom bought with permanent damage—yet ambiguity space is modest.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Kael’s perceptions: “ember winds howled… carrying whispers” filters through his guilty memory. Syntax shortens under stress (“Light erupted.”) then elongates for aftermath, showing rhythmic control. Diction (“grotesque question mark,” “keening sound, like a soul waking”) is vivid yet within alchemist lexicon. No head-hopping; patterned elision of time during forging is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence can layer tactile pain, tool-state, and emotional turn. Mixed-metaphor risk (“bridge… collapsed too”) is brief and character-internal, not closure-adjacent. Rhythm breathes with pressure; no template cadence or synonym loops. One minor paraphrase loop—“creative destruction… felt less like philosophy and more like a curse / wasn’t a theory. It was a choice”—keeps it from 9+.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Combines alchemical repair with self-mutilation to earn a fresh emotional configuration; not a trope checklist. Specificity of silver lattice shrinking into ivory vein makes the act memorable. Destiny-interruption via wounding oneself into an artifact is non-obvious synthesis. Risk-taking (quiet lyric close after explosive image) heightens coherence without clarity loss, warranting the upper band.</comment>
