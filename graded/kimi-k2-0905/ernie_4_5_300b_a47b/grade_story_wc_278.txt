<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is vivid—“guilt etched into her bones” lands—but her final surrender to the firmware rewrite feels abrupt; the mother-letter beat supplies motive yet no visible micro-choice on the page. The contradiction between star-map escapism and maternal duty is asserted, not dramatized in a single observable action with cost. Voice remains coherent, but the climactic renunciation lacks an embodied beat that forecloses her prior identity as tattooist.</comment>

<comment>Closure earns Charged Poise: the amber dims, lab silenced, firmware rewritten—cost is the erased dissonance itself. Causal chain holds: amber pulse → letters → code rewrite → silence, each step because/therefore. One soft spot: the corridor nursery appears without grounding transition, a momentary teleport, but it pays off thematically so orientation debt is waived. Final image is legible under Causal lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>“Laboratory of lost sounds” is sketched by ozone tang and humming walls; the amber micro-setting constrains her needle pause and later powers the scanner. Selective sensory triage—ozone, honeyed glow, fractal wings—mirrors narrowing perception under pressure. Spatial track stays clean: desk → display case → scanner, bodies anchored. Setting is not broad but elementally tight, and the amber’s material logic charges the final image, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—silence the firmware or be consumed—signaled early; tightening occurs when Lira kneels in the nursery and trades baby-wail silence for personal memory, a visible price. Escalation is single but sufficient: each letter read shrinks the corridor, narrowing exit options. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral—loss of audible grief—but remains legible on the page. Agency is decision, not combat, fitting short-form scale.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme—unanswered sound versus chosen silence—emerges through the amber–letter pairing rather than exposition. Final image of quiet lab reweights earlier star-maps as obsolete navigation, offering non-literal answer: silence can be mercy, not erasure. Avoids sermon; no character states the moral. Subtext lives in the wasp frozen mid-flight, a visual paradox of motionless noise. Complexity lingers: forgiveness is encoded, not felt, leaving plausible residue of guilt.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person focalization stays tight to Lira; perceptual signature leans visual–tactile—“silver quill,” “honeyed glow”—consistent with tattooist gaze. Rhythm modulates: long cadence for regret, staccato for scanner activation. No dialogue contamination; Elara’s idiom is clinical, Lira’s replies sparse, distinguishing status. Occasional filter verbs (“Lira saw”) could trim, but voice holds under pressure without drift into academic register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm breathes with scene tempo; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Figurative layer—“constellations onto skin,” “digital ghosts whisper in binary”—is patterned early and paid off at amber fractals, avoiding purple density. Opening line anchors stakes and atmosphere; closing line offers image-based resolution. One micro-scaffold: “the firmware’s dissonance—it’s not just noise” could condense, but it does not recur or dull closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Fusion of tattoo artistry, haunted code, and amber-insect fossil feels idiosyncratic; the specificity of “translates baby cries into silence” rescues the concept from generic techno-horror. Risk is quiet lyric rather than twist, but it commits fully—no retreat to action set-piece. Could edge higher if the mother–daughter link were not revealed via disembodied voice; still, the constellation/silence pairing offers fresh metaphoric charge.</comment>
