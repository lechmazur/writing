<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lirael’s quiet, almost monastic devotion is rendered with tactile reverence—knees in moss, silk between fingers—but her interiority cycles the same paraphrased credo (“transiently rooted,” “ephemeral monuments”) without ever dramizing a moment where that creed is truly tested or shaken. The moth wing stirs awe yet never becomes a crucible; her final “peace” is asserted more than paid for.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each silken knot layers loss and reverence until the lattice becomes a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) that accepts dissolution by morning. Orientation is immediate; the grotto anchors by word 30. Cost is visible—aching fingers, wind that will erase—but the monarch’s landing feels more serendipitous than causally earned; still, closure lands with felt fragility.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The grotto’s “spun-sugar mist” and “peach-lavender” dusk are filtered through Lirael’s esentric gaze, constraining her movements—knees sink, fingers numb—so environment participates directly in the ritual. Spatial choreography is flawless; no impossible positions. The lattice itself becomes micro-setting, its ephemerality charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—honoring overlooked deaths—remains abstract; no concrete consequence if she fails. Escalation is purely cadential (density of knots, darkening sky) rather than option-narrowing; monarch arrives unbidden, offering grace but no test of conviction. Cost is atmospheric (aching hands, impending rain) rather than tactical, keeping pressure legible but lightweight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges gently: overlooked lives deserve witness. Subtext resides in the lattice’s inevitable erasure, yet the story circles this insight three times in near-identical language (“honor the overlooked,” “bear witness to the transiently rooted”), muting resonance. Final image avoids sermon, letting moth-monarch conjunction speak, but earlier repetitions flirt with thematic echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, compressed, internally coherent—“mist curled like spun sugar,” “air tasted of dew and distant thunder”—with perceptual signature that favors synesthetic gustation. No head-hopping; psychic distance stable. Occasional elevated register (“esoteric realist,” “ephemeral monuments”) slightly overshoots POV lexicon under peak pressure but remains consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm breathes with task—long, silk-strand sentences alternate with clipped exhalations. High information density: one sentence can tether body, tool, light, emotional valence. Minor paraphrase loop on “overlooked histories” concept recurs three times; no mixed metaphors. No artifacts in closure beat; lattice dissolution image is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Fresh angle: using spider-silk architecture as ephemeral prayer for insects is specific and non-obvious. Monarch-moth pairing reweights scale of survival stories. Risk taken in quiet, non-causal closure under Accumulative lens; payoff succeeds but will polarize readers seeking overt stakes. Esoteric-realist label feels slightly grafted rather than organically discovered.</comment>
