<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lira’s “luminous skeptic” interiority is vivid—her refusal to surrender to silence is embodied in every scraped knuckle—yet the internal contradiction between doubt and belief is asserted more than dramatized in scene. The final smile is earned, but the absence of visible cost to her body or future options caps the score. No secondary character pressure to test her stance keeps the arc solitary and slightly under-cooked.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the marble’s clink ignites a city-wide re-inflation of memory, undeniable and legible. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each breadcrumb intensifies the stained glass box’s hum—culminating in the charged image of firefly-memories swirling. The Orientation Test is met within 120 words, and the final cost is the city’s own resurfaced grief; Lira’s empty box under her arm is the visible price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The fountains’ dry basins and rusted clocktower gears are tactile obstacles, not postcard scenery; the cracked drain Lira pries open literally blocks her path until she bleeds. Yet the environment never forces a tactical rethink—she always knows the next breadcrumb—so the setting supports mood more than choice. The violet bookmark reappears as a micro-setting inside the library, earning partial constraint credit.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—liberate the sealed memories—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens each time the box’s hum sharpens; the eighth breadcrumb’s absence forecloses the option to quit. Escalation is Accumulative: density of reclaimed objects reweights the stake until the marble triggers the roar. The cost is legible—Lira’s raw knuckles, the city’s tremor—but no persistent constraint shapes tactics after release.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the quiet cost of resurrecting the past: the city’s grief becomes breathable air. The stained glass box’s transparency at the end reconfigures meaning without moralizing. No abstract statement intrudes; the final image of firefly-memories supplies non-literal resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric-fabulist, stable in third-person close; perceptual signature—“fractured starlight” eyes, “sidereal certainty”—remains Lira-specific. Syntax modulates from long incantatory sentences to the staccato “She pried… clinked,” mirroring rising pressure. No dialogue, hence no convergence issue.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene needs; no template cadence or synonym loops. Occasional purple flecks—“ashen residue of a thousand unremembered dreams”—but density stays below the penalty threshold and never muddies the final image. Information density is high; each sentence layers sensory cue or action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The memory-fountain city feels freshly synthesized; the stained glass box as portable archive is a specific, non-generic magic. Breadcrumbs-as-archive-keys invert the usual quest trope by making nostalgia the antagonist. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulation rather than causal twists—yet the concept commits fully, and the final reconfiguration is inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
