<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrically specific (“pause before a star’s light reaches earth”), but contradictions are stated rather than dramatized; the decisive release is motivated by inherited maxims, not an on-page clash of impulses. Micro-choices (selecting the pitted shard, the scale test) are present yet feel pre-ordained by the mother’s voice-over rather than wrestled with. Still, the embodied patience of polishing and the refusal to keep the pearl give the arc credible renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each polishing stroke adds density until the pool mirror and sky-dissolve reweight meaning. The closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the pearl’s vanishing revalues “stillness” as shared transience—yet the cost (she now owns nothing) is implied rather than felt on the page. Transitions are lyric, not causal, so the slight drift is acceptable under this lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The grotto’s lichen pulses, the meteorite-iron tool hums, the sea-glass jar clicks—each micro-setting detail later constrains action (the jar’s etched constellations guide alignment at release). Mist and black water act as literal mirrors that enable the galaxy reflection, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays clean across kneel-polish-release moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Stakes—“share light without fire”—are declared early; pressure escalates only via sensory density (zephyr bloom, mirror clarity) rather than narrowing options. The scale test is a micro-turn that visualizes balance but does not foreclose an alternative path; releasing the pearl is chosen before any obstacle materializes. Cost is conceptual, not viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of stillness-as-transience emerges through iterated images (jar, pool, sky) that shift from containment to release; no explicit moral is stated. The mother’s “loan” note is the lone echo risk, but it is embedded in action (she literally lets the pearl go). Final image of rough shard in pocket quietly extends the cycle, inviting reflection without sentimentality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains a star-watcher’s perceptual signature: light is “weighed,” mist “curls like smoke,” galaxies swim in water. Syntax lengthens during polishing, then fragments at release, mirroring breath. No head-hopping; diction stays within Elara’s idiom—“zephyr bloom,” “meteorite iron”—without jarring elevation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lyric patterning (“light,” “stillness,” “pearl”) risks repetitive cadence but is justified by accumulative design. Mixed metaphors are avoided; “pearl of stillness” stays coherent because the text physically makes a pearl that stills water. Minor scaffold: “its surface” repeats three times in one sentence; does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The “gem polishing a beacon that needs no fire” is a fresh synthesis of alchemical eco-fantasy; the mother-daughter legacy trope is familiar but grounded in tactile procedure. Risk—releasing the perfected artifact—feels inevitable in hindsight, satisfying the transformation test.</comment>
