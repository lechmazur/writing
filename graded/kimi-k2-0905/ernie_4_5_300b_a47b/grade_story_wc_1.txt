<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lirael’s “steadily adaptive” trait is dramatized in the frost-reading crawl and the decision to etch panels instead of sellable wares; the link between glass craft and new cartographic purpose is shown, not told. Interiority stays concrete (“her fingers scraping against stone,” “shard warm against her thigh”) and avoids label-speak. The only drag is a late, slightly abstract leap from smuggler’s hobby to her life-purpose—cost is felt but could be sharper. Still, contradiction, micro-choice, and earned stance all click.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: “she’d craft…panels…teach others to read the frost” reweights her art and the ledger’s code; cost is the forfeiture of commercial safety. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of frost, shard, ledger builds to cadence shift. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no penalty. One minor causality fuzz: how frost patterns perfectly match burnt ledger lines is asserted not tested, but the lyric design teaches the method early enough to waive strict logistics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Canyon under starlight is sketched in three precise strokes yet keeps spatial coherence; micro-setting (glass shard, frost veins) acts as map and mirror, directly constraining her route and final craft plan. Sensory economy favors touch and temperature over visual glut, matching survival urgency. The shard’s projected hologram stretches plausibility but is seeded by “symbols glowed,” so world-rule consistency holds. Final image of frost-etched panels loops canyon frost into future studio, charging closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—find purpose after near-death—tightens when frost-reading forces a vocational pivot; pressure grows via each deciphered vein. No external antagonist, but internal void and environmental constriction supply coherent situational pressure. Escalation peaks at shard-hologram reveal; cost is surrender of lucrative glassware for ephemeral frost panels. Escalation is single-cycle but sufficient for 700-word scope; luck complicates (finding shard) yet does not resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from juxtaposing frost fragility and glass permanence—“meaning in the spaces between action”—without moralizing. Subtext lives in tactile gestures: melting frost = transience, heated glass shard = enduring testimony. Final reconfiguration reframes art as time-marker, not product; ambiguity lingers about whether anyone will value frost panels. No thematic echo penalty; the single proverb is Elias’s, not the narrator’s sermon.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains clean psychic distance; perceptual signature is glass artist’s—light, fracture, temperature—consistent throughout. Rhythm modulates: long clause for aurora vases, staccato for crawl through crevice. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk zero. Filter verbs (“she sensed”) are minimal and justified; diction stays within canyon-grade lexicon. Final sentence mirrors opening cadence, giving deliberate circular resonance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is image-dense yet propulsive; each paragraph advances knowledge or texture. Mixed metaphors avoided—“bowl of indigo,” “ancient ribs”—stay within canyon anatomy. No loops or scaffold; sentences vary in length and opening. One overwriting risk: three adjective stacks (“liquid swirls,” “fractured rainbows”) in a single beat, but compressed inside a summary, not a peak action beat, so penalty minor. Closing line lands cleanly with no artifact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Frost-as-map and glass-as-ledger are fresh syntheses; survival-via-artist-perception angle transcends standard “tracks in snow” trope. Specificity (charcoal strip “gnawed by time,” frost replicas) prevents swap with generic clues. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulative structure—but pattern taught early and closure repays it. No close echoes of famous canyon or heist scenes. Elias remains off-page, avoiding villain cliché; focus stays on Lirael’s reconfiguration, not genre twists.</comment>
