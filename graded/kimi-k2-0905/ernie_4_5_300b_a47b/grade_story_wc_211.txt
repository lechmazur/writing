<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elder Voss’s obsession with emotional archives is vivid, but his internal contradiction—preserver vs. prophet—stays verbal. The micro-choice to replay the shaving crystallizes stance, yet we are told rather than shown the bodily cost of that decision; the smile at the end feels unearned because no prior flaw is punished. Diagnostic label “皱纹” in parenthesis yanks us out of his POV lexicon.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>A coherent Accumulative/Textural lens: the replayed wax pattern intensifies meaning rather than changing external options. Closure lands as Charged Poise—“the leaves will scream” reweights the silence—but the cost is conceptual rather than viscerally felt on Voss. Orientation is clean inside 120 words; the third-grade flashback cue is concrete and pays off. One scaffold loop: “the garden seemed to hold its breath” repeats the prior “garden filled with the ghost” cadence without new charge.</comment>

<comment>The rooftop orchard is tactile: breath-fed roses, gnarled apple bark, phonograph horn pressed to trunk. Micro-setting succeeds—the wax shaving and phonograph cradle act as portable terrain that constrains the final replay. Skyscraper context is signaled early and stays consistent, anchoring time and altitude. Weather (bruise-purple twilight) mirrors mood without overt symbolism; spatial choreography remains clean as Voss moves from kneeling to standing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will Voss decode the prophecy before the city’s breath runs out—arrives with the foghorn silence. Pressure accumulates through sonic density: shriek + harmonic hum = tightening. No visible price is exacted on-page; Voss’s tactics do not change, only his interpretive stance. Still, the hum matching the horn’s absence is a legible pattern break that reweights meaning under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as “memory is audible prophecy” without sermonizing; the final image of stars through canopy answers the question of what the roots remember. Subtext operates in the unexplained shriek—terror held in the body of a tree. No tidy moral is offered; the city’s future scream remains pending. The emotional aftereffect is quiet dread rather than sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Voss; perceptual signature is botanist-acoustic—he hears creaks, frequencies, breath on bark. Old High Martian is seeded early and reprised at climax, giving rhythmic payoff. Syntax leans toward compression: “his皱纹 deepening” would be cleaner without parenthetical translation. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens from reflective kneeling to bone-resonant playback.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene needs—long sentence for twilight vista, staccato fragments during playback. Occasional scaffold: “the garden filled with the ghost of his voice… the garden seemed to hold its breath” repeats noun-verb frame without new information. Metaphor is controlled (“green thumbprint” is fresh; “velvet disquiet” is earned). No typos; tense stable. Information density high—each sentence advances memory, object, or stakes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fusing rooftop orchard, wax phonograph, and emotional archive yields a singular speculative snapshot. The accidental prophecy trope is inverted—prediction is retroactive listening, not future-telling. Third-grade field trip as time-loop key feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky bilingual insertion almost jars, but Old High Martian is acoustically motivated. Overall freshness comes from sonic archaeology rather than surface quirk.</comment>
