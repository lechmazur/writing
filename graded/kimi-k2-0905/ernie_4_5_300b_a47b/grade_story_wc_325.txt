<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lira’s claustrophobia and gold-obsession are viscerally anchored, but the brother motive is told in one flash; her decisive act (slapping the fleck) is abrupt, so the cost feels neat rather than earned. Interiority is concrete, yet the emotional turn is compressed into a single exhale before escape.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands: the gold reweights “invisible” to visible signal, paying conceptual cost. Drive is Accumulative: each sensory layer (rust, salt, hum, hologram) thickens until the map reconfigures memory. Orientation is clean by line 4; no causal breaks; the tide serves as rising density, not coincidence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Facility, staircase, chamber, pedestal—each tactile detail is filtered through Lira’s breath and lamp-beam, guiding her micro-moves. The rust-salt palate twins external decay with internal panic, charging the final hologram. Spatial choreography never slips; environment forces her crouch and hurry.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove the brother’s trace—tightens once: floodwater + hum → gold must be deployed now. Agency is present but the deployment beat is compressed; price (codex lost, facility falling) is shown more than felt. Still, the hologram blip narrows options to acknowledgement, satisfying lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</question><comment>Theme—memory etched in salt and cable—emerges through concrete spiral and blip, not sermon. The “unremembered” reprice is embodied when cables become memorial; no tidy moral, only resonance. Ambiguity lingers: is the blip soul or data? Complexity sustained.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person stays tight inside Lira’s perceptual filter; diction (“choke-on air,” “bubble rising”) is hers, not writerly. No head-hop; psychic distance compresses under water-rise. Rhythm accelerates with short clauses as panic peaks; no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lines are lean, high-density: “tasted of rust and salt, thick enough to choke on” does triple sense-work. No loops, no mixed metaphors; metaphor vehicles obey physics. Opening and closing images echo without repetition. Proofing clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Synthesis—claustrophobe + undersea cable + gold phase catalyst—feels fresh yet inevitable. Illuminant gold as memory catalyst is non-obvious; facility-as-memorial reweights tech relic into elegy. Risk is moderate; could push further into speculative mechanics.</comment>
