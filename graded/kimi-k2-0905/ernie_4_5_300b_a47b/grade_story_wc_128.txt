<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Clara's brittle numeromania and her sudden, unexamined pivot to altruism are rendered with sensory specificity ("heels crunching gravel," pulse quickening), but the interior contradiction between profit-minded broker and spontaneous Samaritan is asserted rather than dramatized in-scene; the final ledger entry feels more symbolic than costly because her professional stake is never pressure-tested on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Charged Poise: Clara’s ledger now literally displays “Profit, Unseen,” reweighting her commercial lens with conceptual cost; the causal chain (envelope→locket→Lila→forged letter) is linear and uninterrupted, though the early “whimsically attentive” ambiance is more decorative than functional to escalation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sea-salt air, domed library windows “like lighthouse eyes,” and the paper-scented breeze are selective, POV-filtered details that mirror Clara’s oscillation between hard numbers and soft humanitarian impulses; the locket photo ultimately charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate for object-as-setting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Clara’s reclaiming of her own compassion—tightens only once, when she forges the conductor’s letter; because her business never actually loses a client or dollar, the felt price is oblique rather than visible, keeping escalation just below the 7.0 threshold.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The “cycles of compassion” theme emerges organically via the envelope’s misdelivery and Lila’s origami boats, avoiding explicit moralizing; the final postcard reprises the cycle without tidiness, offering resonant ambiguity about who next will “notice.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person lyricism stays close to Clara’s perceptual filter—freight rates flicker behind concerto crescendos—while syntax flexes from clipped broker cadence to expansive maritime imagery; no head-hopping, consistent psychic distance, and the locket’s image reprises as a rhythmic echo in the final line.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is lean and musical (“salt-tinged air,” “encyclopedia tower wobbling in delight”), with only one mild loop (“the cycle had already begun to turn…” restated twice); no mixed metaphors, no filter-verb clusters, and the final sentence breathes in step with the ceiling fan’s cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The mistaken-address-triggered altruism refreshes the familiar “cold broker thawed” arc, but the conductor-forgery twist and the ledger column labeled “Profit, Unseen” supply a specific, non-obvious inflection that feels inevitable once the locket appears; risk is moderate, not boundary-breaking.</comment>
