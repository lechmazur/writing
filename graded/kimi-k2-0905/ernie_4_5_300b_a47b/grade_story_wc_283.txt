<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is concrete—her fingers tracing glass, breath catching—but the “quietly inspired” trait is asserted, not embodied. No contradictory impulse is dramatized; she glides from discovery to mastery without visible flaw or hesitation. The final stance is credible, yet the cost is only atmospheric, not personal or tactile.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the jar’s echo reweights prophecy into possibility, felt in the surging chorus. Causality holds—button-sorting ritual → deciphered message → stance shift—but the middle beat is summary, not scene. Accumulation lens is cleanly held; one micro-deepening is enough.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Selective sensory layering—amber light pulsing inside clouded glass, sawdust swallowing footfalls—anchors POV bias. The warehouse and jar function as micro-setting that charges the final image; cliffs outside re-echo the jar’s content. Spatial choreography is stable; no orientation drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Single stake—“spin prophecy into raw possibility”—is signaled early; tightening occurs when the echo resolves into audible counsel, foreclosing passive interpretation. Price is conceptual rather than visceral; options narrow only in thought, not in tactical resource. Agency is present but friction-free.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: history as malleable material, futures planted not inherited. The button motif returns as taxonomy of lost voices, reweighted when Mara accepts the canyon’s counsel. Final image avoids moralizing; resonance is atmospheric rather than ethically complex.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited sustains perceptual signature—“her fingers tracing the cool glass,” “her skirts pooling”—syntax flexes with breathy cadence under pressure. No dialogue, hence no voice contamination. Filter verbs are minimal; diction stays inside Mara’s lexicon of relic and ritual.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong rhythmic control—“wooden beams groaning like ancient bones,” “a mouth ready to swallow secrets”—figurative muddle is avoided. One scaffold loop: “half-remembered tales and half-formed theories” restates the same axis. Density is high; no line dents the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Premise—“canyon echo in a jar”—is fresh, transformed through tactile relic detail rather than abstract magic. Button-sorting as code-breaking feels idiosyncratic, earned by thematic linkage to fragmented voices. Risk is moderate; concept stays internally coherent without retreat.</comment>
