<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lirael’s interior contradiction—archive loyalty vs. truth—surfaces early and drives the chamber release, but the moment of risking everything is narrated rather than embodied; Kael remains a thawed symbol whose only micro-choice is to stand up, so the dyad’s status shift is declared, not dramatized. “Bravely conflicted heart” is label-speak repeated without new bodily cost after the first mention, flattening escalation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Causal chain—letter → awaken Kael → truth escapes—holds and lands a Resonant Reconfiguration: the final image of two silhouettes in the snow-lit archive crystallizes options with undeniable social cost. Orientation is clean by line 3; the single transition (chamber opening) is legible; escalation tightens once when Lirael sacrifices her safe archivist role, but the Council threat is still abstract, so the cost feels prospective rather than paid on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The “echoing library under snow” is more than postcard: the frost that blooms under Lirael’s palm, the whirring gears in frozen air, and the glass fog that times Kael’s revival all tether choice to environment. The cryo-chamber itself functions as micro-setting/tool hybrid, constraining the sole decisive action—its control panel slot is the only path to revolt—so the final image is charged by this object-state change.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth vs. silencing—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightens when Lirael inserts the letter, foreclosing her archivist neutrality. Agency is present but the price (immediate exposure, job loss, arrest) is inferred, not witnessed; the tightening changes knowledge (Kael awake) more than lived options, keeping cost conceptual rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—knowledge preservation is meaningless without integrity—emerges through the archive metaphor and the act of thawing censored history, avoiding overt thesis. Subtext in the silent hand-off of the letter carries the real vow, but the closing “revolution began” edges into thematic echo, slightly flattening resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Lirael with perceptual signature—ice as blooming crystal, library breath, heartbeat drum—creating rhythmic texture. Compression in “within the blink that follows surprise” is taught early; no head-hopping; however, occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing” territory) nudges register drift under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm, varied sentence openings, and high information density: each sentence advances image or stakes. One paraphrase loop (“the truth would thaw / the truth was out”) and two “the Council would” hypotheticals dock 0.3; no mixed metaphors; final line propels without scaffold. Figurative language is selective and pays off in the charged poise of the last image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Frozen-archive-as-rebel-trigger is fresh, and the cryogenic archivist occupation is particularized through tactile procedure rather than label. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, but the broader rebel-network frame and council-erasure premise echo standard dystopian templates without new world logic, capping originality short of the 8+ band.</comment>
