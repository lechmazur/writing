<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Clara’s curator eye is shown in one micro-choice—pocketing the locket—but never tested again; her interiority is generic (“mind already racing”) and the final tears feel performed rather than embodied. No contradictory impulse or visible cost attaches to her discovery, so the “earned” closure is soft.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Causal chain is straightforward—find locket → gather stories → guess combo → open mailbox—but every turn depends on off-stage lore told in summary rather than dramatized pressure. The ending lands a Conceptual Repricing (unfinished 1943 letter), yet the cost is historical, not personal, so the lens tilts Accumulative rather than Causal at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><question>7.2</question><comment>Courtyard dawn is vividly evoked (“damp earth and old paper,” “green and gold” cobblestones) and the mailbox’s texture constrains Clara’s tactics; the locket doubles as micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial tracking stays clean across the single scene, meeting the 9+ gate for object-as-setting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Stakes are declared (solve the mailbox) but never tighten—no clock, no rival, no risk of failure—so escalation is purely informational. The single “reversal” is the combo guess, which is luck-based, not agency-driven, keeping pressure modest and cost conceptual rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Theme of listening-as-healing emerges organically through the neighborhood vignettes and the unfinished soldier’s letter, avoiding overt moralizing. The final image reweights the locket from clue to relic of lost love, delivering quiet resonance without tidy thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Narrative voice maintains calm, antiquarian diction suited to a curator (“discerning,” “relic,” “testament”) and modulates subtly at the tearful reveal. No dialogue means no voice distinction test; free indirect style stays clean and POV remains stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is lean and rhythmic, with only one scaffold loop (“the mailbox… the mailbox”) and no mixed metaphors; sensory detail is selective, not showy. Information density is high—each neighbor’s sentence both world-builds and advances the lore—earning the high-band slot.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Premise (wartime love-letters in thrift courtyard) is familiar, but the curator-observer frame and the locket-as-key inflection feel fresh enough. Risk is modest—no structural experiment—yet specificity of the 1943 photograph and the unfinished sentence lifts it above template.</comment>
