<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elias’s curiosity about the trees is stated repeatedly but never dramatized; he never makes a micro-choice that risks anything or changes tactics because of that desire. His interiority is atmospheric (“he wondered… he believed…”) rather than conflicted under pressure. The healing cut is the only embodied cost, but it is passive—moonlight acts on him, not vice-versa—so the renunciation/stance feels lightly earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the final image of glowing roots reweights the premise that sorrow is legible and transmutable. Causal chain is thin—why dismantling the sextant cracks the wall is never grounded—but the accumulative pattern (storm → moon → map → roots) coheres under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is clean by line 10; no debt. Setup ambiguity about “quantified sorrow” lingers but is taught through action and paid off in the final reprise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The tower, sextant-cogs, and moonlight form a micro-setting triad that actively constrains every beat: damp stone channels sound, brass gears decide wall-geometry, moon phase enables healing. Sensory hierarchy is profession-filtered (stone temperature, gear resistance, static taste). Spatial choreography is flawless: Elias kneels, stands, steps through a shimmer-wall that was earlier solid. Final image of anthropomorphic roots crystallizes the sorrow-sponge rule without exposition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“can sorrow be converted into usable knowledge?”—is signaled early and deepened when the sextant re-assembles into a dream-map. One meaningful tightening: the pin-drop re-occurs, forcing Elias to pocket the map and step through the newly permeable wall; option space narrows from “sketch more” to “enter now.” Cost is conceptual (he crosses a boundary he cannot reseal) rather than visceral, but is legible on the page. Pressure plateaus rather than spikes; no credible loss or tool-break escalates tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through iterated images of fractured light, cracked brass, and splitting stone: damage is the necessary aperture for knowledge. Subtext stays in gesture—Elias pockets the broken sextant pieces instead of discarding them—implying acceptance of incompleteness. Final line (“mundane miracle”) risks mild didactic echo, but is saved by its placement inside an earned visual beat (roots glowing with remembered grief). No tidy moral; ambiguity lingers about whether the trees’ witnessing alleviates or perpetuates sorrow.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-limited voice is stable, with a perceptual signature attuned to maintenance detail: “damp stone wall,” “brass gears creaked,” “skin knitting itself.” Syntax lengthens in calmer beats, fragments during pin-drop junctures, mirroring attentional pulse. No dialogue, so voice carries all subtext; succeeds. Filter verbs (“he felt”) are sparse and justified by tactile profession. Register stays within a quiet laborer’s lexicon; no academic drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense: “lightning flashing…like a celestial heartbeat” does double duty as meteorology and metaphor. No loops, no scaffold; each sentence advances knowledge or texture. Only micro-slip: “quantified sorrow” is abstractly named twice before it is dramatized; a −0.2 hesitation. Final clause “unfolding with every step” is a touch template-earnest, but does not occlude the resonant closing image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Fantasy tropes—labyrinth, moon-healing, dream-cartography—are re-engineered through manual labor granularity: a janitor literally unscrews grief-gears. Fresh inflection: sorrow as calibratable mechanical error. Sextant-to-dream-map gambit feels inevitable in hindsight yet non-obvious at setup. Risk is moderate; payoff clean. Could edge higher if the sorrow-math rule were more concretely specified earlier.</comment>
