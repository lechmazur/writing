<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lirael’s pacifism is stated, never pressure-tested; no contradiction or cost attaches to it. Interiority is evocative but drifts toward abstraction (“catalog the varieties of silence”). The final empathy insight is earned by resonance, not by a visible choice that costs her anything on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the diary snaps shut, reweighting silence from barrier to bridge; cost is felt in the image of Lirael walking away from forced speech into listening. Causal chain (hum → resonance → click) is thin but holds under Accumulative lens; fireworks cadence deepens the pattern. Orientation is clean by line 5.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Workshop micro-setting supplies the tuning-fork rig that physically unlocks the diary—constraint directly shapes tactics. Sensory triad (cold metal, solder smell, distant boom) is selective and POV-filtered. Starlight on the closed diary at the end recharges the opening image, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode silence—tightens once: the clasp’s refusal forces the frequency experiment. No secondary pressure or price is visible; success feels low-risk. Escalation is textural (density of fireworks + hum) rather than causal, adequate for Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges via the diary’s revealed sentence: silence as “presence of everything unsaid.” Final reprise of fireworks-light on the diary reweights the motif without moralizing. Subtext is quiet but coherent; ambiguity lingers in Lirael’s unspoken next act.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature is tactile-tinkerer (“coils of wire, soldering iron”). Rhythm modulates with tension—short clauses during click, longer reflective cadence after. No head-hop or register drift; lyric compression is consistent and taught early.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is clean, no loops or scaffold; figurative language is spare and purposeful. Occasional elevated phrasing (“static of unspoken things”) stays within Lirael’s literate POV. High information density; every paragraph advances image or stakes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Acoustic lock-picking via tuning fork is a fresh, low-tech twist on the heirloom puzzle. Silence-as-language is familiar, but the oscilloscope-to-diary rig particularizes it. Risk is modest; concept stays fully committed. Could swap setting to modern lab with minor edits, keeping score sub-9.</comment>
