<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Lila’s insomnia and painter identity are declared early, but the canvas never dictates her tactical choices; the portrait’s eyes are painted only after Mr. Voss arrives, so the “insomniac painter” trait never alters her agency. The “methodically hopeful” label is asserted (“cataloging kindnesses like fossils”) yet never forces a visible trade-off or error under pressure. Interiority drifts into lyrical summary (“daydreams sparked”) rather than embodied contradiction, so motivation feels performed, not tested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a gentle Resonant Reconfiguration—Mr. Voss recognizes his mother’s worry in the painted eyes, giving Lila a new linguistic path—but the moment is coincidence-driven (he walks in) rather than caused by her prior choices, so the causal spine wobbles. The “lost language” stake is announced but never narrows her options on-page; she doesn’t fail or adapt because of it. Orientation is clear, yet the lens toggles between accumulative lyric and situational coincidence without teaching a pattern, so the tightening feels soft.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>The rooftop greenhouse is concretely anchored (“glass-domed sanctuary, ferns dripped dew”) and its door-creak admits Mr. Voss, so the micro-setting doubles as plot hinge. Smog versus verdant interior creates a usable tension that mirrors Lila’s hope/burnout duality. Sensory layering is selective—charcoal on beret, chamomile scent—avoiding tourist-catalog clutter while constraining her refuge and final invitation to teach.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prove kindness lingers—remains abstract; no tangible risk or ticking clock raises the cost of failure. The only tightening is Mr. Voss’s arrival, a coincidental gift rather than an earned narrowing. Because the lost-language device never blocks or enables a concrete tactic, pressure stays atmospheric, not tactical; visible price is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: language as vessel for remembered kindness. The final image (“To love is to translate”) reweights prior motifs without sermonizing. Subtext lives in gesture—brush passed hand-to-hand—avoiding explicit thesis, though the saffron-quiet tone is named in prompt-language once, a minor echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Lyrical third-person hovers close to Lila’s perception; diction (“defiant lips,” “saffron quiet”) is textured and consistent. Filter verbs are minimal; moonlight and smog are perceived through body and tool. Dialogue is sparse but natural; Mr. Voss’s rasp differentiates his voice. Internal register never exceeds painter-insomniac lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is vivid yet leans on decorative metaphor strings (“orchids bloomed like defiant lips,” “brush…fanned like a starfish”) that slightly dilute climax beats. No template cadence or synonym loops, but density of figurative language in final third holds the piece below 7.0. Sentence rhythm varies, paragraph cuts are clean; small tightenings would lift propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade>
<comment>Synthesis of smog-city greenhouse with resurrecting lost language via portraiture feels fresh; combination is specific to this tale. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulation rather than causal plot—yet payoff is coherent. Could swap names without breaking armature, so transformation is partial, not inevitable.</comment>
