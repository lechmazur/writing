<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara’s warmly inquisitive nature is stated early and drives her to open the diary, but the trait never complicates her path or costs her anything; it remains a label rather than a crucible. Her decision to hand the goggles and diary to the widow is the only visible act that alters the relational state, yet the interior motive is asserted, not dramatized through contradictory impulses. The moment of pressing her hand to the widow’s chest gestures toward embodied emotion, but the beat is too compressed to register cost or irreversible change. Interiority stays coherent, but the absence of a stakes-bearing mistake or loss keeps the characterization short of high-band resonance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The causal chain is legible: diary discovery → goggles vision → symbol translation → shared recognition with widow. Orientation anchors (who=Mara, where=elevator ascending icebound spire, when=captain’s post-crash aftermath) arrive before the 120-word mark, averting the orientation penalty. Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the final image of Mara stepping out to “find the flame” reconfigures the stake from servant discretion to active truth-seeker, with the diary as persistent constraint. Cost is present but oblique—loss of servant anonymity is implied, not felt—keeping the story just shy of 8+ territory.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The icebound spire is evoked through tactile detail—frosted glass, grinding gears, pale gold scattered light—rather than postcard vistas. The goggles function as micro-setting: their cracked lenses refract hidden ice-veins, literally changing what Mara can see and therefore choose. Spatial choreography is clean; diary, goggles, and widow are tracked without continuity drift. Environment never pressures her body (cold, breath, hazard) on-page, so the setting informs but does not constrain choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether Mara will read, conceal, or share the captain’s truth—is signaled by diary discovery at 30% mark and tightens once when she translates the symbol through the goggles. The act of handing both objects to the widow forfeits the option to remain invisible, producing a visible trade-off. Escalation is single-step rather than deepening; no further complication tests her new stance. Cost is present but light—loss of secrecy—keeping the score solid mid-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of “joy beneath anguish” emerges through the phoenix symbol and the widow’s cracked-laughter moment, avoiding explicit moral. Subtext resides in the goggles’ cracked lenses—damage as the price of clearer sight. The ending image of Mara ascending toward an unlit flame offers a non-literal answer: pursuit, not possession. No late thematic statement intrudes; resonance is built from particulars, though the conceptual cost could be sharper.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person close stays locked to Mara; perceptual signature is consistent—clouds thin to “wisps,” dust “sparkles like starlight.” Syntax flexes with pressure: short sentences during diary drop, longer lyrical cadence for symbol translation. No head-hopping or register drift; widow’s dialogue is distinct in its brittle riddles. Filter verbs are minimal; immediacy holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is evocative yet disciplined: “gears grinding like a tired heart” carries character and world in one stroke. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; sentence lengths modulate naturally. Mixed metaphors are absent; “joy beneath anguish is a flame no ice can smother” remains coherent within story logic. Occasional overwriting—“soul that frayed at the edges”—is minor and does not touch closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Frozen-sky gothic is familiar, but the goggles-as-lens that reveal hidden ice-maps feels fresh and specific. The encrypted diary whose symbols literally “unfold” under scattered refracted light converts exposition into sensory beat. Risk is taken in keeping Mara’s ascent unfinished—no flame found yet—without collapsing tension. Synthesis of servant POV with metaphysical treasure hunt gives the tale a memorable tilt.</comment>
