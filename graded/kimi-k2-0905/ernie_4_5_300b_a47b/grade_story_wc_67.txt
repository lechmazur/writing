<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lira’s interior contradiction—needing the mask to erase self while chasing an emotion she refuses to name—lands early and powers every beat. The porcelain mask’s bite into her skin at the end is a crisp embodied cost, earning her renunciation of completion. Without another on-page character exerting status pressure, the relationship crucible is absent, but her self-to-mask dynamic supplies sufficient tension. The final micro-choice—leaving the portrait unfinished—grows logically from the established trait of deliberate omission.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the gallery exhales, the portrait blurs, and Lira exits with ash-glitter hands—undeniable conceptual cost under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is intact because her decision to stop is the direct result of the gallery’s long-taught ephemerality. Orientation is secure within 120 words. The piece does not tighten a second time; one meaningful deepening is acceptable at this length, so escalation is adequate, not exceptional.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The vanishing-point architecture—walls that “resent permanence”—is more than backdrop; it dictates Lira’s tactic of deliberate incompleteness. The powder, mask, and rocking chair operate as micro-settings that constrain every gesture. Sensory selection stays tight: charcoal grit under fingernails, porcelain edges biting skin. Environment never described for its own sake; each detail reweights the central stake of transience.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can art trap a vanishing emotion?—is signaled in paragraph two and never drifts. Pressure escalates once: Lira realizes the portrait must stay unfinished to let the viewer complete the feeling, narrowing her options from finish to forego. Cost is conceptual but legible: she forfeits the comfort of completion and leaves the gallery’s uncertainty unmasked. No second reversal is attempted; at 740 words, one meaningful tightening satisfies scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: permanence is impossible, so omission becomes the only honest art. The ash portrait’s deliberate gaps reprice the premise—truth resides in what is withheld. No moralizing line summarises this; the final image of glittering ash on her hands reweights all prior detail. Complexity is preserved: the gallery’s oblivion is both terror and necessity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person lyric maintains a consistent perceptual signature: every noun is filtered through Lira’s tactile obsession with erasure and residue. Rhythm accelerates during powder-sprinkling, then lengthens into the final exhale, miracing the story’s cadence shift. No dialogue means no voice-convergence risk. Prose texture is distinctive yet controlled—no purple drift, no filter-verb bloat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is musical without mechanical patterning; sentence openings vary, paragraphs breathe. Information density is high—each sentence does double duty (e.g., “powder is her medium, but also her method”). One paraphrase-loop appears—“the mirage of safety lingered, but she knows better. Safety is an illusion”—costing −0.2. Mixed metaphor count zero; no register drift. Clean copy, no typos.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The “gallery that erases its own art” is a fresh container for the familiar artist-versus-ephemerality conflict. Ash as pigment and metaphor synthesizes medium and meaning in one stroke. Risk is moderate: elliptical structure and lyric compression taught early, paid off at closure. While the core question isn’t unprecedented, the specific sensory grammar—porcelain mask bite, ash glitter on skin—makes the execution feel particular rather than borrowed.</comment>
