<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira’s guardedness is shown through tactile detail (bark-rough hands, thorn-walled heart) and a single micro-choice—releasing the seed—that externalizes her need to confront the buried memory. The interior contradiction is present but compressed; the blood-stained past is revealed more by vision than by pressured in-scene decision, so the final acceptance feels lightly earned rather than crucible-forged.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the vortex stills, the seed dims, and Mira lifts a now-inert reminder of the cost she’s willing to carry—an image that reweights her self-concept. Causal chain holds: failed ritual → enters vortex → seed retrieves memory → she breathes spores → orchard quiets. Orientation is anchored within 120 words; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Orchard-vortex is rendered through motion—twisting dancers, clawing branches, ozone stink—filtered by Mira’s druidic perception. The seed’s micro-setting (pulse, hunger, final dimming) constrains her tactic of release and later serves as the charged talisman she pockets, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—face the hidden violence—tightens once: vision of self-defense killing shifts guilt to acknowledged burden. Pressure escalates under causal lens (each spin of vortex narrows escape options) and peaks when spores force recognition; cost is the permanent carrying of an inert yet accusatory seed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of mirrored self-deception emerges through the seed’s hunger for truth rather than flesh; no explicit thesis is stated. Final image—keeping the spent seed—reconfigures the moral weight: darkness is not expunged but owned. Ambiguity is present yet coherent; no late moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Mira’s storm-cloud sensorium; syntax lengthens during vortex spin, then shortens at recognition, mirroring disorientation. No head-hopping; diction remains within druidic lexicon (ozone, spores, bark-rough). Distinct perceptual signature holds under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies, sentences carry double duty (action + sensory filter), and no scaffold loops intrude until a minor template cadence (“She had...” x2) mid-vortex. Metaphors stay coherent; mixed vehicle of “warlike serenity” is flagged but fits the tonal brief. Closure image is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Flesh-eating seed repurposed as truth-diviner feels fresh; orchard-vortex merges two normally separate fantasy topoi into one kinetic space. The self-defense memory reframes the “cursed lake” trope without exoticizing. Risk is moderate but successful; not ground-breaking yet specific enough to avoid template echo.</comment>
