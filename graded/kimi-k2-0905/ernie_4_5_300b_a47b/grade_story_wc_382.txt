<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias’s occupation as “dead-language tutor” is more label than lived; the interiority is generic (“his breath caught”) and no contradictory impulse acts in scene. The woman’s nimble patience is asserted, never embodied under pressure. The final choice to speak to the building is causally thin—no prior flaw or cost makes the refusal or assent meaningful.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the seal’s glow and the answering voice reconfigure stakes with felt cost. Causal chain is present—lie agreed → seal placed → voice answers—yet the middle tightening is summary (“the library shuddered”) rather than dramatized beat. Orientation is clean by 120 wds; lens holds as Causal throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Rooftop garden and library dome are vividly anchored—wisteria, dust raining from rafters—creating tactile constraint. The meteor shower is more postcard than choice-driver, never altering tactics. Seal as micro-setting qualifies: its glow and weight guide the final gesture, charging closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“will the building wake?”—is clear early. One tightening beat: seal placed, blue glow, voice answers; cost is implied not visceral. Agency is present yet off-stage; the actual price (what the voice will demand) is deferred, softening escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of language as living, deceptive pact emerges through the seal and the agreed lies, never sermonized. Final image reweights the premise: buildings speak back, lies now insufficient. Ambiguity is purposeful; no tidy moral asserted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays stable; perceptual signature is modest but consistent—Elias notices “groans and creaks.” Prose rhythm varies; occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”) feels writerly rather than character-bound. Dialogue is sparse yet distinct when present; subtext carries in silence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is clean, sentences varied. No loops or scaffold; one mixed metaphor—“engravings shifting like liquid”—but clarity intact. Information density is high; each sentence advances. Minor register drift into abstract nouns (“conceptual repricing”) keeps it from top band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—buildings speak a forgotten language awakened by lies and meteor shower—feels fresh, not derivative. Synthesis of architecture-as-language and agreed-upon deception is specific to this piece. Risk in quiet, non-human antagonist pays off with resonant closure.</comment>
