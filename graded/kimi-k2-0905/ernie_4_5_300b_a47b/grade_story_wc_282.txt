<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is concrete—her gloved fingers, the pulse under her skin—but the epiphany “I was no longer just…” is a touch diagnostic. The fossil’s crumbling to dust supplies visible cost, yet the renunciation of her old mapper identity is asserted rather than dramatized in a micro-choice under pressure. Still, embodied emotions and a coherent arc lift her into strong territory.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the leaf’s dissolution reweights Lira’s vocation and the world’s memory economy. Causality is sound—each mapper reading drives the next—but the “because” hinge between golden spores entering her skin and her instant vocational rebirth is slightly under-motivated. Accumulation lens holds; the tightening beat is the gold spore uptake that forecloses mere cartography.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Coastal cave is vivid—damp sand, salt gust, bioluminescent vial—yet the heat-mapper and pendant-sized tech remain concept sketches rather than tactile constraints. The cave’s tidal breath guides her path upward, so environment charges the exit image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Selective sensory layering keeps momentum.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes—map the unknown vs. remain a physical cartographer—are signaled early; the golden spore beat narrows her future with visible cost. Escalation is single-wave but sufficient for 700-word scope; the final image makes the trade-off legible. Pressure stays coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-continuance emerges from the leaf’s palimpsest of emotions rather than exposition. Final image of her walking toward “the light, her mapper humming” reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext in gesture (crumbling dust) keeps sentimentality at bay; slight deduction for thematic echo in “the unknown had found its voice.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct—“after-humans-hibernate” coinage, salt-laden gusts felt at skin level—held in tight third. No head-hopping; psychic distance cleanly compresses under spore storm. Occasional cadence drift (“she’d been a living thing, then stone, and now…”) is minor.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet breathable; sentences vary in length and openers. Few scaffold phrases; “the leaf had witnessed…” recap is strategic. Mixed metaphor risk in “ocean’s breath replaced the absent bustle” stays within legibility. No artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The emotional-mapping tech fused with a fossilized leaf feels fresh; post-hibernation coastal cave is a non-obvious arena. Transformation turns on a golden spore reprise rather than a generic awakening, making the synthesis feel inevitable in hindsight. Risk of lyric overwrite is present but controlled.</comment>
