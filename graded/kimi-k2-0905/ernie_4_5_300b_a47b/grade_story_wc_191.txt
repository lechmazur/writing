<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is concrete—spectacles, ruby flake, murmur—yet the “wisely adventurous” label is asserted not dramatized; the final self-recognition is earned but the bones-of-failures mural is skimmed, reducing felt cost. Still, her micro-choice to question, not fight, crystallizes values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: shard-in-wall triggers stair, mural sequence maps path, question disarms guardian; closure (CR) reweights throne as mirror with visible cost—stair collapses, legacy claimed by standing, not sitting. Orientation anchored by word 60; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Bioluminescent pears, ozone scent, frost grass—selective, POV-filtered; orchard’s constellation-shadows constrain navigation and hide murals. Ruby flake as micro-setting recharges final image when it becomes pendant. No exposition dumps; spatial choreography clean across waterfall veil and hollow tree.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“claim throne before sunrise”—tightens when stair flickers and collapses behind her; visible price paid (no return, throne refused). Guardian’s demand for truth, not blood, forces stance crystallization; escalation driven by her agency under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges: legacy is self-recognition, not possession. Subtext in guardian’s fading laugh and pendant-as-mirror reframes ancestry without moralizing. Final image reweights prior murals; avoids tidy thesis. Slight abstraction in “story to write” line nudges sentiment but resonance lands.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Lira’s idiom—”kaleidoscopic waterfall,” “ozone and elderberries”—syntax mirrors scholar-careful mind. No head-hopping; psychic distance compresses under ascent stress. Guardian voice distinct, mechanical echo. Filter verbs minimal; diction controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence lengths contract during ascent. No loops or synonym churn. Occasional modifier stacks (“hologram trapped in time”) flirt with purple but serve tone. Strong verbs, concrete nouns. One participle opener flagged but action sequence clear. Closure image clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Familiar quest scaffold (oracle→guardian→throne) refreshed by mural-peel mechanic and throne-as-mirror inversion. Bioluminescent orchard, ruby flake pendant particularize. Risk: luminous fruit could read whimsical but grounded via ozone scent, bone-litter stairs. Synthesis feels inevitable after close.</comment>
