<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is sharp—her risk calculus, sensory memory of the ink, and hierarchy of values (asylum > truth > pride) all surface in micro-choices. The “honest child of a con” contradiction is shown, not labeled, when she tastes the ink she once only smuggled. Cost is visible: she trades the scroll she worships for papers that still leave her fugitive. Yet the agents’ flat villainy and Mr. Harrow’s sudden capitulation blunt relational pressure, keeping the score below the 8+ gate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: ink pot → mind-reading → leverage → asylum papers; each beat narrows options. Closure is a Decisive Change: she exits with documents and a new public identity as negotiator, father alive but forever hidden—felt cost legible in the emptied pot. Orientation is anchored by word 80; no penalty. One minor causality squeak: agents accept her telepathic claim without verification beat, but it doesn’t rupture the lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The prep room’s lilies/linen/casket layout is sketched with economy and re-used: casket hides her, dummy body shocks agents, ink pot sits on the same mahogany surface she crouched against. Micro-setting (the pot’s false bottom) literally constrains the final exchange. Sensory range is narrow—mostly visual—but selective attention fits a child spy under siege. Enough to pass the 9- gate but no environmental turn charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“keep the math from them and stay alive”—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when guns level. The ink taste beat turns the conflict: she gains leverage, foreclosing the agents’ seizure option. Price is on-page: surrendering the scroll she once guarded with her life. Escalation is single-cycle but sufficient for 700-word frame; agents’ capitulation is abrupt, clipping the top band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme—“truth as negotiable commodity versus moral math”—emerges through con-artist patter versus Elara’s refusal to lie once stakes turn lethal. Subtext lives in the color shifts of the ink: violet danger → gold clarity → clear exhaustion, reweighting “fair trade” as personal cost, not slogan. No final moralizing; the ending image of empty pot + asylum papers lets irony linger. Lacks a deeper social resonance to breach 8.8.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-limited stays welded to Elara’s perceptual filter: synesthetic ink colors, metronome footfalls, metallic taste = consistent signature. Rhythm compresses under guns: short declaratives, parataxis. Dialogue is sparse but differentiated: agents’ clipped threats vs Harrow’s mortician formality. No head-hop; psychic distance tightens appropriately. Voice doesn’t yet achieve the idiosyncratic music that lifts into 9+ territory.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—action + sensory cue—without scaffold. Strong verbs (“unscrewed,” “spun,” “traded”) dominate; adjectives rare. One paraphrase loop: “agents exchanged a glance… exchanged a glance” in adjacent clauses (−0.2). No mixed metaphors; ink color logic stays coherent. Clean copy, clear sequence, prop tracking intact. Artifact-free enough for 8+ but micro-repetition blocks 9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fusing con-artist family drama with economic-whistleblower stakes through a mood-ring ink pot is fresh; the “fair-trade math” concept reframes a familiar MacGuffin. Risk: telepathy-via-chemistry skirts hand-wavium, but the piece owns the rule early and pays it off. Specificity of funeral-home con, child negotiator, and color-coded mind-reading prevents template drift. Not radically avant-garde, yet the synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
