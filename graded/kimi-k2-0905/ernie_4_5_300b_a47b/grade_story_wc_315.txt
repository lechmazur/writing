<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Kael’s grief-linked vigilance and tactile “listening” give him a sharp, embodied signature; the buckle-as-key feels lived-in. Yet the interior contradiction—yearning for mother vs duty—is stated more than dramatized in-scene, and the final “smile” lands tidy, muting cost. Still, micro-choices (node presses, binary clicks) track motive cleanly and earn the spiral fix.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: static crack → pattern rupture → buckle ritual → spiral re-alignment → deeper node. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the arbor’s steady glow re-weights “trust” from burden to language, with the cost of perpetual vigilance now felt. Orientation anchors (who/where) arrive by line 3; no lens ambiguity. One paraphrase loop (“keep watching… keep revising…”) slightly dulls final cadence but doesn’t break causality.</comment>

<comment>Bioluminescent veins, holographic fractals, and cloud-sea silver are selective, sensory, and filtered through Kael’s professional gaze. The buckle doubles as micro-setting, constraining every node interaction; spatial choreography stays clean as he kneels, presses, moves deeper. Environment directly shapes tactics—wrong symmetry demands tactile revision—charging the final steady glow. One minor over-adjective moment (“liquid silver”) but image still propels.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“arbor unravels, city falls”—is signaled early and tethered to lunar deadline. Mid-scene tightening occurs when the first node shudders and projects jagged fractals, forcing Kael’s binary click choice; each stabilized node forecloses rest, visible sweat the price. Escalation is linear, not recursive, but agency drives every shift under causal lens. Cost accumulates physically and psychically, setting up the earned vigilance of closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of inherited trust-as-language emerges through tactile pattern-fixing rather than exposition. Subtext lives in the buckle’s warmth and the mother’s single static word, re-weighted when Kael smiles at dawn. Final image avoids moralizing, offering quiet covenant instead. A hair more complexity—doubt flicker or temptation to flee—could deepen resonance, but ambiguity remains coherent.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Kael’s perceptual filter: “soundless echo,” “listen with hands.” Syntax lengthens under calm, shortens during node crisis, mirroring pulse. No dialogue, so voice carries all; diction stays within plausible lexicon of a lone technician. One near-repeat stem (“keep… keep…”) slightly flattens cadence but doesn’t break texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Strong verb-noun pairings (“boughs shimmered,” “node pulsed”) and varied sentence rhythm propel read-aloud flow. Figurative language is sparse and coherent; no mixed metaphors. One scaffold loop (“keep watching… keep revising…”) and one paraphrase pair (“forest spoke… he’d finally learned to speak it”) slightly dull density but occur outside peak closure beat. Otherwise crisp, clean, and typo-free.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Floating arboreal IT-department is fresh, yet grounded in tactile parachute tech and maternal legacy. Transformation test fails if Kael were any generic guardian, but buckle-as-binary-key and muscle-memory code give specific spine. Risk lies in quiet climax—glow not explosion—but coherence justifies choice. No trope fatigue; detail feels discovered, not assembled.</comment>
