<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lirael’s contradictory impulses—“charmed skeptic” who hoards pain yet yearns for release—are embodied in every micro-choice: pressing the shell to earth, arranging the circle, letting sparks burn without flinching. The final stance crystallizes credibly: she walks away lighter not because pain is erased but because she has weaponized it into independence. The “tragically radiant” label is shown, not told, via the garden’s mirrored gaze and her own willed incandescence. Only the mother-abandonment flashback edges toward diagnostic summary, blunting full urgency. Cost is visible: the garden reduced to ash, her shadow a wraith she outgrows.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each shell fragment layers resonance until the cadence shift at dawn collapses the garden into ash. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the glowing constellations on her skin—whose cost is the garden’s death and her irrevocable renunciation of archived sorrow. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“velvet garden at twilight”) and never drifts. Causality is interior but legible: isolation transmuted into autonomy through literalized resonance. The final “I’ll come back” reprises the mother’s broken promise, now stolen from the universe, a conceptual repricing that sticks.</comment>

<comment>The velvet garden is no postcard: petals shed color, thorns draw blood, shadows pool like ink—each detail constrains her tactile ritual. The seashell halves function as micro-setting, their vibration guiding the resonance that dismantles the garden itself. Twilight-to-dawn progression is tracked by star fade and light flood, anchoring time without exposition. Spatial choreography is clean: center circle, kneeling to standing, path exit—every move alters the environment she leaves ashen.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—translate isolation into independence—tightens when each shell fragment adds resonance pressure, culminating in the garden’s ash price. The single meaningful deepening occurs at the memory spark landing: past pain becomes fuel, foreclosing retreat. No external antagonist is needed; internal conflict is the engine. Cost is visible on her glowing skin and in the ruined garden; tactics (circle ritual) are shaped by the resonance rule taught early.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges without sermon: archival pain repurposed into self-generated light. The shell-whisper motif reweights from nostalgic trap to alchemical tool. Final image of her walking toward an “ordinary and unyielding” world re-prices the earlier mother promise, now owned. Ambiguity lingers: radiance remains tragic, but autonomy is real. Only the phrase “quarantined memory” flirts with thematic echo, a hairline slip.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Lirael’s perceptual filter: “petals as soft as mourning veils” is her metaphysics, not authorial flourish. Syntax flexes with pressure—short clauses at spark burn, longer cadences at dawn reflection. No dialogue, so voice purity is unbroken. Register remains consistently elevated, justified by the garden’s fairy-tale frame. Minor template cadence in “She’d… she’d…” but absorbed by incantatory rhythm.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty: sensory detail plus emotional algebra. Metaphors stay physically coherent (ink-shadows, watercolor edges). No synonym loops; “shell,” “garden,” “radiance” recur with shifting charge. Opening and closing lines frame voice and stake cleanly. One mixed metaphor—“memory trying to claw its way free”—is minor; claws fit shells only obliquely, but the urgency merits tolerance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Familiar trauma-to-light arc is re-angled through resonance physics and botanical collapse, making the garden itself the crucible. “Quarantined memory” literalized as contagious spark feels fresh. The shell circle ritual marries quarantine tech with mystic cadence, avoiding generic magic key. Risk is moderate but coherent: lyric interiority plus speculative botany. Could swap mother abandonment for any loss, so specificity caps short of 9.</comment>
