<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is concrete—her breath fogging the dial, the pencil snagging—showing a copyist’s tactile precision. The “dust remembers” motive is embodied in frantic transcription and the rare fragile smile, not declared. The only slack is the father memory: delivered as summary rather than sensual flash, so the sailor lore feels inherited, not earned. Still, her final step into the gravel carries earned stasis: she chooses to keep listening, cloak warm with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each lyric fragment layers density until the final halo reweights the stake. Orientation is swift—alcove, cliff, ashen plains by line 4; no penalty. Closure is a Charged Poise: the merging glow crystallizes her role as “ghost bard” while the plains stay vast and silent; cost is the lifetime vigil she accepts. Persistent constraint—static will always fade—shapes every dial turn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Micro-setting rules: the radio dial’s blue circle and the moss veins are tools that constrain posture and sight; she must lean, squint, write. Mist and gravel are filtered through a copyist’s ear—she notices “iron and memory” taste, not visual panorama. Spatial choreography clean: cloak pools, boots crunch, gravel tracks. Final image of plains reuses “ashes” but re-prices it: now a stage for her future piracy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—retrieve the next story fragment—tightens when the dirge appears; options narrow to “chase or lose.” No external antagonist; pressure is signal entropy, legible under accumulative lens. One credible loss: the broadcast fades, leaving only scrap; this alters tomorrow’s tactic (ledger entry). Cost is visible: trembling fingers, smile won then swallowed by static.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from motif inversion: dust once silent now “sings,” yet the ending refuses triumph—she walks into silence again. No moralizing; the final smile is image, not thesis. Subtext in gesture: cloak slipping unnoticed = self-erasure required by her vow. Complexity preserved: resurrection of stories does not promise return of listeners.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is specific to a score-copyist: she “transcribes frayed edges,” hears “static-laced frequencies,” sees moss as “secretly luminous” staff lines. Rhythm modulates—long clauses for lull, staccato fragments when signal spikes. No head-hop; single POV stable. Diction stays within her lexicon; no filter-verb stacks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High density: “ember alcove where mist curled like smoke from forgotten hearths” fuses setting, temperature, and history in one stroke. No synonym loops; each metaphor extends the music/wave motif. Sentence rhythm breathes with signal rise and fall. Only hairline slip: “thistled calm” is novel but context teaches the image by closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fusion of pirate radio + orchestra copyist feels inevitable yet unseen before. The “elusive song lyrics” decryption method is fresh: sheet-music literacy applied to static. Risk in quiet ending pays off: no story told, only promise, aligning theme with form. Transformation test fails if Lira were any other profession; her calloused ear is integral.</comment>
