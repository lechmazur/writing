<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lirael’s habit of walking backwards and reading tea-leaf geometries are vivid, embodied quirks that align with her mirrored, fate-divining role; her interiority stays concrete, never sliding into label-speak. The contradictory impulse—to guide others while fearing her own reflection—remains latent but implied rather than dramatized in-scene, so the internal conflict never spikes under visible pressure. Her choice to mentor the girl is soft; the cost is atmospheric rather than a palpable path foreclosed. Still, voice-specific gestures (back-steps, shard pocketing) individualize her above archetype.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The causal spine is intact: drought plea → tea divination → “walk backwards” prescription → village girl’s resolve, each beat logically pressing the next. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the trapped shard-shadow stretching implies exile’s reversal without declaring victory, a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost. Orientation anchors who/where by line 3; no debt. The mild softness is that the girl’s final yes feels slightly convenient—no new obstacle or price is extracted on-page—so the tightening is more symbolic than tactical.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Library, ivy, cracked roof, dust, and the playground swing creak all filter through Lirael’s hush-tuned senses; every sensory pick is selective and mood-governing. The “shard of amber sunlight trapped between two panes” acts as micro-setting that later re-weights the ending image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays clean as Lirael retreats backwards and pours tea; no floating bodies. The world rules hold throughout—no sudden magical physics—so atmosphere serves the situational pressure without breaking credibility.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>The dominant stake—the village’s survival—arrives with the girl’s breathless entrance and immediately tightens Lirael’s quiet exile into potential action. One meaningful deepening: the tea-leaf constellation forces Lirael to translate abstract fate into a concrete, backwards-walking ritual, trading her detachment for involvement. Cost is legible but diffuse: the stretching shadow suggests Lirael will soon face her own reflection, yet that price is projected, not yet felt. Under the accumulative/textural lens, the pressure accrues through symbolic density rather than escalating obstacles, which suffices at this scale.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Reversible exile emerges organically through Lirael’s mentorship, tea-reading, and the girl’s mirrored quest rather than thesis statements. No final-paragraph moralizing; the theme stays implicit in the stretching shadow. Subtextual tension lingers: guidance may demand the guide confront what she most evades. The ambiguity—will reversal truly redeem or merely exchange one peril for another—invites reflection without forcing a tidy answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lirael’s perceptual signature is sharp: “stone walls draped in ivy that shivered,” “damp parchment and old wood,” her nervous backwards gait—syntax mirrors her reflective, hesitant mind. No dialogue clutter; the girl’s two spoken lines carry trembling urgency and subtext of desperation. Psychic distance tightens perfectly: wide atmospheric opening narrows to tea-cup minutiae, then re-widens to the shadow’s release. Voice stays consistent, lyric yet transparent, with no register drift or filter-verb fog.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Sentence rhythm breathes with scene pace: longer, sense-rich clauses early, then shorter beats as tea leaves shift and stakes crystallize. Figurative language is sparse and precise—“map of some forgotten realm”—never stacking vehicles. No loops or scaffold; each line advances knowledge, image, or emotional charge. Opening and final lines frame and echo via the shadow motif, delivering textural specificity without purple overlay.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The shard-mirror archivist who divines fate in teacups while fearing her own reflection is a fresh synthesis of seer-tropes, grounded in sensory specifics rather than gimmick. Reversible exile as preservation-not-punishment flips the usual banishment tale, and backward walking literalizes retreat into forward progress. None of the turns feel borrowed; the girl’s drought plea, the tea-geometry lesson, and the stretching shadow all grow from established story logic. Risk is present but modest; bolder formal daring could have pushed higher.</comment>
