<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Lira’s interior contradiction—ambition vs. the hush—drives every beat; her olfactory micro-choices visibly constrain tactics. The seed-scent shifts are embodied, not labelled. The final renunciation (patience over push) is earned by prior causal tests and carries felt cost in the village’s re-calibrated energy. Only the grandmother dream feels slightly convenient, not dramatized.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of scent-notes → doodle cadence → bloom image tightens stakes through density, not causal reversals. Closure is Charged Poise: the flower’s scent reconfigures village hierarchy with undeniable social cost—elders humbled, children laughing. Orientation is clean by line 6; no prop or knowledge teleport. Dream beat is brief, anchored, and paid off in altered tactic.</comment>

<comment>Treetop walkways, lantern light on leaves, and soil acidity tests are tactile, lived-in, and filter through Lira’s professional nose. The seed’s evolving musk acts as micro-setting that literally guides her next micro-move; same for the bark journal whose margins swell/relax with her pressure. Spatial choreography is flawless: we never lose track of seed, pot, Lira’s body, crowd. Final image of glowing maroon petals against twilight is the charged object that reweights all prior scent cues.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—harmonize village energy—signaled in paragraph 3; tightening occurs when Lira abandons coercion for “wildflower hush,” a conscious forfeiture of control that risks lifelong ridicule. Cost is legible: elders’ scorn, her own fraying doodles, the one-time bloom stakes. No external antagonist needed; internal ambition vs. stillness supplies coherent pressure. Could wish for one sharper material loss (tool, time, social credit) to push战术 recalibration onto the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from iterated scent-to-silence pattern: wisdom grows in receptive stillness, not mastery. Subtext resides in the margins—doodles spiral from jagged to fluid—showing stance change without naming it. Final elder admission (“chaos and serenity are kin”) is the closest to stated thesis, but occurs in dialogue whose social cost is dramatized, so survives. Avoids moralizing; resonance lingers in the bloom’s smell rather than a maxim.</answer>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Lira’s perceptual signature: every line carries olfactory bias or doodle tension. Rhythm swells and contracts with her pulse—long sentences when she over-tends, clipped fragments at crack of shell. No head-hopping; elder skepticism is filtered through her dread. Diction (“olfactorily sensitive,” “wildflower hush”) is idiosyncratic yet internally consistent and pattern-taught early.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, lyrical, and propulsive; every sentence twins sensory duty with causal feed (“metallic tang → adds water”). No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Opening line anchors voice and stakes instantly; final line crystallizes image without exposition. Occasional adjective pairs (“pungent, earthy scent”) risk mild purple but always serve Lira’s professional nose, so forgiven.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh angle: aromatherapy as community politics, conveyed through marginal doodles and seed scent. Treetop village + corpse flower is inherently vivid, yet story roots wonder in patience rather than spectacle. Transformation test fails—swap seed for rare orchid and story still works—so capped shy of 9. Still, the olfactory-doodle synthesis feels specific to this narrator and lingers afterward.</comment>
