<comment>Marlow’s interiority is vivid—chisel-calloused hands, lantern flicker in his chest—yet his contradictory impulse (to speak grief vs. to carve it) is declared rather than dramatized in-scene. The final poem is earned, but the prior silence is summarized, so the cost feels literary rather than lived. Voice remains consistent, gravestone craft is textured, but secondary pressure is absent; no one else on stage to force a status shift.</comment>

<comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens is declared early (“quiet electricity…alive”) and held: each return deepens pattern—ribbon colors, butterfly shadows, ancestral poems—until the last line reweights grief as door, not hole. Closure is a Charged Poise: the lantern flares/dims, ribbon is rolled, flight pattern lingers in bones—felt cost is legible without exposition. Transitions are seamless; orientation anchored by word 50. No causal reversals are needed; density and cadence do the tightening.</comment>

<comment>Greenhouse glass, damp earth, and butterfly shadows are not backdrop but instruments: the rattling panes echo chest-cavity, lantern glow refracts through ribbon dyes, final image of vanished flight imprints bone. Micro-setting rule satisfied: the ribbon and lantern constrain choices—colors decide when to speak, light limits where he stands. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: a carver notices texture against wool, not botanical names. Spatial choreography stays clean across nightly returns.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—“discover the shape of collective grief”—is signaled in para 1 and tightens through each ancestral layer; the butterflies’ departure forecloses the option to keep listening to the voice, forcing the poem aloud. Agency is attention/renunciation rather than external battle; cost is the shift from listener to speaker, ribbon faded but kept. No coincidence resolves; migration timing is thematic pressure, not plot device. One meaningful deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from concrete recurrence: ribbon dyes = bruise colors, butterfly swirl = ink swirl, carved stone = spoken poem. No explicit moral; final image of “door” reweights prior “hole” imagery without preaching. Subtext in silence: the absence of living kin beside him makes the greenhouse itself mourner. Minor softness: “grief is a bridge” is voiced by disembodied mentor—close to thematic echo, but buffered by prior pattern.</comment>

<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is consistent grave-carver: weight of ribbon against wool, lantern glow as breath in ribs, flight pattern as chisel swirl. Syntax tightens toward closure—final poem line uses em-dash and caesura mimicking stone breaks. No dialogue, so voice never leaks. Filter verbs (“felt,” “thought”) are sparse and character-apt. Register stays artisanal, never academic; “ thundering calm” coined oxymoron taught early and paid off.</comment>

<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “glass panes began to rattle—a low, thundering calm that vibrated in his chest” compresses sound, space, emotion in one stroke. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Paragraph cuts are surgical; removing any nightly return would break pattern accumulation. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line crystallizes image. Minor overworlding in “restless spirits” metaphor, but forgiven under lyric permission.</comment>

<comment>Fresh synthesis: gravestone craft + spectral poetry archive + butterfly phenology yields a grief taxonomy not seen before. Risk of disembodied voice is taken and paid off—greenhouse becomes mentor, not gimmick. Particulars irreversible: ribbon dyed with twilight hues, epitaph carved while pregnant, butterfly shadows as living embers. Emotional truth overrides surface novelty; the concept commits fully without late rule change.</comment>
