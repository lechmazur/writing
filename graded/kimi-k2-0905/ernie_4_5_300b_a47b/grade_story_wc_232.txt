<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Lila’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her glasses-squint, the chip’s weight in her palm, the heartbeat-water-drip sync. Contradictory impulses (skepticism vs. longing) co-exist in-scene, not in summary. The final renunciation—choosing the lived shop over the portal—is credibly rooted in the father-garden vision, so the cost is felt; still, the flaw-compounding promised by the rubric is only lightly present.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Causal chain holds: map → ants → chip → doorway → mirroring choice. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by line 3; no penalty. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the garden vision re-weights “home” and the chip becomes a pocketed talisman of self-charting. Cost is visible in the final image—she smiles at dusty shelves that now feel chosen, not escaped.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sensory selection stays POV-tight: wire-rimmed glare, fungi flicker, obsidian pedestal. The cavern’s vaulted dark mirrors her internal vault of memory; creek murmur is both literal and emotional echo. The chip-as-micro-setting constrains the final choice: touching it activates the vision that dissolves the portal’s escape lure. Spatial choreography is clean—no impossible moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will she exit her life or re-enter it?—is signaled early. One tightening: the doorway appears only after she touches the chip, forcing a stay-or-leave fork. Cost is her forfeiture of the portal’s infinite possibility, paid on-page: “the chip cold in her hand.” Agency drives the turn; coincidence (ants) complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme—maps as externalized self-portraits—emerges through image, not thesis: the antique shop dust becomes the final “territory” she charts. Subtext in the father line, “You’re just following the ants,” reframes obedience as autonomy. No moralizing; the smile is image-only. The spiral motif re-weights from trap to compass without overt statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-limited stays locked to Lila; no head-hop. Perceptual signature is bibliophile-tactile: paper “brittle as dried leaves,” chip “pitted with tiny molds.” Syntax tightens under stress—single-clause beats when the doorway wavers. No dialogue to distort voice. Free indirect cleanly handles the father’s remembered speech without quotes.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or causation. Figurative density is high yet purposeful—“stalactites dripped like frozen tears”—and matches cathedral scale. No mixed metaphors. Opening and closing lines are propulsive: first anchors stakes, last recharges ants/spiral. Rhythm breathes—long sentence for cavern reveal, fragment for “Empirically intuitive.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Familiar portal-setup is inverted: the escape hatch dissolves into a mandate to stay. Ant-as-guide trope is re-wired from Pandora to personal cartography. The type-matrix chip—obsolete print tech—becomes memory’s punch-key; specificity rescues the gimmick. Final image of smiling at dusty shelves feels fresh because the portal genuinely offered exit velocity yet was refused.</comment>
