<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elio’s interior contradiction—yearning for exile yet aching for direction—remains embodied in trembling ink and fist-around-compass. The grandmother visitation externalizes his split, but her dialogue drifts into prompt-speak (“Confusion is just exploration’s first draft”), blunting the emotional edge. Closure earns a credible renunciation: he steps through an unmapped door, compass hot, confusion now accepted as engine—cost legible, choice his.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the spiral corridor, warming compass, and deliberate step reconfigure “true north” from fixed bearing to motion itself—felt cost is the surrender of certainty. Causal chain holds: dilation glitch → grandmother coordinate → compass re-alignment → Elio’s choice to walk. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) arrives by line 3; no penalty. One shard, single POV, within scope.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Frosted glass warping constellations, meteorite-ink quill, and vibrating gold filaments concretize the dilation field; the compass rose micro-setting constrains the final choice—its heat tells him when to move. Sensory hierarchy skews visual but justifies POV’s astronomer lineage. Spatial choreography clean: railing, staircase, junction tracked. Environment mirrors internal stretch without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><grade>Stakes—ethical exile vs. need for orientation—tighten when the compass points to a past coordinate, forcing Elio to decide whether to follow. Escalation is single-cycle but sufficient: glimpse prolongs, grandmother re-weights “north,” corridor demands action. Cost is surrender of analytical certainty; agency is the step into nonsensical path. No antagonist needed; pressure is temporal-philosophical.</grade>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme—confusion as legitimate compass—emerges through image spiral, ink smear, and final step rather than statement. Grandmother’s aphorism still flirts with Echo but is offset by embodied reprise: the same deck, now walked in reverse, re-priced as freedom. Ambiguity lingers: is the corridor real or dilated mind-space? Resonance earned via concrete particulars, not sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains astronomer-philosopher diction—constellations “warp like syrup,” compass “quivers toward something.” Rhythm accelerates in final paragraph, short clauses matching decisive step. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk zero. Filter verbs minimal; perception stays body-anchored. One micro distance shift during glimpse is taught by italics-like inversion of stars, paid off immediately.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies: long liquid opener mirrors syrup-time, staccato final lines mimic heartbeat choice. Figurative language sparse and purposeful; no mixed-metaphor clutter. One paraphrase loop—“true north wasn’t a direction… true north wasn’t a place”—is intentional thematic reprise, not scaffold. Clean grammar, meteorite-ink specificity, zero typos. Closure line breathes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Time-dilation deck as exile chamber feels fresh; compass rose applique re-purposed from décor to oracle avoids gadget cliché. Grandmother hologram risks trope but is saved by POV uncertainty—may be memory bleed, not ghost. Synthesis: ethics-of-physics plus familial star-mapping yields non-obvious emotional vector. Final corridor could be any liminal space, slightly generic, preventing higher band.</comment>
