<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lira’s grief-linked vocation and precognitive burden give her a sharp interior contradiction; the “listen, don’t solve” renunciation is earned. Yet the eels remain symbolic scenery—never once bite, slip, or tax her body—so the occupational crucible feels theoretical, not lived. Still, her micro-choices (theta rock, Möbius reordering) visibly track a hierarchy of values under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the obsidian heart-rock dims the dust, eels weave a sigil, and Lira’s stance flips from solver to witness—cost is the foregone certainty of control. Causal chain (rock sequences → dust pulses → pattern visibility) holds; the borrowed-dawn lens stays accumulative/textural and pays off in the final image. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by line 5; no ambiguity at end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aurora colors, frictionless water, and damp boots create an immediate tactile world; the vial of star dust functions as micro-setting that literally constrains every tactical adjustment. Spatial choreography is flawless—rocks click, eel arcs, shadows lengthen—everything tracks. The bluff’s still tide and bruise-purple sky charge the final sigil-image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“restore the sacred order or lose the eels forever”—is signaled early and tightens when the storm-vision threatens total erasure. One meaningful deepening: reordering into Möbius strip narrows options by trading certainty for witness-stance; the price (permanent precognitive ambiguity) is felt on the last line. Agency is continuous; coincidence never rescues.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: pattern as living language versus pattern as code to crack. Subtext lives in gesture—each rock placement is a silent question to the sea. Final image reframes the mother’s promise without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: is the storm truly averted or merely postponed? Complexity honored.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Lira’s sensorium; perceptual signature favors geometric metaphors and color frequencies that feel native to an eel-herder who sees in fractals. Rhythm modulates—short clauses under auroral flare, longer reflective cadences during rock math—without losing control. No dialogue, so voice distinction clause waived.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical; sentences multi-task (action + atmosphere + math reference) without scaffold. One mixed-metaphor risk—“star dust screamed”—but the personification is brief and pattern-consistent. No loops, no filler; paragraph cuts are clean. High-band ear-test passes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Premise fuses ecological fantasy with mathematical mysticism in a way that feels specific, not checklist. Frictionless tide is more than gimmick—it enables the entire eel-language crisis. Risky second-person aurora personification pays off by closure. Could not swap eels, dust, or Fibonacci for generic equivalents without collapsing the story.</comment>
