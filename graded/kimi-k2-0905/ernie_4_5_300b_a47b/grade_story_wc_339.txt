<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara’s obsession with “quantum decay” as grief-metaphor is vivid, but her interior contradictions stay verbal (“physics of letting go” repeated) rather than acted upon under pressure; no micro-choice shows her risking failure or forfeiture. The mother-globe memory motivates the search, yet the climactic realization feels transferred from tape analysis rather than earned by her own tested gamble. Competent, but the emotional cost is asserted, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the 440 Hz hum reweights the snow globe from keepsake to transmission device, giving “letting go” a new physical meaning—felt cost is the acceptance that memory is an orbit, not a grave. Causal chain holds: tape loop → tuning fork → globe motor → redefinition; pressure tightens once via scientific confirmation rather than escalating stakes. Orientation is clean by line 3; no lens ambiguity. Minor slip: “quantum communication” exposition is asserted, not demonstrated, slightly blunting causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Salt-crusted aviation manual, rusted spools, and 440 Hz fork create tactile micro-setting that constrains discovery; the flooded library functions more as atmospheric mausoleum than active obstacle. Sensory hierarchy skews visual; pressure narrows attention selectively but never uses, say, taste of rust or pressure pop in ears to embody risk. Sufficient specificity to serve concept, yet environment never endangers or limits Elara’s next move, keeping it below high-band charge.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is epistemic: can Elara convert decay into continuity? One tightening occurs when hum=fork=globe proves intentional transmission, shifting her goal from explanation to participation. Stakes stay intellectual; no concrete resource (air supply, funding, reputation) is risked, so cost is conceptual rather than felt. Escalation is singular but coherent under Accumulative lens; suffices for length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme—memory as persistent waveform—emerges through iterative hum imagery rather than dictation; the final “shake the globe to feel resonance in bones” offers non-literal answer to “physics of letting go.” Subtextual tension between closure (accepting orbit) and clinging (keeping globe) remains understated and plausible. Avoids moralizing, but late “quantum communication” phrase edges toward thesis statement, trimming top band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s analytical filter; perceptual signature favors mechanical metaphors (wavefunction, decay, tuning fork). Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for scholarly awe, crisp fragments at discovery beat—“Her breath caught.” No head-hopping; diction stays within physicist lexicon except one “therapy-speak” slip: “quiet, analytic ache” is abstract label. Mostly controlled, distinct voice; minor register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Prose is clean, no scaffold loops or paraphrase churn. Metaphors stay coherent (storm-in-glass = ionospheric loop). Information density strong: single sentences couple salt, date, and emotional freight. However, three consecutive sentences open with “She” in paragraph 4, creating template cadence; also, “physics of letting go” repeated four times approaches mantra artifact. These micro-patterns dull final third, preventing 7+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fusing Earhart mystery with quantum-memory conceit is fresh; using 440 Hz A-note as bridge between globe, fork, and ionosphere is elegant, specific, and inevitable in hindsight. Risk taken—lyric scientific fabulism—pays off in final image without gimmickry. Could swap sunken library for any relic site, slight freshness dip, but conceptual synthesis remains memorable.</comment>
