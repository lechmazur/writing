<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lira’s interior contradiction—scholarly detachment vs. insurgent ambition—peaks when she chooses renunciation, but the leap from coffee-stain prophecy to throne-usurpation is asserted more than dramatized; no single micro-choice shows the exact hinge where ambition flips to refusal, so the cost is felt only atmospherically, not through a visible, character-bound forfeiture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the violin shatters into stardust while the empire remains unseized, reweighting her stance with undeniable conceptual cost; however, the causal chain from “propagate” to dismantling the dream is compressed into lyric shorthand, forcing the reader to infer rather than witness the decisive internal break.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The velvet observatory, midsummer heat, and the ice-crystal violin form a micro-setting triad that literally melts under her touch, constraining her final decision (she cannot play the violin without destroying it); the garden window view supplies the visual counter-future she chooses, grounding renunciation in a concrete, sensual image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Perforated destiny is signaled early and tightens through each snapped string—every break drills a new hole in her possible futures; the final image transfers that perforation to the violin itself, paying the felt cost on-page, yet the pressure escalates more atmospherically than through a single irreversible act.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from competing propagation metaphors—botanical, musical, imperial—culminating in a quiet refusal that reconfigures power as absence; the mulberry ache remains unspoken, letting the shattered violin reprice the idea of destiny without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lira’s perceptual signature—scientific precision braided with vegetal telepathy—creates a sinuous, synesthetic diction (“ice crystal thirsty for meaning”) that modulates under pressure; no head-hopping, no register drift, though occasional abstraction (“perforated destiny”) edges toward lyric shorthand.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is generally fluid, but metaphor density clusters in the first third (“velvet observatory…liquid moonlight…mulberry ache”) before the pattern is taught; no mixed vehicles, yet a few scaffold phrases (“a thousand unspoken secrets…a thousand years old”) mildly dilute propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The ice-crystal violin that fractures reality, telepathy with plants, and coffee-stain divination synthesize into a fresh mythic logic; the central trope of “propagate” is literally botanic, musical, and political, making the fusion feel inevitable rather than ornamental.</comment>
