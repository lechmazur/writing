<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s “ache of understanding” and the bleeding hands give us embodied cost, but the interior contradiction—preaching anti-progress while chasing a mechanical grail—stays asserted, not dramatized in a single decisive beat. Mara’s presence supplies external pressure, yet her stance flips from scorn to semi-attendance without a visible micro-choice that changes the relational state. The final image of continued digging is credible endurance, but the emotional turn feels incremental rather than foreclosed by prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the cog-needle assemblage reweights “time is layered” and the sewer drip/gear hum crystallizes options with conceptual cost. Causality holds under an Accumulative lens: each sedimentary find thickens thematic density until the final cadence shift. The Orientation Test is waived—disorientation (who/when above ground) is taught early and pays off in the closing heartbeat image. One scaffold sentence (“His hands bled, his back ached, but he didn’t stop”) is tolerated because it does not touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The brass cog’s tidal etchings and the algae-choked canteen are tactile, POV-filtered, and return to charge the final astrolabe image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography remains clean across the dig site; the moldy tomes and flickering lamp constrain Elias’s squat and shape his stance. The “sunken city” macro-setting is sketched with postcard breadth, but the micro-setting of sediment layers and sewer acoustics does the causal work, so the broader vagueness is acceptable at this length.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—preserve ancient navigation vs. Mara’s sell-it pragmatism—is signaled in the first 150 words and tightens once: Mara’s “Prove it” narrows Elias’s options to dig or concede. The price (bloody palms, backache) is visible and alters tactics—he keeps scraping despite pain. Under Accumulative lens the deepening of artifact density reweights the stake; coincidence is absent. A second tightening beat would push this into the 8.5+ band, but the single intensification is sufficient for 600–800 words.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme—“memory as sedimentary survival against efficiency”—emerges through concrete finds (hairpin, compass needle) rather than slogans. The final gear-hum reprises the opening “trapped heartbeat,” reweighting meaning without moralizing. Subtext in Mara’s stayed silence after “It’s just rust” hints at reluctant curiosity, giving the reader interpretive space. One near-echo of the prompt (“competing narratives”) is spoken by Elias but is embedded in argument, so the Thematic Echo penalty is minimal.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly welded to Elias’s diction—“putrid perfume,” “algae-choked water”—with perceptual signature of philosopher-scavenger. No head-hopping; Mara’s interior is accessed only through her gravel-tin laugh and body language. Rhythm modulates: longer hypotactic sentences for rants, clipped fragments under physical strain. The elevated register of “unmediated truth” is justified by Elias’s self-mythologizing persona and does not drift into authorial intrusion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Strong information density: one sentence often performs atmosphere, character, and world (“The brass gear…hummed…like a trapped heartbeat”). One paraphrase loop is flagged (“His hands bled, his back ached, but he didn’t stop”). Metaphors stay coherent—gear as heartbeat, sediment as memory—without mixed vehicles. Occasional adjective stacking (“abrasive calm, a razor wrapped in silk”) is purposeful and pattern-taught, so the overwriting check is waived.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>The post-plague drowned-city sewer-philosopher is fresh, and the chronometer-cog-as-astrolabe offers a non-obvious synthesis of maritime tech and urban archaeology. Risk is present—philosophical scavenger arguing with a single skeptic—yet the plot arc is a linear dig rather than a structural gamble. The “layered time” insight feels inevitable in hindsight, satisfying the transformation test. A more daring formal compression or nonlinear shard pattern could have pushed this into the 8.5+ band.</comment>
