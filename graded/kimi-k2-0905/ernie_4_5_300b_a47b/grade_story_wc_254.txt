<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lirael’s aesthetic obsession is vivid—her fingers “reading frost,” her voice “paraphrasing the wind.” Yet the promised interior contradiction (craving dissolution yet clinging to beauty) is asserted, not dramatized; she never risks failure or moral cost. The final step onto liquid glass should crystallize a value hierarchy, but reads as triumphant fait accompli rather than earned renunciation. No micro-choice visibly forecloses an alternative path, so the “tremor of certainty” feels given, not paid for.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: Lirael stands on liquid glass, the world “ours to reshape,” cost hinted but not felt. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of crystals, quartz song, lake breathing—yet the decisive intensification (stepping onto water) is gifted by the setting, not driven by prior paraphrase failures or sacrifices. Orientation clean within 120 words; no lens ambiguity. However, the absence of a visible price at the final beat keeps this below 8.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The cobalt atrium is not backdrop but instrument: quartz veins sing under temperature shift, ice dust becomes aura, lake surface offers footing. Each environmental detail is returned to with altered function, constraining the final step. Sensory hierarchy skews visual, but the humming and creak widen the palette. Spatial choreography remains precise; no floating rooms.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—dissolve boundaries between sacred/profane—signaled early; pressure escalates via sensory density rather than narrowing options. The lake’s parting is spectacular but imposed by world, not triggered by a failed attempt or visible trade-off from Lirael. No credible loss (time, tool, social credit) alters tactics. Escalation reads as tableau intensification, not option foreclosure; cost legible but not felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of permeable boundaries emerges through recurring images—ice to air, stone to song, poet to world—avoiding explicit thesis. Final image reweights earlier quartz humming without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: is transcendence liberation or solipsism? Subtext operates in silences and texture; no thematic echo pronouncements. Could use one sharper counter-reading inflection to reach 8+.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: “cloud-shadow poet” notices light fractures, silent echoes, lantern-moth hush. Diction stays within lyric register, syntax elongates under wonder, compresses at threshold. No head-hopping; POV stable. Occasional elevated Latinate phrases (“dissolution of boundaries”) risk register drift, but the voice earns them through sustained incantatory rhythm. Read-aloud cadence is controlled; no algorithmic pattern.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; most sentences advance image or pressure. Figurative layering is high but coherent—quartz as vein, song, threshold—so no metaphor muddle penalty. Minor scaffold: “the world feels both older and newer” abstracts a beat already shown. Filter verbs minimal; rhythmic variation supports breath. Closure line clean; no artifact touches final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Frozen-lake poet transcending ban is familiar lyric template, but the quartz colonnade as living instrument and the paraphrase-as-ritual mechanic give fresh angle. Stakes stay internal-aesthetic rather than world-saving, resisting inflation. Specificity of “lantern-moth hush” and “cloud-shadow” distinguishes from generic ice-poet tale. Risk taken in quiet triumph rather than catastrophe; transformation feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
