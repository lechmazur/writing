<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lira’s calm authority and Jorin’s tentative curiosity are cleanly drawn through gesture and dialogue, but both remain archetypal “guides” without contradictory interior texture. The punch-passing ritual hints at history yet never complicates either guide’s motives under pressure. Jorin’s final brightness feels more conferred than earned; we witness no micro-choice that visibly costs him. Relationship stays mentor/acolyte throughout, so the crucible never tightens.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the punch left on stone crystallizes the vigil’s endless循环 with felt cost—no destination, only return. Accumulative lens holds: the repeated stamping, vanishing paths, and ticket litter build density until the final image reweights “courage” as river, not lake. Orientation is clear by 120 words; ridgeway rules are taught through action. The only causal gap: why the first leash break authorizes the vigil is asserted, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ridgeway’s shimmery disorientation is anchored in salt-iron scent, gravel crunch, and dock stone—details filtered through ferry-guide habit. Micro-setting works: the ticket punch’s worn star and the mossy stone where it’s finally placed constrain the choice to keep serving. Spatial choreography stays clean across the walk-and-return. One slip: “sky dipped low enough to touch” drifts toward generic wonder rather than sensory specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding “unused courage” in others—stays abstract; pressure is situational (paths vanish, stamped tickets multiply) rather than personal. Escalation is accumulative: each stamped ticket thickens the vigil’s burden, but no single turn forces the guides to risk or forfeit anything they want. Cost is diffused across anonymous travelers; the guides pay only perpetual watchfulness, which feels more lyric inevitability than felt price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—courage as circulating river—emerges through the ticket-stamp imagery rather than explicit sermon. Final image of the abandoned punch quietly reweights the premise: service is endless, victory impossible. Subtext in silence: “shoreline lullaby” hum carries both comfort and entrapment. One near-platitude: “learning to see the stars in the dark” could be crisper, but it is embedded in embodied scene, not tacked-on moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Narrative voice maintains lyric distance, syntax relaxed yet rhythmic: “paths coiling beneath a bruised twilight sky” reads like incantation. Perceptual signature is ferry-guide sensory hierarchy—salt, iron, gravel, stamp-ink—never tourist-catalogue. Dialogue is sparse; when it appears, Lira’s diction is shoreline proverb, Jorin’s slightly plainer, consistent with apprentice status. No head-hopping; free-indirect stays cleanly anchored to Jorin by end.</answer>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</question><comment>Prose breathes: sentence lengths vary, paragraph cuts land on image or choice. No scaffold loops; only one paraphrase pair (“twilight deepened, wrapping them in a silence that felt like home”) but it serves cadence, not padding. Metaphors stay coherent—mirror, root-bridge, river—without density bleed. Opening and closing lines are sonic bookends that recharge punch-and-lullaby motifs. Minor filter-verb cluster in “Jorin felt a weight lift” could be sharper.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Ferry guides steering folk through a sentient ridge-path is freshish, but inherits tropes of liminal custodians and endless watch. The ticket-punch compass and “river of courage” reframe generic quest tokens into service metaphor, yet the vigil’s infinity loop feels familiar from angelic-guardian stories. Specificity of salt-iron scent and shoreline lullaby idiom localizes the myth, lifting it above pure template. Risk is lyric quietude rather than structural gamble.</comment>
