<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elias’s “methodically curious” trait is shown through tactile beats (aligning sextant, frame-by-frame comparison) that drive every major turn; the final descent is credibly motored by his grandfather’s journal cue and his own perceptual habits. Interiority stays concrete—breath fogging the lens, chest tightening—avoiding label-speak. The only slack: we never feel a genuine flaw that could betray him; competence is too smooth, so the cost feels intellectual rather than personal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: map tear → footage comparison → crack widens → staircase opens, each step tethered to Elias’s active alignment of tools. Orientation is clean within 60 words; the vault, henge, and Chapel anchors stay spatially trackable. Closure earns Charged Poise: the warm silence reconfigures the premise—empathy in the unsaid—and the cost is felt in the irreversible threshold he has crossed. The 1923/static payoff is slightly compressed, a hairline nick.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The rain-scoured vault frescos, brass sextant, and moss-buried stones are returned three times with shifting valence; the projector lens fog and cracked stone halos directly constrain Elias’s next micro-choice. Micro-setting doubles as body-tool interface—his ear to the vibrating stone—charging the final image. Weather and tool specificity never stall momentum; every descriptor either narrows options or reweights the silence motif. Irreplaceable texture.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>“Reopen the silence” is signaled early and tightens once: the footage comparison forecloses retreat—he must descend. Stakes stay internal-epistemic (will he hear meaning or break the world?) yet feel visceral through embodied sound and holy-water ignition. No external antagonist needed; the pressure is knowledge vs. void. Cost is visible—he forfeits daylight certainty for subterranean empathy—though could be sharper if one tool or relationship actually broke.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of “empathy in the unsaid” emerges solely from images: eroded saints still smiling, vowel-less chant, warm darkness. No thesis is declared; the final lullaby image reweights all prior silence without moralizing. Counter-readings linger—has he merely imposed meaning on stone?—inviting reflection. The concept stays fused to Elias’s perceptual lens; remove his curiosity and the idea collapses.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person hovers at mid-distance yet filters every detail through Elias’s map-framer eye: jagged tear read as “threshold,” serpents’ eyes “now pointed inward.” Rhythm modulates—short clauses under high-tempo rain, longer cadence in chapel hush—without dropping clarity. No dialogue, so no voice convergence risk. Diction stays within plausible lexicon except one minor bump—“conceptual repricing” feel in “reopen the silence” headline; forgiven by payoff.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence layers new tactile or sensory intel. Figurative language is sparse and precise—“broken halos,” “lullaby for the methodically curious”—never crowding causality. Opening and closing lines echo map/ear motifs, creating bookended propulsion. Micro-scaffold spotted once: “He’d spent years methodically curious…” could compress, but it lands outside the high-pressure beat and does not dull the staircase reveal.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fusing archival footage, drone tech, and neolithic henge yields fresh temporal collage; the silent-film crack becoming literal light leak feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Silence-as-language is ancient, but the map framer’s tool-based empathy angle is new. Risk—lyric descent into earth chapel—heightens wonder without gimmickry. Could edge higher if henge cosmology broke a real-world assumption to shock the field.</comment>
