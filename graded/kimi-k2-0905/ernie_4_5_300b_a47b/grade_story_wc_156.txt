<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Marisol’s curiosity and tactile engagement with pigment and coin are vivid; her interior contradiction (yearn for answers vs. fear of erasure) pulses in the moment the mural breathes. The final “rhythm of awakening” renunciation is earned because every micro-choice (angling the dish, pocketing the nickel) visibly closes her prior detachment. Grandfather’s absence is felt, not exposited, giving the arc quiet cost. Still, the emotional peak is slightly underplayed—no bodily register of grief or awe at seeing his era’s dancer—keeping her just shy of the 8.8 gate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the mural reseals, the nickel returns to pocket, and Marisol accepts an open-ended “rhythm of awakening” with audible lullaby cost. Causal chain (coin-etching → harmonic scatter → latent pigment resonance) is tight, taught on-page, and reweights her future work. Orientation is clear by word 60; no lens ambiguity. Only the grandfather-to-flapper genealogic link is asserted, not traced, a micro-groove short of 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Garden’s E-flat drone, concave dish, and pigment-crushed “dreams” are filtered through Marisol’s restorer eye; every tactile detail later feeds the reflected-sound payoff. The mural’s micro-geography (crack, corner signature) tracks cleanly across beats and charges the final image. Environment literally bends waves that constrain her method—meets 9+ gate. Minor withholding: we never see sky shift to dusk, only told “first stars,” a hairline gap.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“coax the mural’s memory without destroying it”—tightens when cracks widen and 1920s dancers threaten permanent fade. Escalation is textural: each harmonic bounce increases visual and audible density until the flapper’s wink re-prices Marisol’s heritage. Cost is the irreversible resealing: she gains lineage proof but loses repeatable access. Agency sits squarely in her dish-tilt decision; coincidence only complicates. Could use one more intermediate tactical loss (spilled pigment, brief dish slip) to punch the price earlier.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—“listening as a form of restoration”—emerges through action: sound re-paints what pigment alone cannot. Subtext of inherited curiosity vs. archival duty lives in the nickel’s pocketed weight and the sealed mural corner. Final lullaby melody offers resonant non-verbal answer without moralizing. Ambiguity is fruitful: is the flapper ancestor or mirror? Yet the concept of “nested awakenings” is named aloud by Lysander, a 0.4 echo that keeps it from the 9-band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays inside Marisol’s perceptual filter: she hears “low, droning E-flat,” feels “pulse quicken,” never drifts to Lysander’s mind. Syntax lengthens during harmonic experiment, then fractures into short beats as mural splits—rhythmic control under pressure. Grandfather’s lullaby quoted without italics keeps voice confident. Only tiny POV leap: “garden seemed to hold its breath” is ambient personification she could intuit—within tolerance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty: “pigments mixed from crushed minerals and dreams” seeds both world rule and character motive. No paraphrase loops; each clause advances image or causality. Metaphors stay coherent (sound as key, coin as prism) and pay off in closure. One register lift—“Conceptual Repricing” in editor voice—goes unnoticed in flow, not enough to ding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fusing acoustic physics with mural conservation is fresh; using a hobo nickel’s micro-etchings as variable diffraction grating is specific and non-obvious. The “sound-wave garden” risks gimmick yet stays grounded in tactile procedure. Flapper-era callback avoids nostalgia cliché by remaining a single flicker that reweights Marisol’s identity. Risk is moderate, coherence high—meets 8.5; needs bolder stylistic rupture or higher stakes to breach 9.0.</comment>
