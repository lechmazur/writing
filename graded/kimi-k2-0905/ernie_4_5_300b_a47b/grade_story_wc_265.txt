<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara’s longing to recover her lost “wild frontier” is stated early and re-stated rather than dramatized; the only embodied choice—inserting the gear—happens once and costs nothing we feel. Interiority drifts toward abstract self-labeling (“sixth sense,” “wild frontier”) instead of contradictory impulse. The father-hologram delivers thematic summary in place of a final micro-choice that would lock in cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the gear-seed drifts away and the forest’s “hum” softens, reweighting the premise toward coexistence. Causal chain is thin—gear insertion instantly triggers revelation and paternal hologram—but the Accumulative/Textural pattern (repetition of wind-song motifs) holds. Orientation is clear by line 6; no lens ambiguity at end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Selective sensory triage—ironwoods’ minor keys, copperwillows’ tuning-fork trill—gives the biomechanical forest an audible body that doubles as brain-synapse map. The pocketed gear’s worn teeth and the moss-softened ground underfoot supply tactile micro-setting that charges the final image. Environment literally rotates around her, constraining stance and supplying the closing reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Single stake—access primordial chaos—is declared but never materially tested; no option is foreclosed and no price is exacted from Elara. Escalation is a single beat: pedestal accepts gear → forest reveals itself as brain → father says “let go.” No tactical narrowing or resource lost; tension plateaus after the initial click.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme—machinery and wildness must co-seed—emerges through the gear-seed image rather than authorial sermon. Subtext is thin: father’s hologram spells out the lesson. Yet the final whispered exhalation of gears leaves a resonant after-image that reweights prior sound-motifs without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Elara’s sensorium, filtering description through auditory bias. Syntax modulates with pressure—long breathless clauses during forest inhalation, then short sentences at release. No head-hop; diction remains within plausible philosopher-tinker lexicon. Occasional elevated phrasing (“conceptual repricing” feel) but never breaks frame.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene: mechanical cadence mirrors gear-turn, then loosens at moss-ground reveal. No scaffold loops; metaphors stay coherent (forest-brain synapses). One strained image—“probability bent like willow branches”—but clarity intact. High information density; each sentence advances image or stakes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Biomechanical rainforest-as-brain is vivid synthesis; gear-seed as synaptic graft feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric compression taught early via wind-tones pays off in closure whisper. Avoids steampunk cliché by grounding tech in auditory neurology rather than brass goggles.</comment>
