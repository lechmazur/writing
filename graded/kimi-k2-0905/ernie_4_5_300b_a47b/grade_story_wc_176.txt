<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael’s grief-scarred silence and “technically gentle” hands are embodied in every tactile beat; the micro-choice to keep weaving despite tremors shows interior contradiction under pressure. The final image of raw but steady hands earns the Earned Stasis closure. Yet the mother’s apparition speaks with therapeutic certainty (“You’ve found me”), a hairline slip that softens the cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because he threads the card into the rope, the braid reknits and summons Lira, foreclosing his exile in silence. Orientation is anchored by word 80 (“icebound sanctum”) and the manuscript rule is taught early. The beam piercing the ceiling is a decisive change with visible cost—his shadow burned onto the wall—so closure lands cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Glacial stone that “remembered sunlight,” rope glowing like breath, and frost-slick braids constrain fingerwork and pace the ritual. The aurora vortex externalizes the memory breach; the mosaic of names beneath the ice reweights the final glow. Micro-setting—the rope’s resistance—directly shapes the climax.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—recover Lira’s erased voice—tightens when each mis-aligned thread risks permanent silence. The rope’s shudder and aurora fracture escalate via because/therefore linkage: flawed weave → light surge → maternal apparition. Cost is legible: burned shadow, raw hands, and the irreversible re-braid that locks the memory into ice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory-as-braided-light emerges from the rope’s chromatic logic rather than assertion. The final image reconfigures forgetting into luminous inscription, a Conceptual Repricing that reframes prior bells and chimes as failed cages. Subtext in the lullaby fragment avoids explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Kael’s tactile perception; syntax lengthens under strain then fractures into short beats during the vortex. “Technically gentle” recurs as a perceptual signature, never explanatory. No head-hop; aurora description remains filtered through his snowmelt-iron palate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “rope coiled like a serpent” is the only simile in the first 200 words, leaving space for ice-creak rhythm. One scaffold—“the rope’s glow spilled… the rope’s light coalesced”—is cut-worthy but does not touch the closure beat. Strong verbs (“snapping and reknitting”) propel the final ascent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Forged memory-music from a frayed organ card braided into aurora-lit ice feels novel yet inevitable. The wax-caster turned frost-weaver reverses his art without fire, a fresh synthesis. Risk in the spectral maternal apparition pays off because the rope’s mechanical logic preps the transcendence.</comment>
