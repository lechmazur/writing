<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kael’s mechanical-arm micro-gestures and Elyra’s blade-adjustments give embodied contradiction, but interiority tilts toward label-speak (“chaos is honesty”). The final shared grin and “I evolve” renunciation is earned, yet the arm’s loss-origin is told not shown, blunting felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the card’s star-map reweights the duel from victory to translation, cost felt when they sheath blades and accept open questions. Causal lattice holds—every parry angles off the sundial code—but the “debate gone wrong” backstory arrives untethered to any present stimulus, a mild causality blur.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Glass atrium + prismatic light + half-painted sundial floor act as micro-setting that literally steers footwork and reflection angles; brook sound keeps temporal pulse. Light-constraint charges the final image when constellation dots hit glass, making environment indispensable to tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—translation vs. victory—tightens once: the card’s stellar revelation forecloses “defeat the rival” and opens “collaborate.” Cost is visible (Kael’s blood, Elyra’s freeze), but pressure stays intellectual; physical wound is superficial, muting visceral price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without sermon: questions as destinations vs. directions reframed by star-map reveal. Final image of side-by-side sheathed blades gives quiet resonance, though the phrase “dignified chaos” is stated twice, slightly diluting subtext.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person close keeps perceptual signature tight—Kael’s gears click thoughts, Elyra notices wire-rims. Rhythm modulates: long reflective sentences during light-play, short punctuated lunges under pressure. No head-hopping; “we’ll make one together” convergence is intentional.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm, few filters, but metaphor strings in opening paragraph (“prismatic shadows… obsession with light”) verge on overwriting. No loops or scaffold; sundial angle mechanics stay precise. Closure line “And that, Kael thought, was the point all along” is tidy but not artifactual.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Fencing philosophers decoding a star-map via sundial angles is fresh; trope fusion feels inevitable not gimmicky. Specificity—épée tracing half-painted lines—grounds premise. Risk: philosophical duel could tilt abstract, but embodied blade-work keeps it visceral.</comment>
