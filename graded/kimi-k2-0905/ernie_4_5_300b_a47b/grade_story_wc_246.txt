<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s guilt and “confidently uncertain” mantra give him a usable interior contradiction; the pen-as-key and humbled editor arc track cleanly. Lira functions mainly as oracle, not crucible, so relationship pressure stays thin. Final renunciation—handing the farmer back agency—lands with modest cost yet feels pre-explained rather than viscerally discovered.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mosaic shard structure is taught early (anomaly→Lira arrival→farmer house) and causality holds: wrong edit → blight → crater confrontation → surrender of authorial control. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: “editing…was about turning mistakes into seeds,” with social cost (he must face the family without a tidy fix). One transition, no orientation debt; lens stays causal throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Gravitational anomaly is immediate, sensory, and instrumental: floating stones foreshadow reality-bending stakes, then flicker off once Elias yields control, charging the final image. Micro-settings (crater soil, pocket nib, hovering leaves) constrain movement and mirror internal disequilibrium. Spatial choreography stays clean across the low-gravity moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—repairing a life-threatening blight—tightens when Lira reveals collaborative editing is the only path; options narrow from “rewrite reality” to “relinquish authorship.” Cost is visible: Elias abandons his former power and must confess. Escalation is single-cycle but sufficient for 700-word scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—history as collaborative web rather than solo script—emerges through the anomaly-as- metaphor and the nib’s redefinition from “writing” to “listening.” No overt moralizing; final image of fever breaking carries quiet payoff. Subtext in Lira’s gentle interruptions nudges Elias from controller to witness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature skews toward cosmic technician (prismatic shards, frequency metaphors). Some elevated phrasing—“history resented being pruned”—pushes slightly above his lexicon but stays within narrative grace period. Dialogue is sparse yet distinct in cadence when present.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm modulates with gravity flux; short sentences under anomaly stress, longer reflective lines in crater stillness. Metaphors are selective, mostly coherent (warped glass, web of timelines). One paraphrase loop—“he’d come here after planting the wrong seeds / he’d spent his career editing history”—but it occurs early and doesn’t blunt closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Timeline-editing as agricultural blight is a fresh angle; gravitational anomaly literalizes moral weight without feeling grafted. Mythic yet grounded image of a nib that listens rather than writes offers memorable specificity. Not radically experimental, but synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
