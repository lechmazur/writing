<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s curiosity-driven autonomy powers every beat; the envelope/seed triggers a credible cascade of micro-choices (testing, planting, brook pursuit) that externalize his “notably receptive” trait. Interiority stays concrete—hands calloused, spectrometer borrowed, dream image—avoiding label-speak. The earned laugh-key moment crystallizes a value hierarchy: puzzle-solver yields to nature’s puzzle, foreclosing sterile control. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene, and the plant’s agency mildly absconds with true flaw-compounded error, keeping him just shy of 8-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Causal linkage holds: seed → tests → key with because/therefore clarity; each orthogonal experiment narrows possibilities toward the iron key payoff. Closure is a Charged Poise: the laugh-image reconfigures Elias’s mission from designer to participant, cost felt in surrendered certainty. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) lands by line 3; no debt. Minor loop: “storm-born silence” phrase reused without intensification; doesn’t dull exit image but prevents 8.8+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Nocturnal brook haven is more than postcard: its mud receives the plant, its water guides the slime trail, its reeds conceal the key—environment directly enables climax. Sensory triad (mist, murmur, ink-black water) is filtered through Elias’s puzzle-designer eye, selective not catalogic. Micro-setting (workbench spectrometer, fireplace ash) constrains tactics. Final image of “crucible where possibility took root” marries place to theme, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve curiosity sanctuary—signals early and tightens when the seed threatens to rupture controlled space. Escalation is intellectual, not peril: each orthogonal test (envelope, chemistry, ledger) forecloses one explanatory path, pushing him toward organic surrender. Cost is conceptual—loss of designer mastery—rather than visceral, capping high-band entry. Coincidence (dream pre-viewing plant’s move) complicates but doesn’t resolve, permitted under lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of “innovation through surrender” emerges silently from action: forced design yields to vegetal agency. Spiral motif (envelope → key) reweights from human symbol to natural cipher, a quiet Conceptual Repricing. No moralizing; final laugh carries wry acceptance of hubris. Subtext in slime trail—nature writing its own escape room—invites reflection without abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-limited adheres cleanly; perceptual signature filters description through puzzle-designer diction (“orthogonal approaches,” “labyrinth of curiosity”). Rhythm breathes—long hortative sentences for night mood, clipped clauses for test sequences. No dialogue, so voice coherence rests on narration alone and sustains. Occasional elevated diction (“nocturnal haven”) feels authored but stays within Elias’s plausible lexicon of theatrical atmospherics.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Strong read-aloud cadence; sentence lengths vary, opening phrases diversify. Information density high—each sentence layers sensory, symbolic, or causal payload. Two minor artifacts: “storm-born silence” exact repeat; “ink-black water / ink-black water” near-repeat 60 words apart. Neither touches closure, but block entry to 9-band. Metaphors (brain-ribbed stem) are precise, not stacked.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fusion of escape-room designer with corpse-flower symbiosis feels fresh; botanical-gothic twist on inventor trope. Spiral motif and orthogonal method marry character craft to natural fractal, an inevitable-in-hindsight synthesis. Risk: intellectual stakes over emotional, but coherence and specificity transcend gimmick. Transformed trope test passes—swap botanist for any other profession and the engine collapses.</comment>
