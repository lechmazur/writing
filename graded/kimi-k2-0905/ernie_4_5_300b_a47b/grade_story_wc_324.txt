<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Lila’s interiority is atmospheric but abstract—“her persistently curious mind” is label-speak rather than embodied thought. The only embodied emotion is the throat-tightening beat, too brief to show contradiction under pressure. Micro-choices (placing hearing aids, jotting words) align with motive yet carry no visible cost; the closure gift feels gifted, not earned. Because the man’s apparition does the emotional labor, her arc is observational, not crucible-tested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the echoing pulse and mirrored hearing aids build density until the synchronized duet reweights meaning. Orientation is clear by paragraph two; no penalty. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final mist-exhale image crystallizes Lila’s vocation and the widow’s relief. Cost is conceptual, not felt—Lila leaves lighter, no constraint or price—so stays below 9-band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mist, marble, and algae-edged photograph are vivid, selective, and filtered through Lila’s tracer gaze. The atrium’s west-wing labyrinth guides physical discovery; the hearing aids act as micro-setting that constrains the final synchronization. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: damp moss scent narrows to pulse vibration. Final image of parting mist recharges the twilight dome without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“assure the unfinished truth reaches the widow”—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: the found hearing aid synchronizes pulses, shifting knowledge but not narrowing live options. No visible price is paid; Lila’s tactics never alter. Escalation is informational, not consequential.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of love too large for words emerges through the photograph’s unread gesture and the static-crack apology. Subtext resides in the synchronized heartbeats—technology as conduit for tenderness—avoiding overt thesis. Final line “Some stories… echo” skirts thematic echo penalty by framing Lila’s continuance, not moralizing. Complexity is modest but intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; diction stays within Lila’s atmospheric register. Metaphoric mist curls and “spectral cats” are patterned early and returned at exit, legible under lyric-accumulative lens. Rhythm modulates: longer cadence for discovery, short beats for pulse sync. No dialogue to test voice distinction; internal cadence remains consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is lean, with high information density—each sentence advances mood or clue. Occasional elevated flourishes (“spectral cats,” “bruised violet”) risk purple but stay sparse enough to avoid density penalty. No loops or scaffold; only micro-repetition of “pulse” serves pattern. Final beep is a crisp auditory closer that avoids overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>“Tracer of hearts” premise freshens the detective trope; hearing-aid séance is a neat speculative twist. Yet the plot beats—found photo, ghostly utterance, note delivered—follow a standard therapeutic-ghost arc without subversion. Risk is moderate; specificity lies in sensory filter, not structural surprise. Freshness feels atmospheric rather than conceptual.</comment>
