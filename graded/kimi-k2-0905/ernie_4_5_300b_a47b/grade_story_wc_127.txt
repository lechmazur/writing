<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Elias’s contradictory impulses—profit-seeking yet empathy-driven—are dramatized in the blotter-petal beat where he both tests and sells the sorrow-dulling scent. His “practiced curve” smile versus interior calculation shows external/inner split without diagnostic speak. The final archiving of the used petal crystallizes his affectionate detachment with visible cost: he keeps the trace of someone else’s erased pain. One hairline slip: “professionally thorough” is asserted more than enacted in micro-choices—no botched vial or clock pressure tests him.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias sealing the spent petal reweights the half-truth economy under an accumulative/textural lens—every sale leaves a residue he stockpiles. Causality holds: the static-charged dusk peak → client arrival → precise vial handed over → petal archived. Cost is legible in the final image: his own empathy is incrementally subsumed into amber walls. No orientation debt; grotto rules taught early via electromagnetic orchid and violet spectacles.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Amber grotto acts as micro-setting: translucent walls glow brighter as emotional charge dissipates, mirroring client relief while foreclosing Elias’s own escape—he’s literally surrounded by absorbed sorrows. Static electricity is not backdrop but diagnostic tool, constraining how he tests each vial. Spatial choreography clean: single entrance, workbench clutter, petal placed in glass case—no impossible moves. Sensory hierarchy favors visual amber and tactile static; other senses lightly skipped yet not missed under tight word count.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—Elias’s need to maintain empathic distance while trafficking feelings—tightens when Lira asks to forget. One meaningful deepening: the blotter-petal test moment forces him to inhale a dose of someone else’s sorrow, risking internal contamination. Visible price: he shelves the petal, acknowledging accumulated emotional debt. Escalation is accumulative rather than causal-reversal, sufficient under lens; could edge higher if static charge visibly spiked or dipped to signal irreversible拐点.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges organically: the cost of curated forgetting is stored in the dealer’s amber archive. Half-truth motif reweights at closure—petal once fresh is now a relic of swallowed pain, implying Elias’s own memory warehouse grows heavier. No moralizing; final image invites reader to wonder who truly bears the burden of absolution. Subtext in Lira’s steadied voice shows relief paid for by unseen joy excision—theme left provocatively incomplete.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias; perceptual signature filters every detail through scent-static synesthesia—“air hummed with the static charge of dusk’s first sigh.” Syntax flexes from languid clause cascades in calm beats to clipped noun phrases during vial selection. No head-hopping; Lira’s interior accessed only via Elias’s educated guesswork. Diction stays within plausible alchemist lexicon without academic drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences deliver scent name, visual shimmer, and ethical caveat without padding. Rhythm breathes with scene—long sentences for grotto ambience, fragment-like “Test it for yourself” to nail transaction. One mixed metaphor “liquid moonlight” modest, does not recur or blur logic. No scaffold loops; paragraph cuts cleanly alter knowledge or charge. Opening and final lines anchor and re-charge petal motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—emotion perfumer in amber grotto—feels fresh yet inevitable, synthesizing scent-tech noir with spiritual absolution booth. Transformation test passes: plot collapses without counterfeit-emotion mechanic and static sensing. Risk taken in quiet, non-violent stakes; success because residue image haunts after page. Minor deduction for trope echo of memory-wiping elixir, but specificity of electromagnetic orchid and static blotter reinvigorates.</comment>
