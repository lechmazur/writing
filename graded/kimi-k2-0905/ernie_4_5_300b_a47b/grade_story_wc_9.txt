<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—yearning for her mother while fearing the answer—are embodied in the trembling hand on the cracked saucer; the final traced palm on the cloth shows a paid cost. Interiority stays concrete (“the phrase tasting of ash and honey”). The Earned Stasis of accepting that repentance is a choice, not a place, is fully motivated by the vision in the glass city. Only the slight over-articulation of “willingly perplexed” keeps this from 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the healed saucer and new handprint reconfigure the meaning of lost time under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality holds—each card and unfastening tightens the pattern until the straight crack replaces the question mark. The Orientation Test is waived: disorientation in the first 120 words pays off when the glass-city vision anchors the timeline. Cost is legible in the final image—“her mother’s, traced in onyx ink”—a permanent alteration of the birthday cloth.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The floating moss-and-birch glade is not backdrop; its dissolving edges and hourglass-rooted tree constrain Elara’s climb and fall. The saucer functions as micro-setting: its crack widening dictates when the light/chorus is released. Sensory selection is POV-filtered—ozone, lilacs, starlight—each tethered to memory. The city of backward time is revealed only when the glade’s tree is breached, making environment instrumental to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recovering the lost maternal moment—tightens when the crack becomes a straight line, foreclosing endless search. Agency is continuous: unfastening sash, climbing, placing *The World* card. Pressure escalates via pattern accumulation (cards, cloth, saucer) rather than external antagonist; the final image crystallizes stance with visible cost. One meaningful intensification suffices for this length and lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of “lost time” as a place one waits versus a choice one makes. The reweighted saucer and new handprint render the moral without statement. Subtext resides in silence: the mother’s mid-song absence, the untraced childhood palm. Final whisper—“Trace your hands, little star”—offers Charged Poise, not moral, leaving ambiguity intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s perceptual signature—constellations taste, cloth frays like time’s teeth. Syntax mirrors ascent: longer clauses while climbing, clipped fragments at the fall. No dialogue, so voice distinction N/A. Occasional lyric compression (“cloudbound repentance”) is taught by context and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable; figurative language is patterned—crack as question mark, tree as hourglasses—without overwriting. No loops or scaffold. Strong verbs (“unfastened,” “billowing,” “swallowed”) carry motion. One mixed metaphor (“fabric pooling like ink” vs. “ink staining skin”) is minor and does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fusion of tarot, cloud-island, and backward-glass city feels singular; no trope checklist. The cracked dolls’ saucer repurposed as temporal key is fresh. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off when the straight crack reconfigures the premise. Specificity—birthday handprints, onyx ink—anchors universals.</comment>
