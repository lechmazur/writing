<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and driftwood-sculptor identity threads every perception; contradiction is mostly absent until the late epiphany, so the final “Teach me” feels slightly unearned—no interior cost is dramatized on the page. Micro-choices (pressing slide to keystone, dropping sculptures) anchor agency, but the lack of visible hesitation or flaw keeps the arc just shy of high-band tension.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: Charged Poise in the turbine-hum smile re-weights the premise—she is now timeline-weaver, art = map. Causal chain: slide-touch → portal-cross → ancestral gift → perceptual shift; each step depends on the last, no lucky rescue. Orientation fixed by word 60; one soft reset (storm still howls) is acknowledged, not hidden. Cost is conceptual (island complexity internalized) rather than visceral, sufficient for 8.2 but not 9+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Storm-archway, damp moss, kelp-haired mermaid—all tactile, never listed; environment is handled (slide pressed to keystone, sculptures dropped) so setting becomes actor, not backdrop. Sensory hierarchy obeys sculptor’s eye: grain of driftwood > distant village. Spatial choreography tight; no impossible moves. Final image of archway still howling re-crystallizes the place as charged object, meeting 9+ gate but micro-slip in “coral-and-timber huts” vagueness keeps it 8.7.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—make the island’s chaos legible—signalled early and escalates through slide discovery, portal crossing, ancestral imperative. Tightening beat: “You’re late” forces crystallized stance. Price is existential absorption of layered time; felt but not visceral. Agency present at each node; no coincidences solve problems. Slightly abstract cost prevents 8.0+ entry.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—art as cartography of time—emerges via sculptural images (mermaid hair = timeline strands) without sermon. Subtext in lantern-slide heartbeat: memory is covenant, not artifact. Final smile re-prices her vocation; no moral spoken. Complexity/simplicity motif stays implicit, gaining weight through concrete re-seeings. One hairline cliché (“tasted like salt and iron”) slightly dulls edge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lira’s perceptual signature—carving stories from flotsam—colors every verb and metaphor; no head-hop. Syntax tightens under portal hum: clauses shorten, present-participle clusters mimic vibration. Diction stays within coastal craftsman lexicon; no academic leakage. Dialogue (3 lines) is indirection-rich, voice-distinct from narrative. Filter verbs minimal, purposeful. Meets 9- gate but rhythm repeats “turbine-hum reverie” twice without pattern-teach, capping at 8.4.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High density: single sentences fuse sensorium, myth, tool-use—“stone hummed, a turbine-hum reverie that vibrated in her bones.” No scaffold, no synonym loops. Metaphors stay physically coherent; mixed vehicle “labyrinth of fog and shifting tides” is saved by island-as-body logic. Paragraph cuts test clean; each advances knowledge or image. One tiny register lift—“conceptual repricing” notion implied but not voiced—keeps elite tier intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Time-archway + driftwood cartography fuses two tired tropes into fresh instrument: sculpture = memory map. Lantern-slide-as-covenant refreshes standard portal MacGuffin. Island history reimagined as collaborative quilting across eras, not excavation of relics. Risk—lyric mosaic inside 700 words—pays off through taught pattern (slide → village → return) and coherent closure. No traceable famous-scene echo; specificity (“kelp hair = years”) anchors originality.</comment>
