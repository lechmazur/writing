<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kael’s “underachieving mage” label is shown rather than told through the failed-spell backstory and his trembling approach to the keystone; the garden memory and final sketch choice give a credibly embodied cost. Interiority slips into mild therapy-speak (“he realized then that…”) twice, blunting contradiction. The micro-choice to pour starlight is sharp, but the later “tears freezing” feels cosmetic rather than driven by a fresh contradiction. Still, the arc from insecure failure to earned quiet pride lands with visible forfeiture of grand magic for a humble garden, satisfying the 9− test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: failed automagic culture → seeks spire → mist-walk → starlight gamble → garden transforms → exits with altered stance. The keystone crack and staircase descent provide a decisive change charged by the personal sketch; cost is the renunciation of spectacle magic, felt in the final line. Orientation is clear by word 60, no debt. One slight causality slack: “the spire trembled” is stated as external effect without clarifying whether Kael’s pour or the keystone itself triggers it, but the gap is too small to rupture closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Icebound spire, vapor gate, and inner greenhouse are economically etched; temperature and light gradients guide emotional tempo. The garden fountain micro-setting acts as object-in-setting, forcing memory recall that tilts the final sketch decision—meets 9+ gate. Selective sensory detail (gloved hand, fogged breath) keeps momentum; no tourist catalog. Spatial track stays clean during vapor levitation and staircase spiral.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can he recover personal meaning in magic?—is signaled early and sharpened by the automated-culture frame. Escalation occurs once: starlight pour collapses the labyrinth into a living garden and narrows his options to either claim spectacle or simplicity; the final sketch is the explicit trade-off. Cost is the forfeiture of grand illusions, visible in the withering of exotic plants. The single tightening suffices for 700-word scope, though a mid-story obstacle beat could have pushed score higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete images: mechanical spell-casting vs. mother’s tended roses; no explicit sermon. The garden’s transformation reweights “sacred in the simple” via the sketch callback, giving resonance without moral tag. Subtext in the fountain vision shows creativity as memory, not invention. Final answer is imagistic—rainbows on ice—avoiding tidy axiom, though the phrase “he’d found what he’d been looking for” flirts with echoic over-statement (−0.2).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Kael’s perceptual filter; no head-hop. Diction leans romantic but consistent with wonder-seeking mage: “dagger of frost,” “brilliant dimness.” Rhythm modulates—long sentence for garden awe, short fragments under starlight ignition. No dialogue, so voice purity is high. Filter verbs minimal; “he realized” is the lone intrusion but rescued by immediate embodied continuation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is vivid, mostly clean; occasional modifier stacks (“lingering luminance that revealed hidden paths”) flirt with purple but stay legible. One paraphrase loop: “the spire trembled, and the ice around him began to melt” could compress. Opening and closing lines carry acoustic echo without templated cadence. No grammar slips; spatial clarity maintained during vapor float. Strong read-aloud rhythm and varied sentence launch points.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Frozen-inverted tower as creativity sanctuary is fresh; mystical garden folly keystone that swaps spectacle for humble flora offers a specific inflection on “find beauty in simplicity.” The mist-walk mechanic is familiar fantasy, yet its pairing with starlight alchemy feels idiosyncratic. Transformation test passes: swap mother-garden specificity and the story collapses. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulative structure—but executed cleanly without gimmick.</comment>
