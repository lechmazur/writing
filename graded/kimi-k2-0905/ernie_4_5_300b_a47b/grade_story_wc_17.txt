<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Lira’s curiosity about “what walls dream” is vivid, but her interior contradiction—why this matters beyond filial piety—stays abstract. The moment she chooses to burn the film strip is a micro-choice with cost, yet the emotional hierarchy (why erase rather than keep?) isn’t embodied beforehand. No genuine flaw complicates the choice; the risk feels aesthetic, not personal. Voice remains coherent, but the arc leans toward discovery rather than transformation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the locket’s whisper “You are the map” reconfigures her role with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain holds: diaries → recognition of shared dream → surrender of film → inheritance claimed. Orientation is clean within 120 words; no lens ambiguity. The film-burn beat could carry sharper physical stakes, but the persistent constraint (she must become the map) is legible and earned.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ivy-veiled passage is not backdrop but actant: it parts, whispers, warms the locket—environment that alters tactic and final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true; damp stone, salt air, moss that refuses footprints all filter through Lira’s cartographer gaze. Micro-setting (locket map, fireplace ash) constrains her next move. World rules remain consistent; no exposition dump.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“what walls dream”—is signaled early; escalation is textural: each diary line thickens the sense that the corridor feeds on memory. One tightening: burning the film surrenders her external record to become the internal map. Cost is conceptual (she absorbs the dreams), but not viscerally felt; no credible loss of tool, time, or social credit. Pressure plateaus rather than spikes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—legacy as osmosis rather than artifact—emerges through image, not maxim. Subtext resides in the empty film that nonetheless records, the locket that already knew her. Final reweighting reframes cartography from external tracing to internal hosting. Avoids moralizing; resonance lingers as uneasy intimacy with the built world.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person intimate maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is precise—corridor as “question mark,” air tasting of salt and old wood. Syntax mirrors Lira’s measuring mind: clauses like calibrations. No head-hop; no filter-verb bloat. Dialogue absent by design; voice carries subtext alone. Minor elevation drift in “infinite patience” but forgivable under lyrical pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm modulates: longer sensory coils contract to single imperative (“Let it burn”) at climax. Metaphors stay coherent—passage as throat, ivy as tongue—but avoid mixed vehicles. No synonym loops; each noun is specific (moss, ash, locket). Opening and closing lines tether and release the motif cleanly. One paraphrase micro-loop around “walls hum/remember” could tighten, but it does not stall propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: climate-haunted architecture that metabolizes memory via ivy and echo. Diaries as half-burned palimpsest beats the standard found-manuscript trope by integrating the fireplace as living maw. Conceptual risk—cartography of time not land—pays off in the final reconfiguration. Could edge higher if the personal stakes were as singular as the world premise.</comment>
