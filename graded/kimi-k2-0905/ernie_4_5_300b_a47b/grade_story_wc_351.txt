<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Kael’s helix-minded engineer trait is shown through tactile tool use and chaotic precision, but interiority drifts into diagnostic self-talk (“chaos in his own thoughts”) that flattens embodied emotion. The memory-bleed risk momentarily threatens passivity, yet his micro-choice to dial the headband while tasting ash embodies cost. The archeologist motive converts into an earned, visible act—rewiring the mirror—so renunciation lands with credible sting. Voice remains coherent; only the therapy-curl in peak beat keeps this shy of 8+.</comment>

<comment>Causal linkage holds: cracked mirror → laser etch → memory splice → resealed glass, each beat a because/therefore step that narrows options. The midpoint memory-voice (“I buried it here”) is a decisive hinge that changes Kael’s tactics. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the mirror’s iridescent mosaic makes the entanglement’s social/psychic cost undeniable. One minor scaffold loop—“the mirror wasn’t just reflecting light; it was reflecting her”—is forgiven because it crystallizes the turn.</comment>

<comment>Moonlit canyon and mirror shard operate as micro-setting: the liquid-silver light pools inside the cracks Kael will later fill, binding environment to method. Sensory triage—gust dying to whisper, solder glow, glass hum—tracks attention under pressure. Spatial choreography is clean: kneel → lift shard → laser pass → headband dial → glass seam; no floating props. The canyon’s breathing glyphs remain plausible hallucination under synaptic overload, so world-rules stay intact.</comment>

<comment>Single dominant stake: salvage abandoned dreams by grafting foreign memories onto self. Escalation is causal: each laser pass deepens feedback-loop risk until identity bleed becomes visceral (“taste of defeat like ash”). The tightening choice—continue etching despite neural overload—forecloses the option of safe withdrawal. Cost is visible: his reflection is replaced by a mosaic of strangers, a permanent cognitive rent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges implicitly: memory is physical property, identity is editable substrate. No moralizing—final image of alien mosaic is the non-literal answer. Subtext coils around burial/excavation: woman’s buried memory is unearthed only at the price of Kael burying his former self. The refrain of “archeologist” is repurposed from metaphor to literal technique, earning resonance without abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person close maintains tight psychic distance; perceptual signature is engineer-filtered: “fractures weren’t flaws—they were pathways.” Diction stays within plausible lexicon; no register drift. Rhythm accelerates under feedback stress—short clauses, tactile verbs (“gritted, adjusted, pressed”). No head-hopping; interior access is consistent. One template cadence run (“He’d spent weeks… he sought… he lifted…”) is acceptable as retrospective compression.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Sentence variety and read-aloud rhythm are strong; information density high—each groove pass advances stakes and image. Mixed-metaphor guard is clean: “liquid mercury” and “shattered constellations” occupy separate beats, no collision. One paraphrase loop—“the mirror wasn’t just reflecting light; it was reflecting her”—is forgiven because it reweights the stake. No scaffold loops or filter-verb stacks; closure image remains sharp.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise fusion—synaptic-plastic mirror repair—is fresh and specific; not a stock prompt mash-up. The “archeologist of abandoned dreams” phrase is transformed from conceit to literal method, giving conceptual integrity. Risk of tech-explanation infodump is avoided; mechanics surface only through embodied action. Entanglement payoff feels inevitable in hindsight yet non-obvious at entry.</comment>
