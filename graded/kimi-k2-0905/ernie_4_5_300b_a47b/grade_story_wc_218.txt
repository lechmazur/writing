<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lira’s “brazen calm” is repeatedly named but never contradicted; no interior friction or competing impulse is dramatized, so her final acceptance feels pre-scripted rather than earned. The six-month death sentence is declared, yet no beat shows her fatigue, fear, or tactical recalculation—she remains serenely competent throughout. The copper-wrapping micro-choices are tactile but flatten into ritual; they never force her to question, improvise, or relinquish anything. Closure still lands with visible cost (her death), so the arc reaches Earned Stasis, but the absence of internal struggle keeps the score just below the 9-gate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Closure is cleanly legible: the orchard’s pulse syncs, the spirit accepts coexistence, and Lira’s death pays the price—Conceptual Repricing achieved. Causality holds: each copper wrap tightens the bridge premise; the rumble signals resistance; the final wrap triggers acceptance. The six-month clock is stated but never tightens tactics on-page; time remains ambient rather than causal, a missed lever for escalation. Still, the lens (Hybrid, sliding to Accumulative) holds through the resonant final image of “a sigh, soft as copper on oak,” reweighting the premise without exposition.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The living stone pillars and copper-veined oak function simultaneously as environment, tool, and micro-setting; their fused pulse physically constrains the final choice. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered: Lira notices warmth, reddish gleam, leaf shudder—never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is flawless; the orchard’s heart, the nearest pillar, and the gourd track cleanly. The setting charges the closure image; remove the living stone and the bridge premise collapses.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—interspecies harmony—signals early and tightens once: the rumble forces Lira to decide whether to continue. Cost is visible: her final breath pays the price, and the orchard’s hum locks in the new state. No secondary resource loss (tools, social credit) is dramatized, so escalation feels singular rather than compounded. Agency remains ritualistic; the copper acts more than she agonizes, keeping the score south of 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: translation between organic growth and human geometry is shown through the copper lattice, not asserted. The final image—copper on oak holding her last breath—reweights the premise: coexistence is not balance but mutual inscription. No moralizing line explains “bridges beat boxes”; the silence after the spirit’s laugh lets the reader feel the reconfiguration. Complexity lingers: the spirit admits “It hurts,” refusing tidy harmony.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays anchored to Lira’s perceptual filter: “her fingers tracing,” “her mind clear,” “her own breath caught.” Diction remains botanical and tactile—”unspooled,” “gnarled,” “web of metal and wood”—creating a distinct texture. No head-hopping; the spirit’s dialogue is external voice, not interior intrusion. Rhythm modulates: short clauses under pressure (“Lira froze”) lengthen into lyrical cadence at closure, matching the orchard’s hum.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; each sentence advances image, causality, or emotional charge. Metaphors are disciplined: “liquid sun” is brief, apt, and physically consistent. Information density is high—copper, rumble, diary, spirit—yet clarity never wavers. Final line crystallizes without overwriting: “soft as copper on oak” compresses material, cost, and afterlife into eight words.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The premise—bio-architectural diplomacy via living stone and copper graft—feels fresh against standard eco-fantasy. The spirit’s flickering flame form is familiar, but its admission of pain complicates the usual benevolent nature trope. Risk is taken in the quiet, ritual climax rather than a spectacle; coherence rewards the gamble. The synthesis of botany, craft, and interspecies translation is specific enough that swapping elements would break the story’s logic.</comment>
