<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lira’s drone-pilot acuity and “perpetually surprised” trait are shown through sensory, embodied beats (goggles flicker, breath hitches). She acts: tracks, scans, grips tools, pulls the lever—each micro-choice escalates cost. Interior contradiction is light but present: skepticism vs. star-struck wonder. The final stance—coat tightened, listening—earns a quiet, visible cost: she foregoes certainty for resonance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Causal lattice holds: pilgrim’s arrival → Lira’s pursuit → prism alignment → lever pull → chip reassembly → tonal shift to “listen.” Orientation anchors by line 4; no missteps. Closure is a Charged Poise: the decoded frequency reweights “belonging” from place to resonance; cost is the humming stones and her chilled boots—felt, not declared. Lever mechanics are foreshadowed by blueprint hologram, so final rotation feels inevitable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Observatory stones, rusted dome, Cassiopeia overhead—each detail is filtered through Lira’s drone-overlay gaze, never touristy. Dusk light is used tactically: prism fractals cue the alignment beat. Spatial choreography is clean: grappling hook arc, lever location, niche beams track without drift. The dome itself acts—rotates, vibrates—qualifying as micro-setting that constrains the final choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“decode belonging”—is signaled early and tightens when alignment, not chip, becomes the obstacle. One meaningful escalation: lever pull shifts possibility space from retrieval to attunement. Cost is legible: ancient mechanism groans, stones wake, Lira’s heartbeat syncs with alien rhythm. No antagonist needed; pressure is situational-coherent under starlight countdown.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without thesis statement: belonging as resonance rather than geography. Subtext lives in shared silence after “Now we listen”—a renunciation of mastery. Final image reweights prior drone-mapping ethos into passive receptivity. Ambiguity is purposeful: frequency has no translation, only shared hum.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Lira’s perceptual filter: “goggles flickering,” “breath hitched.” Syntax tightens under pressure—fragments like “Star trails,” mirror her clipped focus. No head-hop; pilgrim’s interior remains opaque, read through prism angle and eye-flick. Diction is tech-poetic—“type foundry matrix,” “celestial keyhole”—yet remains within her drone-operator lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, high-density: every sentence advances image or causality. No loops or scaffold; metaphor is sparse and precise—“crown of shadows.” Opening line anchors voice and stakes simultaneously. Final line crystallizes without flourish: “Now we listen.” Register stays consistent; no corporate drift. Closure beat is unmarred by artifice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Freshens familiar “ancient alien tech” trope by reframing the McGuffin: chip is decoder, stars are key. Prism-split fractals and heartbeat-synced frequency feel specific to this world. Risk taken in quiet ending—renunciation of mastery—pays off by reweighting colonial mapping impulse into receptive listening. No derivative echo; constellation alignment logic is internally invented.</comment>
