<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lira’s grief-propelled quest is vivid, but her only on-page choice—spilling ink and walking off—feels lightweight; the brother-stake stays abstract, so the final step carries limited cost. Interiority is atmospheric yet drifts toward poetic summary (“serene anger burned through restraint”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The child momentarily sharpens her resolve, but no relationship shifts state, keeping the crucible narrow. Still, traits (albino tracker, wild intuition) color perception and action consistently, satisfying baseline credibility.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the ink reveals the tower door, crystallizing a Charged Poise—she steps into the unknown with her brother’s memory as unavoidable cost. Causal chain is thin (ink → map → door) yet coherent under a lyrical lens; the disappearing ink rule is taught early and paid off at the end. Orientation is swift: who/where/when anchored by line 3. No meaningful tightening inside the scene; escalation is imagistic rather than tactical, acceptable for Accumulative/Textural mode. Meets short-form scope: single POV, one scene, <800 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Wind-carved tents, bleached bone skin, ozone scent—details are selective, sensory, and filtered through Lira’s tracker gaze. The drone’s metallic glint against earth tones efficiently signals tech/organic clash. Micro-setting works: the spilled ink on sand becomes the pivotal map, constraining her next move. Spatial choreography is clear; no geography drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Stake—recover lost brother via time anomaly—is declared early and personal. Pressure is atmospheric (elders’ warning, child’s oracle) rather than tactical; options do not narrow, but knowledge deepens when ink reveals tower. No visible resource lost or path foreclosed on page, keeping cost conceptual. Sufficient for 600-word lyrical mode, yet lacks a mid-scene squeeze that would propel tension above 8.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme—time as fragmentary breath—emerges through ink ephemera and child’s circles, never sermonized. Subtext resides in the tension between elders’ fatalism and Lira’s refusal to forget. Final image of stepping into the tower reweights earlier ink dissolve: memory must be seized before it vanishes. Avoids tidy moral; resonance lingers in the humming residue.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Lira’s perceptions; diction (“consciously wild intuition,” “ozone and distant rain”) mirrors her calibrated ferocity. Rhythm modulates: longer reflective sentences contract into clipped “She turned the handle and stepped inside.” No dialogue to test voice distinction; internal voice remains consistent and idiosyncratic. Filter verbs minimal; prose breathes without POV leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Strong read-aloud cadence; sentence lengths vary, openings diversify. Figurative language is restrained—one metaphor per beat—preventing purple overload. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances image or decision. Minor elevation (“amber bleeding sky”) fits POV; no register drift. Clean grammar, precise punctuation, zero typos.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Disappearing-ink-as-cipher and time-fragment desert tower feel fresh, not recycled cyber-fantasy. Albino tracker trope is grounded by sensory vulnerability to eclipse light. Risk taken: lyrical accumulation over causal thriller, paid off by resonant door image. Could edge higher if midpoint offered a unique world rule; as is, synthesis is memorable but not paradigm-shifting.</comment>
