<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Elias’s interiority is concrete—his reticence shown through tactile dictionary-touching and pacing—but the “fractured sequences” epiphany is declared more than dramatized; the single micro-choice (returning the crystal) is mild, so the cost feels inferred rather than visible. Still, his embodied emotion and pattern-obsessed worldview stay consistent and particular.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the crystal’s refracted light reweights the premise—growth is non-linear—with undeniable conceptual cost. Causality under Accumulative/Textural lens holds: dust, shelves, crystal reflections accumulate until they force the new map of knowledge; the final image crystallizes options. Orientation is clean by line 3; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Library’s “suspended hush” functions as micro-setting: it constrains Elias’s pacing, filters his attention, and supplies the crystal that charges the final image. Selective sensory detail—“dust motes,” “faint scent of ink”—is woven through action, not dumped. Spatial choreography is tight; no object teleporting.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—decode growth pattern—is signaled early; pressure intensifies through accumulating sensory fragments rather than external opposition. The meaningful tightening is the crystalline reflection that reweights his stance; cost is conceptual (messy truth vs. tidy categories) rather than viscerally felt, keeping it just below high-band punch.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: knowledge grows in fractured, non-linear pulses. Final image—crystal refracting new light—offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence and prismatic imagery; no thematic echo penalties.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate maintains stable psychic distance; perceptual signature is scholar-specific—dictionaries’ gold lettering “dulled by age,” ivy’s “stops and starts.” Rhythm modulates with longer contemplative sentences early, then shorter fragments under revelation. No head-hopping; filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, information-dense; figurative language is selective (“suspended hush…like a second skin”) and does not clog high-pressure beat. One minor template cadence (“He…then he…” ×2) but it does not touch closure. Opening and final lines are sharply anchored.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: library dust + crystal optics → metaphor for epistemic growth. Risk-taking is quiet—lyric accumulative structure rather than plot twist—but coherent. Crystal trope is transformed through scholar’s lens, not worn trope. Transformation test passes: story collapses without exact crystal-and-dust pattern.</comment>
