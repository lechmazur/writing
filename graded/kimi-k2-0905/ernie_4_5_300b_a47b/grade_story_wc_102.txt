<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is lyrical but leans on abstract self-diagnosis (“spiritually curious,” “need to understand”) rather than embodied contradiction. The pilgrim memory is recalled, not dramatized, so it informs but doesn’t pressure present choice. Her final shift to healer is declared, not tested by a forked decision with visible cost. No secondary character on page, so no relationship crucible; head-count is clean.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the glowing pool reweights the premise—unused love is stored interstitially—with undeniable emotional cost felt in Lira’s eased breath. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: repetition of glowing, breath, and light patterns tighten until the final image reconfigures meaning. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“twilight viaduct”). Causality is soft—drop of tear → shift in perception—but acceptable under lyric design; no contradiction at exit.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Twilight viaduct, glowing blossoms, and camera obscura are rendered with selective sensory filters that mirror Lira’s attention. The pool-as-micro-setting directly constrains the final revelation and charges the closing image, satisfying 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is clean; no geography drift. Idiom stays literary-lyric, consistent with focalizer’s artist sensibility.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find where unused love is stored”—is signaled early but remains conceptual; no external obstacle or forked choice raises concrete cost. Tightening occurs when breath-method reveals the ember-trail, yet this is discovery, not foreclosure of options. Price is emotional peace, not a forfeiture that alters later tactics. Escalation is an accumulative brightening, adequate for lyric mode but thin under causal scrutiny.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Theme emerges organically: unused love as latent radiance reframed through viaduct, pool, and breath. No explicit thesis stated; final image answers the pilgrim’s question non-literally. Ambiguity is purposeful—reader left to feel rather than decode moral. One minor echo-risk: “unused love” is repeated, but it is the core question, not a tacked maxim, so waiver applies.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric maintains consistent distance; perceptual signature favors translucent, luminous diction that suits artist-POV. No dialogue, so no convergence issues. Rhythm modulates with breath pacing, supporting thematic machinery. Filter verbs (“she felt”) are few and justified by reflective mode.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is vivid but occasionally overwritten: three consecutive sentences open with participial light imagery (“glowing,” “shimmering,” “lit from within”) in the first 100 words, creating template cadence. Mixed metaphor risk—“twilight…clung like a secret” and “foggy lucidity”—but does not obscure causality. No looped paraphrase; sentences advance knowledge. Read-aloud rhythm is musical; minor tightening would reach 8+ band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fusion of camera obscura artist with Kwan Yin’s tear and breath-reveal method is fresh; metabolizes spiritual-tech trope into lyric quest rather than exposé. Pilgrim-of-sparks reincarnation thread could feel prompt-derived, but specificity of ember-trail and interstitial-love resolution transforms it. Risk-taking in non-linear, image-driven structure is coherent and paid off. Not quite unforgettable, but angle is non-obvious.</comment>
