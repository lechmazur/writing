<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara’s altruism is constant but never complicated by contradictory impulse; the absence of interior contradiction keeps her just shy of full individuation. The settlers’ shift from fear to solidarity is sketched in collective strokes rather than through single named exemplars under pressure, so micro-choices that would make the group feel like discrete people are missing. Still, her transparency and the visible cost of her fading at the end give the arc a credible, gentle sting.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the arch holds, the nebula flares, Elara fades—cost is felt in her vanishing and the bell’s lone chime. Causality is lyric rather than tight because the settlers’ success is a chorus act without individuated turning points; the lens is Accumulative/Textural and the pattern holds. Orientation is clean inside 120 words and the single transition (dawn → sunset) is legible. A hairline slip: the chalk messages multiply without showing how each new instruction changes tactical options, so escalation is more cadence than compression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The copper bell’s patina, the pearl-fruited trees, and the floating rock arches are tactile, weight-bearing, and mirrored in the final image where the bell becomes the arch’s keystone. Sensory hierarchy is biased toward Elara’s gentle auric perception—shimmers, chimes, dew—which keeps description filtered and purposeful. Spatial choreography across the orchard and beneath the arch is tracked without drift; weather (twilight) is used to time the nebula’s payoff. The setting actively constrains the repair tactics (ropes, pulleys, chanting) and recharges at closure when the nebula bathes the mended arch—meets 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save the arch or lose orchards and sky-peace—is signaled in paragraph two and deepens through each chalk message. Escalation is accumulative: each dawn message thickens communal resolve rather than narrows tactical options; the meaningful tightening is the bell’s elevation to keystone, a symbolic transfer that carries conceptual cost when Elara fades. No individual reversal or resource loss is dramatized, but the collective chant-and-rope beat gives visible effort. Cost is felt post-peak in the ghost’s dissolution—sufficient for 8-band, not the sharper price 9+ demands.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—hope as communal garden—emerges through the recurring bell-to-orchard-to-nebula living metaphor rather than any stated thesis. The final image of a lone chime in empty twilight reweights all prior chalk exhortations into an audible after-echo, achieving CR. Subtext operates in Elara’s unseen handwriting: her messages are literal yet remain ghostly, creating gentle irony about belief. No moral is declared; the settlers’ silence under the glowing arch lets the visual answer the thematic question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Narrative voice maintains mythic distance—long cadences, soft consonants, repeating triads (“the arches hold the sky…”)—that suits an altruistic ghost story. Filter verbs are minimal; perception is encoded in sensory verbs (“shimmer,” “chime,” “flare”). No dialogue, so voice convergence risk is waived. Psychic distance is stable at panoramic soft-focus; the only micro-shift is the final contraction to the bell’s single sound, a purposeful tightening that pays off the taught pattern.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyric yet propulsive: parallel triplets create incantatory rhythm without mechanical monotony. Figurative language is selective—one metaphor per beat—and stays coherent (arch as sentinel, nebula as sanctuary). Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new visual or social detail. The opening and closing lines act as symmetrical bookends that recharge the bell image, satisfying the read-aloud ear test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of ghost-as-gardener, chalk-graffiti diplomacy, and orchard planet with floating geology feels fresh yet inevitable. Risk is quiet—no twist, no villain—but the inversion of haunt trope into community catalyst gives the premise lift. Floating rock arches risk cliché, yet their erosion becomes a literal deadline that pressures communal choreography. Transformation test passes: the story would collapse without Elara’s intangible gardening and the bell’s tonal payoff.</comment>
