<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Nana Marisol’s insurgent past and plant telepathy are shown through memory and momentary sensation, not label-speak, and her final choice to plant the embryo is rooted in her lifetime of balancing tradition and change. The interiority stays concrete—hands trembling, sulfur mist, blistering palms—so the emotional stakes feel earned. The only slack is the instant leap from “legend” to decisive action; a micro-beat of her recalling a specific wartime loss tied to the embryo myth would have locked causality. Still, her refusal to control the future crystallizes a credible endurance with cost.

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: kite script → plant whispers → dig → hatch → embryo → plant it. Each step shrinks options and raises cost. The hatch opening on the first try is a touch convenient, but the price—blistered hands, drone risk, irreversible release of destiny—keeps the turn earned. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the glowing amber sphere in the bubbling spring reweights all prior talk of tradition vs. evolution into a living future whose price is still unfolding.

<comment>Volcanic mud, sulfurous steam, and rusted hatch metal are filtered through an ex-guerrilla’s practiced eye—every texture is also a memory trigger. The blackberry thorns scratching her knuckles while she frees the kite is a micro-setting detail that later mirrors the hatch’s sharp edge, so environment literally constrains her body. Only the drone patrol window is stated, not shown as a sensory threat (sound of rotors, searchlight glare), so the spatial tension never peaks. Still, the hot-spring bowl becomes the story’s crucible, charging the final image with geothermal literalness.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will she seize or release engineered destiny?—is signaled when the plants whisper “choose wisely.” Pressure tightens once: dig before drones return. That single narrowing is sufficient at this length, and the cost (blisters, possible discovery, irreversible planting) is visible. No off-stage rescue; the embryo’s glow is the direct consequence of her agency. Stakes stay personal-local, avoiding telescopic bombast.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the tension between tradition as cage and tradition as seedbed, never sermonized. The embryo is a literal seed, the hot spring a literal womb, so the central metaphor grows from event, not assertion. Final image—amber light seeping into soil—offers a non-literal answer: evolution is nurture, not control. No late thesis statement; the kite tail’s cryptic spiral silently reprises as the hatch key, reweighting earlier rebellion into future cultivation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person distant stays anchored in Marisol’s sinewy, plant-attuned perception: “melody of roots and chlorophyll” is idiom she could own. No head-hop; plant whispers arrive as external sensory data, not omniscient exposition. Syntax shortens under drone pressure (“Dig here. Before the drones return.”), then widens into lyrical cadence for the planting beat, so rhythm tracks emotional temperature. Voice never defaults to workshop generality; even “reconstruction crews had left for the day” carries her skeptical veteran tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence slips in the Uprising, drone patrols, and regime fear without outline feel. Metaphors stay coherent—kite tail as wounded bird, amber as future-capsule—no mixed vehicles. Only minor loop: “the script began to unravel, its meaning blooming” repeats the unspool image within three lines. Final image is clean, no scaffold, and propels outward.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Fusing insurgent-grandmother trope with plant telepathy and genetic-destiny embryo could feel kitchen-sink, yet each element is filtered through her specific wartime trauma and post-war gardener identity. Hot-spring vault as rebel archive is a fresh geographic twist; amber embryo as negotiable seed rather than weapon subverts typical McGuffin use. Risk is taken by making the climax an act of release rather than possession; the quiet planting refuses thriller inflation and feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.7</grade>
</comment>Setup: first paragraph establishes her insurgent past and current rebuilding role. Development: she alone decides to dig, defying drone risk and crew ignorance. Closure: her insurgent identity reframes from fighter to planter—destiny released, not seized. Cost is blistered palms and future uncertainty. Removing her veteran cunning breaks the dig decision and the final shrug at being called mad.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>9.2</grade>
</comment>Present in first beat as legend, handled at midpoint inside amber sphere, and reweighted at close when she buries it to grow rather than weaponize. Its glow literally seeds the spring, so the object drives both turn and image. Without the embryo, the kite script is just graffiti and the story has no payoff.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.9</grade>
</comment>Concept shapes stakes from the moment plants whisper “choose wisely.” It forces the final fork: control destiny vs. cultivate it. The script’s spiral lock is a literal implant interface, making the idea materially operational. Removing it collapses the moral tension and the closing reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade>
</comment>Accidental telepathy is seeded via bombing-raid flashback, enables the script decoding beat, and costs her the static shock when she touches the kite tail. Without plant input the cipher stays dead and the hatch never opens. Trait is not ornamental; it is the sole decryption key.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>9.5</grade>
</comment>Unseal is the central causal verb: every subsequent event flows from prying open the hatch. It is also the thematic unseal of fixed destiny. The physical act is dramatized with blister cost and drone clock. Replace “unseal” with “find” and the entire second half vaporizes.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.8</grade>
</comment>Kite tail script appears in paragraph 1, is physically traced into mud, and its spiral symbol literally unlocks the hatch. Mechanics matter: the plants translate the glyphs, proving the decoding is not hand-waved. Without this vector the embryo stays buried and the story stalls.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.0</grade>
</comment>Setting supplies the buried vault, the sulfur-soaked mud that softens for digging, and the geothermal heat that incubates the embryo at the end. Steam hides her from drones, bubbling water provides the final cradle. Springs are not backdrop; they are the womb she chooses for evolution.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade>
</comment>Reconstruction era is stated early and justifies abandoned tools and absent crews, creating the window for unsupervised digging. It also supplies the ideological conflict: rebuild old bathhouse vs. seed new future. Timeframe is not a live clock, so it enables rather than pressures; hence mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade>
</comment>Motive is voiced as internal desire to “evolve tradition with intent” and is dramatized when she rejects control and plants the embryo, literally growing a new tradition. Friction is felt: she risks crew censure and drone arrest for this choice. motive is not asserted in final paragraph; the planting act is the embodied argument.</comment>

</comment>Tone is not a required element; the piece maintains lyric-urgent tone throughout, modulating from cauldron-steam menace to seed-light wonder, but no numeric score requested.</comment>
