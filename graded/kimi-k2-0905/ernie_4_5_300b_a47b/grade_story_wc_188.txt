<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s guilt-driven quest and her mentor-shaped “filter” reflex give her a sharp, embodied interior life; every micro-choice (touching apron hem, kerosene knot flare, chant cadence) is character-specific and advances her climb from shame to self-ignition. The only drag is a late, slightly abstract epiphany—“shadows aren’t darkness but unlit potential”—that is told more than dramatized, blunting the cost ledger a hair. Still, her flaws combust into the final stance with credible fire-craft logic and earned upward spin.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece teaches its pattern early—ambient sensory filtration, mosaic note, knot flame—and each beat thickens density until the domed lilies detonate into a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights “hopelessness” as fuel. Causality is lyric, not linear, but the tightening is legible: every filament of imagery loops back to charge the final golden bloom with conceptual cost. No orientation debt; closure lands on-page with visible flame and atmospheric shudder.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>“Blooming fortress” is no postcard; the fire-lilies, liquid-light fountains, and serpentine corridors actively channel Lira’s movement and furnish the explosive substrate for her craft. Micro-setting rule satisfied: the kerosene-soaked knot and dormant lily chamber constrain tactical choices and literally provide the fuse for the climax. Sensory hierarchy obeys her pyrotechnician bias—smell of sulfur, click of petals—so environment, tool, and body conflate into one combustible instrument.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—outrunning the gravity of her own failure—is signaled in the first 100 words and tightened by each sensory filter: every new bloom of light raises the wager that she’ll either transcend or repeat the pavilion fire. The chain-reaction ignition is agent-driven; she places the knot, triggers the lilies, and the sky’s reflected glow makes the price (memory of scarred children) shimmer inside the triumph. Cost is visible in the laugh that catches her raw throat—triumph laced with lingering scorch.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the transmutation of shame into generative light; no moral is stated—the final image of starless sky mirroring lily-fire reprices “shadow” from moral blot to unstruck potential. Subtext lives in the knot’s oily figure-eight: infinity reclaimed from disgrace. The refrain “fire spins upward” arcs from mentor koan to embodied belief without editorial nudge, yielding an afterglow that feels honest, not sentimental.</comment>

<comment>Third-person lyric remains tight to Lira’s perceptual signature—pyrotechnician diction, rhythmic chant fragments, fire-color vocabulary—without head-hop. Syntax stretches into incantatory parallelism at pressure peaks, mirroring her own vocal tic, then contracts to clipped sensory notices. No dialogue to distort voice; narration stays within her plausible lexicon and resists purple inflation. Filter verbs are scarce and flame-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “gardens of fire-lilies that pulsed like living embers” fuses sight + metaphor + stakes in one stroke. Rhythm modulates—long sentence for approach, staccato for ignition—without algorithmic pattern. Minor paraphrase loop around “filter/filtered” appears 3× but serves motif, not clutter, and never infects closure beat. No mixed metaphors or scaffold; every clause advances image, motion, or pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Freshness lies in welding fireworks craft to lyric fortress botany, turning masonry into combustible choreography; the mentor’s “filter” rule becomes literal ignition device. Conceptual risk—starless sky overwritten by human-made bloom—pays off by flipping cosmic defeat into private transcendence. Not utterly unprecedented, but synthesis feels specific to this voice and stakes; no stock dystopia or redemptive cliché.</comment>
