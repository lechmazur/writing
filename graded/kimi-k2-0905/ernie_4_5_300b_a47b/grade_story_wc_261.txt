<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mara’s scar-as-map desire is vivid, but the leap from “closure seeker” to “coffee-ring tunnel diver” feels externally scripted; no interior contradiction surfaces before she kneels. The mother’s voiceovers supply thematic labels instead of pressure-tested memories. Micro-choices (touch frost, descend) are obedient, never surprising. Earned renunciation lands, but the emotional cost is declared—“heart light”—rather than embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: hourglass frost → tunnel → visions → shatter → epiphany. Orientation clear by word 60. Closure is a Charged Poise: the scar’s meaning reconfigured, cost implied in “no longer pain but connection.” However, the tunnel’s rules (coffee rings = memory portals) are asserted, not constrained; no limit or price attaches to Mara’s descent, softening the miracle’s displacement.</comment>

<comment> Tower, hourglass, scar, and ivy form a tight micro-setting that continuously presses against skin and choice. Frost, damp stone, and coffee stains are tactile, never touristy. Spatial choreography is immaculate—no floating bodies. The hourglass reappears as both portal and mirror, charging the final image; environment directly shapes tactics, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—read the scar’s story—signaled early. Tightening occurs when each coffee ring forecloses denial, forcing visceral confrontation. Cost is present (scar burns, tears fall), but escalation is iterative rather than deepening; the same pain loop repeats with new visuals. Agency is observational; Mara never tries to refuse or alter the visions, blunting the final claim of “pride.”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: scars as legible text versus scars as lived wound. Mother’s “stories are written in scars” is the single overt echo, forgiven because it is later re-weighted by Mara’s tactile re-reading. Final smile avoids moralizing; resonance lingers in the image of light on healed flesh. Ambiguity remains—what “reading” means is felt, not defined.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric close-up stays locked to Mara’s senses; no head-hop. Syntax flexes with pressure—“hum that vibrated in her teeth” is instantly embodied. Ivy whispers avoid Tolkien pastiche because the diction stays vegetal and sibilant. No dialogue to fracture voice; interior monologue is character-specific, avoiding self-help labels.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and largely loop-free; “coffee rings” recurs with变异, not churn. One scaffold pair—“She’d come seeking closure, but the hourglass had opened wounds instead”—could compress. Mixed-metaphor risk in “meteor hush” is saved by context: the universe holding breath. Tense stable, strong verbs, no filter-verb clot.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Frosted hourglass as memory tunnel is fresh; coffee-stain portals feel newly minted. Risk is moderate—lyric trauma retrieval is familiar, but vegetal telepathy and inverted meteor silence tilt it askew. Specificity of scar geography keeps it from template. No famous scene echoed; hourglass shatter is inevitable yet surprising.</comment>
