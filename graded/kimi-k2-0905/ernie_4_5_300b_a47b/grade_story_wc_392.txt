<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid—her pulse-synced lantern, the “weight of centuries”—and her shift from compliant pawn to defiant actor is legible. Yet the turn pivots on a single summary paragraph (“She’d been a fool…”) rather than a dramatized beat; the epiphany feels delivered, not earned under pressure. Director Cole remains an off-page label, so the relational crucible is missing and status dynamics unaired. The earned cost is present—she will expose him—but the internal contradiction that triggers it is asserted, not embodied in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: lantern vision → suspicion → files → resolve to expose. The hidden-compartment reveal is a mild convenience, but the prior lantern beats justify access. Closure is a Decisive Change with conceptual cost—her tactical switch to “empirical observation” severs Cole’s memory-manipulation chain. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) is firm by line 4; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The tunnel’s drippy echo, rusted ladder, and condensing walls are tactile and bias-filtered through Mara’s investigator gaze. Lantern-light shadows “writhe like living things,” steering her attention to cracks and stress fractures—setting actively guides discovery. Spatial choreography is flawless: ladder descent, wall scan, compartment location tracked without drift. The environment does not yet constrain final tactics, so the 9+ gate is open but not crossed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove the “accident” was murder—surfaces early and tightens when lantern visions contradict Cole’s verdict. One meaningful deepening: the files’ red “Eliminate” stamp escalates abstract suspicion to mortal danger. Micro-choice—she slams the file shut—signals resolve, but the price (risk to career/safety) is implied, not yet felt. Agency is internal; external stakes still gestural at word-count limit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-weapon emerges through lantern imagery and file scrawl rather than thesis statement. Subtext pulses in Eliza’s 19-c gunshot echo refracted onto modern infrastructure violence. Final image—“She was done being controlled”—is terse, avoids moralizing, yet reweights prior visions as insurgent knowledge rather than chain. Complexity lingers: lantern truth is also manipulative, so liberation is double-edged.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Mara; perceptual signature sharp—“smelled of mildew and old metal,” “light cast long shadows that seemed to writhe.” Syntax tightens under threat: fragments like “Not anymore.” No dialogue, so voice distinction n/a. Filter verbs minimal; diction remains within investigator’s plausible lexicon. Lantern’s brass, soot, red-ink “Eliminate” supply tactile idiom without brand sprawl.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, high-density: “condensation after the drought finally broke” does weather + politics in six syllables. Metaphors are sparse and apt—walls “writhe” under lantern stress—no mixed vehicles. Rhythm varies: long sensory sentence cycles into staccato “She lit the lantern.” No loops or synonym churn; one near-scaffold (“watchfully calm” repeated) but serves thematic branding. Closure line is stark, propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Fusing 19-c underground-railroad lantern with present-day infrastructure homicide feels fresh; memory-entanglement as investigative tool reframes noir evidence trope. Risk is present—magic lantern could slide into gimmick—but historical specificity (abolitionist etchings, Eliza’s fall) grounds it. Synthesis is inevitable in hindsight: lantern’s past light exposes present murder-cover-up. Not radically avant-garde, but angle is non-obvious and fully committed.</comment>
