<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—dread that beauty fades vs. thrill that it might not—remains verbal, never crystallizes into a scene-level choice; the locket is caressed but never risked, so “preserve small moments” stays an abstraction rather than a costly act.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is a lyric Charged Poise: the jetty’s sighing flowers reconfigure the covenant as an ongoing act of attention, with felt cost in her ink-stained hands; causal chain is thin—why tonight’s ritual matters now is asserted, not shown—but the accumulative lens holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The blooming jetty’s nightshade roots constrains her kneeling posture and supplies the final pulsing-heart image; sensory triage (salt-jasmine air, bruised horizon, warm locket edge) is filtered through archivist priorities, never touristy, and tracks spatially without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“keep the covenant alive through small acts”—is signaled early, but pressure is atmospheric, not tactical; no option is foreclosed, no price paid on-page; the final smile is acceptance, not escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges as “preservation is participation, not heroics”; the locket’s silver shadow and the baker’s bread reweight each other without sermon; final image of ink-stained hands keeps ambiguity—covenant may still fail—so complexity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Walnut-ink syntax is textured, rhythmic, biased toward catalog and vegetal decay; perceptual signature—“flowers pulsing like tiny hearts”—is character-specific; no dialogue, so no voice convergence; filter verbs are sparse and purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm breathes with twilight cadence; no loops, no scaffold; mixed metaphor count is low (“horizon a bruise” is earned); information density high; opening line anchors stakes, final line recharges flowers/ink motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Folk-horror pastoral angle feels fresh—archivist tending a floral jetty covenant—yet premise of “town renews sea-pact through tiny rituals” leans on familiar eco-fantasy template; specificity of walnut-ink taxonomy and nightshade roots saves it from generic.</comment>
