<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s frugality is more than back-story; it governs her micro-choices (bartering wages, kneeling to brush sand herself) and sharpens the final refusal to treat knowledge as coin. Contradictory impulses—skepticism vs hunger for transcendence—coexist in-scene, not in summary. The mentor’s death is the only interior block; it is concrete, brief, and quickly tied to her present hunger for pattern. Closure is an earned renunciation: she swears by curiosity itself, a visible cost that forecloses easier mercenary uses of the tile.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the tile becomes a mirror whose image (her face star-stitched) reweights every prior equation into covenant with the self; cost is felt because “the unknown wasn’t a void to fear—it was a dialogue” and she must now keep it open. Causal chain holds: frugality motivates the trip; tile discovery triggers wall-slide; tile-merge projects star-map; mirror forces stance crystallization. The palace’s past reuse (tomb, library, forge) is textured through cuneiform reliefs, not exposition dump, so orientation is complete before word 120. No lens ambiguity; the drive is situational—external pressure of ruins forces internal stance lock-in.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The sandstone arches and bioluminescent chamber are filtered through Elara’s astronomer gaze—star-chart eyes of gods, equations in brick—so every surface is read as schematic. Spatial choreography is exact: corridor → recessed panel → chamber → pedestal; no impossible positions. Light sources (lantern, tile glow, violet sky) track cleanly and affect visibility choices. The tile itself becomes micro-setting: its grid, bite in her palm, and final mirror-surface constrain her final oath, satisfying the 9+ gate for environment-as-tool.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can she convert frugal empirical habit into covenant with unquantifiable cosmos—tightens once: tile-meld projects mentor’s star-equations, forcing either cynical retreat or leap. She leaps; price is loss of safe objectivity: “Some truths were too vast for telescopes.” Agency is continuous: every tile placement, choice to speak to the voice, final grip on biting edge are her moves. Pressure is situational but coherent; coincidence never rescues. Cost is conceptual but legible on-page: her own starred face is the map she must now live inside.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from pattern, not sermon: equations carved in devotion, frugality as spiritual armor, star-maps as self-portrait. No tidy moral; ambiguity remains—“It’s a mirror. What you see depends on what you bring”—so covenant is ongoing dialogue, not trophy. The final Babylonian word *“Asharu”* is earned by prior tiles-to-language logic; it reweights her skepticism into binding curiosity without declaring victory. Subtext lives in gesture: dust brushing, tile edge biting palm, the refusal to pocket gold from miracles.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is consistent—astronomer’s lexicon of equations, orbits, voids—yet avoids jargon dump; each term is tied to tactile discovery. Syntax breathes with corridor tension (long clauses) then compresses under star-flare (fragments). No head-hopping; single POV stable. Voice modulates: early sardonic frugality (“Irony’s a poor substitute for answers”) softens into hushed awe in bioluminescent chamber. No dialogue contamination; disembodied voice stays formal-cosmic, Elara’s replies terse, maintaining distance control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: “dust-caked stone walls of the ancient Babylonian palace, her lantern’s flicker casting elongated shadows” does three jobs in one line—place, texture, light source. Varied sentence openers; no template cadence. Metaphors stay within physical logic (star-waiting, wind through reeds). One paraphrase soft spot: “every coin saved was a shield against the void’s indifference” repeats frugality concept already shown; not severe enough to dull closure. Final line cadence mirrors opening with desert wind, creating purposeful bookend rhythm.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The fusion of archaeological procedural with cosmic mirror is fresh; magic-square trope is inverted into self-reflective lens rather than power-granting MacGuffin. Frugality as spiritual discipline rather than comic quirk gives new moral calculus. Specific detail—cuneiform numerals that shift under gaze, bioluminescent chamber breathing—grounds the speculative in sensory fact. Transformation test fails: swap astronomer for poet and narrative still functions, limiting ceiling, but the synthesis of Babylonian math, star lore, and austerity psychology feels non-generic.</comment>
