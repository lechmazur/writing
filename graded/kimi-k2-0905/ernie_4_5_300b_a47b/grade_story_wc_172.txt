<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Contradictory impulses—profit vs. extinct-bird nostalgia—are dramatized in the egg-handling, the secret nightly recordings, and the final poured vial; each micro-choice costs him social-moral capital and forecloses the path back to pure cynicism. Interiority stays concrete (“the egg’s shell was iridescent, a ghostly blue that shimmered like a mirage”) and avoids label-speak. The Earned Stasis—he walks away without verifying the egg, already planning the resort—pays off the earlier sentimentality with visible self-inflicted loss. Voice remains singular, amorality uncompensated; no safety-hedging.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the map yellows on his wall while thunder replays in memory, crystallizing that progress now carries the tax of permanent extinction—a conceptual cost legible without exposition. Causal chain holds: drought → egg theft → salt-flat ritual → resort plan, each “therefore” tightening options. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“edge of the salt flat … cracked earth beneath his boots”). No lens ambiguity; the Accumulative/Textural pattern (cracks/echoes accumulate weight) is taught early and reconfigured at the end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Salt flat and thunder function as micro-setting that constrains the ritual: the cracked map dictates the exact depression for the egg, and the impending storm supplies the ticking clock. Sensory hierarchy is filtered through the tycoon’s selective eye—he notices iridescence, land value, and the thunder’s “low growl” but not the farmers’ names—keeping detail purposeful. Environment evolves causally: the same cracks that guide him widen by wind and rain, mirroring his moral erosion. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can he manufacture meaning from engineered loss—tightens once when he pours the last river water: that act forfeits any future claim to ecological restoration, narrowing his remaining option to monetized memory. Escalation is accretive: each beat (diversion, purchase, theft, ritual, resort plan) layers guilt-as-asset until the final image retroactively reweights the map as art. Cost is visible—empty vial, dissolved egg, thunder that will never hatch. Coincidence (storm timing) complicates, does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inverse alchemy of progress: turning living river into luxury resort converts extinction itself into a collectible aesthetic. Subtext operates in gestures—the egg cradled then abandoned, whisky drunk to birdsong—never in direct moralizing. Final Charged Poise reweights the map’s “abstract beauty” as the price of permanent loss, offering a resonant non-literal answer. Ambiguity lingers: grace is felt only as fracture, not absolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to the tycoon’s perceptual signature—salt tastes like profit, thunder like childhood guilt—without head-hop. Syntax lengthens in calmer reflections, fragments under stress (“A futile gesture, but one that felt necessary”). Diction remains within his lexicon: “iridescent,” “ecological resilience,” “luxury resort,” never academic overreach. No dialogue, so voice carries all subtext; rhythm modulates with pressure without drumbeat monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive: “He’d funded the dam that choked the river dry, then bought the land when the farmers left” compresses decades into one cause-effect line. Metaphors are selective and consistent—egg as ghost, cracks as language—never stacked in high-pressure beats. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances knowledge or image. Opening anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges map/echo motifs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Familiar trope—rich destroyer haunted by childhood sound—is inverted by making sentimentality the hidden engine of destruction: he kills the river to own the silence. Specific detail (extinct egg’s iridescence, vial of last water) transforms generic guilt into proprietary ritual. Risky quiet ending earns resonance through prior pattern rather than twist. Fresh inflection: amorality weaponizes nostalgia itself, turning conservation into a private collectible experience.</comment>
