<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Kail’s “jittery” trait is shown early through bodily detail and micro-choices, but the interiority drifts into stock phrases (“nerves frayed,” “instincts screamed”) that tell rather than embody tension. His final moment of earned calm is credible and seeded, satisfying the arc. Yet the mentor and the lantern-woman are vessels for cryptic exposition rather than real relational pressure, so the crucible test is weak. Interior contradiction is present but not layered deeply enough to reach the 8-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—aurora and pendant cadence build density toward a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the sapling image crystallizes Kail’s new stance with legible cost. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) is taught by line 3, but the causal trigger for accepting the seed is weakly motivated—he kneels because “the pendant vibrated harder,” not an active choice. One micro-turn (woman appears → gives seed) tightens once; sufficient for length, but the off-page mentor solve dilutes agency.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Aurora, frost-cracked stone, and the pendant’s hum are vividly selective and filter through Kail’s sensory panic. The ridgeway setting constrains movement—slick stones force slow kneeling, the aurora’s light shapes timing of planting—so environment charges the final image. No occupational or systemic depth required at this length; specificity is earned. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: will Kail trust the relic’s pull or keep running? Tightening occurs once: woman appears + seed offer. Cost is conceptual—the pendant stills, implying he surrenders his old jittery identity—but not viscerally felt on-page. No credible loss of option or tool; escalation is purely imagistic. Agency is reactive; he obeys vibration rather than deciding.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—legacy as seeds—emerges through pendant→sapling transformation without overt statement. Final image reweights “germinate the past” mantra, offering a quiet Conceptual Repricing. Subtext in woman’s smile and pendant silence carries more weight than dialogue. Avoids final-paragraph moralizing, but wisdom is slightly abstract; would sharpen if Kail’s earlier panic recurred as sapling leaf etched with his own heartbeat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-limited stays tight to Kail’s perceptual filter; diction (“spectral hand,” “jade and violet”) matches his hyper-alert eye. Rhythm modulates—short beats under aurora swirl, longer reflective lines post-planting. No head-hopping; mentor voice is external echo. Minor template cadence in “He’d been warned… He’d last seen…” but not intrusive. Voice is character-specific enough to reach 8-band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and mostly propulsive; figurative language is selective. One paraphrase loop: “He wondered if she’d meant for him to feel…” restates prior beat. No mixed metaphors or register drift. Scaffolding minimal; information density good. Final paragraph could trim one abstract clause to let sapling image breathe alone, preventing 8+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Seed-as-memory-relic is fresh; aurora-germination blends fantasy with ecological metaphor. Mentor’s “germinate the past” line flirts with thematic echo but is saved by being the only overt thesis. Risk is moderate—quiet lyric closure rather than twist—but stakes stay personal. Not radically original, yet specific detail (dragonfly wing runes) prevents swap-out with generic talisman.</comment>
