<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is concrete—her storm-cloud eyes, the prism biting her palm—and her micro-choice to whisper “Show me what you’ve seen” crystallizes her need. The final renunciation (“the arbor didn’t need her emotions”) is earned, but the shift from absorption to mirroring is declared rather than dramatized with new bodily cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the prism-as-lens distorts instead of discovers, reweighting her theory with visible cost—she pockets the cold prism and laughs bitterly. Causal lens holds: because she projects, the quartz flares; therefore she must accept the mirror. Orientation anchored by word 60.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Arbor, mist, frost on glass, and the prism itself all constrain action and charge the final image; the cracked frost literally shatters her method. Micro-setting (palm against cold glass) functions as tactile ground. Sensory hierarchy skews visual but tracks Mara’s obsessional gaze.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove objects absorb emotions—tightens when the arbor’s flare seems to confirm, then reverses when frost implodes. Cost is legible: her theory’s collapse forces public self-confrontation. One meaningful turn suffices; no external antagonist needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges without sermon: the desire to externalize emotion collides with the human tendency to see only self-reflection. Final image of silent arbor reweights earlier visions as projection. Avoids tidy moral; ambiguity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited sustains storm-cloud perceptual signature; diction (“crystalline branches piercing the morning mist”) stays within mystic lens. Rhythm accelerates under pressure—short clauses during flare, then exhausted cadence at end. No dialogue to judge; no head-hop.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>High information density: frost etching, prism glow, arbor pulse all serve double duty. Figurative control—“frozen lightning,” “truthful lies”—remains coherent. One scaffold loop: “She realized…revelation sinking in” could compress, but it does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Emotion-as-quartz-archive flips to mirror-projection is fresh; execution grounds trope in tactile frost and palm-bite. Risk lies in lyric micro-arc rather than plot twist. Specificity of “patterns in the frost on a car window” keeps concept from abstraction.</comment>
