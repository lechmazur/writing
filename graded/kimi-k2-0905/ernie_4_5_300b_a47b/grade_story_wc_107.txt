<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Kael’s interiority is textured—calloused fingers, glassblower’s patience—but the “contemplative” tag is asserted more than dramatized; only the final beat shows a micro-choice (keeping the cracked bookmark) that costs him the illusion of perfect answers. The mentor-backstory flash is a single reflective block that lands within the 20 % allowance and tilts his present stance, so no BRR penalty. Contradictory impulses (hunger for safe zones vs. embrace of fracture) stay largely summary until the last paragraph, keeping the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the cracked bookmark reframed as light-catcher reweights the premise with conceptual cost—he abandons the search for flawless shelters. Causality under the Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each melt-drip intensifies pattern until the schematic reveal; no coincidence resolves the stakes. Orientation is anchored by word 80 (abandoned control room, midday thaw). The price is legible in the final image; persistent constraint (the crack) shapes the last beat, satisfying the 9+ quick test, but the slight over-narration of “weighty lightness” keeps it under 8.8.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Ice, rust, and sunbeam specificity are filtered through glassblower vision—silica metaphors, refracted light—so detail feels occupational rather than tourist. The bookmark micro-setting constrains the final choice and charges the closing image, meeting the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is clean: kneel, pocket, pry, pack; no impossible moves. One minor over-label: “entropy” is named rather than shown, a hairline slip.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—protect fragile inquiry—surfaces early and tightens once when the schematic compartment opens, foreclosing the option of “no usable legacy.” Pressure grows via melt-drip cadence and revealed blueprints, coherent under Accumulative lens. Cost is visible: he abandons certainty, carries the cracked bookmark as permanent reminder. No second reversal, but one meaningful deepening suffices at this length; the lack of external antagonist keeps it below 8.2.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: fracture as prerequisite for light. Subtext lives in gesture—tracing the crack, aligning it with sunbeam—never sermon. Final image reweights the premise without moralizing, meeting the 9+ quick test, but the earlier self-narration (“Its resistance mirrors…”) edges toward explicit thematizing, a −0.2 drag.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Kael’s perceptual signature: glassblower’s attention to viscosity, refraction, tension. Self-narration device is signaled early and modulates under pressure—shortens to “Even broken things can catch the light”—so rhythmic control holds. No dialogue, hence no voice-drift issues. One filter verb cluster (“he wondered… he mused…”) in mid-section prevents 9.0.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies: long reflective lines alternate with clipped discovery beats. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is sparse and occupational—molten silica, bubble trapped—so density never cloys. A single mixed micro-metaphor (“ghost of a system”) is minor enough to leave closure untouched.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Post-collapse glassblower seeking “inquiry zones” is fresh; cracked bookmark as map-light conduit feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in self-narration device pays off without obscuring clarity, earning the +0.3 within-band bonus. The thawing-heart concept is familiar but reweighted through glass-craft specifics, avoiding template drift.</comment>
