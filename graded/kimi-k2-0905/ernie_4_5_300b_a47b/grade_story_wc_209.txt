<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s “quietly driven” trait is shown through concrete, costly choices—creeping into the cathedral at night, climbing scaffolding, tracing patterns until her teeth ache. The contradiction between public mural duty and private obsession sharpens when she paints the shadows, not the jasmine, showing a visible pivot. Her grandmother’s echo (“reckon through the hidden layers”) seeds internal conflict that culminates in the final smile, paying the cost of accepting an unending mystery. Interiority stays concrete; no diagnostic labels intrude.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: light-shifts and glass layers accrue meaning until Mara’s final inversion of flower→shadow reweights the stake. Orientation is anchored within 120 words (amber pavilion, autumn, postcard cache). Closure is a Charged Poise: “the window’s final layer remained etched but unbroken” crystallizes options and cost without solving the puzzle. The persistent constraint—glass that hums, bruises, and withholds—shapes every tactics and the final poise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Amber pavilion, latticed shadows, and melting snow provide tactile, evolving pressure; the cathedral scaffold creaks under bodily weight, integrating body-with-tool as micro-setting. Light itself becomes a manipulable object—violet glow, frosted veins—constraining Mara’s choice to paint darkness rather than bloom. Sensory selection tracks her artist gaze: she notices gradations of frost before safety. Final image of “autumn leaves fell once more” recharges the opening motif with new conceptual weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode the glass language before the abbey restoration ends—tightens when each light-shift reveals fainter etchings, risking permanent loss. One meaningful deepening: morning roots → noon star charts → twilight heartbeats progressively foreclose wrong readings, forcing Mara to abandon literal jasmine for negative-space shadows. Cost is visible: bruised palms, aching teeth, sleepless circuits, and public murals that now “whisper” rather than declare. Escalation is textural but legible; coincidence never rescues.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of light/dark: flowers bloom at night in communion, not defiance. Subtext lives in gesture—painting silence around the jasmine rather than the bloom itself. The final reconfiguration (“mysteries yet to unfold”) resists moral tidy-up, offering earned ambiguity. Recurring postcard/etching motif constrains interpretive choices and is reweighted in the last line, not harvested for symbolic check-box.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person fixed on Mara sustains perceptual signature—she sees root systems, star charts, heartbeats where tourists see décor. Syntax lengthens under obsession, contracts under physical risk (“glass hummed… teeth ache”). No dialogue clutter; Sister Agatha’s two interruptions carry subtext of maternal warning. Free indirect style cleanly slides between external motion and interior calculus without filter-verb bloat.</comment>

<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm alternates between lyrical accumulation and crisp action beats. Figurative language is selective—fiery confetti, map to the hush—never stacked in high-pressure beats. No synonym loops or template cadence; each sentence advances image or knowledge. Minor scaffold: “the postcards belonged to her grandmother” could compress, but does not touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Fusion of botany, stained-glass cartography, and negative-space muraling feels fresh yet inevitable. The night-bloom premise is inverted from rebellion to communion, avoiding eco-cliché. Risky structural choice—textural escalation rather than causal reversals—pays off in final charged poise. Specificity of Elias Thorn’s buried sketches and violet glass layer prevents swap-out genericity.</comment>
