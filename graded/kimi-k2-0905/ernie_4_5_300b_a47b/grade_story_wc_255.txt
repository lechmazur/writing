<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Elias’s interiority is evocative—his synesthetic ambition, his sideways seeing—but the pivot to “I’ve just started to see” feels sudden; the moth’s whisper and mural-vision are imposed more than earned by prior micro-choices. Marla’s motives (phoenix fire as deliberate gift) are asserted in expositional flash rather than dramatized contradiction, so the relationship crucible never truly heats. The colorblindness is shown pressing one choice—accepting cobalt dust—but the final stance leap overshoots the visible stair-steps of causality.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the sky-painted fractals reweight beauty’s locus from perfection to cracked glass, with felt social spectacle cost as tourists gawk. Causal chain is mostly accumulative: dust → mural blooms → reed tongue heats → secret revealed; because/therefore links are soft—Elias does not actively test the mural, he “discovers” it. The Orientation Test is satisfied by word 80. Lens holds as Accumulative/Textural; one meaningful tightening (dust ignition) is on-page.</comment>

<comment>Molten-glass orbs, kiln flames, and reed-glint anchor the courtyard as a tactile workshop that constrains Elias’s palette and supplies Marla’s barter economy. Selective sensory triage—sound of cricket-click brass, moth-wing iridescence—mirrors colorblind POV. Spatial choreography stays clean; tourists queue only after plant-light show, so scale escalates logically. Setting charges the final image: airborne fractals literalize the courtyard’s glass medium into sky-canvas.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—proving beauty in imperfection—signals early; pressure tightens once via cobalt dust gamble. Cost is conceptual (Elias abandons grayscale purity) but not viscera-felt; no tool, stamina, or social credit visibly forfeited. Escalation is pattern-break rather than option-narrowing; coincidence (moth inside rose) complicates without protagonist agency. The mural bloom is spectacular yet passively received, muting tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: imperfection as fiery fuel crystallizes in glass-bird-shard phoenix image. Subtextual gesture—Marla’s shattered-bird memory painted by Elias—unites beauty and complicity without sermon. Final sky-streak avoids tidy moral; tourist murmur leaves ethical ambiguity intact. Moth-whisper “Awaken” verges on echo, but resonance is earned by earlier plant-ivy spiral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is crisp—colorblind painter notices glint, spiral, rustle rather than hue; syntax grows longer and fractal under mural rush, mirroring visual overflow. No head-hop; single POV stable. Dialogue sparse but tonally distinct: Marla’s glass-shatter laugh vs Elias’s measured curiosity. Free indirect dips cleanly: “he’d long suspected…” aligns with present micro-choice to trade. Minor template cadence in “the… the…” plant list, but rhythm breathes with scene.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Strong information density: single sentences fuse sensory, symbolic, and causal work (“cobalt dust glittered like starlight, but he’d sworn off pigments”). Metaphors cohere under glass/fire/cluster optics; no mixed vehicles. Minor loop: “the plants shuddered… the ivy curled… the rose’s petals unfurled” repeats syntactic stem for rhetorical triad—acceptable as pattern-teaching crescendo. Final line “I’ve just started to see” is crisp, propulsive closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: colorblind painter + post-phoenix barter-magic + plant-communication creates non-obvious causal palette. Phoenix-as-imperfection-arson twist inverts restorative trope; glass-shard-in-feathers image is specific, not catalog quirky. Risky sky-paint release pays off visually and thematically. Transformation test fails—names/skin could swap yet arc holds—so ingenuity resides in concept mash-up rather than character singularity.</comment>
