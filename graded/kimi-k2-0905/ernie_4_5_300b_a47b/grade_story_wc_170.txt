<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lirael’s grief-linked motive is clear and embodied in the locket, but her interiority repeats “perceptively calm” instead of letting contradiction tear her. The sister-image is vivid yet never complicates Lirael’s choices mid-scene; she executes the plan flawlessly, so no flaw drives a visible cost. The ending renunciation is implied, not dramatized—she simply walks away—so the earned price feels withheld from the reader.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the mirrors reset yet the meadow-image proves the song worked, reweighting possibility with conceptual cost—the sister stays unreachable. Causality is lyric-accumulative: each mirror activation tightens the same stake rather than branching plot, satisfying the lens. The locket-heartbeat metronome is the persistent constraint that shapes tactics throughout. One causal gap: the bells’ interruption never threatens failure, so the final success feels pre-ordained rather than wrested.</comment>

<comment>Wet prism parapet, jasmine, and bioluminescent trees are sensuous, selective, and filtered through Lirael’s painter-eye. The terrace’s echo and slick glass directly constrain her sonic method and footing, charging the climax. Micro-setting (locket, condensation) doubles as emotional barometer—every shimmer answers her song. Spatial choreography stays clean in a single-location scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“persuade mirrors to show beyond”—is signaled early and escalates mirror-by-mirror, each reframing risk of failure. Agency is present yet low-conflict: no mirror resists hard enough to force a tactical shift or sacrifice. The borrowed heartbeat quickens, but Lirael never risks losing it, so the felt price is muted. Still, the final image forecloses the fantasy of reunion, tightening options under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of art as transfiguration of absence emerges through mirrored meadows and forest paths rather than statement. The children’s lullaby, warped into code, quietly argues that grief can be sung into new worlds yet never healed—an insight earned by the failed reach toward the sister. No moralizing line intrudes; the final smile across dimensions reweights the premise with conceptual cost. Ambiguity lingers: did she open portals or merely accept illusion?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person hovers at a lyric distance that matches the painter-mirage concept; diction (“prism parapet,” “bioluminescent light”) is specific, consistent, and never drifts into workshop-generic. Syntax lengthens and shortens with the song’s breath, creating audible rhythm without drumbeat monotony. No dialogue appears, so voice purity remains unbroken. The perceptual signature—light fracturing through wet glass—recurs like a leitmotif, anchoring POV.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid: “colors bleed where her touch distorted the light” does triple sensory duty. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; each sentence advances mirror, music, or body. One mixed vehicle—“chain coiled like a question”—is minor amid otherwise precise metaphors. Final paragraph slows cadence to match exhaustion, then releases, earning the hush.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Mirage-painter who sings mirrors into alternate worlds is a fresh synthesis of sound-art and grief-magic; the heartbeat-crystal locket literalizes pulse as paint. The trope of dead sister is redeemed by refusal to resurrect her—instead she becomes a reflected possibility, not a fetched ghost. Risk lies in the lyric stillness: no antagonist, no fight scene, yet the piece commits fully to its incantatory logic. Removing any mirror-image would collapse the emotional proof, so specificity feels inevitable.</comment>
