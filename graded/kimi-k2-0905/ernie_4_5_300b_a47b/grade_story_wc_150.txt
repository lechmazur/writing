<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lirael’s returnee motive is dramatized through micro-choices—fitting the sundial, speaking to bones—but the interior contradiction never sharpens into a single risky decision; the final “choice to follow” is voiced, not embodied. Backstory blocks are anchored and brief, yet the emotional cost stays lightly sketched. Enough for pressure, not yet for flaw-driven compulsion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the shrine’s pulse reconfigures diaspora absence into possible return with visible communal cost—villagers arriving at orchard’s edge. Causal chain intact: sundial → alignment → harmonic tone → convergence. Reflection kept under 20 % and tied to present stimuli. No orientation debt; anchor who/where by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Catacomb-orchard is not backdrop but active agent: roots coil round ankles, shift to reveal springs, tighten at harmonic tone. Sensory triage follows Lirael’s attention—myrrh scent, bone crunch, lantern flicker—mirroring her cautious progress. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly as she descends, sits, is observed. Environment’s constraint directly shapes the final image of communal threshold.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore faith via shrine—signalled early; tightening occurs when roots react to sundial, turning abstract hope into physical resonance villagers can witness. Protagonist agency drives escalation: she alone positions relic, speaks to trees, kneels in light. Cost is communal and symbolic rather than personal body-risk, but legible on page. One meaningful intensification suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of reclamation through curious listening emerges via image pattern—bones, roots, star-maps—rather than thesis statement. Final tableau of gathered villagers offers resonant reweighting: diaspora may re-cohere without promise of success. No moralizing sentence; ambiguity lingers. Particulars trump abstractions.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Lirael’s perception, diction within her plausible lexicon (“humming energy,” “cautious enchantment”). Free indirect slides cleanly; no filter-verb stacks. Rhythm modulates—short clauses under root-choke, longer reflective cadences at sundial alignment. Distinct perceptual signature evident; no dialogue to judge.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong information density: one sentence often handles atmosphere, action, interior (“roots twisting like serpents through ribcages”) without metaphor clash. Varied sentence openings; paragraphs breathe. One paraphrase loop (“she thought of…she thought of…”) mid-climax costs −0.2; otherwise propulsion clean. No scaffold or artifact touches closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard as living shrine is fresh; sundial-as-key concept familiar but re-cast through bone-littered roots. Risk taken with quiet, accumulative structure rather than confrontation; pays off in communal resonance. Specificity of murals, port-fever delay, myrrh scent prevents generic slide. Could swap names yet emotional arc remains; still, angle feels memorable.</comment>
