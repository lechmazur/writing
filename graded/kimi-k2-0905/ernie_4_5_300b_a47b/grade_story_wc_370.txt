<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eleanor’s interiority is specific—her thumb on frayed gold, the hush of empathy in a hooded room—and her contradictory desire to hide inside revelation drives every beat; the final cradle of letters earns her renunciation with visible cost. Flaw: “compassionate recluse” is named once rather than shown through micro-choice. </comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A tight causal spine: invitation → password → map → mirrors → letters; each step narrows her options while the mother’s voice retroactively furnishes motive. Closure lands as Charged Poise—she stays while leaving, cost felt in the hush against her back. </comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The library’s oak shelves, perpetual candle-twilight, and mirror-chamber distortions constrain every move; the crumpled invitation and key act as micro-settings that gate progress. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no object drifts or teleports. </comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will she let herself be seen?—tightens from anonymous observation to compulsory self-recognition in the mirrors; the blank book and key force a trade-off between grief and exposure. Cost is legible: she forfeits lifelong invisibility for the letters’ emotional reckoning. </comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of “mistake as wisdom” emerges through mirrored selves and the mother’s line “admit you’re lost”; no overt moralizing. The final image of letters against chest reweights hiding as a reversible act, achieving quiet CR. </comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is textured, Eleanor-specific: “paper unfurled like a secret too heavy to announce,” syntax lengthens under reflection, contracts under mirror shock. No head-hopping; hooded chorus remains exterior, maintaining psychic distance. </comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Zero loops, no scaffold; each sentence advances stake or atmosphere. Metaphors are clean (dust-veiled ceilings, glassy page) and never clash. High information density—every sensory detail also advances POV bias. </comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>“Secret society in a library” risks trope, but nested paradox password, blank book that shows what you bring, and mirror chamber that projects possible selves twist it into fresh emotional tech. Risk stays tied to Eleanor’s grief, not ornament. </comment>
