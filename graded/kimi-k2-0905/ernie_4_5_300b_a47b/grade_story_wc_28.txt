<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s “aberrant mercy” creed is dramatized in the single physical act of re-setting the tessera, but the interiority drifts into circulated phrasing (“cradle empathy in arms of steel” appears three times) rather than fresh contradiction under pressure; the retrocognitive flashes show memory but never force a micro-choice that risks failure, so the final stance feels pre-decided rather than earned at cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the re-set tessera re-weights the plaza from ruin to rebirth, visible in the final line “renamed the world, one chipped stone at a time.” Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than strict because/therefore; the lens is taught early and held. Cost is conceptual—he accepts that memory cannot prevent fire, only transform its aftermath—satisfying the 9+ quick test even though the price is oblique rather than visceral.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The shattered sky and soot-sweet air are filtered through Elias’s burnt-mouth perception; the single chipped tessera becomes the micro-setting that constrains his only possible act, charging the final image. Sensory selection is urgent and character-biased, never touristic. Spatial choreography is clean in the plaza kneel-place-stand-kneel sequence; the environment quietly mirrors internal cooling without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment> Dominant stake—can the plaza be spiritually renamed after atrocity—tightens once via the mosaic act that forecloses passive mourning. Agency is renunciation/attention rather than external victory; cost is the acceptance that prevention is impossible, transformation is the only remaining option. Escalation is textural: each retrocognitive flash increases the density of memory until the single physical gesture crystallizes the stance. Under accumulative lens this single deepening is sufficient; price is legible in the final “warm coldness” that accepts perpetual grief inside hope.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the tension between mercy and radical action; no character articulates a thesis. The tessera’s return re-codes destruction into continuity, offering a non-literal answer to how mercy survives atrocity. Subtext resides in silence—no crowd, no speech—only the quiet click of stone into stone. Ambiguity lingers: the city may still burn again, but the renamed ground now carries memory as living weight rather than wound.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person liminal voice stays tightly fused to Elias’s perceptual filters—ozone, fractured starlight, calloused-hand memory—without head-hop. Syntax grows clipped under retrocognitive flicker, then lengthens in the final paragraph, mirroring cooling resolve. No dialogue appears; narrative voice carries all subtext through imagistic precision. Diction remains within plausible post-apocalyptic lexicon; no corporate register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong rhythmic control—opening sentence’s 22-word sweep vs. closing four-beat fragment. Figurative layering is dense (“stars burned like fractured glass”) but taught early and mirrored at closure, satisfying pattern rule. Minor scaffold: “tessera” is repeated four times in 60-word window mid-story; the noun could have been pronominalized once. No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors; metaphor logic stays visual-reflective throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The retrocognitive radical who renames ruin via mosaic repair is a fresh synthesis of memory-as-activism; the premise feels inevitable in hindsight rather than borrowed. Specific detail—the blue wave motif, soot-sweet air—anchors universality without quirky ornament. Conceptual integrity holds: the story never retreats into heroic saviorism, staying inside modest, stone-level transformation. Risk is quiet rather than bold-structure, capping score below 8.5.</comment>
