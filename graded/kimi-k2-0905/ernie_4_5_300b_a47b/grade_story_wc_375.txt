<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is vivid—charcoal-black fingers versus starved soul—but the contradiction never sharpens into an immediate micro-choice that costs him something we can feel. The “quiet, persistent melody” and “cave listening” are evocative, yet the emotional risk stays generalized until the final beat; we sense relief but not the specific, embodied price of opening the shadow-door. Motivation is consistent, but the link between grandmother’s mnemonic gift and his own block remains thematic rather than a tool that pressures him here-now. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing, so the arc is earned, but the cost is more atmospheric than corporal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the lock clicks, the shadow-door opens, silence is “rectified,” and the final image of sketching re-weights his earlier stasis with undeniable felt cost. Causal chain is lyric-accumulative rather than tight because/therefore, but pattern is taught early (lock + canvas + cave light) and paid off in the投射 shadow. Orientation is anchored immediately (who, where, when by line 3). No telegraphing or soft resets; the grandmother memory could have tightened present causality but does not break it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Crystal cave is never catalogued; every detail (light refracting through canvas, moss under knees) is filtered through Elias’s artist eye and serves the final projection of the shadow-door. Micro-setting rule satisfied: the flat rock and lantern constrain brush placement and lock positioning, literally steering the climax. Sensory economy is biased to sight-touch, plausible for a visual artist under urgency. No credibility slips; spatial choreography holds from kneeling → canvas propping → lock insertion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“uncork suppressed creativity”—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightened once: the act of painting the lock-mouth crystallizes into the shadow-door that can’t be unseen. Escalation is accumulative: each stroke increases the literal projection of his trapped scream until the only option is to insert the broken lock into shadow. Cost is atmospheric (auroral sorrow, chest-ache) rather than a concrete forfeiture, keeping it from 8.8+ bands, but the pressure is legible and protagonist-driven.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: art as exorcism of personal silence. No explicit thesis; final image of charcoal moving again re-prices earlier “starved soul” without moralizing. Subtext operates through recurrent mouth imagery (lock-dials → screaming mouth → opened door) that reframes suppression into expression. Complexity is present—he doesn’t blame commerce, only his own fear—allowing ambiguity to linger.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited remains tightly fused to Elias’s perceptual lens: “charcoal-fingered,” “prismatic crystals refracted… across the cavern’s jagged walls.” Syntax grows shorter under pressure—“He fitted it into an invisible keyhole… click”—mirroring breathless release. No head-hopping or filter-verb bloat. Distinct texture maintained: artist sees light as pigment, lock as mouth, silence as wound.</answer>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyrical but disciplined: no mixed metaphors, no scaffold loops. Sentence rhythm alternates between long painterly clauses and urgent fragments (“He fitted it… click”). Information density high—each sentence both advances image and emotional stakes. Minor overwriter tick: “auroral sorrow” is lovely but abstract; still, it recurs intentionally and is justified by closing atmosphere rather than cluttering peak beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</comment>
<comment>Familiar trope—artist confronts creative block in magical cave—feels fresh because the mechanism is a literal projection-painting that becomes a keyhole in shadow. Broken lock as scream-mouth is an original inflection not seen in standard “artist unblocks” templates. Risk taken with accumulative lyric structure pays off in resonant final image. Could push higher if suppression cost were more socially or bodily specific.</comment>
