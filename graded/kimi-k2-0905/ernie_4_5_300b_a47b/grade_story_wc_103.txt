<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's obsession with "texture of time" drives every beat; the interiority is sensorily anchored ("the fragment bit into her palm") and her final renunciation—designing a maze "to remember"—costs her the visions she craved. Flaw: the retrocognitive ability is declared, not dramatized as a prior burden; we see effects, not the trap constraining earlier choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the garden’s photographs stabilize, the fragment dies, and Elara forfeits her voyeuristic power for the creative act of memory-making—cost is legible in the dull metal and her quiet smile. Hyperbolic geometry is the taught pattern; its collapse/reform reconfigures meaning under an Accumulative lens. One soft spot: causality of the fragment’s exact trigger is fuzzy ("as if both were trying to communicate").</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Living bridge garden is not backdrop but actuator—planks shift, vines hum, spatial loops force her retreat; the bench pixelating into fireflies is the final image-charging object. Sensory triage narrows to touch and ozone under crisis, then widens to "salt and regret" breeze—POV-filtered, never touristic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>Dominant stake—will she unravel time’s fabric—tightens when the first photo dusts and the garden groans; her agency to press the fragment collapses the bridge, forcing the forfeit. Cost is visible: luminous photographs stabilize only after she loses the visions. A second tightening would have pushed higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Theme emerges without statement: memory is not a consumable texture but a story one actively shapes; the stabilized photographs’ glow reweights the earlier decay. Subtext in Clara’s erased face refracts Elara’s own erasure. Final smile lands as earned wisdom, not platitude.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Voice is architect-eye: "hedges seemed to bend light into loops," "question-mark bridge"—precise, spatial, yet lyric. Compression ("time fraying like fabric") teaches the pattern early; no filter-verb stacks; rhythm accelerates into fragment-loss beat, then softens into closing smile.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Sentences multi-task: "the garden groaned, its living structures straining" carries sound, agency, metaphor. Near-zero scaffolding; only micro-loop is "the photographs...the photographs" in adjacent lines—doesn’t dull closure. Figurative language is patterned (fabric/threads) and paid off.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Fusing retrocognition with hyperbolic garden geometry feels fresh; the maze-designer’s pivot from puzzle-maker to memory-curator is an inversion of expected genius-plot. Risk in collapsing the entire world is rewarded by the re-materialized garden as mnemonic museum. Slight proximity to "Memory Garden" tropes keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.9</question><comment>Occupation shapes perception ("hedges bend light into loops") and motivates the final choice—she’ll build a maze to remember, not confuse. Yet no beat shows her exercising design craft mid-scene; integration is thematic, not tactical.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>9.2</question><comment>Fragment is handled in discovery, activation, and death; its iridescence → inertness mirrors the price. Removing it would erase the catalyst and the final tactile cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Fading photographs drive the entire arc: their decay triggers the experiment, their stabilization is the visible change. They constrain every tactical touch and frame the closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>Retrocognitive trap forces her experiment—visions surge uncontrollably, pushing her to seize the fragment; losing them is the forfeiture. Trap is label-declared early but enacted in the visions that compel action.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</question><comment>Disintegration of bridge & photos is the decisive visual turn; word is used once but action is the hinge between collapse and reform. Could swap synonym ("unravel") yet the pixel-firefly image is signature.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</question><comment>Hyperbolic geometry is named early, motivates the "impossible angles," and justifies the world’s re-formation post-collapse. Mechanics remain metaphorical rather than mathematically precise, but the pattern holds.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>9.5</question><comment>Garden is co-protagonist: it breathes, retracts, re-forms; its living railings and shifting planks physically limit her path and supply the firefly raw material for the final image. Story collapses without it.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</question><comment>None required.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Desire to "discover the texture of time" seeds every micro-choice; the final realization—time is a story, not a textile—re-prices her goal, costing her the voyeuristic power she coveted.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Quaking reverie saturates diction ("slow-motion symphonies," "ozone and old paper") and modulates from trembling awe to quiet certitude; the final smile is the cadence shift that resolves the tremor.</comment>
