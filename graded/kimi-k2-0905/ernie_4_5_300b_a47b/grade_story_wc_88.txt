<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s “clean-slate” premise is vivid, but her guilt manifests in abstract labels—“fragments of guilt surfaced like ink”—rather than embodied contradiction. The moment she names J.T. feels telepathic; no sensory cue or prior knowledge justifies the leap. Interiority leans on diagnostic shorthand: “a jaded wonder, fragile but real.” These lapses keep her change evocative yet not fully earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise: Mara vows to “read the world more carefully,” cost legible in the secret glow of the baseball. Causal chain, however, is thin—how does J.T.’s lake appearance follow from the newspaper map? Orientation clears within 120 words, but the lake’s rule-set (regret-fed bacteria) is asserted, not demonstrated. The lens holds as Accumulative/Textural; the final cadence reweights meaning, yet a firmer cause→effect bridge would sharpen the beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The bioluminescent lake is tactile—“water reaching her knees, its glow seeping into her skin”—and mirrors Mara’s inner state without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography is clean: grate→descent→water’s edge. The baseball’s glow at the end recharges the motif. One minor over-clar: “the labyrinth wasn’t physical, she realized” tells what the image already shows.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—empathy vs erasure—signals early; escalation occurs when reflections shatter, narrowing her options to “carry its weight with grace.” Cost is implied but not viscerally felt; no tool, stamina, or social credit is visibly lost. Because the lake functions as oracle rather than obstacle, pressure plateaus rather than tightens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: erased memory cannot delete unlived possibility. Subtext beats thesis; J.T. never declares “empathy is good,” she kicks water and lets shards speak. The baseball’s final glow reconfigures regret as compass rather than burden. One soft echo of thematic label—“the labyrinth of choices”—is spoken aloud; minimal deduction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person lenses Mara’s attention—“walls slick with moss that pulsed faintly blue”—with consistent perceptual bias. No POV drift; J.T.’s interior stays opaque. Syntax mirrors emotional tempo: short clauses under pressure, longer reflective cadences at rest. Filter verbs rare; rhythm breathes with scene.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is compact, high-density; most lines advance image or motive. Metaphors are spare—“bioluminescent algae swirled like drowned stars”—and do not crowd peak beats. One scaffold trace: “She didn’t know if she believed… but for the first time… she felt something akin to hope” layers three hedge clauses. Otherwise clean; no loops or register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Neural-reset spy + regret-fed bacteria + time-traveller’s baseball fuses noir and sf without gimmickry. The lake-as-mirror-of-abandoned-lives is fresh, yet conceptually inevitable once stated. Risk is taken—oracle scene instead of chase—but coherence never wavers. Detail particularity (1987 sports-page margin map) keeps it from sliding into trope collage.</comment>
