<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elinor’s seed-sorting precision and tactile care are vivid, but interiority stays safe; the moonstone prod is the only micro-choice that visibly costs her prior skepticism. Folklore shift from dismissive to believer happens off-stage, so the decisive stance change feels lightly earned. Still, her embodied ritual—tracing light with calloused thumb—anchors a credibly solitary, vocation-driven arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: dust-speck → monuments → legible leaves → triad of actions; each beat tightens options under an accreting pattern. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—Elinor’s new charge to warn and seek Lirael—paid for by dissolving dust and the hush lifting; cost is conceptual but legible. Orientation is clear by line 6; no teleporting props. Minor softness: storm/silverseed warning arrives as external gift rather than deduction under pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>“Ashen skyborne arbor” is economically seeded; filtered green light, moss floor, and floating branch mist all constrain movement and visibility. Seed-table, chisel-marked stones, and bark sliver act as micro-settings that channel the monuments ritual. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating rooms. Final image of softening sky and leaning branches recharges earlier “ashen” filter, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode leaf-message—signals early; pressure escalates via because/therefore linkages as dust enables leaf legibility. Cost is conceptual (loss of disbelief, dissolution of dust) rather than tangible resource loss; felt price is moderate. No antagonist or reversal, but single meaningful deepening suffices for length. Agency sits mostly with Elinor’s ritual act; storm warning is externally delivered, slightly blunting personal jeopardy.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: folklore as living language, memory externalized in miniature monuments. Moonstone and leaf motifs recur only when they alter Elinor’s tactical stance, avoiding tokenism. Final image reframes prior “superstition” as practical grammar—quiet but resonant. No closing moral; ambiguity lingers on who Lirael is, inviting reader extension.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Narrative voice sustains hush-toned lyricism with controlled syntax: “arbor’s canopy filtered the light into a mossy green haze.” Perceptual signature is seed-centric, weight-and-color calibrations, aligning with vocation. No dialogue, so voice contamination avoided. Register stays consistent; minor filter-verb clusters (“seemed to lean”) are voice-motivated and don’t stall flow.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is mostly lean and image-dense; sentences vary in length and avoid template cadence. Mixed-metaphor risk in “branches twisted like ancient veins” is justified by arbor’s living-organ conceit. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; information dual-loaded (“moonstone dust speck glinting…whisper”). Peak beat (“leaves…markings now clear and steady”) remains uncluttered, preserving momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Floating-tree seed-sorting milieu feels fresh; coupling it with micro-memorial cairns is a specific, non-obvious synthesis. Folklore-as-encryption reframes familiar “messages from nature” trope without gimmickry. Concept commits fully—no late rule changes—and ends with earned stasis rather than twist. Risk resides in quiet stakes; emotional payoff is contemplative, not startling, keeping score sub-9.</comment>
