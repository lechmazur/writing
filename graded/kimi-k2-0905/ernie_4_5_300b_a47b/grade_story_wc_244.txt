<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias’s “elusive” logistician tag is shown more than told—he dodges paperwork, vanishes from camps—but the interior contradiction between duty and evasion is only sketched, not dramatized under pressure. The moon-rock gift and geologist debt supply motive, yet that debt is asserted, not tested; we see no micro-choice where refusing the rock would cost him. Closure shows a felt softening of his chest-ache, so a minimal arc is legible, but the absence of a visible price paid keeps the change from feeling earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: rumor → moon rock → ghost negotiation → release of loneliness. Orientation is swift—who/where/when anchored within 80 words. Closure is Charged Poise: the conductor’s dictum “loneliness is the space between” reconfigures the premise with conceptual cost rather than tidy victory. The missing beat is an on-page price exacted from Elias; because none is shown, the turn feels light even though the lens is coherent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The station’s ivy-choked platform, bioluminescent graffiti, and pulsing vines act as an active membrane: access routes narrow, the signal lever demands the rock, the mural foreshadows dissolution. Micro-setting choice—placing the rock on rusted metal amid breathing walls—constrains the ritual and charges the final flare of light. Sensory selection stays filtered through Elias’s relief-logistician eye (boot cracks, rust, distance gauging). No orientation debt; spatial choreography is clean across tunnel, chamber, tracks.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“cure for loneliness”—is signaled early and tightened when the ghost refuses the term, insisting loneliness is language, not disease, thus foreclosing the expected payoff and forcing Elias to revise desire. One visible cost appears: the moon rock vanishes, but its loss is abstract, not tied to tactics or body. Escalation is conceptual rather than visceral; stakes pivot but do not wound, keeping pressure below 8-band intensity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through reversal: loneliness as communicative medium rather than pathology. Subtext resides in the conductor’s layered whispers and Elias’s unspoken ache—never diagnosed, only felt. The final image reframes prior images (ivy, moon, tracks) as connectors, not parasites. Avoids thesis-statement candor; “polite anarchy” is voiced once by Lira, early enough to feel playful rather than preachy.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person keeps tight psychic distance; diction (“jocular bark,” “mos-carpeted stage”) is Elias-colored without slipping into purple. Perceptual signature—logistician’s inventory eye, refugee-camp muscle memory—surfaces in selective noticing (boots, distance, cracks). Dialogue carries subtext: Lira’s clipped hortatory tone pushes Elias toward belief, while his deflective jokes reveal dread. No head-hops; register stays consistent; rhythm accelerates under flare of light without syntactic meltdown.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Strong info-density: one sentence does description, atmosphere, and character (“its arched windows clogged with ivy that pulsed like a second heartbeat”). Occasional modifier stacks (“bruised sky,” “desperate, jocular bark”) flirt with overwriting but serve voice. No scaffold loops; spatial tracking is clean. Metaphors stay coherent—ivy as heartbeat, train to stardust—without self-contradiction. Final third is artifact-free, allowing 8-band ceiling.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Fusion of moon-rock physics, ghost-as-loneliness-archive, and disaster-logistician protégé feels fresh; trope inversion (cure rejected, conversation catalyzed) grows from character rather than gimmick. Specificity—bioluminescent graffiti, moon-dark-side untouchedness—anchors the conceptual risk. Risk is modest: no structural audacity, but content angle is non-obvious. Could swap names without breaking skeleton, yet the ivy-station image is memorable enough to resist full abstraction.</comment>
