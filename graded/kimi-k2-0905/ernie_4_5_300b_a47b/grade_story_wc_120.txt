<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lirael’s interiority is vivid and specific—her chronological homesickness is embodied in the way she traces the shell “mapping childhood memories onto its curves.” The flaw (temporal displacement) directly shapes her goal of composing “unheard symphonies” from silence, and her micro-choice to write fortunes that are “maps back” shows a hierarchy of values with visible cost: she writes until “exhaustion loomed.” Missing 9-band because no second character appears, so relationship crucible and status dynamics cannot test; the arc is solitary renunciation rather than interpersonal pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the final image of the “upturned hush” crystallizes her Earned Stasis—she keeps writing, accepting the cost of exhaustion to resurrect the past. Causality holds: the shell’s hum triggers memory, memory drives the fortune texts, the texts become the symphony. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of mirrored/echo motifs tightens until the final silence reweights the stake. One hairline slip: “she’d always felt out of step with time” drifts toward diagnostic label-speak, slightly blunting embodied cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Glass spire, frozen lake, and nautilus shell form a micro-setting triad that constrains every choice: the prismatic walls fracture dawn light that dictates her writing rhythm, the shell’s glow cues memory retrieval, the lake’s mirror is the literal horizon she tries to breach. Spatial choreography is flawless—objects stay tracked (shell on obsidian slab, quill dipped in moonstone ink). Environment directly shapes tactic: she must finish before dawn exhausts her. 9-band gate met: the shell charges the final image as she holds it to her ear, reweighting the mirrored horizon.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—resurrect the past via unheard symphony—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens once: dawn’s advance → exhaustion threat → she writes faster, foreclosing rest. Cost is visible: “she had to work before exhaustion hit.” Agency is accumulative—each fortune written increases density of past-present collision; no coincidence resolves. Missing higher band because the escalation is single-cadence (time only) rather than a second, deeper trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Theme emerges from motif cluster: mirror/echo/reflection = attempt to reverse time. No explicit thesis; final “upturned hush” offers Conceptual Repricing—silence itself becomes the symphony, reweighting earlier “unheard” premise. Subtext resides in gesture: tracing shell ridges = trying to touch chronology. Ambiguity lingers: is she preserving memory or trapping herself? One minor dip: “she could bend time to her will” edges toward abstraction, slightly over-announcing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyric, compressive voice taught early (“dawn’s first light fractured through prismatic walls”) and sustained. Syntax grows shorter under pressure—“She wrote faster”—mirroring ticking clock. Perceptual signature is synesthetic: lullabies “shimmered on the lake’s surface,” fortunes “curling like smoke.” No dialogue, so no register drift; no head-hopping. 9-band gate met: rhythmic control heightens pressure without obscuring closure image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density: each sentence layers sensorium + motive + metaphor—“ink made from crushed moonstone” does triple work. Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. Only minor scaffold: two adjacent “she’d” anaphora lines could trim, but cadence serves accumulation. Read-aloud rhythm breathes naturally; final sentence lands clean. Artifact-free in closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: fortune-cookie writer as temporal composer is non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Mirrored horizon literalized as frozen lake avoids generic nowhere. Risk—lyric stasis instead of plot—pays off via accumulative pressure. Shell-as-metronome feels discovered, not selected from checklist. Slight proximity to “dawn-fractured glass” tropes keeps it from 9+ band.</comment>
