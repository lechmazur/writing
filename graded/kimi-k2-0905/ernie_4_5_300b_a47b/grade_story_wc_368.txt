<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lin’s interiority is evocative—dye-master perception, post-transplant estrangement—but her contradictory impulses stay summary-level (“felt as though she were now two people”) and never collide in a single pressured beat. The final resolve to “illuminate stories” is declared, not dramatized; no micro-choice on the page pays the cost of that vow. Without an embodied fork-in-the-road moment, the arc reads as gentle uplift rather than earned transformation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the vanished wing reweights Lin’s perception of her grafted life and vocation, with felt cost (“its lesson remained—a flicker of iridescent caution”). Causality under Accumulative lens holds: sun-trail pattern → wing release → shared aura among patrons → new vocation. Orientation is swift; only one transition (terrace → chamber) and spatial logic stays clean. The beat sequence is lightly episodic—wing flare, instant group epiphany, instant life-purpose reset—so escalation is more luminous than consequential.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Floating obsidian tea house, valley mist, and refracted sun threads are vividly filtered through dye-master sight; each ray alters mood and later choice. The wing itself serves as micro-setting that charges the final image before it disappears. Selective sensory economy—indigo on silk, cobalt-violet flare—keeps description purposeful and momentum alive. Environment never blocks or enables a specific tactical choice, capping entry at 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to see/curate narrative magnetism—surfaces early and tightens once when the wing’s flare reveals the travelers’ shared aura. Pressure is largely contemplative; no option is foreclosed and no price is exacted from Lin. The escalation beat is aesthetic rather than tactical, sufficient for an Accumulative arc but short of the visible cost that would push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—stories as transplanted hearts we learn to circulate—emerges through dye, donor metaphor, and vanishing wing without authorial thesis. Final image of tea house as “stage for quiet explosions” reweights prior motifs under a resonant, non-moralizing lens. Subtext could sharpen if patron dialogue carried more implication, but silence fits the hush of wonder. No echoic platitudes or final-paragraph sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Lin’s perceptual palette—pigment, light, mist—creating a distinct chromatic texture. Rhythm modulates from long contemplative sentences to sharper bursts at the wing flare, mirroring her quickened pulse. No dialogue, so voice purity remains unbroken. Occasional lofted diction (“ravenously,” “transcended”) slightly lifts above the grounded sensorium but stays within lyrical allowance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and loop-free; figurative layering is disciplined, never clogging causality. Density is high—each sentence paints plus advances. Minor scaffold: “quiet explosions of human experience” appears twice with only tonal difference; a trim would sharpen. Otherwise read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene temperature.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Floating tea house lit by story-hunting lepidopteran wing is an imaginative synthesis; transplant-as-lens feels fresh. Core moves—object flare, group illumination, life vow—follow a familiar epiphany arc, slightly dampening surprise. Specificity of dye-craft and sun-tracking keeps the concept from drifting into generic magical realism. Risk is present but moderated; bolder consequence or failure would push higher.</comment>
