<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid (“hollow space where purpose used to live”) and embodied emotion surfaces in trembling fingers, yet the decisive shift to “resurrecting forgotten stories” is announced rather than dramatized in a micro-choice on the page; the phone call compresses the moment of agency. The flaw is softened because the cloth talisman is kept in pocket, a tangible cost, giving Earned Stasis lite.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Causal chain intact: botched TV → quarry exile → cloth discovery → Google ID → call bassist → purpose pivot. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the trailer office suddenly reweighs as archive, not exile, felt in the cloth against his heart. Cost is understated but legible: he must keep living the quarry life while newly accountable to vanished music.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Quarry trailer is textured through mildew, concert posters as insulation, flicker of desklamp on frayed threads; the micro-setting of the cloth itself—its gold-crimson grid—constrains the recognition beat and thus the final image. Spatial choreography clean across the two on-page bodies. Weather (rain knock) works as pressure cue.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—purpose vs. obscurity—signalled early (“after the applause, what’s left?”). One meaningful tightening: cloth refuses to be tossed despite Gus’s order, forcing Lenny to choose memory over wage. Escalation depends on accumulating recognition, not external jeopardy, fitting Accumulative lens; cost is opportunity-loss of easy disposal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of post-fame survival emerges from concrete particulars (Echo Valley’s single disaster show) rather than lecture; final image reframes quarry dust as archival, not erasure. Subtext in Gus’s “rocks to crush” counters art’s fragility. Avoids sentimentality yet lands wistful charge.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited sustains roadie appraiser's perceptual filter—amp trivia, valuation manuals, “confidently uncertain” self-tag. Syntax flexes under pressure: fragments (“Toss it?”) echo blasts. No head-hopping; diction stays within ex-roadie lexicon. Dialogue sparse but idiomatic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm, varied sentence openers, only minor scaffold (“he’d…” x3 in one line). Information-dense: desk-lamp flicker on frayed edges does three jobs (light, texture, emotion). One strained metaphor—“dreams that crashed like quarry dynamite”—but it lands cleanly within closure image, forgiven.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Grille cloth as relic of forgotten one-show band is fresh; ex-roadie turned quarry antiques appraiser offers non-obvious synthesis of music and geology of failure. Not radical but avoids trope parade; risk is modest, coherence high.</comment>
