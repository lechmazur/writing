<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elias’s reticence is shown through gruff silence and pocketed hands, but the interiority never cracks under pressure; the “warmly observant” shift is told, not embodied. The final smile arrives without a prior micro-choice that visibly costs him—his arc is emotional but not crucible-tested. Interior contradiction is absent; the sea glass hum is sensed but doesn’t force a conflicting response. Still, the lone POV is consistent, and the endurance stance is credibly tied to his occupation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the stacked stones become a surrogate beacon, reweighting safety from lamp-light to communal ritual; the “luminescent ache” is felt. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—each note and stack deepens pattern rather than forcing external turns. Orientation is clean by line 3; no teleporting props. The only cost is the unlit lamp, but that external loss is transferred to an internalized ritual without a visible price paid by Elias himself—slightly softening the sting.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The lantern room’s iron-tasting air and rattling windows are filtered through Elias’s sailor-honed attention; every sensory pick is biased, never touristic. The stack of stones micro-setting actively guides the final image—its glint re-configures the meaning of light. Spatial choreography is flawless: hand-to-pocket, kerosene flicker, eastern window sight-line. Environment constrains choice and charges the closing beat, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving the felt safety of the light—survives the lamp’s death and tightens through each new note; escalation is pattern-deepening under Accumulative lens. Elias’s agency is reactive—he stacks, reads, places glass—but never initiates or risks beyond compliance; no option is foreclosed for him. Cost is off-loaded onto the absent chain-writers; the ache is atmospheric, not personally priced. One clear tightening occurs when the glass is returned to the sill, shifting the ritual from curiosity to stewardship.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: safety is not a beam but a shared, fragile gesture. Subtext lives in the stacked stones—each silent tower speaks louder than the dead lamp. No final-paragraph sermon; the last image is concrete and reconfigures prior material. The sea’s indifference versus human persistence is felt without abstraction, achieving quiet resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias; perceptual signature is sailor-practical—salt streaks, iron taste, wind as voiced secret. Syntax lengthens in calmer beats, shortens when he “fumbles,” mirroring reticence. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. Diction stays within a weathered seaman’s lexicon; the rare smile is earned and unslipped.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes: long sensory sentences in ascent, clipped fragments at lamp death. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or stake. Metaphors (“darkness felt heavier, a physical thing”) are brief, single, and apt. Opening and closing lines are image-anchored; no filler between. Minor density alert—three adjectives in “pale blue, smoothed by years” but compressed into one quick phrase, forgiven at this length.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: the lighthouse still burns—via stone cairns and anonymous notes—transforming a maritime trope into communal synaptic wiring. Sea glass as message vessel is specific and new; the stack-code feels like lived folk practice rather than invented quirk. Risk is quiet—no villain, no storm—yet stakes feel large because safety is internalized. Could edge higher if Elias had originated rather than inherited the ritual.</comment>
