<comment>Elara’s survivor-guilt interiority is vivid (“quiet weight… mimic grief so well she forgot where art ended”), but the “benevolently ruthless” trait is asserted rather than dramatized—no moment shows her harming someone kindly. The pawn = herself epiphany lands cleanly, yet the cost feels conceptual, not embodied. Still, contradiction under pressure (walking vs. gallery whispers) keeps her above stock.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Causal lens holds: each “unbind” lap tightens acoustic feedback → king topples → board reconfigures, yielding a clear Decisive Change. Orientation is swift (gallery, night, alone) and cost is legible—“she left with the board” seals her new historian role. Minor slack: why the interregnum loosens rules is unexplained, but the payoff justifies the ellipsis.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Whispering gallery is not postcard backdrop; its acoustics literally push back, forcing her footfalls to spell words. Micro-setting succeeds: the chessboard’s missing pawns constrain her theory and final self-definition. One hairline slip: “domed ceiling” and “marble pedestal” verge décor catalogue, but the echo mechanic rescues specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—document invisible gestures—faces one tightening beat: king topples only after she reverses her pattern, proving agency. Cost is present (she claims the board, exits the liminal), but external stakes (curators’ return) stay abstract; price is more existential than visceral. Sufficient for length, but not gut-punch.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: erased pawns = erased everyday actors; final image reframes Elara as both pawn and historian, no moralizing. “Luminous absence” reweights earlier silence from void to potential. One micro-lecture line—“history remembered the loud”—tilts toward statement, but is embedded in walk-action, forgiven.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is tactile, rhythmic (“sound curled like smoke”), and stays inside Elara’s perceptual filter. No dialogue, so syntactic variety carries cadence; occasional elevated diction (“interregnum,” “nomadic penumbra”) fits her theorist bent. Zero POV drift; compressed lyric mode taught early and paid off at exit.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is mostly lean, but two adjacent “she’d begun… she’d spent” create minor template cadence; metaphor stack near climax (“nomadic penumbra… elusive state… blurred”) risks purple yet serves concept. No loops obscure causality; final line breathes. High density throughout; artifact-light.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: crisis-actor-as-pawn is new, and the acoustic-spell mechanic weaponizes gallery cliché. Risky lyric structure taught early and lands cleanly. Could tip into gimmick but feels inevitable—high-end lit-mag fresh.</comment>
