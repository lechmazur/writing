<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Kael’s interior contradiction—impatience vs. the elders’ mantra—drives every micro-choice; the final “listen” moment crystallizes earned endurance with visible cost (aching back, dawn exhaustion). Flaw: the acolyte beat merely repeats the lesson aloud, adding no new pressure or flaw exposure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the grid-locking filings and ice ripples make the before/after legible, cost paid in bodily fatigue and foreclosed haste. Causal chain holds: mis-alignment → moonbeam cue → fractional realignment → controlled surge. One scaffold sentence (“He thought of the elders’ words…”) could trim without loss.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Basalt pores absorbing breath, filings trembling like a heartbeat, moonlight through roof-fissure—each tactile detail constrains Kael’s next precise move. The frozen lake’s glass thickness returns as concentric ripples, re-weighted by the final magnetic pulse. Micro-setting (viaduct node etched in stone) anchors the decisive adjustment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“unyoke power without force”—tightens when hurried realignment scatters filings; the moonbeam cue forecloses the option of speed, forcing micro-degree patience. Cost is visible: night-long labor, locked grid, aching body. No external antagonist needed; internal impatience supplies coherent pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through pattern: stillness vs. motion, ice vs. current, moon vs. iron. Final image—thawed lake yet persistent hum—reweights the premise: revolution is reorientation, not rupture. Avoids moralizing; the acolyte’s puzzlement keeps ambiguity alive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Kael’s perceptual filter: goggles fog, filings “debate,” viaduct “restless.” Syntax lengthens during patience work, then shortens at dawn surge, mirroring pulse. No head-hop; diction remains within horizon-mapper lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Strong verb density—“filings coiled…straightened…locked” propels without adverb clutter. One paraphrase loop (“the revolution wasn’t over; it had just begun”) could compress. Otherwise rhythm breathes with beats, no mixed metaphors, clean grammar.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Magnetic archaeology via moon-tracked patience feels fresh; avoids Chosen One or rebel clichés. Could push further into speculative mechanics—what does the grid enable beyond lullaby? Still, the synthesis of geomancy and contemplative practice is memorable.</comment>
