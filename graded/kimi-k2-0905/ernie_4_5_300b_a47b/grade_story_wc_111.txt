<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is concrete—her gnarled hands, the feel of marble chips, the way she redirects a vine to block a sensor. The contradiction between refusing algorithms yet outwitting them is lived, not declared. Micro-choices (polishing, redirecting, gifting a marble) reveal a hierarchy of values: memory > metrics. The final refusal to hide cracks feels earned because every prior marble already carried visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the maze “blooms—not in spite of its wounds, but because of them,” reweighting the premise that perfection beats brokenness. Causal lattice holds: each vine-redirect causes the maze to recalibrate; marbles accumulate meaning until the final hand-off to Joren. Orientation is clean inside 120 words. Cost is palpable—Elara forecloses technological dependency, pays in solitude, and the maze’s final flowering is the receipt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The vine-dresser chest, the cracked marbles, and the sensor-blocking vine function as micro-setting that constrains tactics. Hedge light absorption, stone scent, and tactile marble edges are filtered through Elara’s gardener bias. Spatial choreography is immaculate: bodies, vines, tablet, and marble positions track without drift. Final image of maze blooming from wounds is charged by these objects, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove gardens remember gardeners—tightens when Elara blocks the sensor with a vine, forcing the maze to re-route; this is the single meaningful escalation under a Causal lens. Cost is visible: she risks algorithmic failure (hence isolation) yet succeeds. No reversals needed; one decisive act narrows options and reweights the stake. Joren’s conversion is consequence, not coincidence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the accumulating marble ledger: brokenness as biography, not blemish. Subtext lives in gesture—handing Joren a cracked marble silently argues that flaws are data, not shame. Final image reframes “withering” as generative: the maze blooms because of wounds, not despite them. No explicit moralizing; the reweighting is felt, not asserted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays anchored to Elara’s perceptual signature: she notices vine tension, marble warmth, algorithmic rustle. Diction stays within a gardener’s lexicon—“coaxed,” “trellis,” “sensor”—never drifts into tech jargon or academic gloss. Rhythm modulates: short declaratives during vine-redirect, longer reflective cadences while polishing. No head-hopping; Joren’s interior access is mediated through Elara’s reading of his silence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Zero scaffold loops; each sentence advances either tactile detail or causality. Figurative language is spare and precise—“twisted like a question mark” teaches the maze’s skepticism early, paid off when the vine literally rewrites the path. No filter-verb stacks; verbs are strong (“guided,” “blocked,” “recalibrated”). Copy is clean: no typos, pronoun drift, or tense slips. Final line achieves charged poise without rhetorical inflation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The quantified-luck garden maze is a fresh speculative graft; cracked marbles as data-ledger transforms familiar “treasured trinket” trope. Risk is taken: eschewing antagonist or big reversal for a quiet, accumulative proof—yet coherence holds. Specificity of vine-redirect sabotage makes the algorithmic world feel lived, not pasted. Transformation test fails if relocated to any other setting: the maze’s wound-bloom logic is inseparable from this horticular gear-shift.</comment>
