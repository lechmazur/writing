<comment>Lila’s grief is credibly embodied—trembling hands, the photograph ritual—but her interiority occasionally slides into therapy-speak (“somatic markers,” “anchor optimism in realism”) that flattens contradiction. The freeze action is dramatized twice, each time with visible cost, earning the final unfurling of the photo. Mrs. Voss functions more as thematic mouthpiece than independent pressure source, softening relationship-as-crucible. Still, the contradiction between clinging to and releasing Elias is held in scene, not summary, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the photo tuck-back crystallizes a before/after stance with felt cost. Causal linkage is sound—each return to the bench tightens the stake in stillness—yet the lighthouse keeper backstory is ornamental, never constraining tactics. Orientation is clear by line 4; no lens ambiguity. The ending would gain finality if the persistent constraint (wind? salt decay?) shadowed the last image; as is, cost is emotional, not environmental.</comment>

<comment>Sea-arboretum is vivid and selective: salt-bleached roses, wind-twisted pines, moss-cracked walls all filter through Lila’s painterly eye. Micro-setting succeeds—the stone bench’s cold grit anchors the freeze beat and returns charged in the final tuck. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating props. Weather is invoked but never actively complicates, keeping the setting one notch below 9.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—finding a pocket of unmoving peace—signals early and tightens once: the gust-triggered flashback narrows options to “stay anchored or drown.” Agency is interior (freeze, breathe, tuck) but forecloses escape; cost is the continued presence of grief. No external antagonist needed; wind as coincidence complicates, not resolves. Escalation is single-cycle, sufficient for 700 words, yet lacks a persistent environmental constraint that would push the score higher.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges organically: stillness as an act of defiance against chaos. Subtext lives in gesture—smoothing the photo vs. tucking it away—avoiding overt thesis. The lighthouse-keeper anecdote risks thematic echo, but stays under 20% and is anchored to present journal, so −0.2 only. Final image reweights earlier motifs without moralizing, earning resonance.</comment>

<comment>Third-person close maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is painterly, salt-accurate. No dialogue to judge; interior monologue avoids filter-verb stacks. Compression in flashback paragraph is taught by italicized “bombed mid-vows” and paid off in the gust trigger. Diction stays within Lila’s artisan lexicon; no register drift. Rhythm accelerates with short sentences during gust, breathes longer at closure—effective modulation.</comment>

<comment>Prose is lean and concrete; sentence variety strong, no template cadence. One mixed metaphor—“pearl of stillness cradled like a promise”—is minor. Information density high: single sentences deliver scent, texture, memory. No synonym loops or scaffold. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image. Line-level artifacts absent, clearing 9-band path.</comment>

<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Drone-strike wedding survivor is fresh terrain, yet the somatic-marker self-help frame feels familiar; the synthesis is competent, not startling. Risk taken: interior freeze as climax, which pays off emotionally but lacks external twist. Specificity of salt-bleached roses and drone-strike canopy lights keeps it from generic grief story. No close echoes of famous scenes. Conceptual integrity intact; premise fully inhabited.</comment>
