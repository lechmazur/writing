<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias’s claustrophobia is shown through embodied beats (shallow breath, back against stone) and alters his tactics; the compass jab to still the corridor is a crisp micro-choice. Interiority avoids therapy-speak, but “prudently adventurous” is label-only until the final lunge, so motivation feels slightly front-loaded rather than discovered. The earned moment—key drops into palm, cathedral shudders—carries visible cost and crystallizes his stance. Flaw complicates action; endurance is credibly costly, but the shift from dread to chase is abrupt, thinning the arc’s middle.</comment>

<comment>Causal lens holds: compass misbehavior → organ summons → corridor mutiny → key retrieval, each because/therefore link legible. Closure is a Decisive Change: cathedral dissolves, gateway opens, cost felt in recrudescent claustrophobia and key’s pulse. Orientation anchored by 120 words; spatial choreography survives the rubber-wall sequence. One causality micro-gap: the organ’s mechanics are never motivated or constrained, so the summon reads as convenient miracle rather than earned rule.</comment>

<comment>Cathedral is rendered through cold stone, fractured starlight, groaning pipes—selective sensory triage aligned to POV panic. The compass point serves as micro-setting that constrains the final stab; starlight shifts from prison bars to path, mirroring interior flip. No world-rule inconsistency; spatial physics rubberizes only after organ cue, signalling rule change. Setting actively guides choice (wall stab) and charges final gateway image, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—retrieve key or remain trapped—signalled early and tightened when corridor twists literally narrow his options. Escalation is physical: walls bend, key flickers, spatial mutiny raises cost each beat. Protagonist agency drives every turn; luck complicates but does not resolve. Price is visible—claustrophobia rebounds, cathedral begins to collapse—yet the stake itself stays abstract (“vital key lost to time”) rather than personal or moral, capping depth.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of wistful rebellion emerges through images: silent organ roaring back, starlight turning from prison to path, key shaped like constellations—authority subverted by curiosity. No overt moralizing; final gateway invites reader to feel both triumph and unease. Subtext operates in organ’s dirge and key’s heartbeat—tools of the cathedral now complicit in escape. Ambiguity lingers: is the cathedral’s dissolution liberation or deeper entrapment elsewhere? Complexity acknowledged without forced balance.</comment>

<comment>Third-limited stays tightly adhered; no head-hop. Perceptual signature filters description through claustrophobic bias—shadows “swallow,” silence “presses.” Syntax shortens under stress (“He lunged… world flipped”) then elongates during corridor chase, mirroring breath. Diction stays within Elias’s plausible lexicon; no register drift. One minor filter-verb cluster in opening paragraph; otherwise immediacy is clean.</comment>

<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, information-dense: single sentences layer sensory data and emotional charge. No paraphrase loops; metaphors (constellation-teeth, rubber walls) are consistent with taught spatial-mutiny rule. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line recharges gateway motif. Occasional elegant telling (“He’d come too far to turn back”) compresses without stalling. Clean grammar, unambiguous pronouns, varied paragraph cuts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Spatial-mutiny cathedral + starlight compass + haunted organ synthesizes familiar tropes but grounds them in tactile specificity (needle hiss in wall). The “key as constellation” turn feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risk is moderate—lyric chase through bending corridor—but execution remains coherent. Could swap key for generic relic without breaking logic, slightly dampening ingenuity.</comment>
