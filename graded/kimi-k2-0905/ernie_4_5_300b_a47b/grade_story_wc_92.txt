<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Kieran’s vigilance and Elara’s inventiveness are sketched efficiently, but internal contradiction is thin; both feel like cooperative plot avatars rather than individuals with clashing stakes. The quill-holder choice is concrete, yet no micro-choice dramatizes real risk or personal flaw. Their partnership is cordial, so status crucible never ignites. Closure relies on communal uplift, not a personally-costed stance, so earned stasis is weak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Causal chain is clear: blackout → quill test → stair reveal. Orientation anchors land before the 120-word mark; no penalty. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the Council will soon see the new basement—so cost is social rather than personal; still legible. One minor lapse: “the grooves match” knowledge is asserted, not demonstrated, a hairline causality nick.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>“Luminous fort at twilight” and blackout narrow visual field effectively; amber glow vs. starlit bronze generates texture. Setting guides choice only once (sundial slot opens the stair); otherwise it serves mood more than obstacle. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves. Tool-as-setting (quill holder) charges the reveal but not the final image, so 9-gate missed.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“ignite a silent revolution”—is declared early but never sharpened into personal cost or time pressure. Tightening beat is the panel click; it changes location, not tactical options for the duo. No resource is lost, no path foreclosed; risk stays abstract. Escalation is situational; pressure is atmospheric rather than decision-forcing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme of quiet subversion emerges through the cradle image and Council/Sparks binary, avoiding overt moral. Subtext is modest: loaded glances, “they’ll know the spark can’t be extinguished.” Final uplift is resonant but familiar; no fresh ethical twist complicates the binary. Theme never acquires a personal price tag, so conceptual repricing is collective, not intimate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade>
<comment>Narrative voice is steady, serviceable, slightly default-omniscient; no perceptual signature distinguishes Kieran’s interiority from Elara’s. Dialogue is functional, goal-directed, but both speak in the same measured cadence and lexicon. No syntactic music or rhythmic compression under pressure. Filter verbs absent; psychic distance stays consistent. Competent, not distinctive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, readable, low on scaffolding; sentences advance moment-to-moment. Two minor loops: “angles… they’re a” echoed in back-to-back lines; “the cradle of sparks wasn’t a place but a idea” grammar slip. Metaphors are spare, avoiding density clog. Information density adequate; opening hooks, final line lands. No artifacts near closure; stays within 9- band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Fantasy-revolt template is standard; freshness comes from sundial-cipher rather than map. Quill-tool twist is elegant but not concept-altering. Council vs. underground inventors is familiar; no worldview inversion. Specific details (half-painted sundial, bronze quill) add texture, yet plot beats remain swappable. Risk level is moderate; execution smooth but not transformative.</comment>
