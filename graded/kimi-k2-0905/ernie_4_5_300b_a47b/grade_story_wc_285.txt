<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Thaddeus’s “closely attentive” trait and distiller motive stay consistent, but every beat is interior observation; no micro-choice tightens or forecloses a path. The yarn needle warms yet never pricks a decision; the ferry ride ends where it began. Interiority is atmospheric, not conflicted; contradictions and cost are absent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/lyric lens holds: fog, needle, ferry layer density toward a palimpsest closure. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) is clear within 60 words. Closure is a Charged Poise—Thaddeus sees the ticking gutters and “carries his layer forward”—but the cost is conceptual only; no tactic or option visibly narrows. Pattern is coherent yet static, not causally tightened.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fog and river function as micro-setting that constrains sound, visibility, and pacing; ferry hull creaks and gutters’ ticking are tactile cues that charge the final image. Spatial choreography across dock → boat → dock is clean. Tool (yarn needle) is handled but never alters physical choice; environment pressures ambiance, not tactics. Vivid specificity anchors mood; lacks causal bite for 9-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake is the preservation/continuation of the “palimpsest promise,” but it remains abstract; no live option is foreclosed on-page. Pressure is atmospheric (fog, silence, ticking gutters) rather than tactical escalation. Protagonist agency is limited to boarding and departing; no reversal or deepening changes his available paths. Cost is conceptual, not dramatized; tension plateaus.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—layered time/memory distilled into essence—emerges through recurring images of fog, needle, and river palimpsest. Subtext is carried in silence between coachman and ferryman; final image of “next crossing” reweights prior layers. Avoids overt thesis, but insight feels pre-known rather than earned through struggle. Emotional aftereffect is contemplative, not charged.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Thaddeus; perceptual signature is sensory and metaphoric (“eyes like wet coal,” “spindrift serenity”). Rhythm modulates with fog-muted cadence; no head-hopping. Diction occasionally over-elevates (“palimpsest promise,” “conceptual repricing”) beyond coachman lexicon, but pattern is consistent. Free-indirect texture is controlled; voice is distinct if slightly ornate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud ear test passes: sentence lengths vary, fog-muted rhythm supports mood. Figurative density is high—multiple metaphors per paragraph—but pattern is taught early and sustains voice. No loops or synonym churn; information density is strong. Occasional elevated register (“conceptual repricing,” “ambient awareness”) nudges above character base, but clarity remains intact. Closure image is clean and resonant.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade>
<comment>Fog-river crossing as palimpsest is fresh lens on familiar threshold motif. Yarn needle repurposed from sewing to metaphysical distillation is inventive. Silence-as-dialogue and “ticking gutters” clock are nice specifics. Core situation—ritual ferry ride—remains static; no transformative turn surprises. Risk is aesthetic, not narrative; concept stays contemplative rather than revelatory.</comment>
