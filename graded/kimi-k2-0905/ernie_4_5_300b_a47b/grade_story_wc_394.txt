<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Lira’s obsession with the arrow tip and bell is concrete, embodied, and propels every risky tweak of the *Skein*; her “irreverent awe” is shown in whoops and grins, not labels. Interiority stays sharp and gear-specific (“gears with feet”). The final hurl of the tip is earned—years of stylus tracing pay off in one charged, irreversible act. No contradictory impulses live side-by-side, so the 9-bar misses by a hair.</comment>

<comment>Causal chain holds: kaleidoscope images → transliteration → aerodynamic tweaks → bell strike. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the sea, workshop, and sky re-ringing to a bell no one else can hear yet, cost felt in the acid mist shudder. Orientation locked by word 30; no prop or motif teleporting. The lens is Causal throughout; no soft resets or convenient amnesia.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The skeletal *Skein*, acid-sea updrafts, and kaleidoscope projections are filtered through Lira’s engineer gaze; every sensory pick is a tuning dial. Micro-setting (arrow tip as clapper surrogate) directly enables the final trajectory. Spatial choreography stays clean—no impossible dives or gear jumps. Environment constrains the final approach: only one dive angle will thread the tower crown.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—sound the unheard bell—signaled in paragraph 2 and tightened by each kaleidoscope twist that narrows flight options. Escalation is causal: each image forecloses a prior glide path until only the suicidal dive remains. Cost is visible—acid mist eats tools mid-scene, *Skein* braces strain audibly. No off-stage rescue; the bell’s first vibration is paid for with the irreversible loss of the tip and the glider’s airframe.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme—desire as code that can be ridden like wind—emerges from the act of transliteration rather than authorial thesis. The bell’s unheard hum reweights the arrow tip from compass to clapper without a moral stated. Subtext sits in the silence after the strike: the future is now slightly mis-tuned for everyone else. No final-paragraph sermon; the resonance is sonic, not lexical.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is gear-gritty, compressed, rhythmic: “gears clacked overhead, a metronome to her restlessness.” POV stays tight third; no head-hopping. Diction stays within Lira’s mechanical lexicon—no sudden academic register. Purposeful fragment (“No rope, no clapper. Just a hollow mouth…”) accelerates the dive beat. Read-aloud rhythm mirrors propeller whir without syntactic monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Lines multitask: “The glider—her *Skein*—dove toward it, wings folded” packs motion, tool identity, and emotional tilt. No scaffold, no filter-verb stacks, no mixed metaphors. Figurative control peaks in the final “hum” that is not a ring—precise, unextended, unforgettable. Minor paraphrase near “acid mist seeped…eating at her tools” is the only loop, too minor to cap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The acid-sea gear-shop, kaleidoscope flight computer, and unheard bell synthesize into a premise that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk is real—no safety net of familiar tropes. The hunter’s arrow tip repurposed as clapper-code is a fresh inflection unseen in steampunk or solarpunk cans. Conceptual integrity holds: the world never flinches from its corrosive physics.</comment>
