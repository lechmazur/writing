<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Lirael’s quiet, patient scholarship is embodied in tactile desk work and star-charting; her interiority remains concrete (“bloodshot but sharp”) without label-speak. No contradictory impulses play out in scene—she proceeds steadily—so the required internal friction is missing. The final breakthrough feels inevitable rather than wrested from risk, softening the cost. Still, her perceptual signature (celestial mechanics as thought-rhythm) is individual and consistent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: key-study → constellation alignment → key-turn → gateway reveal. Closure is a clean Decisive Change with conceptual cost—shadows condense into a time-reversed realm, reweighting the isle’s reality. Orientation anchor (who/where) arrives by line 3; no debt. The “spoons bent reality” catalyst is confessed but not dramatized, a slight teleported-prop wobble that keeps the score sub-9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Floating-isle observatory is sketched with star-close brass and shifting star-floors; micro-setting (the key, the dais slot) constrains the climax. Sensory economy favors visual/geared texture over breadth, fitting scholar-POV. Spatial choreography stays clean across telescope-adjusting and key-insertion. The shadow-gateway image reuses the prior “shadows at noon” motif, charging the final beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“where shadows go”—is signaled early and tightens when the Weeping Archer window narrows to minutes. One meaningful escalation: the key-turn forecloses the option to remain ignorant, opening the backward-time gate with visible auroral cost. Agency is present but solo; no opposing pressure or credible loss beyond lost sleep. Coincidence is absent; escalation is legible but modest.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: knowledge as a keyed mechanism that unlocks hidden temporal strata. Subtext resides in the shadow-pool image—what daylight denies returns in condensed, reversed form. No moral is stated; the final image reweights the premise without sermon. The “sealed awakening” concept stays conceptual rather than moralized, preserving ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Lirael’s scholarly perceptual filter: gears = constellations, ink = sky. Syntax is controlled, rhythms echo clockwork (“polished to a mirror sheen,” “satisfying click”). No dialogue to test voice divergence, yet interior diction remains consistent and character-bound. Register never drifts into academic loftiness; perceptual signature is distinct.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, high-density; sentences advance premise or image without scaffold. One paraphrase loop (“key… key…”) is forgiven inside a 740-word limit. Figurative language is sparse and coherent (“stars seemed close enough to pluck”). No mixed metaphors or register drift; final image is crisp and uncluttered.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The automaton-key-as-celestial-cipher is a fresh inflection on clock-magic; spoon-bending catalyst is delightfully odd yet under-dramatized. Shadow-gateway to backward-time feels inevitable in hindsight via star-alignment setup. Conceptual synthesis overrides character risk, keeping originality high but not exemplary. Specific scholarly process details anchor the wonder in lived procedure.</comment>
