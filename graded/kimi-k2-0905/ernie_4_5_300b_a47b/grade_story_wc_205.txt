<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Kael’s motive to expose a stolen past is clear and emotionally grounded; the “burnished sorrow” registers in embodied beats like wrapping the shard “like a relic.” Interior contradiction is sketched (revolutionary turned archaeologist) but the turn is asserted rather than dramatized in-scene. Micro-choices (draping mirrors, planting fungi) visibly enact values, yet no moment forces him to risk present safety for the truth, so the arc feels incremental rather than costly. The final stance is legible but leans on poetic assertion, not a crucible choice that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the glowing fungi re-weight history and expose the Council’s lie with undeniable social cost. Causal linkage between mirror-draping and the storm-vision is poetic logic rather than strict because/therefore, but the pattern is taught early and payoff is on the page. Orientation is swift—“who, where, when” anchored within 60 words. One soft spot: the fungi bloom feels slightly convenient—Kael “planted seeds” off-page, so the physical mechanism of victory is only retroactively asserted.</comment>

<comment>Baroque asteroid is rendered through selective sensory hooks—cobalt haze, obsidian atrium, bioluminescent fungi—each filtering Kael’s archaeological gaze. The crystal shard functions as micro-setting: handled, re-wrapped, scanned, it literally refracts light onto walls, guiding spatial orientation. Weather-as-time is more concept than constraint until the final beat, keeping environment from actively shaping tactics mid-scene. Still, the shard’s refracted glow on the atrium floor charges the closure image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prove the Luminari fraud—signaled in paragraph two and tightened when the Council tears down drapes, narrowing Kael’s options to the fungi gambit. Escalation is largely reputational and symbolic; no bodily or resource cost is risked on-page, so pressure is intellectual rather than visceral. The mirror method’s payoff arrives via storm-vision, a situational gift rather than an earned reversal, muting the cost clarity. Still, the final fungi reveal forces public re-interpretation, a legible social price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the palimpsest metaphor—history overwritten by victors—without overt thesis statements. The shard’s refracted light and the fungal script literalize buried voices, letting image carry meaning. Final line (“civilizations… built on the courage to see what mirrors hide”) flirts with thematic echo but earns its lift via the mirror-draping motif that literally uncovered new evidence. Subtext stays in gesture and light-play, inviting reflection on who controls reflection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is lush yet precise—“shimmering cobalt haze,” “sharp as regret”—owning a poet-archaeologist’s perceptual signature. Syntax lengthens under contemplation, then tightens at the storm climax, mirroring emotional cadence. Free-indirect distance stays stable; no filter-verb bloat. Dialogue is absent, a valid choice that keeps the lens internal; consequently no voice convergence issues. The velvet-drape, silver-scrap imagery distinguishes his worldview without ornamental excess.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is thick with figurative language—almost every sentence carries metaphor—yet pattern is taught early (“time… visible as a shimmering cobalt haze”) and sustains coherence. No mixed metaphors or register drift; metaphors stay within optic/geologic domains plausible to Kael. A few scaffold phrases (“burned like a slow fuse,” “sharp as regret”) are familiar, but they land in low-pressure spots. Closing image is uncluttered, leaving the shard’s hum as resonant cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fusion of temporal storms, mirror occlusion, and fungal archives feels genuinely fresh; none of the core moves are off-the-shelf tropes. The conceit that mirrored surfaces amplify historiographic lies is bold and logically extended to its biological counter-archive. Risk is high for 800-word SF, yet clarity is preserved. Incremental reveal keeps the concept from overwhelming character, and the transformation test passes—plot depends on archaeologist-poet sensibility, not generic hero.</comment>
