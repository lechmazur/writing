<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lira’s contradictory impulses—guilt-rooted restlessness vs. firefighting need to mend—are dramatized in the micro-choice to lie “This’ll keep her safe” while touching the coin; the splinting beat embodies the arson-daughter guilt and the need to graft new roots. Interiority is concrete (coin weight, sand hiss) rather than label-speak. Earned renunciation is visible: she releases the grain into the lagoon, accepting that scars remain but can sing; the cost is the forever-carry of her father’s stigma. Secondary pressure from Mara’s fear sharpens Lira’s stance crystallization.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the released grain + coin jingle reweight “scars can sing” with undeniable social cost—she will keep carrying the arson stigma. Causal linkage holds: because she splints the bird with the coin lie, therefore Mara releases it, therefore Lira can release the grain and reconfigure her own scar-rule. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (who, where, when). No lens ambiguity; the lyrical accumulative pattern is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Volcanic black sand and obsidian lagoon are specific, sensory, and return in the final image; the sand literally hisses under tactile handling. Environment mirrors internal state without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography is clean: boots sink, knees sink, hand scoop, grain released. The coin-as-micro-setting constrains the splint choice and charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove scars can sing—tightens once when the bird-release forces Lira to enact the same letting-go with the grain; the option to hoard guilt is foreclosed. Cost is visible: she forever forfeits the coin and accepts public stigma. Escalation is accumulative/lyric: pattern of sand-coin-bird-scar culminates in final reweighting.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: volcanic sand, drilled coin, broken wing—scars as fertility not erasure. Subtext in the lie “This’ll keep her safe” shows compassion as unyielding even when deceptive. Final image of vanishing grain offers non-literal answer: compassion is release, not amnesia. No sermonizing; complexity remains.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: “sand hissed like a secret,” “clouds migrate—a slow, gray parade.” Free indirect style stays clean; diction remains within Lira’s plausible lexicon. Rhythm modulates: longer lyrical sentences at rest, clipped lines under alert tension (“Yes.”). No head-hopping; single POV stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varied; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is selective (“broken mirror,” “wind chimes”) and does not clog high-pressure beats. Information density high: one sentence often does two jobs (anchors + mood). Minor scaffold: “its surface dotted with…” could compress, but does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><question>7.5</question><comment>Fusion of arson-daughter firefighter + volcanic scar-soil is fresh synthesis; trope transformed through black-sand fertility notion. The drilled coin-as-splint is a specific, non-obvious tactical use. Risky lyric pattern is taught early and pays off. Final reprise feels inevitable yet not derivative.</comment>
