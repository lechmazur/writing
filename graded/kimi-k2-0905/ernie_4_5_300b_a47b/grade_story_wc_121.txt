<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses—yearning to float above risk yet craving grounded connection—are credibly embodied in the tablet choice and final descent. The “feeling it ebbing now” line gives concrete visceral signal of cost. Interiority lapses into thematic labels (“conquer the labyrinth of self”) that feel pre-digested rather than lived, muting full immersion. Still, the earned renunciation of flight for touch carries visible price and scales to length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each arch selection therefore spawns a new timeline shard that forces micro-choices under tightening gravity-death threat. Closure lands cleanly—tablet dissolves, feet touch stone, gravity regained—visible cost paid. Orientation is stable; who-where-when anchored within first 110 words. Mosaic shards taught early; transitions legible; pattern pays off in convergent thread image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Viaduct, wet stones, and residual glow serve as both stage and moral compass, silently rating each timeline option. Tablet-as-micro-setting is handled in three distinct beats, its pulsing runes steering path selection. Sensory hierarchy stays tight—visual shimmer, gut tug, footfall splash—mirroring ebbing power. Environment never over-described; each detail either enables or blocks choice, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will she ever land and belong?”—is signaled early and sharpened by each portal’s either-or fork. Escalation is accumulative: every new timeline samples a higher cost of isolation or ordinariness, tightening the noose around neutrality. Final refusal to keep floating crystallizes stance and forecloses omniscient drift. Cost is felt but could be more viscerally acute; still, agency remains hers.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of self-acceptance emerges through iterative sampling of lives rather than overt thesis. “Darkening brightness” motif returns reweighted at end, now read as beauty of impure, lit dusk rather than ideal glare. Subtext resides in silent tablet crumble—wisdom that maps are external yet path is muscle. Avoids moralizing, lets image do repricing; complexity acknowledged but not deeply paradoxical.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-person close hovers at consistent psychic distance, mirroring protagonist’s flotation. Syntax is controlled, with rhythmic lifts in arch transitions to mimic drift. Filter verbs minimal; perception stays body-anchored (“tug in her gut”). No dialogue to judge; narrative voice sustains faintly mythic cadence without purple inflation, modulating under power-loss stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is lean, almost no scaffold; sentences advance image or decision. Figurative language kept scarce and functional (“arches glowing like lanterns” earns its keep). One mixed metaphor ripple-drop could argue for muddle but occurs early and is immediately taught as time-map logic. Rhythm breathes at descent beat, accelerating subtly as gravity returns; no loops or synonym churn detected.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Timeline-sampling via procedural generation remixes familiar chosen-one portal fantasy yet centers on renunciation rather than mastery. Tablet-as-schedule-of-selves feels fresh object mechanic, avoided typical techno-MacGuffin. Risk taken in eschewing villain or external antagonist, keeping pressure internal; succeeds without gimmickry. Could edge higher if emotional specificity of rejected timelines cracked open more singularly personal wounds.</comment>
<question>9 A</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Her periodic power loss directly forces the final ground-touch; two mid-scene beats—hover exhaustion and tablet-guided descent—hinge on gravity defiance. Trait reweights from blessing to liability, charging closure.</comment>
<question>9 B</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tablet handled in discovery, path projection, and crumble; each use alters tactical options. Its dissolve signals map’s obsolescence, paralleling self-acceptance, and is inseparable from final image.</comment>
<question>9 C</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fractured timelines are the narrative engine: every arch choice procedurally generates a new shard that tightens stakes. Concept shapes tactics throughout and converges in single-thread closure.</comment>
<question>9 D</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>“Periodically eternal” trait enables flight yet threatens fall; ebbing sensation triggers key fork decisions and final landing. Cost is visible when boots finally touch stone.</comment>
<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Literal retracing—stepping back through prior life-paths—drives plot; removing it collapses entire montage structure. Action is dramatized, not summarized, in each arch traversal.</comment>
<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Procedural generation is named and functions: tablet’s runes algorithmically spawn timelines per her choices. Mechanics matter mid-story, not ex post, shaping her navigation strategy.</comment>
<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Viaduct provides spatial logic for sequential timeline gates and mirrors fading power through dimming glow. Setting alters tactics by forcing binary left/right choices under spectral light.</comment>
<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>“Between drop and ripple” supplies lyrical clock that tightens mood but isn’t tracked as decision timer; time felt more metaphorical than mechanical, limiting upper band.</comment>
<question>9 I</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Labyrinth-of-self motive propels every portal entry; conflicted desire dramatized in hesitation at each fork. Final grounded walk resolves desire with visible cost—touch at price of flight.</comment>
<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Darkening brightness motif threads consistently—glow fades but beauty remains—modulating across timeline samples. Tone charges final twilight image, reconfiguring earlier spectral menace into peaceful dusk.</comment>
