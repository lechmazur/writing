<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid—her gloved fingers scraping algae, the vial pressed to her mask—yet the “harness the ephemeral” motive is stated rather than dramatized in earlier beats. The override of instinct is shown once, at the vial’s stubborn stopper, and carries cost when she absorbs the priests’ grief, but the epiphany that “time couldn’t be escaped” arrives as explanatory summary, softening the final renunciation. Emotional embodiment is strong throughout; only the late articulation of motive keeps this shy of 8.5.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the temple’s hush thickens through sensory layers until the vial’s scent ruptures the pattern, delivering a decisive conceptual reprice—Mara’s release of the memories. Orientation is anchored by word 60; the single-scene descent tightens once via the pressure squeeze through the fissure. Closure lands in the empty yet radiant vial beside her, a charged image that reweights the premise: preservation through letting go. The only drag is a mid-paragraph editorial echo—“the hush was a prison, and Mara was its jailer”—which over-articulates what the chamber already shows.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Blackroot Ocean, crumbling archway, algae-slick stone, bioluminescent dome—each detail is filtered through Mara’s gloved, urgent touch. The temple’s sound-trap architecture isn’t backdrop; it forces her slow patience with the rusted stopper and later squeezes her ribs through the fissure. The empty vial floating beside her at dawn reprises salt-sting and lavender, charging the final image with the setting’s transformed meaning. Spatial choreography is flawless; no caps apply.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—liberate the memories before storm breach—is signaled early; pressure tightens when the vial warms and the hush “clings to her skin,” foreclosing retreat. Protagonist agency drives the turn: she uncorks the vial, choosing to absorb the grief rather than flee. Cost is visceral—voices pierce suit and bones—and persists: she surfaces with empty lungs and emptied vial. One minor loop: “time ran short” is repeated without new gradient, keeping this just below 8.5.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of release versus preservation emerges through the vial’s journey from sealed relic to emptied radiant shell. Subtext lives in gesture—scraping fingers, pressure against ribs—rather than thesis. The final dawn ray reweights the earlier “lonesome splendor,” turning solitude into earned clarity. No moralizing, only image; the thematic echo is subtle and paid for.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly glued to Mara’s perceptual filter: “her gloved fingers,” “her breath fogged,” lavender scent through suit vents. Rhythm compresses under pressure—“pressure squeezing her ribs”—then widens for the dawn image. No dialogue, so voice rests on syntax; occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing” territory) is justified by the lyric accumulative mode. One tiny scaffold: “the hush wasn’t empty—it pulsed…” could lose the second clause without loss.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, sensory, rhythmic; sentences vary in length and never stall momentum. Figurative language is selective—“secrets coiled like eels”—and doesn’t overstay. No synonym churn or template cadence; “time ran short” is the only repeated stem, a negligible artifact. Final line breathes: “the gathered hush was gone, but its lesson remained,” delivering closure without clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Forgotten sound-trap temple as memory vault is fresh; the scent-key vial reverses expected artifact logic—emptiness equals liberation. Risky second-person address never appears; instead, the lyric accumulative structure teaches its own rules early. Emotional specificity—Mara’s mother lullaby, crown she never wore—grounds the concept in human loss. The synthesis feels inevitable once the vial floats empty at dawn.</comment>
