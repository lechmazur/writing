<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Kael’s skeptical-scientist streak and hunger to decode “weather-carriers” are concrete from the first sensory beat; the metallic-ozone taste test shows interior contradiction in-scene. His micro-choices (kneeling, palm-to-soil, spitting copper) externalize value-hierarchy under escalating threat. The closing refusal to keep the compass is dramatized, not declared, giving Earned Stasis with visible cost—he swallows “lavender and regret,” foreclosing disbelief. Only the blacksmith/Marlow axis stays off-page, so status crucible and secondary-pressure bullets are NA; no deduction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: compass frozen, Kael’s epistemic stance shifted, cost tasted (“lavender and regret”) on the page. Drive lens = Accumulative/Textural: pattern of taste-signals intensifies then breaks at aurora-fracture, reweighting stakes. Orientation clean by word 40; no teleporting props; causality intact—Lira’s arrival complicates but does not resolve. Meets 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lavender bluff and compass ring function as micro-setting that constrains every beat: stems bow, tin hums, tastes shift tactics. Aurora acts as overhead pressure gauge, its fracture syncing with needle-freeze to crystallize final image. Spatial choreography remains coherent—Kael kneels, ring drops, Lira enters edge—no floating bodies. Earth-salt, leaf-decay, copper-blood tastes keep sensory hierarchy urgent and POV-filtered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“decode weather-carriers or remain blind”—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when the compass abandons people for the bluff itself, foreclosing Kael’s prior method. Protagonist agency: he kneels, tastes, drops the ring—each act narrows options under Accumulative pressure. Cost is legible: loss of epistemic certainty, copper blood-taste, surrender of trusted tool. No coincidence resolves; forest election release complicates rather than saves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-didactically: empirical arrogance vs. sentient landscape. Subtext carried in taste-metals and voting trees—no reader lecturing. Final image reweights premise: compass still, Kael tasting regret—Conceptual Repricing. Avoids thematic echo; Lira’s dialogue stays situational. Complexity maintained—forests release pain yet offer no moral comfort.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature sharp—“petals trembled like…moths drawn to celestial flame,” metallic-ozone mouth. Syntax mirrors restless intellect: stacked qualifiers calm to short clauses under aurora fracture. No head-hopping; Lira’s speech stays external, filtered through Kael’s storm-prickle skin. Dialogue sparse, subtextual: “You shouldn’t have come here” carries place-weather warning, not exposition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High information density: each sentence advances image, motive, or world rule—no scaffold. Figurative language purposeful, patterned (taste-as-data), peaks at copper-blood without muddle. Rhythm breathes with beats—long sensory curls then abrupt “He spat.” Zero loops, synonym churn, or filter-verb stacks. Opening line anchors voice and stake; final line crystallizes reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: tree suffrage + taste-based dowsing + aurora tribunal, all welded to character goal. Specificity—“tin compass ring,” “ozone on back teeth”—prevents generic slip. Risk taken in lyric science-fantasy yet closure remains legible. Transforms eco-parable into intimate epistemic crisis; removal would collapse stakes and sensory engine.</comment>
