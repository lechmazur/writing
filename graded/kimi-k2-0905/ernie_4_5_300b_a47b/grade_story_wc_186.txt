<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—retrocognitive gift vs. stubborn hope—drives every tactile micro-choice (bleeding fingers, shard-alignment). The final renunciation of needing the stars fully returned is earned by persistent embodied cost and crystallizes her hierarchy of values.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the prism’s song reweights the premise—light is for memory, not navigation. Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the cadence shift from hush to hum is legible and carries persistent cost (scarred hands, void scar remains).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Glass pavilion functions as micro-setting: jagged edges cut fingers, dust clouds vision, and the hollow in the mosaic literally accepts the shard to complete the resonator. Environment constrains every alignment attempt and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prove meaning in coincidences—tightens when each star-path alignment costs blood and stamina. The storm-night deepening forces the final shard insertion, foreclosing abandonment; price is visible in torn skin and the void’s unhealed scar.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from accreted images: shard → fragment → song. Final non-literal answer: rekindling is not restoration but re-membering; the scar in the sky endures, proving meaning survives rupture. No moralizing statement, only resonant reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains perceptual signature: “shattered panes rattled like skeletal wind chimes,” “glass hummed—a low, resonant tone that vibrated in her bones.” Rhythm swells with pressure; no head-hop; diction stays within custodian-star-map lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; sentences vary in length and opening. Figurative language is sparse under peak pressure; “shard of hush” is taught early and paid off. High information density: one line often layers sensory, emotional, and cosmological data.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>“Shard of hush” re-lexifies apocalypse trope into acoustics; retrocognition as star-path archaeology freshens beacon-tower myth. Synthesis feels inevitable: silence is a material that can fracture. Risk (lyric accumulative structure) heightens resonance without obscuring closure.</comment>
