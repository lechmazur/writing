<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is concrete—gloved hands trembling from cold and static, the coin warming in his palm, the silent counting of steps. His contradictory impulse—accepting the challenge not for money but to test a private theory—drives every move, and the final quiet humming and light footsteps show a micro-choice hierarchy that costs him the “long way” and Voss’s approval. The flaw: we never feel a genuine struggle with fear or doubt; competence dominates, so the endurance lacks visible cost beyond a grin. Still, his perceptual signature (ozone taste, container groans as positional cues) remains individual and consistent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: coin→Libra symbol→key→hidden staircase→glowing map proves the labyrinth watches, re-weighting Elias’s prior whisper-theory with conceptual cost. The 698-word single-scene arc is cleanly oriented by ~120 words (container row, storm, challenge), one transition (descend/return), and lands a Resonant Reconfiguration—his quiet “Not long enough” crystallizes a new stance. Minor stutter: the brass key appears with zero prior cue or failed attempt, so the lock-less logic feels providential, not earned. Closure is intact, lens is Causal, cost legible in the humbled haulers and Elias’s refusal to shout directions.</comment>

<comment>Port-container labyrinth is tactile: rusted bolts clank, storm-static hums through steel, ozone coats tongue; distance tracked via echoing shouts versus whisper-slips. Micro-setting object—the zodiac coin—literally unlocks the staircase, satisfying 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays clean through junctions, staircase, return. Only slip: “towering maze” never specifies vertical scale vs. horizontal rows, but container doors slamming like thunder anchor height enough to avoid white-room syndrome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“prove whispers beat shouts”—is declared early and tested when Elias rejects shouting back at lost haulers, tightening his tactical silence. One meaningful escalation: storm-peaked midnight + spinning compasses erase map reliability, forcing instinctive coin/key pivot that forecloses the safe pencil-route. Cost is felt: double-pay bragging rights surrendered to Voss for the slower whisper-path; haulers remain lost as proof. Agency pure; no coincidence resolves. Could use one tangible loss (tool, blood) to push past “bragging” into visceral, hence capped at 8.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Theme—language volume vs. efficacy—emerges through action, not thesis: loud haulers stay lost, silent Elias finds hidden hub. Final image of him withholding directions while humming re-weights earlier motif without moralizing. Subtext in dialogue minimal but present: Voss’s grunt “You took the long way” carries institutional skeptic of unofficial knowledge. No late symbolism grabs; zodiac, maps, key accrue meaning through use, though “labyrinth with mind” skirts allegory, slightly blunting nuance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias; no head-hop. Voice carries stevedore diction—“rusted bolts,” “container 42-B,” “haulers”—without academic drift. Rhythm mirrors tension: short paratactic clauses during shift, longer reflective cadence atop staircase. One filter-verb cluster (“He mused…”) but justified internal deduction. Dialogue sparse, natural: Voss grizzled, haulers panicked; distinct idiom achieved in two lines. Perceptual signature strong—coin temperature as compass—earns 8+.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is propulsive, info-dense: “storm’s energy made the metal walls vibrate, and the air tasted like ozone” performs three jobs in one line. Occasional ornamental metaphor (“edges sharp as knife cuts”) but isolated, not clustered. No paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary. Tiny scaffold: “He unfolded his map again” repeats function of prior map line; −0.2. Grammar clean, no typos. Final line “a door opened” is crisp, image-driven. Artifact-free enough for high-band, but not immaculate under 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Shipping-container labyrinth that reconfigures by “walk-identification” is fresh world-logic; zodiac coin as skeleton key literalizes star-navigation inside steel boxes—clever synthesis. Risk: allegorical tinge (“labyrinth listens”) but grounded in dockworkers’ lived superstition, avoids abstract sermon. Whisper-over-shout premise feels non-obvious yet inevitable after closure. Could push further into maritime folklore or union politics for higher originality, but within 700 words the concept is distinct and transformative.</comment>
