<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lirael’s “softly deliberate” trait is shown through her decision to study footage instead of alerting the council, but interiority stays general (“her mind raced”) and the final word-choice beat feels lightly motivated rather than driven by a visible contradiction or cost. The twin-stone gesture is elegant yet the emotional price is implied, not embodied. Enough micro-choice links action to motive to clear the 7-band, but the peak beat lacks a charged internal split that would push higher.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: stone’s pulse → footage comparison → spiral recognition → utter “Bloom” → shadow reconfigures. Orientation is swift, the library/cloud dome anchors space by ~70 words, and the 1987 footage supplies a clean before/after hinge. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the shelves rewrite themselves—whose cost is felt as the shadow’s dissolution, satisfying the 9- gate for form even if the price could be sharper on Lirael personally.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Petals-carved shelves, spider-silk robes, and the gold-veined stone give tactile specificity; the dome glass and dusk light track spatially across beats. The river-stone-as-key constrains the final action, meeting the 9- object test. A touch more sensory narrowing under crisis (heartbeat-like pulse in palm) would have nudged 8.5, but selection stays purposeful and feeds the climax image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“preserve the shape of hope”—is signaled early and tightens when the shadow’s hunger for definition is revealed. The single meaningful turn (footage overlay → word spoken) forecloses the option of doing nothing and visibly rewrites the library, paying a conceptual cost. Pressure escalates causally; a second intermediate complication would have lifted the band another notch.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through the metamorphosis of hope rather than exposition: hope frays when externalized, requires periodic re-shaping, and leaves luminous residue. Final image of re-titled books offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. A slightly more character-bound emotional aftertaste would have reached the 8.5+ tier.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays anchored to Lirael’s perceptual filter; dusk light, petrified petals, and stone pulse color her noticing. Syntax is controlled, with minor cadence repetition (“The stone… The shadow…”). Dialogue is minimal but carries subtext (Thalos’s luminous regret). Voice is coherent, not yet idiosyncratic enough for the 8.8+ band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, with high information density: each sentence advances image or causality. No scaffold loops or mixed metaphors; figurative language (“touch like starlight”) is sparse and timed for closure. A couple of adjective pairs (“smooth, gray”) could be trimmed, but artifacts never threaten clarity or momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Shareable-dream tech + library above clouds + hope-metamorphosis shadow synthesizes familiar tropes into a fresh conceptual lens. The footage-comparison method and spiral-symbol reprise feel inevitable in hindsight. Risk is moderate; a bolder structural or POV gamble could have lifted the score into the 9- range.</comment>
