<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory motives—guilt over the family lie and hunger for the truth—are kept alive in every beat; the reinvention trait directly shapes his refusal to stay a mere courier. Interiority is concrete (fingers trembling on the harness, chest tightening at the lullaby memory). The renunciation of the safe courier life to walk toward the coast is earned by the dust-mote map and taped song; cost is felt. Flaw drives plot: his obsessive secrecy delays action, letting clients slip away, a credible stumble.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: dust patterns, ledger entries, and song fragments layer until a new map crystallizes. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration—Elias abandons the attic sanctuary, momentum shifted by the dream injunction “the echo is in the space between.” Cost is legible: he forfeits income, client trust, and the shelter of fabrication. One causal micro-gap: the anonymous mailing of the chip is never sourced, but it is the necessary inciting rupture, not a resolver, so allowed under Situational complication.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The attic is evoked through tools (harness, scroll case, cassette deck) that constrain action—Elias can’t decode without them. Dust under the skylight becomes a living map whose shifting spirals directly enable the final decision. Olfactory and tactile hooks (wood polish, pigeon feathers, sunflower seed) root the scene without checklist overload. The environment is not backdrop; it is the instrument of revelation, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth vs. fabricated legacy—tightens when the 1987 ledger entry proves the meteorite already traveled once, making Elias complicit in its loop. Escalation is textural: each recovered fragment (cassette, dream, dust map) increases density rather than external peril, consistent with Accumulative lens. The price is visibly felt: ignored clients, forfeited reputation, the aloneness of walking out. One tightening beat suffices and is present.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from recurrence: paper trails, pigeons, and dust all expose the instability of any single story; truth is a swirl, not a sheet. No moral is stated; instead the final image of Elias on the road lets the reader feel the cost of renouncing the tidy lie. Subtext in the grandfather’s drunk lullaby hints cultures lost to sandstorms—colonial erasure—without exposition. Ambiguity is purposeful: we never learn who mailed the chip, keeping the echo alive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is synesthetic and tactile: “sunlight in a golden haze,” “smell of old paper and wood polish.” Rhythm modulates—long, luminous sentences for memory, clipped fragments when Elias decodes (“A map. Not of geography, but of time.”). No head-hop; interiority stays strictly bounded to Elias. The slight heightening of register toward the end (“conceptual repricing”) mirrors his intellectual excitement and is earned.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty: “He released the pigeon, watching it vanish into the sky. Then he turned to the skylight….” Action, image, and emotional pivot in two lines. No scaffold loops; varied openings avoid drumbeat. One mixed metaphor—“the echo of lost songs blooming and withering”—occurs in the final clause; because it reweights the premise under Accumulative lens and carries conceptual cost, it is allowed. Otherwise metaphors stay coherent and sparse.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The meteorite-as-cipher and dust-mote celestial map feel fresh, avoiding stock treasure-hunt beats. The pigeon-courier attic is specific to Elias’s vocational world, not genre set dressing. Risk is moderate: lyric accumulation replaces thriller stakes, but coherence holds. Synthesis could be more daring—plot skeleton still resembles “inherit the mysterious artefact, decode ancestry”—but granular detail and sensory prose keep it from feeling template.</comment>
