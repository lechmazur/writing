<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara’s want—"to find the place where stories begin"—is declared early and recurs, but her interiority stays abstract ("her mind racing") and no micro-choice under pressure shows a value hierarchy; the renunciation at the end is gentle rather than costly. The milk-eyed stranger remains a cipher; no status shift or relationship crucible tests her. Still, the clean-slate premise is particular and her stall actions track with motive.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the floating note dissolves into Elara’s palm, reweighting premise (absence returns as stardust) with visible cost—she now shoulders every untold story. Causal chain is slim—stranger appears, buys jar, vanishes—but the accumulative pattern of absences-taken/returned holds. Orientation is swift; only one transition (day→night) and spatial logic stays clean.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Library-of-glass image is vivid yet selective: refracted shards, mist-muffled steps, prismatic light—all filter through Elara’s vendor gaze. Cloud-sea and floating melody are poetic but consistent; no physics contradictions. Micro-setting works: the empty jar shelf literally charges the final image when the note hovers there. Details are woven through action, not listed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—control over narrative void—signalled early; pressure escalates only once when stranger takes the jar, but Elara’s agency is observational, not tactical. Cost is conceptual (infinite stories now possible) rather than felt; no live option is foreclosed for her. Escalation is present but gentle; lens is Accumulative, not causal-turn driven.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—stories begin in absence—emerges through iterated object exchanges rather than sermon; final image of stardust in palm reweights prior motif without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: what tale will the stranger write? Complexity is embraced; no tidy thesis. Subtext in gesture (tracing jar edge) supports theme quietly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person close stays locked to Elara; perceptual signature is consistent—she notices light, silence, weight of jars. Syntax is controlled, lyrical but not overwrought; diction stays within her poetic-vendor register. Dialogue is minimal yet distinct: stranger’s gravel-water voice vs her measured cadence. No head-hopping or filter-verb bloat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene pace—short sentences for lull, longer for prismatic description; no template cadence detected. Information density is high: one sentence often sets scene and theme ("She believed that before a tale could take shape, there must be a void"). Minor paraphrase loop ("stories begin in the smallest, most fragile things—/a note, a glance, a jar of moonlight") but it echoes list structure intentionally. Metaphors stay coherent; no mixed vehicles. Clean proofing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Premise—vendor selling literal absences in floating glass library—is fresh and commits fully; "Bottled Moonlight" as narrative potential feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric mode is held without clarity loss. Tropes (hooded stranger, ephemeral library) are re-grounded via commerce of voids. Specific detail—frosted-glass knife, single milk eye—prevents archetype drift.</comment>
