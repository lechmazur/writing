<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s feral patience, dimensional homesickness, and clawed stillness are vividly embodied; the tossed pendant crystallizes her refusal to surrender uncertainty. Interior contradiction is present—longing for home yet guarding this world—but the final beat could sharper show the cost of that renunciation. The mentor’s reappearance feels slightly gift-wrapped; a trace more earned doubt would push the arc to 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: lure → wait → renounce → threshold; the tossed pendant is a decisive visible cost that reconfigures access to the library. Orientation is anchored within 120 words; the moss path reveal pays off the garden’s spatial logic. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—uncertainty repriced as home—felt through the ache in Mara’s stilled heart.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Frozen topiary, ice-crusted soil, and blue flame lantern are tactile and POV-filtered; the moss path’s glow directly enables the final step, satisfying the 9+ constraint. Mist operates as both veil and clock, narrowing perception under pressure. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating props or geography shifts.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—guard this reality vs. return home—tightens when the pendant’s call threatens to dissolve boundaries. One meaningful turn: toss the pendant, foreclose easy reunion, accept exile as price. Cost is legible in the hiss of sinking silver and the mentor’s lantern now hers to carry. Pressure escalates under causal lens; no coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges: uncertainty as sanctuary, light as the true prison. Final image—“uncertainty? That was just another word for home”—reweights earlier dread into acceptance without moralizing. Subtext of library-as-liminal-space invites multiple readings; ambiguity feels earned, not evasive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lean, winter-bitter, with feral perceptual signature—“claws digging into ice-crusted soil.” Compression and inversion (“I fear the light”) teach the reader the pattern early. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens under stress. Dialogue is sparse, indirection-loaded; cultist’s tremor humanizes the antagonist momentarily.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and rhythm; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is sparse, precise—“lantern… casting no light but revealing hidden things.” No filter-verb stacks or mixed metaphors in peak beats. Minor scaffold: “the garden seemed to hold its breath” is familiar, but it sits early, not at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Blends portal-fantasy nostalgia with feral monk vigil; the library-between-planes is familiar, yet Mara’s clawed stillness and fear-of-light inversion feel specific. Tossing the key *into* the fountain—surrender rather than unlock—reverses expected ritual. Risky choice to make waiting the central action pays off by turning stasis into agency.</comment>
