<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s guilt over the tycoon eulogy is cleanly anchored in present ritual, and his micro-choice to reverse the puppet roles crystallizes the ethical question with felt cost—his quiet “Exactly. Half-truths are the only kind worth telling” is a credible renunciation. Interiority stays concrete, not diagnostic, and the serenity trait modulates under crowd pressure without flattening. The beat-count is thin for full transformation, but the earned stasis lands.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the reversed projection reweights the premise that “ethical” equals full exposure, and the cost is legible in the audience’s nervous laugh that becomes release. The single-scene orientation is firm by line 5; the causal lens (Situational) holds as the campfire stick’s glow forces stance crystallization. One micro-turn suffices; no teleport props or amnesia.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The rusted radar dome fractures light and literally shapes the staging—its curved wall is the only surface that can receive the holographic puppets, so the setting constrains the final reversal. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven: Elias notices ink-stained fingers and the faint hum of old signals, never tourist-cataloguing. The dome’s ribs reappear in the last sentence as a mirrored crown, charging the closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can a story be ethical if it withholds—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightened when the drifter challenges “half-truths.” The reversal act narrows options: Elias must publicly defend partial concealment or lose the crowd. Cost is visible—the audience’s nervous laughter turns cathartic, social credit spent. Pressure coheres under situational lens; no coincidence resolves.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Theme emerges from the image of reversed shadows, not from Elias’s aphorisms. The final reweighting—power as mirror, not crown—offers resonant ambiguity without moralizing. Subtext in Mara’s scarf and the dome’s fractured light quietly echo the fracture between truth and performance. No tidy thesis; the reader leaves with the campfire’s unsettling flicker.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person close stays locked to Elias; perceptual signature is calligrapher-specific—ink, serifed verses, runes as strokes. Syntax tightens under performance pressure: “They steal time, memory, even truth. But what if we reverse the heist?” Rhythm mirrors puppet-string control. No head-hopping; dialogue is sparse and goal-driven, carrying subtext in implication, not declaration.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies from long image-driven sentences to clipped reversal command. No scaffold loops; “rust-crowned dome” and “meteor hush” are specific, not thesaurus churn. One mixed metaphor—“rusted crown above scrubland”—is minor. Information density high: each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and thematic work. Closure line “inviting you to lean in” breathes without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: calligrapher turned shadow-play provocateur in a dead radar dome reframes ethics as performance art. The campfire stick’s runic carvings link ancient oral tradition to holographic tech without exposition dump. Risk—half-truth as moral stance—could feel glib, but the cost is social laughter turned cathartic, not abstract. Transformation test passes: swap elements and the concept collapses.</comment>
