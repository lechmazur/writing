<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Lila’s interiority is textured—her perceptual filter for arcs, her ritualized return, the dove-gray case as extension of hand—yet no contradictory impulse ever threatens her calm. The final “enough” is a label, not a tested renunciation; we never see her refuse an actual alternative, so the cost is conceptual, not embodied. Still, the micro-choice to photograph again is earned and particular to her vocation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure is a quiet Conceptual Repricing: the field and factory already are the masterpiece, so her lens shifts from making to witnessing. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of arcs, seasons, returns—held cleanly to the last image. Cost is legible in the shift from “transmute pain” to “enough,” though compressed into a single word rather than dramatized beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lavender field–factory dyad is vivid and bias-filtered: Lila notices rust crescents, vine curves, dove-gray echo. Spatial choreography is stable; the environment guides her decision to photograph again, charging the final image. Yet the 9+ gate is missed—no object or micro-setting constrains a tactical choice; the map case is carried but never limits or enables action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transmute pain into masterpiece—anchors early; pressure tightens when she realizes the collaboration is already complete. The tightening is internal and textural, not a causal reversal, but it reweights her ambition under the Accumulative lens. Cost is conceptual (renunciation of authorship), visible in the final word, yet lacks an on-page forfeiture of time, tool, or opportunity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the arcs—pipe, vine, lens—of ruin reclaimed: healing is not creation but recognition. Subtext lives in gesture: feather tucked, case snapped shut, camera raised. The dove and lavender avoid symbolic shout by remaining sensory. Final “enough” lands as earned wisdom, though its resonance is slightly blunted by summary brevity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited hovers at lyric distance; diction stays within Lila’s lexicon of curves and patina. Rhythm modulates—long sentences for lingering, fragmentlike snap for “enough.” No head-hop; compression is taught early (“as if the soil itself had grown impatient”) and paid off in final cadence. Filter verbs appear but are voice-motivated (“she saw,” “she realized”) and do not dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is clean, lyrical, and mostly loop-free; only mild scaffold in repeated “as if” constructions. Metaphors are coherent (vines as fingers, arcs as secrets). Information density is high—each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and thematic cargo. A faint register drift toward editorial “we realize” is avoided; the voice stays anchored to Lila’s perceptual rhythm.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Familiar decay-rebirth territory is refreshed through the puzzle-archivist gaze and the arcs-as-grammar motif. The inversion—masterpiece already exists—feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk is modest; the lyric-accumulative structure is well handled but not formally daring. Specificity of dove-gray case and lavender scent keeps it from generic ruin-porn.</comment>
