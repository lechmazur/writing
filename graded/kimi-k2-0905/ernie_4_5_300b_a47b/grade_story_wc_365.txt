<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael’s compulsion toward the shard is visceral and embodied; the “second heartbeat” line makes the urge legible. The final renunciation lands because the shard has hurt him all along—its absence now registers as cost. Interiority stays concrete, but the mother-parallel-world double is sketched too thinly to exert crucible pressure, so the relational stake feels assumed rather than tested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: shard pull → platform → portal → mother-world → shard rejection → return, each step a because/therefore. Closure is a clean Earned Stasis: hurling the shard forecloses reunion and costs the certainty he chased. Orientation is anchored by word 80; no debt applied. One minor lapse: the visor’s lattice rules are never re-consulted after the jump, so the final stability reads slightly convenient.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dust motes catching visor hues, rust vs. gleaming alloy, ozone tang—each detail is filtered through Kael’s cartographer gaze and tied to his emotional tempo. The bay’s shift from derelict to pristine is the external mirror of the choice cost, satisfying the 9+ constraint. Spatial tracking stays clean; only the hovering ship’s distance and vector remain vague, a hairline slip.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“will he open the forbidden door?”—is signaled early via mother’s hologram. Escalation is single-cycle but effective: shard heat intensifies → portal offers reunion → rejection narrows future paths. Cost is visible: he forfeits the living mother and the certainty the shard promised. Pressure plateaus rather than deepens once he meets the alternate mother, keeping the score just below the 8.2 gate for 9+ eligibility.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme—truth as a cutting, portable wound—emerges through the shard’s edge and the final “weight was gone” image. Subtext operates in the mother’s smile that “didn’t reach her eyes,” hinting at ethical cost without exposition. No moralizing line intrudes, but the hologram warning is a near-thesis utterance, triggering a −0.4 nudge. Resonance lingers, yet the alternate-world ethics remain under-complicated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Kael; perceptual signature is sharp—“lenses humming,” “tang of a world where time bled sideways.” Syntax tightens under stress: fragments like “He fell.” propel the vortex. No head-hop, no filter-verb clutter. One register lift—“conceptual repricing” diction in the rubric, not the story—doesn’t leak onto the page; voice remains coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, image-dense; no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Metaphors stay physical and consistent (quicksand, vortex, thread). One mixed cluster—“gravity reversed, colors inverted”—is acceptable compression during free-fall. Final paragraph lands with cadence variation and no overwriting. Clean copy; no artifacts in closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Multiverse-as-grief-therapy is familiar, yet the shard-as-key-that-must-be-discarded gives a fresh ethical twist. Specificity of the cartographer profession and visor tech keeps the frame from feeling generic. Risk is moderate: the alternate-mother encounter could have slid into sentimentality but is kept terse. Not radically new, but the personal scale and sensory mapping lift it above template.</comment>
