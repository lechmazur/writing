<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lila’s “functional creativity” is shown, not told—she scavenges conduits, rigs a generator, trades sweat for light. Interiority stays concrete, filtered through spatial/engineering perception. No contradictory impulses on-page, so the 9+ quick test fails, capping at 8.7. Micro-choices (kneeling, rerouting, pocketing the sextant) align with motive and foreclose the “restore-old” path, paying visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single-scene causality holds: find sextant → reroute flows → light equation = Decisive Change with irreducible visual cost. Orientation anchor appears by word 88, beating the 120-word limit; no penalty. The lens is Causal throughout; no ambiguity at closure. One tightening beat—she commits the sextant to the crater—flips the terminal from dead to generative; the formula’s glow is the charged image, paying conceptual cost instantly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dusty terminal, shattered glass, moonlit crater—details are tactile and engineer-filtered. The sextant fragment constrains her improvised tools; the atrium’s geometry dictates the generator layout, so environment shapes tactics and final image, passing the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography remains clean—no impossible moves. Economy is good; carnival only implied, not exposition-dumped.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“prove fractured systems can mean something new”—is signaled early. Escalation is one continuous because/therefore climb: sextant found → hum awakens → reroute → equation lights. Cost is the sweat, risk of electrocution, and the irreversible commitment of the relic; price is legible. No coincidence resolves; agency drives every turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from action: resurrection = repurposing, not nostalgia. Final image (projected equation) answers the thematic question without moralizing. No echoic label-speak at peak. Ambiguity remains—equation is untested—inviting reflection. The sextant’s cosmic etchings quietly reweight “lost truths” into DIY physics, achieving Conceptual Repricing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays inside Lila’s engineering sensorium; perceptual signature is rivet-level and vector-based. Syntax tightens under pressure—clausal shortening during rerouting. No head-hop; distance stable. Carnival only off-stage rumor, so no POV leakage from unseen voices. Register matches intern vocabulary; no academic drift at climax.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Clean, high-density lines: “Moonlight pooled on the floor, illuminating a jagged metal fragment lodged in a crack” does triple sensory, prop, and mood duty. No scaffold loops; no mixed metaphors. Rhythm accelerates with parataxis during conduit reroute, then relaxes into longer reflective cadence. Opening and closing images (twilight → dawn) bracket the arc neatly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: spaceport ruin + carnival absence + engineer repurposing sextant into energy art is not stock. “Resurrection via redirected flows” flips trope from ghostly to infrastructural. Risk taken—quiet, solo, tech-heavy climax—pays off. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped, confirming specificity. No derivative premise penalty warranted.</comment>
