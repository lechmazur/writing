<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elias’s quiet obsession with ghosts is shown through tactile micro-choices—pressing forehead to metal, pocketing the mainspring—rather than labels; the final moment of shared weight with the clown ghost crystallizes a believable, earned endurance rather than tidy growth. Interiority stays concrete and profession-shaded; only the “second skin” line flirts with cliché. The lack of any second on-page character keeps status dynamics and relationship crucible off the table, but solitary POV is coherent. Closure is a renunciation-repair stance whose cost is felt in his trembling legs and the cold hand on his shoulder.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: dust patterns, cracks, and flickering lights thicken until the ceiling compartment reveal reweights the stakes. Orientation is anchored by 120 words via ticket counter, elevator shaft, fluorescent death. One meaningful cadence shift occurs when plaster gives way and hidden papers emerge, tightening knowledge. Closure is Earned Stasis: Elias chooses to “repair the stories,” not just the elevator, with visible cost signaled by shaking legs and the ghost’s cold touch; lens stays coherent, no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Abandoned circus ticket office is sketched with selective, sensory economy—peeling laminate, cool metal, blue-gray haze—each detail filtered through Elias’s technician gaze. Spatial choreography is clean: counter as step, ceiling crack as portal, dust piles mapped on the floor. The mainspring barrel functions as micro-setting/object that constrains his investigative method and reappears at closure. Fluorescent buzz death supplies a live clock that tightens the final discovery, passing the 9+ gate test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—ghosts need witnessing—signals early and tightens once: the ceiling reveal forecloses the option to leave without acknowledgment. Agency is observational-decisive: analyzing dust → choosing to brush, listen, open plaster, then to “repair the stories.” No external antagonist; pressure is situational-accumulative. Cost is legible in trembling legs and cold ghost touch; escalation is single but sufficient for 700-word span.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</question><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: facades—physical ceiling, emotional suppression—must be cracked open before movement (elevator, ghosts) can resume. No explicit thesis; final image of cold hand / whirring barrel reweights earlier dust and crack motifs without moralizing. Subtext resides in silence and gesture: clown ghost pointing, Elias’s shaking legs. Ambiguity lingers—he’s still alone, office still abandoned—yielding a quiet, honest aftereffect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Elias’s technician perception—dust as data, plaster as diagnostic surface—no head-hop. Diction is precise yet restrained: “horologist’s mainspring barrel,” “swirl here, ridge there,” matching vocational lens. Rhythm subtly accelerates during ceiling excavation via shorter sentence clusters, then exhales with the final “whirring softly.” No dialogue, so voice distinction test is waived; internal voice remains singular and consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</question><comment>Prose is clean, high-density: each sentence advances observation or atmosphere; no filler transitions. One mixed metaphor risk—“shadows stretch like old, thin hands” beside “weightless burden pressing like a second skin”—but both serve ghostly tone and do not tangle causality. No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks; sentence openings vary. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves with image (mainspring whir) that echoes first paragraph cue.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fusion of elevator tech with ghost whisperer is fresh; mainspring barrel as emotional stethoscope is non-obvious and specific. Dust-pattern forensics repurposes an everyday maintenance act into supernatural detection, resisting trope checklist. Circus fire backstory is revealed through found tickets/photo rather than exposition dump. Risk taken—quiet, epiphanic ending—pays off under accumulative lens; no derivative echoes detected. Could travel unchanged with name swaps, but detail density keeps it memorable.</comment>
