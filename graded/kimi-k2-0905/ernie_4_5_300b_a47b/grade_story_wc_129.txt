<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Kael’s “boldly sympathetic” trait is shown only in his impulse to seek Veyra, not in any tested contradiction or micro-choice under pressure; the interiority is poetic label (“luminescent ache”) rather than embodied contradiction. No relationship-as-crucible pressure since Lira is revealed only at the end. Earned stasis is present but thin: the cost of shared loneliness is declared, not dramatized in a beat where he must renounce or pay. Still, the arc from solitary maker to co-weaver is legible and tied to his vocation, keeping it above mid-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: because orchard fades → therefore search → therefore follow tags → therefore meet Lira → reveal. Closure is a Charged Poise: the shared ache is crystallized under the obsidian arbor with the constellation thread glowing, reconfiguring isolation into kinship. Cost is felt—“the luminescent ache remained, but now it was shared”—and the lens holds (causal). Minor waiver: orientation anchors (who/where) are slightly late (~130 words) but the disorientation is functional to the dream-logic and pays off in the final image, so no penalty applied.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard and glass-tree sap are not postcard backdrop: the sap literally binds Kael’s reed sculptures, and the crater’s angle-of-light mechanic is the clue that drives the search. Spatial choreography is tight—eastern edge, amphitheater clearing, obsidian arbor as second sky—tracking bodies and sightlines cleanly. Sensory filter is POV-tilted: prismatic refraction, liquid-mercury time, reed callouses. The 9+ gate is met: the arbor’s reflective surface constrains the final moment, charging the constellation thread that reweights kinship.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—combat loneliness by finding Veyra—is signaled early and tightens once: the tag-date forces a timed choice. Agency is present but light: Kael deciphers and follows; the final reveal is Lira’s decision to unmask. Cost is the shared ache, legible but not viscerally paid on the page. Escalation is accumulative—each tag adds density rather than narrowing options—sufficient for sub-800-word scope, yet the lack of a fork where Kael risks something tangible keeps it below 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of webbed kinship emerges through the arbor-as-bridge image and the refracted-light motif rather than assertion. The final reconfiguration—loneliness shared becomes connection—avows no moral; the constellation thread reprises the earlier hidden signature, revaluing anonymity as mutual recognition. Subtext operates in silence: Lira’s silver eyes reflect orchard glow before her reveal, coding her as mirror. Minor echo of “web” language is allowed because it is always tied to sensory image (glass threads, light merger).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-limited voice is stable, with reed-sculptor perceptual signature: angles of light, sap viscosity, constellation etchings. Diction stays within Kael’s artisan lexicon; no corporate register drift. Rhythm modulates: longer fluid sentences for crater description, clipped fragments when tag-date is discovered. Dialogue is sparse and indirect—“Follow the angles”—carrying subtext without ventriloquism. No head-hopping; Lira’s interior is withheld until reveal, which is valid under causal lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and image-dense; sentences carry double duty (e.g., “sap...used to bind his creations” world-builds and characterizes). No scaffold loops or synonym churn; metaphors (liquid-mercury time, second sky) extend orchard logic without contradiction. Read-aloud rhythm varies; paragraph breaks mirror beats. One near-mixed metaphor—“time pooled like liquid mercury” beside “air hums with ghosts”—but internal logic holds. Closure line is crisp: shared ache crystallized, no clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Freshness lies in the fusion of glass-orchard botanic with reed-sculptor craft; the arbor-as-constellation-device is a specific synthesis, not stock sf-fantasy. However, the “search for mysterious artist who turns out to be closest person” is a familiar twist; the tag-as-test is not radically re-invented. Particularized sensory detail (sap as binder, angle-of-light clue) rescues from template feel, but the emotional arc could transplant with minor re-skin, keeping it sub-8.8.</comment>
