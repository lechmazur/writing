<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Alaric’s guilt and need for self-forgiveness are viscerally embodied in the black-thread memory; the ring-fidget micro-choice recurs under pressure and links directly to the pedagogical reframing at the end. Interiority stays concrete—no diagnostic labels—and the final “weight lifting” is earned by the on-page unravelling of threads. Flaw: the prince’s last look is the only moment we feel two contradictory impulses simultaneously; elsewhere the emotional layering is sequential rather than concurrent, keeping this just shy of 9-territory.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the woven hush physically wraps Alaric, re-pricing his guilt as a thread to be rewoven, not severed. The cost is unmistakable—he forecloses perpetual penance and chooses renewed vocation—crystallized in the final image of the ring-twist shifting from anxiety to anticipation. Causal lens holds throughout: each labyrinth step is a because/therefore consequence of thread-plucking. Accumulation caps do not apply; no orientation debt; no late-rule insertions.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Platinum labyrinth lines constrain every footstep; their gradual dissolution into light charges the final image. The time-frozen bodies function as micro-setting, narrowing perception to Alaric’s heartbeat and the cued tapestry. Selective sensory hierarchy—muted colors, distant thunder felt not heard—mirrors his narrowed guilt-attention. Detail never stalls beats; each descriptor either guides physical movement or cues memory.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—signalled in paragraph one. Escalation arrives via the single micro-turn: black thread yanked → memory surge → labyrinth path revealed, tightening options under causal logic. Cost is visible: the tapestry border irreversibly unravels, foreclosing the fantasy that guilt can stay contained. Pressure plateaus rather than deepens further, keeping this below the 8.8 tier that would require a second, higher price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Theme emerges from the shifting meaning of “game”: chess as war → chess as pedagogy → life as rewoven tapestry. No explicit thesis statements; the final “new game to teach” reconfigures the concept without moralizing. Subtext rests in the ring-twist and the fading labyrinth, not speech. One hairline slip—“mistakes were moves, not endings” edges toward aphorism, but the image lands inside Alaric’s perceptual idiom, so penalty stays minor.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person tight stays strictly inside Alaric’s perceptual filter: “faint light of a sun that hadn’t moved in decades” is a tutor’s time-reference, not omniscient. Syntax lengthens under reflection, then fragments during thread-pluck—“The world shifted.”—mirroring cardiac lurch. No filter-verb stacks; diction (“winnow,” “frayed hush”) stays within his educated lexicon. Dialogue absent by design; voice remains singular and coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes: long kneeling sentence → short thread-pluck → cascading clauses as labyrinth dissolves. Information density high; one sentence often fuses sensory cue, memory trigger, and causal pivot. Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. Final line omits scaffold, landing on tactile “fidgeted with his ring” to propel exit. Minor artifact: “tableau of lives interrupted” is a stock phrase, but it sits in a low-pressure bracket, so only −0.1.</question>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fusing chess pedagogy with frozen-time curse is fresh, but the tapestry-as-code and guilt-unravel metaphor has prior literary echoes; specificity of platinum labyrinth and ring-fidget tilts it back toward memorable. Conceptual commitment is total—no late rule patches. The transformation test passes: swap chess for any other strategy and the entire symbolic scaffold collapses. Risk is moderate—quiet lyric closure rather than twist—but coherence stays high, earning upper-band placement.</comment>
