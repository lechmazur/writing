<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Zara’s contradictory impulses—obedient recorder vs. clandestine plotter—surface in the micro-choice to expose the mutable chart to Jaxon; the trembling needle and laugh embody simultaneous fear and defiance. Jaxon functions as pressure conduit rather than full crucible, but his shift from dismissive to awed supplies credible external mirror. Final “earned stasis” holds: she keeps stitching under heavier shadow, cost felt in the candle-lit silence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as conceptual repricing: the galaxy knot straightens under flame, reweighting the premise that decoration is harmless. Causal chain—telescope move → chart revelation → flame test—tightens once, sufficient for length. Orientation anchored by line 3; no debt. Persistent constraint: the eternal flame now marks her as rebel to any initiate who looks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Cobalt walls, frost rattle, domed dust, and brass sconce constrain movement and social risk; the candle’s heat limits how long Zara can safely “show” the message. The spiral galaxy cloth itself acts as micro-setting/tool hybrid that literally reconfigures under flame, charging the final image. Selective sensory triage—cold air, metallic scent, silk glow—mirrors her narrowed attention under coup anxiety.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve hidden star-knowledge—faces immediate tightening when council repositions telescopes; Zara’s agency is the deliberate act of decoding/displaying the chart to Jaxon, foreclosing her “invisible” status. Felt price: once the chart morphs in firelight, her disguise is weaponized and irreversible. Escalation is single but sufficient; no off-stage rescue.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: recorded knowledge is political power, and art’s beauty can be Trojan horse. Subtext resides in the flame-cued warp of silk—truth literally bends when viewed. Final image reframes earlier “nonsense songs” as encoded transmissions, inviting reader recursion. Avoids tidy moral; ambiguity lingers on who else can now read the sky.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Lush yet disciplined lyricism (“needles darted like comets”) stays within embroiderer’s perceptual bias; diction never exceeds her artisan-astronomer lexicon. No dialogue excess; Jaxon’s whisper and Zara’s wind-chime laugh carry distinct sonic stamps. Psychic distance tightens from panoramic observatory to needle-eye without head-hop. Compression achieves voice propulsion rather than ornament bloat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>High information density: embroidery jargon, telescope politics, and coup dread packed into single sentences without paraphrase loops. Rhythm modulates—long breath cadence for description, staccato for Jaxon’s warning. Figurative layer survives the flame test: galaxies “wink,” silk “breathes,” no mixed metaphors. Minor overuse of participle openers, but never within climax beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fusion of textile craft and espionage cartography feels fresh yet inevitable; premise commits fully without gimmick. Flame-as-synchronizer repurposes eternal-flame trope into active plot hinge. Risk taken: plot turns on fabric reacting to heat—sold by tactile specificity and prior rule seed (“threads of luminescent gold”). Without this element, closure image collapses.</comment>
