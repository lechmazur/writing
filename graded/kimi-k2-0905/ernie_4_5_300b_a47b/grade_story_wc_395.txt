<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is concrete—her pulse, the rough fabric under her fingertips—yet the “diagnostic label-speak” on the final beat (“And she was done letting the company erase…”) nudges her into textbook resolve rather than embodied contradiction. The micro-choice to upload coordinates while drones advance is visible and costly, earning her renunciation, but the prior emotional layering is slightly smoothed into a single heroic arc. Still, her attentional bias toward data streams and frayed patch is specific and sustained under pressure. Voice coherence is high; only the closure beat lacks a last contradictory tremor that would cap the arc at 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal linkage is clean: each 7-14-21 sighting tightens the search vector, Hale’s lie escalates access denial, and the decrypted video rewrites the mission rules. The closure is a Decisive Change—coordinates uploaded, path foreclosed—paid for by drone pursuit and job loss. Cost is legible in the upload moment; no lens ambiguity. One minor scaffold: “Across the echo of forgotten songs” is poetic throat-clearing that could be cut without loss, keeping the score just under 9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The glowing labyrinth of server racks, cold light on walls, and the spiral-insignia patch create a micro-setting that literally guides Lira’s cursor to the wormhole coordinates. Sensory selection is biased by her archivist gaze—timestamps, visor static, obsolete code—so every visual detail is also a tool. The final image of the patch glowing under drone-red light recharges its earlier meaning, satisfying the 9+ gate. Only the derelict station remains a placeholder; we feel the map pin, not the metal hull.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—find the vanished astronaut—tightens twice: Hale’s lie blocks archival access, then encryption gates the video. Each 7-14-21 instance is an on-page reminder that options narrow to one set of coordinates. The cost is felt when alarms blare and drones advance; upload is irreversible. No coincidence resolves the conflict; the numbers were seeded by Elara herself, so agency stays causal under the inferred lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the recurring motif of erasure—files, people, stars—without a final sermon. The spiral galaxy patch reframes from souvenir to cipher, reweighting corporate nostalgia as evidence of crime. “Sensed absence” is dramatized in ghost-folder footprints and static visor dreams, not asserted. The ethical calculus—memory versus profit—remains complex; Lira’s victory is escape, not justice, leaving ambiguity intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Lira’s perceptual signature: numbers flicker in peripheral vision, code smells obsolete, patch fabric is “rough beneath her fingertips.” No head-hop; Hale’s oily tone is filtered through her suspicion. Syntax accelerates into staccato clauses as drones enter, mirroring upload urgency. The lyric opener “Across the echo of forgotten songs” is the single self-conscious flourish; otherwise diction stays inside her data keeper lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Information density is high—every sentence advances search, pressure, or atmosphere. No paraphrase loops; “glowing labyrinth,” “sea of data streams,” and “cold light casting shadows” are distinct images. Metaphors stay coherent (labyrinth→servers, sea→streams). Final line “her mind racing toward the edge of the system” propels without figurative muddle. A single filter-verb cluster “she wondered if Elara had touched it the same way” is minor drift, not enough to dull the closing beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The corporate-archive search for a wormhole-erased astronaut is a fresh synthesis of cold-case noir and post-cyber memory politics. Recurrent prime numbers as steganographic star-map feels inevitable yet non-obvious. The spiral patch evolves from relic to key, avoiding symbolic convenience. Risk stays conceptual rather than structural; the piece plays the form straight, so the ceiling is mid-8.</comment>
