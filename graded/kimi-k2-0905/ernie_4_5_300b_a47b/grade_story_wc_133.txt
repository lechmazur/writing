<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marin’s insomnia-painter identity is vividly anchored in the first paragraph and keeps paying off: sleeplessness drives her night-walk, her pigment-making, her receptiveness to the stranger. Interiority stays concrete (“wryly earnest” is shown when she mutters about rain giving answers). The stranger’s motivation is thinner—why sketch her for years yet wait until tonight?—but the micro-choice to grind the brooch and paint feels inevitable and costly, earning the closing renunciation of puzzle-solving for conversation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final canvas reweights the island from tomb to bridge, with felt cost (her insomnia eases because she now carries the brooch’s weight). Causal lens holds throughout: rain → brooch → exchange → pigment → new painting. Orientation is clean by line 5; the one transition (studio → island interior) is legible. The sketchbook’s prior scenes could feel like teleporting information, but the piece teaches its pattern early (“drawings Marin recognized”) so the reveal tightens rather than breaks causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Setting is tactile and selective: salt-bleached cliffs, boot-squelching mud, amber dust in oils. Weather is not backdrop but motive—rain literally carves the path to the brooch. The lighthouse-studio and black-mirror pool function as micro-settings that constrain choice (only here can she grind the amber). Final image of gilded cliffs recharges the opening “salt-bleached” palette, meeting the 9+ gate for environment charging the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</question><comment>Dominant stake—“thresh meaning from experience”—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens when the brooch offers a literal catalyst. Escalation is accumulative: each left-behind object raises the pressure to interpret; the stranger converts curiosity into an explicit exchange; grinding the amber forecloses her old cynical distance. Cost is visible: she forfeits her prior palette and insomnia, accepting the quieter, conversational world. Agency remains hers at every beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges without sermon: meaning is grown, not extracted, shown by the shift from mockery (“the canvas mocked her”) to additive conversation. Subtext lives in objects—duck, brooch, sketchbook—each re-weighted by closure. The final note’s “conversation, ongoing” avoids tidy moral; the reader is left to feel the cost of perpetual listening rather than told a lesson.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is painterly—perception filtered through chromatic metaphor (“liquid sunset,” “gilding the cliffs”)—yet remains spare and syntactically varied. Compression is taught early (“gnawed by decades of water wars”) and paid off. No head-hopping; stranger’s interior is withheld, maintaining Marin’s limited lens. Dialogue is minimal but distinctively rasped, wry, matching the haggard tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: single sentences do double duty (“rain had rewritten the rules” = weather + plot). No scaffold loops; metaphors stay coherent (amber = sunset = bridge). One mixed vehicle (“frayed at the edges like a watercolor”) is apt to painter POV and does not obscure causality. Final line varies rhythm, releasing tension with quiet cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Premise—post-climate-war tidal island where art materials literally rewrite perception—is fresh yet grounded in painterly process. Tropes (mysterious stranger, magical object) are transformed through specificity: amber must be ground into pigment, not merely possessed. Risky lyric compression is taught early and holds. Synthesis feels inevitable: only an insomniac painter would trade sleep to listen to paint.</comment>
