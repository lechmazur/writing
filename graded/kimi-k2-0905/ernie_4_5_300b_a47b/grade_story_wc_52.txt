<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Clara’s grief is embodied in sawdust-scented breath and the tremor of first cut; the internal contradiction—needing the lion to be both memory and muscle—activates every micro-choice. The ash blank as last gift anchors motive, but the epiphanic “This is how we survive” drifts toward label-speak, slightly softening the cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: rain, kettle steam, and wood shavings layer into a density shift that reweights loss from void to vessel. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the sleeping lion on the sill reconfigures absence into held light; the cost is felt in the cold kettle, the candle stub, the sawdust still clinging to her palms.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rain-beaded skylight and rust-hued walls aren’t backdrop; the leaking glass warps city lights into the very watercolor blur she must carve solid. The ash blank’s grain is tactile under thumb, constraining knife angle and emotional tempo—environment, tool, and body fuse into one decision surface that charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transform absence into holdable shape—tightens when the first cut splits silence; each shaving narrows the option to retreat. No external antagonist needed; the wood’s resistance and the memory’s bite escalate via accretion until the closed-eye lion forecloses further carving—visible price is the pile of “discarded seconds” that can’t be re-glued.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the blank becoming lion: loss is not filled but re-formed. The refrain of “here and gone” mutates into “here, held,” a conceptual repricing achieved without moralizing; the rust-hued peace turns from decay-color to patina of survival, final image offering non-literal answer to grief’s chemistry.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person hovers at Clara’s shoulder, perceptual signature narrowed to scent of damp wool and the way raindrops “fracture” light—no head-hopping. Syntax lengthens during carving, shortens at each cut, mirroring knife rhythm; diction stays within her lexicon (“chipped enamel,” “sawdust and honey”) without academic drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm: paragraph lengths breathe with candle flare and kettle hiss; sentences switch from participle openings to subject-verb under pressure. Only minor loop—“the wood…raw material of memory” nudges close to paraphrase of earlier “raw material of memory,” but compression elsewhere keeps propulsion intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Widow-as-carver reverses usual lion-tamer trope; crystallized-time method literalizes mosaic grief without sci-fi apparatus. Freshness dips slightly with familiar “rainy attic” loft, but specificity of rust-hue and skylight warp rescues it from postcard; ash blank’s transformation into sleeping lion feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
