<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lirael’s contradictory impulses—reckless forward motion versus the need for gentleness—are dramatized in the stitching scene where she literally sews her own regret into bone; the moment is embodied, costly, and particular. The skeleton’s prior bargain and the keeper’s teasing of “doubt” create credible pressure that forces her to renounce certainty, earning the change. Interiority avoids label-speak; instead, knowledge states shift through tactile contact with bone and fruit. The only limit to 9-band is that the keeper’s motivation remains functional rather than fully dimensional, but within 750 words this is acceptable.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the final image of Lirael emerging into amber-violet light crystallizes a before/after—ash becomes growth—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The orchard’s pattern (trade → stitch → eat) is taught early and tightens once through the act of sewing, reweighting the stake from “patch holes” to “carry orchard inside.” Cost is legible in the bitter-sweet fruit and the visible shimmer of patched cracks. Causality holds: because she gives the Fool card, therefore she receives the fruit that reframes her reckless idealism as generative.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is not backdrop: its root-snake/bone interface literally supplies the needle and thread, and the black fruit’s warmth is the final constraint that alters her worldview. Spatial choreography is clean—torch radius, root coils, clearing distance all track. Sensory hierarchy filters through Lirael’s reckless curiosity (she notices bioluminescence before danger). The environment charges the closure image: the half-light persists into the sunset sky, making the orchard’s rule-set portable.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—"patch holes in soul"—is signaled in para 2 and narrows to one live option: surrender certainty. The single tightening is the keeper’s line “He gave his certainty…”—a micro-turn that forces her to decide whether to sew. Price is visible: the skeleton’s meditative pose foreshadows her future stillness; the fruit’s foreign heartbeat is an embodied debt. Agency remains hers: she presses the needle, she bites; coincidence never rescues.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulates—ash, silk, bone—rather than exposition: the idea that destruction can be composted into gentleness is shown, not told. The Fool card’s repricing (from shame to seed) supplies conceptual resonance without moralizing. Subtext operates in the keeper’s smile of broken shards: reader sees danger, Lirael sees opportunity, creating earned irony. Final sunset image offers quiet ambiguity: orchard-light inside her may still lead to new graves.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays anchored to Lirael’s perceptual signature—she feels “vibration of buried secrets” before naming them, diction stays within her frayed-coat register. Rhythm modulates: long sentences for awe, fragments under stitching pressure (“She bit. Vision flooded.”). No head-hopping; keeper’s interior remains opaque, sustaining tension. Filter verbs are scarce; when used (“she wondered”) they signal active doubt that primes the final gift of doubt.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences fuse action, metaphor, and world-rule (“roots snaked through the bones of forgotten saints, their white limbs twisting into trunks”). No looped stems; each sentence advances stake or image. Metaphors stay coherent—orchard as grave, fruit as heart—without mixed vehicles. Minor purple note (“souls trapped between worlds”) is earned by prior world-building; it does not stall the beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The destiny-barter catacomb orchard feels freshly synthesized: tarot necromancy plus spiritual surgery via bone needle is not a trope catalog entry. Risk—turning regret into literal embroidery on a skeleton—pays off because the physical logic (silk through parchment bone) is followed. Specificity anchors universality: the boy in the river is unnamed, yet the pattern of reckless consequence becomes specific through ash-dusted card. Transformation test fails if moved to generic fantasy graveyard; the half-light and fungal glow are indispensable.</comment>
