<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The ghost bride’s interior contradiction—simultaneous yearning to release and to wound—surfaces only in abstract diction; the only embodied micro-choice in-scene is Elara lifting the bead to the fruit. The story relies on summarized backstory rather than present-tense action to expose motive, so the venomous-love tension is declared, not dramatized. Her final dissolution is earned by prior causality, but we never see a moment of visible cost or hesitation that crystallizes her hierarchy of values under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: dawn fractures, the bead turns warm, and the greenhouse’s rule-set reverts from eternal stasis to living season. Causal chain holds—pomegranate/bead resonance is set up, the incantatory debt is foretold, and the final fruit-split directly frees both souls under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Cost is unmistakable in the single image “the bead warm in her hand,” reweighting centuries of coldness. One minor scaffold: the greenhouse’s rune-rule is stated twice in adjacent sentences near the open, a −0.2 artifact that does not touch the ending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>“Frost clung to glass panes… shadows pooled like ink” filters perception through the ghost’s bias, framing access and threat; the crystalline fruit that hums against Elara’s gloved hand becomes a micro-setting that forces her decisive move. Every sensory detail serves pressure—spectral iridescence foreshadows the later light-vortex—so the greenhouse actively constrains tactics and charges the final image. Spatial choreography stays clean across the single greenhouse set; rune etchings and the bead’s meteorite core remain consistent anchors. The environment’s shift from endless night to dawn is the visual cost that locks closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—the bead’s imprisoned soul versus the ghost’s centuries-old vow—signals early and tightens once when the bead meets the largest fruit, forcing knowledge change on Elara. Price is conceptual: centuries of stasis crack into dawn, visible on-page. No second reversal is needed; escalation satisfies the Accumulative/Textural lens by deepening pattern density rather than because/therefore turns. Ghost remains largely passive oracle; agency resides with Elara, but the story never dramatizes her fear or hesitation, muting visceral cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of debt as both bondage and mercy emerges from concrete objects—cold bead, warm bead—rather than authorial statement; the final image reweights “repayment” as mutual release. Subtext in the pomegranate/Persephone echo is invited, not preached, letting readers supply moral complexity. The phrase “lovingly venomous” is the only near-articulation of thesis, but it is anchored to the ghost’s specific history, not an abstract maxim. Quiet dawn closure resists tidy moral, allowing love and vengeance to coexist in ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Narrative voice sustains a lyric, elevated register consistent with gothic-alchemical milieu; syntax elongates with clause-layered cadence that mirrors ritual chant. Perceptual signature stays ghost-anchored—shadow, frost, spectral hum—so selective noticing feels character-bound rather than catalogue. No dialogue present, so no voice contamination; internal monologue remains appropriately laced with archaic diction. One template cadence run (“she… she… she…” anaphora) is taught early and reprised at payoff, so reads intentional rather than artifact.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies sentence length to create breath-like ebb under eerie calm; no paraphrase loops. Figurative language is selective and paid off—meteorite bead echoes fallen star, pomegranate splits into vortex—so density remains purposeful. Register stays high-lyric but internally coherent; no mixed metaphors. Copy is clean; pronoun and rune references stable. Opening line anchors stakes and final line (“the ghost bride’s laughter lingered”) supplies image-based cadence that recharges motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Combining ghost bride, alchemic greenhouse, and meteorite bead yields a fresh synthesis rather than trope checklist; the debt-as-release inversion feels specific to this iteration. Persephone echo is transformed through the bead-prison twist, so familiarity feeds rather than flattens resonance. Narrative commits fully to gothic lyric mode and follows implications without hedging. A slight hedging in Elara’s generic curiosity keeps the piece just outside the bold-risk bonus.</comment>
