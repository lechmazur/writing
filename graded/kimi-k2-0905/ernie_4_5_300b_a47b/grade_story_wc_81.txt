<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lira’s indexer mindset is dramatized through tactile micro-choices—palming grooves, sketching spirals—so her “logical” trait alters tactics, not décor. The moment she aligns stamp to indentation and the lock clicks, her professional tool becomes personal agency; stamp weight turning symbol is earned. Interiority stays sensory, avoids label-speak; “quiet confession of failure” lands as embodied cost, not diagnosis. No contradictory impulses in scene, so 9+ gate missed, yet characterization is vivid, specific, and closure-costed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single-scene arc taught early: blackout → vault search → truth found; each beat because/therefore linked under Causal lens. Door-open image delivers Decisive Change with felt cost (stale air, heavy journal); city’s self-betrayal reweights premise. Orientation anchored by word 60 (“sunken city,”“forgotten library”), waiving any penalty. No causality breaks; only hairline slip is off-page flood backstory summarized, not dramatized, keeping it sub-9 by a whisker.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Environment acts as third force: algae-lit desk constrains visibility, bronze grooves shape code attempt, moon-dapple texture modulates mood. Sensory triage (cold wall, rust flakes, bioluminescent jars) mirrors internal shift from murky ignorance to lucid responsibility. Spatial choreography holds—stamp, journal, door handled without teleport. Final image of fractured moonlight on water recharges initial dapple, qualifying for 9+ gate, capped only because world rule on flood mechanics is assumed, not tested.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“trace honest origins”—signals in paragraph 2 and tightens when door map offers tangible path; failure cost is obsolescence of her indexing craft if myths persist. Agency drives each beat: stamp test, sketch spiral, vault breach; blackout complicates but does not resolve. Tension escalates under Causal lens; one meaningful turn suffices. Price paid is psychic (carrying Elara’s failure), not external, keeping it just under 8.8 high-band gate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of collective denial emerges through concrete found text, not author sermon; “city lost to itself” reconfigures meaning without moral tag. Dappled light motif reframes from aesthetic to moral filter—truth fractured yet reachable. Subtext in stamp alignment implies indexing can expose or conceal histories, inviting reader reflection. Complexity intact: no redemption offered for submerged populace, only Lira’s renunciation of myth, yielding resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Lira’s perceptual filter—she spots bloated spines, feels grooves, never exceeds sensorium. Sentence rhythm lengthens during discovery, shortens under shock, tracking pulse of beats. Diction (“tranquilly perceptive”) risks authorial intrusion but is immediately dramatized by calm sketching amid danger, earning its place. No head-hop, no filter-verb clutter; voice distinct, controlled, if not yet unforgettable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is lean, high-density: “stamp’s weight…felt heavier, a silent plea” performs triple duty—tactile, symbolic, foreshadow. No synonym loops or template cadence; metaphor disciplined (“dappled resolve” re-illuminated at end). Opening and closing lines act as brackets, propelling entry and exit. One mixed vehicle (“blackout crept like thief”) is cliché-adjacent but isolated; does not touch closure, so penalty minor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Flood-as-metaphor-for-suppressed-history breathes new life into cli-fi trope; sunken-library vault concealing historiography is fresh synthesis. Specificity—grooved spiral map, algae lamps—grounds concept so removal would collapse plot mechanics. Risk taken in quiet, internal climax instead of escape thriller; coherence maintained, though broader cultural references (Elara’s journal) skirt universalism. Not quite startling enough for 8.5+ band but well above derivative.</comment>
