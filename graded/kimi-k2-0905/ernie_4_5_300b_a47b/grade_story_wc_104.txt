<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lirael’s interiority is lean but embodied—her fingers “brushing the cold floor,” chains “biting”—and her micro-choice to hurl the vial rather than hoard it crystallizes her hierarchy of values. Yet the transition from captive to liberator is compressed into a single clause (“The liberator was unchained at last”) that tells the shift instead of dramatizing the psychic cost of abandoning the shelter of chains.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as earned stasis: she forfeits the vault’s full bounty to weaponize one vial, a visible cost that reconfigures both her people’s odds and her own state (“the liberator was unchained”). Causal links hold—arrow-map → key sequence → vault → vine burst—though the wall-collapse cue is late; orientation still clears by word 100 with “rusted iron cuffs” anchoring who/where/when.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The carnival’s dust-and-cotton-candy ghostliness is selectively sketched; the piano bench’s velvet interior becomes a micro-setting that physically constrains the arrow and thus the next move. Spatial choreography stays clean—bench → stairs → vault—meeting the 9+ gate for setting-as-constraint, but the larger grounds remain slightly generic, capping short of exemplary.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—resilience vs. scavengers—tightens once: turning the star-key forfeits secrecy and invites pursuit. The vine burst externalizes the price, but escalation is single-stage; no secondary tightening beat. Agency is decisive under causal lens, yet scavenger pressure is asserted more than tested, keeping tension below 8.8 tier.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of inherited resilience emerges through the vial-names and the choice to scatter rather than stockpile, avoiding explicit thesis. The final image reweights the premise: seeds as weapons, not food, enact conceptual repricing without moralizing. Counter-readings (is growth now dependent on violence?) linger plausibly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person POV maintains steady psychic distance; diction (“shimmering like liquid starlight”) edges poetic but stays within Lirael’s sense of wonder. No dialogue to test voice distinction. Rhythm accelerates through parataxis during the key sequence, then relaxes for vault reveal, supporting pressure modulation without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—e.g., “The arrow’s design matched the symbols on the keys” simultaneously reveals map-mechanic and recharges object—achieving high density without scaffolding. Figurative language is spare; mixed-metaphor risk is avoided. Minor paraphrase loop (“time blurred in this place—waiting for the right moment to act”) costs a hair, not touching closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Fusing post-collapse carnival with seed-vault heist feels fresh; the arrow-map cipher and ivy-forged door transform familiar tropes through tactile specificity. Risk lies in the compressed vault scene, but the payoff (instant vine entanglement) justifies the gamble. Could swap scavengers for any marauders, so not fully irreplaceable, yet the overall synthesis is memorable.</comment>
