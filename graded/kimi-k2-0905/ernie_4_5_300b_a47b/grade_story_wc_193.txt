<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mara’s pyramid-scheme past is sketched via label (“knack for spotting lies”) rather than moment-to-moment contradiction; the turn of the bolt is plausibly “mischievous,” but interior cost is asserted, not embodied. Still, her wary competence under pressure is consistent and the final grin lands as earned endurance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: glitch texts → bolt → diamonds destabilize → Mara turns bolt → farm saved; the porthole bolt re-enters to trigger closure with visible cost (“edges now smooth from her touch”). Orientation is clean within 120 words; minor slack in how “conceptual pressure” maps to physical stakes keeps it under 8.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fungal glow, humming dome, and slick condensation on the bolt are vivid, selective, and filtered through Mara’s technician gaze; the submarine bolt micro-setting constrains the decisive act. Early anchors dome/who/when arrive promptly; spatial choreography stays coherent with two moving bodies.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—implosion/death—tightens once when diamonds tremble; Mara’s agency narrows to “turn or die.” Cost is legible in the final tactile image, yet the escalation is one-step; no secondary trade-off deepens the pressure curve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</question><comment>Pressure-as-diamond metaphor threads causally through setting and closure; theme of converting exploitative weight into beauty stays implicit until the final text “You’re welcome.” The reweighting lands, but a touch of explanatory gloss on “conceptual pressure” nudges it toward statement rather than pure image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Voice stays tight-third, syntactic rhythm accelerates under bolt-turn crunch; diction (“shadowseam,” “cobalt hum”) is distinctive yet within Mara’s perceptual lexicon. No head-hopping; psychic distance clean. Dialogue is minimal but serviceable, carrying status tick.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</question>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—action plus imagistic charge—without scaffold loops; mixed metaphors absent. Occasional poetic uplift (“world exhaling”) is brief and pattern-taught early, so momentum survives. Clause variety and strong verbs keep propulsion high.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</question>
<comment>Merging crypto-cult survivor guilt with quantum-fungal diamond farming feels non-obvious; the bolt-as-key twist is foreshadowed by shared frequency rather than last-minute conjure. Specificity of cult-debt psychology grounds the speculative frame, lifting it above pure quirk.</comment>
