<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara’s curiosity-over-caution mettle rings true in the moment she pockets the pearl; interiority stays sharp (“breath caught… throat tighten”) and contradicts her de facto job title. The pilgrim remains archetype-as-plot-device—shadows & onyx teeth, no interior hinge—so relationship pressure leaks one-way only. The earned cost—hearing the cave’s “unpredictable hum for good”—is vivid and specific, but the choice feels more imposed on her than catalyzed by layered motive.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Causal chain: arrival → mis-sight → gift → collapse → permanent change holds cleanly; midpoint orientation (who/where) is anchored by para-3; closure lands via Charged Poise (“steady, unpredictable hum”) with legible cost. Single scene, no teleporting props. Stake (guardianship of harmony) is declared early and re-weighted at end. No meaningful tightening beat occurs—the pilgrim’s pearl simply detonates—so escalation stays tonal rather than option-narrowing; this caps the 7+ zone.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Cave is more character than backdrop: crystals “sing,” walls “pulse,” shards “swirl” and ultimately dictate the final altered sound Elara must live with. Multi-sensory layering (light, chime, condensation) is selective, not encyclopedic. Spatial choreography is clean—no impossible positions. Micro-setting (pearl) constrains the climax: once touched, environment fractures. Setting alone can’t vault to 9+ without a 9+ Q2, but its integration is exemplary.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“preserve predictable harmony”—is stated early; escalation is purely textural: cadence warps → crystals shatter. No trade-off or irreversible fork is forced on Elara; the destruction happens to her, not because of a decision she makes. The ending merely burdens her perception with “unpredictable hum,” cost is present but passive. Agency gap prevents 8+ entry, but the tonal pressure does intensify under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without sermon: art vs. chaos, craft vs. the uncontrollable, shown through environment and gift rather than assertion. Ambiguity is purposeful—reader must decide whether the fracture is ruin or evolution. The final image of a “steady, unpredictable hum” lets theme resonate as lived consequence. No moral is spoon-fed; resonance is earned, though slightly undercut by the protagonist’s lack of active complicity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Free-indirect texture is consistent (“her skin,” “her bones”) with lyrical compression. Diction skews poetic but remains legible; patterned metaphors (shadows, starlight, molten silver) are varied and atmospheric, not algorithmic. No head-hop; POV distance stable. Dialogue lines are few, goal-driven, and tonally apt—pilgrim’s thunder-rumble timbre reads intentional. No drum-beat syntax; rhythm breathes with scene cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Purple glow but not murk: metaphors occasionally stack two-deep in single beats (“cloak woven from starlight” adjacent to “molten silver”) yet stay coherent. One paraphrase cluster (“cave’s song… cadences… harmony… melodies”) recycles stem without new data. Filter verbs light. Opening and closing lines hit hard. Overall momentum good, but ornamental descriptor drift in mid-section holds this short of high-band control.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Fantasy trope—clairvoyant + living cave—gets fresh slant by weaponizing the prophecy failure itself as inciting event; this “gift miss” drives the piece. Shadow-portal arrival and singing geology feel inevitable in-scene, not bolted on. Pearl as “key to unpredictability” flips convenient trope into theme engine. Could edge higher with braver structural risk, but synthesis already specific and non-generic.</comment>
