<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lira’s “spiralingly calm” attribute is shown through steady micro-choices (tilting shutters, angling the mirror) that align with her goal; the mirror as maternal gift gives personal back-story cue without summary overload. Interiority stays concrete—“the silence was a wall, but also a bridge”—and her final pause SHOWS earned stasis rather than announcing change. Cost is subtle—she leaves the patterns to fade, accepting perpetual return—but visible enough for 800-word scale.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the last image of lingering patterns visibly reweights the premise—darkness has momentarily learned stars—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is clean: because she refracts light, the canal’s whispers soften; cost is the acceptance of endless return (“her work would never truly be finished”) stated on page. Orientation is anchored within first 60 words, no set-up teleports. No meaningful lens ambiguity; pattern of light-weave taught early and paid off at end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Slick cobalt dock, bruised sky reflection, and chipped blue shutter slats give concise, tactile grounding; rain and footstep sound extend to hearing. Dental mirror doubles as micro-setting/tool that constrains every tactical choice; its etched stars echo final constellation patterns, charging the closing image. Spatial choreography is tight—mirror angle → light patch → water canvas track clearly. Weather affects action (slippery planks) and mood without cliché storm symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“teach darkness the value of stars”—is signaled in paragraph three and pursued through the weave action. One meaningful tightening occurs when dusk fades and mirror-light becomes scarce, forcing final precise tilts; option loss is implicit but legible. Cost is the eternal return acknowledged in last paragraph. Pressure escalates via Accumulative density of patterns rather than external antagonist, fitting the inferred lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of silent empathy emerges through refracted-light gesture, never slogan. Subtext in fisherman’s shrug and cat’s watching shows wordless transmission of beauty. Final image reweights silence from absence to communicative medium—Conceptual Repricing. No moralizing statement; complexity preserved by unspoken “half-spoken secret” that remains secret.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Lira’s perceptual filter—she notices ripples, star-etched mirror, cat’s moon eyes. Rhythm varies: long lyrical sentence for setup, then clipped hinge-groan, soft footsteps. Diction—“stillwater tension,” “cobalt,” “constellations”—remains within contemplative guardian lexicon. No filter-verb stacks; free indirect cleanly handled. Dialogue brief but gravel-voiced fisherman contrasts her silence, confirming voice range.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong information density: one sentence can set scene, body cue, and foreshadow mirror use. Figurative layer thick but patterned—“bruise on glass,” “silence a wall/bridge”—and repaid at closure; no mixed metaphors. Occasional ornamental adjectives (“cobalt,” “spiralingly”) forgiven for lyric intent. Minor paraphrase loop in “patterns that shifted with her breath / patterns lingered” but does not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Canal-guardian refracting starlight via dental mirror is fresh synthesis of urban-fantasy caretaker trope. Stillwater tension as tonal frame avoids cliché storm confrontation. Specific chipped-shutter palette and mirror-etched stars feel idiosyncratic, not checklist quirk. Risk is moderate—quiet accumulative arc—but coherence justifies choice; no derivative premise guardrail needed.</comment>
