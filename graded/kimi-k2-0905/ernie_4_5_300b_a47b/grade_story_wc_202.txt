<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lira’s translator gift is concrete from line 1; she *must* decipher runes, then *must* match starlight vials to memories. Interior contradiction arrives mid-mural when childhood recollection and present breath-rhythm collide, forcing her hand to the crack—choice is embodied, not declared. Cost is tactile: the shard’s “sharp yet soft” edge cuts her palm memory, a price felt at once. The arc is a single, earned release of memory reclaimed; no epiphany clutter. Voice stays hers alone; the weaver’s status is readable in silver eyes and parchment push, never explained.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lattice is tight: ink → hyper-vision → mural crack → breath-to-wave alignment → shard release. Each step is irreversible; failure would mean no fragment, no second chance for the drowned world. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: “anchors of intuition are for letting go” re-weights the whole market quest; the price is the pierced palm and the relinquished shard. No orientation drift—who/where/when anchored by third line; transitions are one mist staircase, one ink swallow, one mural touch—clean.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The market is not backdrop but toolkit: silk stalls hum light that Lira must read; the crack *in* the mural is the door she needs; the dust-mote alphabet literally spells her path. Lighthouse lens recurs first as tapestry, then as mural, finally as heartbeat shard—object-as-setting charging closure. Spatial track is flawless: spiral mist stairs → stall counter → mural wall → weaver’s pouch; bodies never ghost. Sensory hierarchy obeys translator priorities: sight > tactile star-cool > rust-ink taste > palm scar match—never checklist. Environment constrains method: only the mural’s painted wave rhythm can sync her breath to unlock shard.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—retrieve shard or the drowned world stays forgotten—signaled at tapestry reveal. Escalation is micro but decisive: each hidden detail (wave-breath, star-scar) eliminates brute-force options, narrowing to intuition-only. Payoff is the shard slipping free *because* she accepts memory pain; luck plays no part. Cost is the cut palm and the transferred weight to the weaver—felt, not abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from action: translation as salvage of obliterated worlds; no narrator ever moralizes. Final line “eternal instant” is image, not label—re-prices the whole quest as perpetual present holding past. Subtext in weaver’s silver eyes: centuries watching fragments fail until Lira arrives—history needs living conduit. Motif of light-as-bridge returns sharpened: lighthouse beam once cut fog, now shard cuts palm—same light, new wound.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyric third-person hovers at translator distance, diction precise—“vials of liquid starlight,” “elusively tangible”—yet never expository. Rhythm tightens with task: short clauses for climb, elongates for star-read, staccato for shard release—pressure audible. No filter-verb clusters; perception stays embodied: ink *tastes*, fragment *hums*, palm *matches* stars. Dialogue sparse, subtextual—“You feel the fracture” spoken to the shard, not the girl.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances knowledge or texture. Metaphors stay internally consistent: silk stalls *hum*, tapestry *bleeds* color, shard *pulses* heartbeat—no mixed vehicles. Opening line is sensorial hook; final line crystallizes without sermon. Only micro-slip: “sharp yet soft” is near-cliché, but saved by tactile immediacy at closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fantasy marketplace trope is inverted: vendors sell paradoxes, not goods; translator trades in memory, not coin. Lighthouse lens fragment as portable memory core feels inevitable, not borrowed. Risk taken in lyric compression (800 words) pays off—whole worlds saved by breath-to-wave alignment is fresh synthesis. No derivative echoes; concept commits fully to memory-as-light physics.</comment>
