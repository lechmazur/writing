<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lirael’s need to grasp “the shape of home” is concrete from the first paragraph and every beat grows from it; her embodied silver skin and feather-touch micro-choice show contradictory impulses in scene. The final endurance—accepting obsidian shards—pays the visible cost and re-prices her identity. Interiority stays specific: “mercury skin substituted reality” not abstract “I felt lost.” The mother’s apparition is handled as remembered voice, not convenient on-stage helper, so motivation remains character-bound.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is cleanly Earned Stasis: Lirael’s deliberate acceptance of stone shards forecloses escape from others’ memories and re-configures what “home” means. Causal chain holds: feather → stone crack → memory flood → choice to bear them. One smooth time-jump (attic cavern) is taught by the stone portal and pays off immediately. No props vanish; geography of mountain/bookstore stays consistent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The bookstore-mountain and mercury-body double as setting and tool, constraining movement and reflecting choices; lantern shadows “sharp as knives” echo later stone-knife shards. Sensory triage narrows under pressure: during the cavern collapse only falling rocks and bioluminescence exist. Selective detail—obsidian dust, cedar box scent—anchors transitions without cataloguing. Spatial logic survives the dimensional flip; feather dissolves, stone embeds, body keeps reflective surface.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“to understand the shape of home”—tightens when the stone forces her either to keep fleeing or to accept others’ memories inside her skin. Escalation is one-step but sufficient: feather-touch widens from translation attempt to irreversible graft of shards. Agency is present; she could drop the feather at any point but chooses to press harder. Cost is visible: obsidian embedded in mercury skin ends any fantasy of leaving the mountain unmarked.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the accumulating imagery of mirrors, locks, and feathers: home is whatever memory you consent to carry. No character sermonizes; the final line seeds the world “via the texture of a feather,” letting image do the moral work. The ambiguity is productive—carrying others’ memories can read as gift or wound. Conceptual repricing lands when bookstore reappears unchanged but her skin is now permanently flecked, reweighting normalcy itself.</comment>

<comment>Third-person keeps tight psychic distance; perception skews to silvered surfaces, giving a consistent liquid-metaphor signature: “shadows as sharp as knives,” “symbols...blurring into liquid.” Syntax lengthens during descent into cavern, then fractures into shorter units under physical shock, matching pressure. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. Filter verbs (“she felt”) are minimal and justified by bodily alien nature.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “titles like The Geometry of Silence and Whispers Beneath the Skin leaned against each other” does setting, tone, and character knowledge in one stroke. Mixed metaphors are avoided; “hidden thunder” sustains rather than contradicts the mercury-glass imagery. Rhythm varies: cumulative clauses build atmosphere, then staccato “Rocks tumbled...froze midair” paces the climax. No loops or scaffold detected; every sentence advances image or stakes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Fantasy trope of “memory stone” is re-animated through material specificity: feather quill as stylus, mercury skin as lock, obsidian shards as price. Mountain-sized bookstore is fresh as lived space rather than postcard oddity. Synthesis of linguist-parent, silver-bodied daughter, and proto-writing system feels internally inevitable, not grafted. Risk of lyrical obscurity is taken but closure stays legible, earning the +0.2 boldness bump.</comment>
