<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias’s “infinitely patient” hands enact micro-choices (kneeling, brushing snow, coaxing rope) that externalize inner contradiction between belief and failing eyesight; the decision to lay the warm glass beside the rope is a visible, costly renunciation that seals his new stance. Interiority is concrete (“heart racing”), embodied, never diagnostic. The woman’s storm-cloud eyes supply external pressure that sharpens his hierarchy of values. No head-count or status drift; single-POV default met.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the dock becomes a “temple to patience” and the glass a “promise,” reweighting the premise that preservation is the true loom. Causal chain (glass → rope → woman → renunciation) lands with felt cost: he relinquishes ownership of discovery. Orientation anchored by 120 w (“golden dock… creaked under Elias’s boots”). No lens ambiguity; Accumulative/Textural pattern (knot-map → knot-stars → knot-roots) deepens until final image crystallizes meaning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fog, snow, and salt-bleached planks narrow perception to Elias’s gloved fingers and the rope’s resistance, constraining how gently he must handle both artifacts. Micro-setting (rope fibers, glass spirals) doubles as map and star-chart, directly shaping next tactical move. Dock’s creak and gull-cries layer sonic hush that modulates with pressure. Final image of sacred dock re-uses same anchors now charged with conceptual cost, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“preserve ancient methods before industrial erasure”—tightens when each decoded knot forecloses Elias’s earlier belief that the loom is a physical place. Micro-turn: glass warmth signals irreversible shift from seeking to safeguarding. Cost is visible: he kneels, renounces claim, leaves glass as offering. No coincidence; escalation driven by his decoding agency under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete recurrence: knots = encoded memory; patience = refusal to let memory die. No moralizing; final “promise” reweights premise without thesis statement. Subtext in woman’s silence and fading footsteps leaves ambiguity about whether guild still exists. Emotional aftereffect is quiet awe rather than sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyric, compression-rich diction (“oceanic hush,” “watercolor blur”) remains anchored in Elias’s seed-collector perception; no POV leakage. Sentence rhythm mirrors coaxing motion—long clauses yield to staccato whispers. Dialogue minimal, indirect, tide-low. Perceptual signature selective: he notices fibers, glyphs, tidal glyphs, never tourist vistas. Filter verbs purposeful (“he realized”) when knowledge state flips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density: single sentences fuse sensory, metaphoric, and informational work (“rope… revealed a constellation of stars”). No synonym loops; “knot” recurs only when meaning reweights. Metaphors stay coherent (dock as temple) and paid off in closure. One minor scaffold: “He understood now” could be cut, but does not obscure causality. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with fog rolls.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fulgurite-as-code-reader freshens standard quest trope; rope-as-library is specific maritime folk-tech. Synthesis of tide charts, solstice stars, and seed lore feels inevitable, not gimmicky. Risk: quiet renunciation instead of grand discovery heightens meaning without gimmickry. Could swap names, but knot-glass pairing and seed-collector vocation are irreplicable particulars.</comment>
