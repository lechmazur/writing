<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Mira’s “flawless goodbye” motivation is vivid and embodied; her tactile handling of the vinyl shard and micro-choice to give it away crystallize her hierarchy of values. Contradictory impulses—clinical detachment vs. personal memory—surface, but the interiority slips into therapeutic shorthand (“scent of hope”) that blunts edge. Elias remains a symbol more than a person; his single whispered line is too slight to earn the reunification weight the story assigns. The final gift of the shard is earned, but the cost to Mira feels generalized rather than singular.</question>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands: Mira’s renunciation of the shard and adoption of the next case forms a clean Charged Poise with conceptual cost—her perpetual service. Causality is causal-lite; the hymn literally revives Elias, a contrivance the text embraces rather than motivates. Orientation is secure within 120 words; the single-scene window holds. The “blood work” stake is announced early and honored at the bedside, satisfying lens coherence under Causal.</question>

<comment>The vinyl fragment functions as micro-setting that constrains the final gesture; the sky-haven is sketched with selective lavender and sunrise cues rather than white-room. Spatial choreography stays clean—turntable, window, hand-off. Professional detail (hospice music therapist) is accurate but ornamental; no choice hinges on it. The shard’s tactile return in the last paragraph charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate for object-as-setting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“execute a flawless goodbye”—tightens once: Elias speaks, proving the method, then dies. No further narrowing of options occurs; Mira’s next case is an evocative echo, not escalation. Agency sits with Mira, but the visible price (emotional fatigue) is implied, not dramatized. The hymn miracle resolves rather than complicates, letting coincidence do the heavy lifting.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of transmuting brokenness into sacred ritual emerges through the shard’s journey and the skipped vinyl that still sings. Subtext lives in Clara’s forehead-to-forehead silence and the shard’s transfer; no explicit thesis statement. Final image of Mira humming down the hallway reweights the premise: broken world, unbroken song. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers on the cost to Mira.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric, warm, saturated with sound metaphors that suit a music therapist: “crackle a prelude,” “pulsing stillness.” Syntax modulates—elongated clauses for sunrise, clipped fragments at death. Perceptual signature is consistent: Mira hears before she sees. No dialogue dependence; when spoken lines appear, they are brittle and real. Occasional elevated diction (“radiant haven”) drifts above Mira’s probable lexicon but reads as intentional ritual elevation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is pleasing; sentence openings vary, paragraphs breathe. Density is high—“hymning the mundane” compresses concept and method in four syllables. No scaffold loops, but two adjacent “hope” scents verge on synonym churn. Mixed metaphors (“fragrant reminder that even in endings, there was beginning”) are minor. Closure line “The pulsing stillness of it all” lands cleanly, no artifact interference.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Premise—vinyl shard revives dying man—skirts sentimental miracle, yet the specificity of the mother-hymn and the shard’s final gift transform cliché into lived ritual. Risk is moderate: hospice setting plus music healing is familiar, but the “hymning the mundane” method and object-transfer closure add fresh inflection. Emotional truth outweighs surface novelty. Could swap lavender for any flower, so not fully irreplaceable, but the sonic alchemy feels particular to this narrator.</comment>
