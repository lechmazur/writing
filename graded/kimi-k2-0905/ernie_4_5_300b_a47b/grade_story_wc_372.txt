<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s trait of “gently meticulous” is repeatedly embodied in tactile beats—aligning quills, tuning the beam, scribbling ledger columns—so the label becomes behavior. Interiority stays concrete, e.g. “quartz hush settling over the room,” not abstract labels. The final exhausted smile is earned by a causal chain of micro-successes and visible stamina cost. No secondary character on page, so no status crucible; headcount is appropriate for length.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: dawn-light flares, illusions brighten, and Elara’s smile crystallizes the cost—her body and years of failed attempts behind that moment. Causal lens holds: each frequency sampled therefore re-assembles one vow therefore rekindles one layer of library magic. Orientation anchors who/where/when inside first 90 words; no debt incurred. One schematic beat—“she adjusted the lantern’s lens”—could be slightly more lived-in, but the beat is brief and does not dampen the tightening.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Frozen library above clouds is sketched through sensorial work: sagging shelves, frost-rattled panes, prism carved from ice. Details act on body—Elara’s fingers trace glass edges, wind rattles while she ignores it—tethering place to agency. The prism functions as micro-setting-tool that literally splits the final choice; satisfies 9+ gate. Minor missed chance to let temperature affect the page (ink freezing, breath cloud) but cold is still atmospherically felt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save the library by recovering vows—is signaled in para 1 and tightened when “final word eludes her.” Escalation is accumulative: each sampled frequency restores one syllable but simultaneously proves time is running out (illusions bleaching, dawn approaching). Cost is visible fatigue and the perpetual threat of total erasure; agency sits with Elara’s iterative measurements. A second, deeper tightening beat (perhaps one vow irredeemably lost) would push higher, but current arc meets 8-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of meaning salvaged from oblivion emerges through iterative light-work rather than exposition. The golden script of vows reweights the idea of promise itself; final dawn-flare offers non-literal answer that memory can be re-lit, not hoarded. Avoids overt moralizing, though “conjure meaning” phrasing in para 2 drifts toward thesis-statement; resonance survives because image of couple dancing in meadow is concrete.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person intimate maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is scientific-archivist—“frequencies,” “oscillations,” “ledger”—without register drift. Syntax modulates: longer, clause-heavy sentences during delicate calibration shorten to “No,” she hissed. “Not yet.” under pressure. No dialogue on page, so dialogue bullets waived; free-indirect is clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is controlled; sentence openings vary, no template cadence detected. Figurative language is spare (“shimmered like starlight,” “colors bleaching like old ink”) and avoids purple clutter. Information density high—e.g., “violet hue” simultaneously paints scene, shows method, reveals partial success. One paraphrase ripple: “She had done it. She’d conjured meaning...” is slightly redundant but occurs at cathartic beat and therefore allowed.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Concept of reassembling intangible promises via light-frequencies is fresh and specific to this narrator’s skillset; not a stock quest. Familiar “dying magic archive” frame is revitalized through hard-science micro-actions (tuning fork, spectrum sampling). Risk is moderate but successful; no gimmickry, closure remains legible.</comment>
