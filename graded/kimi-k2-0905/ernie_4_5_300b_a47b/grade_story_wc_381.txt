<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The summoner’s interiority is lyrically specific—“terrestrially cosmic” eyes, micro-mapping silence—yet her choices never fork under contradictory impulses; the prophecy is accepted, mapped, fulfilled. No credible alternative path is weighed, so the final renunciation feels pre-ordained rather than costly. Still, the embodied ritual detail keeps her from sliding into archetype.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the crane dissolves, the brook restarts, and the hush is now materially inside the world. Causal linkage is light—prophecy → map → wing → silence—but the Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each ripple, firefly-pause, and paper fiber accrues until the cadence itself flips. Cost is legible in the dust left in her palm, a tactile forfeiture.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The nocturnal haven is not backdrop but instrument: moss cushions knees, water drinks paper, fireflies freeze mid-flight to ratchet tension. Micro-setting (the crane-wing as portable altar) constrains the only possible ritual move. Spatial choreography is pristine—no floating props—yet the world-rules remain tacit, keeping the lyric spell intact.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Stakes are singular—hush the prophecy or lose the sanctuary—and tighten only once, when the wing’s edge blurs. That single deepening is sufficient for lyric mode, but the absence of a second fork keeps pressure from compounding. Cost is felt (wing lost, silence transplanted), yet escalation is more atmospheric than tactical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the alchemy of fragility—paper, water, breath—being strong enough to reroute fate. No character articulates a thesis; the final image of dust on water reweights the idea that silence is active force. Ambiguity lingers: prophecy is stilled, but the summoner’s vigilance must be eternal, a credibly unsettling aftertaste.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly latched to her perceptual filter—nebula eye tracks firefly constellations, earth eye holds the folding angle. Syntax lengthens and contracts like breath, mirroring the hush-mapping. Diction stays within a mystic cadence without drifting into purple; every metaphor is anchored to water, paper, or light.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm is consciously musical but never mechanical; variation in length and comma pulse keeps the read-aloud ear engaged. Information density is high—each line advances atmosphere or ritual step. Only minor scaffold: “the hush was not passive; it was a force” could be compressed, yet it occurs early and doesn’t recur at climax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The origami-as-ritual-tech angle is fresh, and the notion that silence must be actively mapped rather than simply invoked gives the piece its conceptual bite. Tropes (lonely mage, prophecy, brook-side spell) are re-grounded in tactile paper physics. Risk is modest—lyric accumulation rather than structural daring—but execution is confident and specific.</comment>
