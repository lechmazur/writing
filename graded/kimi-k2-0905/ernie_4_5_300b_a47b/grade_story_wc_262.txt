<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—yearning to resurrect “unused love” while fearing its cost—peaks when she cups the lilac-scented air, a tactile micro-choice that forecloses leaving the Alhambra. Emotional embodiment is strong (‘the ache in her chest’), but the film-vision epiphany is slightly performative (“Her throat tightened”) rather than physically disruptive under pressure. Grandmother’s letters act as an off-stage motivator; on-page causality is filtered through smoky-quartz sensation, so the drive feels inherited more than personally forged. Still, the renunciation—accepting custodianship of strangers’ grief—carries visible cost and is earned within the single-scene arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly with a Charged Poise: the booth’s lilac-tinged air reweights the premise, making Mara’s custodianship feel irreversible and socially costly. Orientation is swift—by line 3 we have who, where, stakes—so the lens stays Accumulative/Textural, pattern held throughout. Causality is mostly tight, yet the script’s leap from ‘47 dance to farewell letters is a convenient film-edit rather than an on-page choice that tightens options for Mara; this faintly softens the climax. The persistent constraint (she physically pockets the strip) shapes future tactics and satisfies 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Projection-booth geography—‘single window rattled,’ ‘scarred wooden table’—guides her access and object handling; the booth itself is the micro-setting that charges the ending. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: dust smell > flickering bulb > lilac scent, each filtering her spatial imagination. Weather shifts from rain to charged stillness, mirroring internal cadence without overt symbolism. Detail is selective; no fat, and the theater’s 1947 layer is economically sketched through film stock rather than exposition.</question>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</question><comment>Dominant stake—locate and release unused love—signaled in para 1 and tightens when she palms the strip, forcing custodianship. The film vision deepens knowledge rather than narrows live options; escalation is textural, not causal, but the final image of lilac-scented custody creates undeniable cost. Agency is primarily attentional (she pockets the strip), yet it forecloses walking away. No external antagonist, but internal pressure accumulates cleanly; meets length-appropriate demand for one meaningful intensification.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</question><comment>Theme—love archived as physical residue—emerges through haptic objects (quartz, celluloid, letters) rather than assertion. Subtext flourishes in gesture: Elise kissing an unsent envelope becomes a proxy for every unvoiced desire. Final lilac scent reconfigures meaning without moralizing; reader left to weigh archive vs. act. Avoids explicit thesis statements; emotional after-effect is concrete.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</question><comment>Third-limited stays locked to Mara; no head-hop. Perceptual signature—world as memory lattice—colors every noun: film=’node,’ booth=’incubator.’ Syntax grows shorter under revelation (“She gasped.”), mirroring breathless cognition. No dialogue, so voice compression is interior only and succeeds. Diction stays within plausible lexicon for a millennial psychic researcher.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</question><comment>High information density: one sentence often fuses scent, object, and memory work. No paraphrase loops; metaphors stay coherent (celluloid=container). Rhythm modulates—long reflective sentences early, clipped beats at vision climax. Minor scaffold: ‘the woman… the man…’ anaphora during film flash is intentional and pays off in symmetry. Closure line (‘The Alhambra’s secrets were safe with her’) is crisp, propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Fusion of psychometry with vintage cinema feels fresh; trope is transformed by tactile film handling and spatial-imagery POV. Specific detail—frayed sprocket holes, twilight-colored dress—anchors novelty. Conceptual integrity: premise commits fully to celluloid as grief vessel, no retreat into metaphor. Could not swap setting/prop without breaking logic. No famous-scene echoes; risk of sentimentality is embraced, not hedged.</comment>
