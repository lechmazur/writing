<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira’s contradictory impulses—grief for the orchard vs. the giddy spark the fresco ignites—are rendered in concrete micro-choices (scavenging, painting with stolen sunbeams, pocketing the shard). Interiority is tactile, not diagnostic: “the fog clung…like a second skin.” The final renunciation of elegy for carnival is earned, but the cost is stated more than felt; a single sharper forfeiture (a prism left behind, a mirror cracked) would nail the crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative lens: each shard of light/story thickens the texture until the fresco’s laughter reconfigures the district’s meaning. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Lira’s grinning “Everything” crystallizes the new rule that joy can be developed. Cost is conceptual but legible: the fog’s monopoly on memory is broken, future murals will demand new risks. One minor slip: “knowledge network” arrives late as a tell; if its notes had constrained an earlier failed attempt, escalation would tighten.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Greenhouse studio, peach-grove skeletons, and fog as second-skin are selective, sense-driven, and filter through Lira’s artist-eye. The fresco fragment functions as micro-setting: its chipped edges and star-hungry hands physically steer her next mural. Spatial choreography is clean—bodies track from crumbling glass to heart-district square without drift. Environment finally constrains the ending: the embarrassed fog thins, proving the orchard can still be lived in, not just elegized.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover lost joy—tightens when the fresco fragment threatens to expose elegy as habit. Agency: Lira decides to “challenge the fog’s monopoly,” narrowing her future (no more quiet memorials). Cost is visible but soft: the fog thins, committing her to defend fragile carnival light tomorrow. A sharper material price—broken prism, cut hand—would push this into 8.8+ territory.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of undeveloped film → living color; no character spells the thesis. The fresco’s laughter and children chasing light-words form particulars that reweight grief into generative memory. Final image of pocketed shard as talisman offers quiet, non-moral answer: art keeps the negative until the world is bright enough. Avoids sentimentality, but one line—“she’d painted with hope”—leans toward echo; trimming it would let the image speak alone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person hovers at Lira’s shoulder, perceptual signature intact: “stones themselves had forgotten their purpose.” Syntax flexes with emotional dilation—short clauses under pressure (“She slipped the fragment into her pocket”), longer lyrical sweeps during light-painting. No head-hop; violinist and Marla filtered through Lira’s artist-eye. Filter verbs are few and motivated; diction stays within her plausible lexicon. Rhythm breathes with scene tempo, accelerating as children chase firefly words.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud ear test passes: sentence openings vary, paragraphs breathe. Information density high—“encrypted notes left in hollow trees” compresses an entire economy. One metaphor cluster near climax (“reckless, pensive mirth”) borders on overwrite but is saved by its oxymoronic charge. No paraphrase loops, no scaffold; occasional “of”-phrase stacks are voice-true. Final line earns its monosyllabic punch.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Frescos that capture starlight, orchard turned carnival graveyard, and painter who develops memory like film synthesize into a fresh configuration. The undeveloped-film concept is literalized through light-painting rather than used as metaphoric ornament. Risk is taken: joy is chosen over elegy in a ruined place, resisting dystopian grimdark default. Not utterly unprecedented, but the specificity of light-words chased by parentless children makes the angle feel singular.</comment>
