<comment>Elias’s interiority is sensorially rich—ring-borne vibrations replace sight, and every step is a tacticle choice. The final reunion is earned: he has paid with solitude, risk, and the map’s unstoppable trembling. No secondary character shares the scene, so relationship/status bullets are N/A. Micro-choices (kneeling to dig, wading the river) visibly foreclose retreat, satisfying cost.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: mother-as-memory reconfigures grief into sightless “seeing,” cost felt in the ring’s final throb. Causal linkage holds: each ultrasonic cue → ring translation → physical act; no gaps. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“edge of the Whispering Glade”). Lens is Causal throughout; no late ambiguity.</comment>

<comment>Ultrasonic forest is not postcard scenery—it sings directions, grows diamond-brittle leaves, forces Elias to wade an upside-down river. Platinum ring functions as micro-setting: its changing vibration palette steers every move. The river-bed dig is spatially tracked; no impossible positions. Final clearing is minimal yet charged, letting the emotional reconfiguration dominate.</comment>

<comment>Single dominant stake: reach the stillpoint where grief might transmute. Escalation is steady: each ultrasonic drop narrows the audible trail, raises stakes of permanent loss if he fails. Digging in electrified river is visible price—cold, possible drowning, map trembling. No coincidence; agency drives every beat.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of “feeling becomes seeing” emerges through physicalized metaphor: vibration → vision, map → heart. No explicit thesis; final line is imagistic, not moral. Subtext resides in ring’s silent tongue, mother’s lullaby now tactile. Ambiguity lingers: is she ghost or memory? Complexity retained.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays glued to Elias’s fingertip perception: “his fingers knew the contours,” “ring thrummed against his thumb.” Syntax lengthens in calms, fragments under rapid taps. No dialogue, hence no voice convergence issue. Diction stays within blind cartographer’s lexicon; no academic register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes—long lyrical sentences for canopy hum, staccato for cane taps. No synonym loops; “vibration” recurs but each time with new sensory angle. Mixed metaphors absent; “trees that sang in harmonics” is consistent with world rule. Only micro-flaw: “time pooled like mercury” edges on cliché, but image is saved by immediate emotional payoff.</comment>

<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fantastical elements (ultrasonic trees, upside-down river) are freshly synthesized; premise is not a retread. Blind dowser who translates forest song through ring offers specific vocational twist. Final “memory made flesh” avoids generic ghost trope by anchoring in tactile reunion. Risky world-building holds together without exposition dump.</comment>
