<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elias’s grief for Lila is embodied through the key-tag burn and the auditory “stain” her last words left; the interior contradiction between nightly “truth” and secret quest is visible. Yet the pivot choice—surrendering the key and admitting self-seeing—arrives with only a single whispered line; the causal cost feels light because no alternative path is foreclosed on-page. Micro-choices (wading, unlocking, book-opening) repeat but do not escalate stakes; the emotional crescendo is asserted rather than dramatized. Still, his perceptual signature (lamps, salt, color-of-sound synesthesia) remains particular and consistent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: placing the key on the desk reweights “luminous vows” from external quest to internal covenant, costing him the talisman of past denial. Causal lens holds: because he enters the library he re-colours Lila’s voice and therefore his future stance. Orientation is crisp within 50 words; the single transition (dock→ship) is legible. However, the tightening beat is singular and late; no intermediate therefore-links raise cost before the final image, keeping escalation shy of the 8.8 gate.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The pier’s “salt-bitten wind” and warped book “smiles” are filtered through Elias’s lamplighter eye; the submerged library’s dome and oil-shimmer leather create tactile, POV-driven specificity. Meteor hush and lantern-streaked sky serve double duty—external mood and synesthetic setup for the color-of-sound payoff. Spatial choreography is clean: dock planks→cleat→water→door 13→desk; no impossible positions. The setting actively constrains the final image: only inside the air-locked library can the vow hues materialize, charging the closing symphony.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will he face or keep dodging grief—signals early via key-tag and Lila echo. One meaningful tightening occurs when the pristine library forces confrontation: knowledge that sound has color re-prices his avoidance. Agency is present yet low-stakes; surrendering the key costs the talisman but no external consequence is dramatized. Pressure is accumulative/textural rather than causal; the escalation is a single density shift, sufficient for this length but not multi-beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the image circuit: light carried → light surrendered → internal light heard; no explicit thesis. Subtext stays in gesture: key placement replaces spoken absolution. The ending’s non-literal answer—“the color of sound hums in his veins”—reweights prior lanterns and key without moralizing. Minor sentimental echo in “I see you now” is softened because it is addressed to self, not Lila, avoiding platitude.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly lashed to Elias’s perceptions; synesthetic diction (“meteor hush,” “color of sound”) is consistent, rhythmic, and taught early. No head-hop; psychic distance compresses under water-pressure without breaking idiom. Register remains working-class coastal; no academic drift. The cadence swings the lantern-sway rhythm, paying off in the final steady-flame sentence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive: each sentence advances image or stakes; no paraphrase loops. Metaphors stay coherent (planks “groaned like old bones” fits maritime decay). One mixed metaphor risk—“key burned against his thigh” (metal ≠ heat source)—but forgivable under lyric license and POV intensity. Grammar clean; opening and closing lines anchor voice and re-charge motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Fusion of sunken library and synesthetic sound-color is fresh, avoiding familiar magical-realist templates. The lamplighter profession is integral to light motif rather than quirky ornament. Key-tag reprise transforms from denial token to relinquished guilt, an inevitability that feels organic in hindsight. Risk is moderate—quiet interior arc inside lyric vessel—but sufficient for 600-word form.</comment>
