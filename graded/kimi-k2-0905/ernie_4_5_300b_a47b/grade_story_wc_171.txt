<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is concrete and embodied—“operatively gentle” hands, the clipboard pressed like a shield—yet her contradictory impulse (cling to ritual vs. concede imperfect peace) stays legible only in summary, not simultaneous scene tension. The final “heart heavy yet hopeful” is diagnostic shorthand that blunts cost; still, her endurance carries visible price and earns stasis under the Accumulative lens. Secondary delegates remain placeholders, but single-POV default holds. Micro-choices (finger tapping rhythm, tight smile) show hierarchy of values; flaw complicates without tidy fix.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal linkage is loose—negotiations advance more by accretion than because/therefturns—but the Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early and honored: each stain/crease on the clipboard adds density until the final signature reweights the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise: the signed treaty plus Elara shouldering the unspoken cost of vigilance. Orientation anchors by line 3; no lens ambiguity. No meaningful reversal inside a single beat, yet the pattern of weary concessions narrows options credibly. Cost is felt in the final image—“weight…comfort”—and constrains next battlefield.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The terrace statues and volcanic stone are vivid, selective, and filter through Elara’s ritual mind; weathered faces mirror her internal erosion. Spatial choreography remains clean—clipboard, shadow, sun-arc track logically. Micro-setting qualifies: the clipboard’s scars evolve and constrain her tactile choices. Sensory hierarchy narrows under crisis; midsummer heat and celestial slowness externalize stalled talks. Environment does not alter tactics beyond mood, so 9+ gate fails, but atmosphere supports theme with earned specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—imperfect peace vs. personal integrity—signals early. Pressure escalates by accretion: each delegate concession adds density rather than reversals. Agency is endurance/renunciation; Elara forecloses the fantasy of immaculate peace when she accepts ambiguous language. Cost is legible—coffee stain crease becomes emblem of future fragility—but no single tightening beat narrows live options; instead slow erosion suffices under Accumulative lens. Persistent constraint (clipboard scars) shapes tactics and final image.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: stains, statues, “flawed beauty” refracted through Elara’s ritual patience. No explicit moral; final image of descending past stone gods offers conceptual repricing—redemption is cyclical vigil, not victory. Subtext lives in gesture—clipboard shielding chest, delegates’ shaking hands. Ambiguity lingers: peace is simultaneously signed and suspect. Avoids sermon, though “price of redemption” verges on prompt-echo; resonance survives via tactile callbacks.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person roams tight internal free indirect style; perceptual signature is Elara’s tactile, metronomic attention to scars, stains, celestial rhythm. No head-hopping. Diction stays within her calibrated diplomat register—“operatively gentle,” “lofty promises into tangible clauses.” Rhythm modulates: languid sun sentences vs. staccato finger taps. No dialogue contamination; sparse speech carries subtext. Filter verbs appear but serve voice—“she mused.” No syntactic monotony; sentence openings vary. Voice remains singular and purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm breathes with sun arc; paragraphs lengthen then contract to mimic negotiation lulls. Density high—each clipboard scar performs double duty as history and omen. No mixed metaphors; volcanic stone / eroded god faces cohere. Minor scaffold: “the price of redemption, she knew…” repeated thrice; final instance in closing paragraph flirts with thematic echo but lands inside POV musing. No paraphrase loops, no register drift. Proofing clean; no typos.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh angle: peace viewed as archival object—clipboard as palimpsest of wars—elevates standard negotiator trope. Ritual pacing against celestial clock feels inevitable yet not derivative. Specificity of volcanic terrace and coffee-stain treaty counters generic bunker scenes. No famous line echoes. Risk is moderate: slow lyric accretion instead of reversal, but coherence holds. Could transpose to other post-conflict zones with minor edits, so not fully irreplaceable.</comment>
