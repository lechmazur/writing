<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Kael’s reluctant caretaker role is embodied through his jerky, ungraceful movements and the way he “tolerates” the birds; the nut-in-pocket micro-choice anchors his knowledge state and motivates every marker he leaves. Interior contradiction is present—he curses yet obeys the curse—but the traveler beat is too thin to test his hierarchy of values under real pressure, so the final shove reads as dutiful rather than costly. Still, the earned endurance of locking the door with the cracked nut gives a palpable cost that forecloses retreat, satisfying the 9− gate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: nut map → silent markers → birds evaded → door opened → traveler saved → nut cracked, frost locked in. Orientation is clean within 120 words; the single-scene arc tightens once when the birds dive and Kael must freeze or keep guiding. Closure is a decisive change with visible cost—the nut’s shell and his own future exposure—so the lens stays causal to the end. One minor slack: the “labyrinth shudder” is asserted, not shown to alter his options, keeping it just under 9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Frost, gravel, brass gears, and the cracked nut are filtered through Kael’s risk-calculus; every sensory pick is also a tactical one. The cliffside maze is sketched with three deft strokes yet tracks spatially as he doubles back, drops twig, kneels at fountain. Micro-setting (nut ridges biting palm) literally steers the final lock-turn, satisfying the 9+ constraint test. Only the traveler’s appearance lacks environmental embedding, a hairline slip.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—guide or wither—is signaled early and narrows to one live fork: stay hidden vs. keep marking. The birds’ dive supplies the single meaningful tightening; sparks force Kael to freeze, raising exposure cost. Escalation is causal, not cumulative, but the final crack of the nut makes the price legible on-page. Missing a second reversal keeps it below 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of reluctant service versus self-preservation emerges through the nut’s silent grammar and the graceless markers; no line moralizes. The cracked shell at the end reweights the blueprint from abstract map to spent resource, offering resonant reconfiguration without statement. Traveler remains cipher, so the ethical cost lands on Kael alone—effective but slightly narrow. Ambiguity survives: curse may still claim him, satisfying complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly lashed to Kael’s perceptual hierarchy: he hears “discordant hum,” feels ridges “bite,” calculates frost timing. Syntax grows clipped under bird-threat (“Kael froze”), then exhales with visible breath—rhythmic control mirrors stakes. No dialogue, so voice distinction bullet is waived; internal diction stays consistent and weathered. One filter verb cluster (“he felt, he heard”) could be trimmed, but it doesn’t dilute immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, image-dense; no loops or scaffold. Figurative layer (“veins beneath the bruised sky”) is brief, patterned early, and paid off by frost glazing stones, so it earns its place. Occasional adjective triads (“tangle of dead vines and fractured stone”) risk ornamental density but remain within POV’s worn lexicon. Closure sentence (“nut…cracked but intact”) lands with precise cadence and no overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Maze-plus-mechanical-birds nods to genre, yet the silent nut-map and “graceless beauty” tactic feel fresh and specific to Kael’s reluctant ethic. Blueprint-as-shell micro-etch turns a familiar quest object into consumable resource, transforming trope rather than recycling it. Risk is moderate—quiet, interior heroics—but coherence justifies the gamble. Could push further if curse mechanics were less opaque.</comment>
