<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elias’s refusal of false comfort is visible in his refusal to smash the bottle; the memory-as-alchemy method is dramatized through his scavenging and arranging, not merely declared. Contradictory impulses—hollow exhaustion vs. furious will—co-exist in the first beat and again when tears mix with salt spray, giving credible interior tension. Final endurance (bottle remains sealed) is foreshadowed by early rejection of easy exit, so the renunciation feels earned. Voice stays in his gaunt body; no label-speak slips in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the cove’s lanterns brighten, ghosts become living images, and the seamless bottle is re-read as lens, all on-page with visible conceptual cost—Elias’s hollowed solitude is accepted, not cured. Causal chain holds: because he mines memory, therefore the town re-animates; no off-stage wish or coincidence resolves the revival. Orientation (who/where/when) is anchored within 120 words by apothecary dust and salt-laden air. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural; the brightening cadence and pattern break land the tightening required for this lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Micro-setting of the amber bottle functions as the core environment; its seamless surface constrains every attempt to open it and is re-weighted at closure as lens, satisfying 9+ gate. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elias’s apothecary bias: scent of brine and herbs, phosphorus echoes, lantern flicker felt on gaunt face. Geography stays stable; no impossible props or spatial drift. Weather (salt spray, dusk hues) affects emotional register but never solves plot, keeping atmosphere subservient to stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“breathe life into ashes”—is signaled early; pressure tightens when each scavenged artifact becomes a thread that either works or doesn’t, narrowing options toward acceptance of the sealed bottle. Escalation is textural: density of lantern light and ghostly presence intensifies rather than causal reversals; this fits the Accumulative lens. Visible price: Elias’s solitude deepens as the town revives without him; cost is legible. No coincidence rescues; revival is earned by memory labor.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of creation-through-memory emerges from concrete beats—arranging jars, ledger, compass—never abstract assertion. Final image of sealed bottle as lens re-prices the premise: civilization reborn not by conquest but by accepting impermeable past. Subtext in ghost-images silently asks whether revival is worth personal erasure, avoiding moralizing. No thematic echo lines; meaning accumulates through repeated lantern and bottle imagery whose final shift is earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited clings to Elias’s perceptual signature: salt stings sunken eyes, amber glow warms palm. Syntax lengthens in calm scavenging, then compresses at “tears mixing salt spray,” mirroring emotional cadence. No head-hopping; POV distance stays modest. Diction—“spectral echoes,” “phosphorous-rich ore”—suits alchemist lexicon without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid: one sentence often conveys sensory data and symbolic tilt (“bottle grew warm, as if absorbing his resolve”). No looped stems or synonym churn; metaphors stay coherent (bottle-as-lens, not mixed vehicles). Rhythm modulates between long breathy clauses and sharp fragments under pressure. Only micro-slip: “hum of spectral echoes” edges toward poetic overlay, but does not obscure causality or dull closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Ghost-town revival via memory-mining re-casts usual post-apocalypse trope as interior alchemy; bottle-with-no-opening is a fresh constraint that refuses Chekhovian smash. Specificity—phosphorus ore, paper-lantern cove—anchors concept so it could not swap places with any ruin. Risk of quiet accumulative arc is taken and paid off. Could use one more lived detail of alchemist failure to reach 8+ bands, but already distinctive.</comment>
