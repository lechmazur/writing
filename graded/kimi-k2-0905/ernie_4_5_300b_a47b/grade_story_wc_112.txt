<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Veyra’s obliging nature stays surface-level; we see no interior contradiction when she obeys LUX’s barked “Recalibrate!”—a missed crucible moment. The “curiosity” ascribed in the final paragraph is told, not dramatized; her micro-choices never risk her self-image or status. Still, her gauntlet clicks and sweat trace embodied cost, keeping her above generic.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: lever-pull → field spike → destabilization → manual reroute → earned calm, each beat because/therefore. Closure is a Charged Poise: Veyra’s fingers brush the lever again while “icy warmth” reconfigures her future risk; cost is felt in the station’s lingering tremor and her own sweat. Orientation anchored by word 80; lens stays causal throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lavender twilight, grated floor, clicking gauntlet—selective sensorial pins create an immediate, lived-in lab. The magnetic nexus is not wallpaper; its holographic ribs and secondary coils are mapped during the crisis, guiding Veyra’s reroute. Micro-setting triumph: the lever’s “cool surface” reappears in the final image, crystallizing her poised addiction.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single stake—prove time bends—tightens when the flora stir and the field buckles, forcing Veyra to wager the entire experiment on a manual recalibration. Price is visible: creatures thrash, glass rattles, her sweat slicks the visor. Escalation is linear, not deep, but the because/therefore torque keeps pressure coherent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges sideways: the human appetite to tinker with time mirrors the alien flora’s “subdued awakenings.” Final image of Veyra smiling at the lever reframes curiosity as compulsion—an earned, ambiguous note. No moral is stated; the resonance lingers through the nexus’s low hum.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays pinned to Veyra’s perceptual sieve: she “swears she could feel time itself stretch.” Diction drifts slightly academic (“conceptual cost”) but remains consistent with a technician’s lexicon. Rhythm accelerates into clipped clauses during the spike, then exhales—deliberate modulation under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>High information density: “petals unfurling in slow motion” collapses visual and temporal into one stroke. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances sensorial or causal data. Opening and closing lines book-end with tactile cold/heat, creating circular cadence without scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Alien flora stirred by magnetic alignment is fresh; the “time moves sideways” premise is familiar sci-fi but grounded in technician procedure rather than philosophical monologue. Risk is moderate—reliance on a single lever beat—yet the payoff image of Veyra’s lingering smile sells the addiction angle, escaping template ethics.</comment>
