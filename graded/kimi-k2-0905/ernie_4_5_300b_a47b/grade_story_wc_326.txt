<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s compulsive heartbeat-count and porcelain-pressing embody contradictory impulses under pressure; the final “defragment” is a credible micro-choice that accepts the ghost as compass. Interiority stays concrete—“ink climbed its ridges”—never drifting into label-speak. The only flaw is that OBS-7’s status and power remain vague, blurring the cost of overriding it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elias reweights the error from curse to compass, paying the price of permanent cohabitation with the ghost. Causal linkage holds: shard-ink pattern → defy AI → new stance. Orientation is taught early (“opal observatory under snow” by line 3), so the slight spatial vagueness around the console is waived.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Frost-laced glass, wheezing gears, and ink-filled grooves give tactile, multi-sensory anchors; the porcelain shard functions as micro-setting that literally scores the control panel and final image. Snow and dome rotation constrain exit options, tightening the last moment. One minus: exact spatial relation between Elias and OBS-7’s speakers is never fixed, keeping this just under 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“prove life to the machine”—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens when OBS-7 orders “Choose.” The defragment act narrows options by rejecting binary alive/dead and accepting messy coexistence; cost is the eternal haunt. Escalation is single-thread but sufficient for 700-word scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from pattern: failure/error as epistemological tool, not stain. The ink–porcelain constellation reweights from spilled accident to star-map, letting “wisdom from failure” feel discovered, not declared. Final smile into snow offers quiet repricing without moralizing, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is sharp—“metronome clink,” “ghost heartbeat in the machine”—and syntax mirrors cardiac tic: short pulses, fragment beats. Free indirect slips are clean; no head-hop. OBS-7’s vinyl-crackle diction contrasts Elias’s inked silence, keeping voice distinction intact under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Rhythm varies from cardiac fragments to lullaby cadence; sentences layer job-double duty—“He pressed the porcelain shard into the ink, dragging it across the panel” advances action, reifies metaphor, and crystallizes cost. No loops, no mixed metaphors. One filter-verb cluster (“He could see… he could feel”) mildly dulls immediacy but misses closure beat, so −0.2 only.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Synthesis of digital afterlife + antique observatory + ink divination feels inevitable and fresh; trope of “ghost in the machine” is inverted—the machine wants purity, the human embraces spectral residue. Risky lyric structure holds under accumulative lens. Minor deduction for familiar “stars blink back, indifferent” image; still earns high-band originality.</comment>
