<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The Herald’s interiority is vividly embodied—her laughter is a tactile force, her grip on the lantern a live wire of want. Contradictory impulses (yearn for prophecy vs. fear of what it costs) are present but compressed; the moment she decides “Let’s do this” feels more declared than earned, so the final cost is inferred rather than suffered on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative-textural lens: each adjustment of the wick layers density until the lantern’s trapped light bursts into prophetic shadows. Closure is a Charged Poise—she hoists the lantern, reconfiguring dawn from time-marker to choice, with the implicit cost that she must forever feed the flame. Orientation is clean by line 3; the single-scene arc holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The emerald glass and spider-thread wick are tactile micro-settings that constrain every tilt of her wrist; star-thick sky and cliff-roar function as pressure walls, narrowing her options to “adjust or be swallowed.” The lighthouse’s refractive geometry is not backdrop—it is the physics she must master to steer fate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—control the dawn—tightens when the shadows first slither alive around her ankles, foreclosing the option to look away. Escalation is accumulative: each wick-tweak thickens the dark, until the final flare forces her stance crystallization. Price is conceptual: she trades innocence for custodianship of an unasked future.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the iterative act of lantern-tending: knowledge is inseparable from custodial burden. The final image—lighthouse beam slicing night—reweights “dawn” from natural event to moral choice without moralizing. Subtext whispers that every visionary laughs to keep from screaming.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vibrant perceptual signature: wind “tugging” the cloak, flame “like a captured comet,” shadows “cold and electric.” Syntax tightens under pressure—fragments appear as she tilts the lantern, mirroring the moment glass is about to yield. No head-hop; distance stays tight inside her skin.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High information density: one sentence can stage, sense, and symbol (“glass panels glowing faintly under a sky thick with stars”). Metaphors are clean and consistent—no mixed vehicles. Minor scaffold: “the shadows weren’t just shapes anymore—they were *alive*” could trim the exposition, but it lands outside the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Takes the tired “seer in tower” trope and re-engineers it through optical physics; the lighthouse is not metaphor but instrument. The accidental prophecy angle freshens the mystic keeper archetype. Risk—lyric accumulative structure—pays off when final image recasts dawn as ethical choice rather than celestial given.</comment>
