<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Clara’s sardonic pragmatism (“imperfect miracles require imperfect methods”) is vivid and embodied; her micro-choice to upend the bottle while squeezing Elias’s shoulder crystallizes her hierarchy of values. Interiority stays concrete—she smells regret, fingers Braille-like spines—never drifts into label-speak. The enduring flaw (commodifying grief for copy) is never soft-hedged; the cost is felt when she admits the bottle now “felt heavier,” foreclosing her glib detachment. Missing 9.0 only because the shift from cynical prop-collector to co-exorcist is fractionally abrupt; one more preparatory beat of doubt would seal it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds throughout: because Elias lied to lure her, Clara brings the bottle; because copper conducts, the drop channels Lila’s resonance; because the song finishes, the orchard falls—tight because/therefore chain. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the empty bottle and the roaring saws reweight the entire premise—miracles are imperfect and bought with real noise. Cost is legible in the final two sentences: dove still, chainsaws alive—silence traded for mechanized loss. No因果 breaks; orientation anchored by word 50; one transition (shadow→piano) is clean.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The archive is not backdrop but instrument: yellowed scores rattle under Lila’s incoming current, piano wood drinks the drop—environment literally absorbs the conflict. Micro-setting succeeds too—the dove-shaped stopper’s copper wings become the conductive grid that lets energy flow. Sensory triage matches Clara’s profession—she prioritizes tactile (Braille-spines) and olfactory (regret-smell) over visual clutter. Spatial choreography is flawless: bottle upends above soundboard, glow travels into floorboards, chainsaws outside track the same timeline.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can guilt be alchemized into music before the orchard dies—is signaled in Elias’s first line. One decisive tightening: the drop falls → room shudders → options narrow to “finish the song.” Price is paid on-page: bottle empties, silence ends, orchard irrevocably falls—felt cost meets 8.8 band guardrail. Coincidence (tree fell years ago) complicates rather than resolves; present agency remains Elias’s fingers and Clara’s pour.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges without宣言: art as electrical conduit for overdue apologies; imperfection as the only miracle we can afford. The re-pricing image—empty bottle vs. roaring saws—makes the ethical calculus unmistakable: completion demands real noise and real loss. Subtext in Clara’s coat-pocket heft shows commodified grief turning into complicity. No final-paragraph moralizing; resonance is purely imagistic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is distinctively noir-lyric: “eyes two bruises in the dim light” and “dust smelled of regret” carry perceptual signature. Syntax tightens under pressure—short imperative “Now, play her piece” after longer metaphors. Free indirect fuses Clara’s cynicism: “figured it might make a good prop” stays within her lexicon. No filter-verb stacks; rhythm accelerates during glow-pulse without drum-beat monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero scaffold loops; every sentence advances image or causality. Figurative language is selective—three metaphors total, each paid off (bottle-dove conducts; orchard-silence felled; keys yellowed). High information density: “trench coat frayed at the cuffs” shows status + time + wear in five words. Closure beat is crystal: “bottle lay empty, the dove’s wings still” — no modifier clutter, yet heavy with conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>“Gossip-column exorcist” is fresh synthesis; copper-stopper-as-electrode turns flea-market kitsch into occult tech without expositionary hand-wave. Risk of ethereal grit tone pays off: lilac ghost meets chainsaw reality in last line. Transformation test fails if Clara is swapped with generic medium—her reporter’s quips and prop-scavenging are specific. Minor deduction: poltergeist-piano trope is familiar, though saved by sister-as-resonance twist.</comment>
