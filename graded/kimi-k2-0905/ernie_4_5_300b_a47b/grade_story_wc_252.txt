<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is concrete—she scoffs at tales, clenches the scrimshaw, laughs through tears—yet the “true nature” she embraces is asserted more than dramatized. Contradictory impulses appear early (pride in dock work vs. pull to sea) but flatten once the whale appears; no micro-choice after the swim back tests her new self. Still, the embodied arc from clutching to releasing the talisman carries visible cost and forecloses return, satisfying the 9− threshold.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because she keeps the scrimshaw, the whale summons her; because she releases it, the island dissolves. Orientation is clean—who/where/when anchored by line 3. Closure is a decisive CR: the island’s dissolution reprices “home” and the scrimshaw’s vanishing light pays the cost. One soft spot: the whale’s eye-to-eye “surge of recognition” is slightly abstract, keeping this just shy of 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The sublittoral fringe is not backdrop but tool: kelp tangles ankles, bioluminescence times her breath, retreating tide literally pulls the island apart. The scrimshaw functions as micro-setting—its cold weight against palm reorients her twice. Final image—clear water, no island—recharges every earlier sensory cue with conceptual cost. Meets 9− gate: environment charges the closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“leave or vanish with the island”—is signaled early and tightens when the whale’s call leaves only one path. Releasing the scrimshaw is the single decisive trade-off that forecloses return; cost is legible as the island fractures. No secondary reversal is needed at this length. Pressure plateaus rather than spikes again, capping at 8.3.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of detachment-as-freedom emerges through the scrimshaw’s journey rather than sermon. The whale’s final cry reweights “guarded hearts” as the island that must be unguarded—conceptual repricing without moral tag. Image of swimming toward horizon crystallizes theme in action. One tiny echo of prompt language (“combative tenderness”) is woven, not declared, keeping score high.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person close stays inside Lira’s perceptual filter—kelp “like dancers,” scrimshaw “cold, smooth.” Syntax lengthens under water, shortens at surface break, mirroring buoyancy. No dialogue, so voice purity rests on sensory idiom and rhythmic control. One register wobble: “conceptual repricing” thought line feels slightly analytic for a dock worker mid-swim, nudging down from 8.5.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical; sentences multitask (“The fringe gave way to darkness, and she swam, her breath steady, her movements fluid”). No loops or scaffold. Metaphors stay coherent—whale eye as “moonlit pools” echoes scrimshaw eyes without strain. One passive cluster (“was gone, was replaced”) in closure paragraph slightly dulls propulsion, holding below 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Isle-vanishing and whale guardian are familiar maritime tropes, but the scrimshaw-as-detach-key and the island-as-mirror refract them into fresh light. Synthesis feels specific to this voice rather than template. Risk of abstract whale epiphany is taken and mostly lands. Lacks the startling particular that would push into 8.5+ originality band.</comment>
