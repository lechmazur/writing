<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lira’s quiet obsession with “answers” over bread is shown through tactile obsession with shells and whistle; the interior contradiction—curiosity vs survival—remains vivid. Embodied stress (trembling hands, hitching breath) tracks escalating risk. Final stance crystallizes credibly: she stays to play the whistle, accepting apocalypse-cost foreshadowed by mother’s journal. Micro-choice hierarchy (truth > life) earns its place, though mother's off-page vanishing is a touch too convenient as primal driver.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: mural notes → whistle sequence → tunnel opens; journal → watchers move → shells wake. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by 80 words and serve closure. The single decisive change—“gate rusted shut to keep *us* in” lands with conceptual cost, reweighting premise. One causality wobble: watchers’ exact powers remain opaque yet are allowed under situational pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Shell-streets, brine-air, Market-district fracture—each detail is filtered through Lira’s cartographer eye and doubles as tactical map. Reed whistle and pickaxe function as micro-settings that constrain action beats. Spatial choreography is clean: lantern-light, tunnel descent, skeletal chamber track without drift. Final image of watchers atop shifting shells re-uses setting as animated antagonist, passing 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“why do the watchers move?”—signals early and tightens when tunnel hum matches pulse, converting curiosity into survival. One meaningful deepening: journal reveals shells *hungry*, narrowing options to flee or confront. Cost is visible—city quakes, people scream—yet protagonist’s personal price (mother lost, city doomed) is felt more than bodily loss; still qualifies under causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from specificity: city as fossilized life, maps as false comfort, pattern as countdown. Final re-pricing—“gate kept us in”—reweights colonial/exploitation subtext without sermon. Motif of spiral shells shifts from wonder to maw, earning resonance. Ambiguity lingers: are watchers guardians or victims? Complexity embraced.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person hovers close to Lira’s sensorium: “tasted of salt and iron,” “crackling with static”—perceptual signature stays consistent. Syntax tightens under stress: fragments, enjambed clauses mirror quake-breath. No dialogue, so voice purity unbroken. Reed whistle’s single note functions as leitmotif, modulating from lullaby to defiant cry—rhythmic control heightens closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>High information density: each sentence layers map, body, myth. Figurative language disciplined—one metaphor per beat, no purple drift. Rhythm varies: long clause for discovery, staccato for collapse. Only minor scaffold: “the sound grew louder” repeats concept of escalation; doesn’t touch closure, so stays within 9- gate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Turtle-shell metropolis, pattern-language archaeology, and living-seafossil premise synthesize into fresh cosmology. Risk taken: city becomes antagonist, reversing “built on backs” into “built in mouth.” Specificity—grooves align with constellations—prevents abstraction. Not quite 9+ because watchers’ nature remains hinted, not redefined, but transformation is strong.</comment>
