<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lila’s contradictory fear of “losing him twice” versus her willingness to unclasp the pendant is dramatized in one continuous beat; the moss graft into the amber externalizes the shift with visible cost, earning the lighter-pendant close. Interiority stays concrete (“the weight of the pendant lighten”) rather than label-heavy. Micro-choice hierarchy is clear: protect relic vs. accept Elias’s offer—she risks the former to secure the latter. Secondary pressure from Elias is present but gentle; still, status tilts when she cedes control of the pendant setting.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the pendant now contains living moss, materially altering the relic’s meaning and foreclosing pure mourning. Causal chain holds—because Elias names the drip rhythm, Lila trusts him to modify the amber; therefore she invites him to stay, deepening the garden’s future. Orientation is complete by word 90. No lens ambiguity; Accumulative pattern (drip map → orchid → sapling) tightens once to final image with felt cost: the brother’s amber is no longer a sealed tomb.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The server-rack terrariums and east-to-west thaw pattern constrain the orchid placement and final sapling site; environment actively shapes the partners’ joint action. Sensory selection is POV-colored: “honeyed hush” tastes the air, amber glow warms dampness, mosslight refracts off resin—details serve tone, not tourism. Spatial choreography is clean; bodies kneel, hands brush, pot centers the drip spiral. Weather (snow outside, internal heat) mirrors protected vulnerability without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether Lila will keep the amber sealed or let life infiltrate it—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightened once when she unclasps the pendant; option to preserve stasis is foreclosed as resin is pried open. Pressure is accumulative/textural: each graft (moss into amber, orchid into pattern, sapling into soil) increases density rather than flipping plot. Cost is visible—she physically breaks the seal and socially cedes curatorial control to Elias. No coincidence; all complications arise from her invitation to alter the relic.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through iterated grafting images: grief can be Host, not Grave, if one allows foreign tissue into the wound. Subtext resides in gesture—Elias’s orchid placement at the spiral’s heart proposes partnership more gently than any declaration. Final sapling reframes “trapped time” into “growing time” without sermon. Complexity is honored: brother is still dead, pain still present, but medium of remembrance has shifted—ambiguity remains fertile.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited clings tightly to Lila’s perceptual filter: she traces stains, tastes syrup-thick air, gauges pendant weight. Syntax lengthens under contemplation, shortens under decision (“Stay.”). Free indirect style cleanly slips in/out: “She wondered if the pattern would shift...” maintains distance yet stays interior. Dialogue is spare, botanist-precise, and goal-driven: Elias’s “Grafting requires vulnerability” simultaneously courts and instructs.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; high-density lines (“amber pendant swung between them, catching the mosslight”) do double atmospheric and symbolic work. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds tactile or emotional news. Metaphors stay coherent (hush as syrup, servers as anchors) and do not crowd any one beat. Final paragraph lands on short declarative cadence that releases prior lyric tension without scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Post-digital moss garden is fresh stage; using melt-drip cadence as heartbeat map and grafting trope for mourning praxis offers non-obvious synthesis. Risk of sentimentality is navigated by keeping ritual botanically precise (moss sprig pressed into bezel). Transformation test fails if relocated to generic greenhouse—server racks and viral confession are integral. Final “conversation not permanent” line reweights typical love-conclusion into ecological process, resisting tidy romance.</comment>
