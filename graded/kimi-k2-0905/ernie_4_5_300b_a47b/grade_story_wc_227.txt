<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira’s uncertainty is embodied through trembling hands, masked breath, and the choice to remove the respirator—each action costs. The final renunciation lands because the charm’s hum and the acid’s mirror have already forced her to confront her own cracks. Interiority stays concrete; “quilt memories together” is shown via the constellation map that reweights her past. The only drag: the line “Kintsugi isn’t about perfection” is diagnostic label-speak amid an otherwise visceral beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Lira’s respirator removal crystallizes a Charged Poise—she survives by accepting imperfection, cost felt in burning lungs. Causal chain holds: charm-match → map → self-repair. Orientation is swift: acid sea, copper hull, pockmarked statue within 50 words. One micro-turn—charm is promise, not key—tightens stakes without breaking lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Acid sea, copper hull, and corroded statue create a micro-setting that actively dissolves certainty; the workshop’s gears supply the only mechanical heartbeat. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—fumes burn, charm bites palm, gears groan—each detail constrains the next action. Final image of sea-as-mirror recharges earlier reflections. No orientation drift; space stays coherent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—conjure meaning from oblivion—is signaled early and tightens once: the charm’s map reweights her cracked past, foreclosing denial. Pressure escalates under Accumulative/Textural lens—each sensory layer (acid, hum, constellation) deepens the cost of narration. Final respirator removal is an earned stance with visible bodily price. No coincidence; escalation is internally generated.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of mending-through-fracture emerges from the statue’s glowing scars and Lira’s lung-scarred breath, never sermonized. Subtext lives in gesture: removing the mask = accepting dissolution. Final image reconfigures “kintsugi” from gold filler to survival choice. One thematic echo line is slightly overt, but resonance persists.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is alchemist-specific: equations on vials, “liquid light,” “Kintsugi intentions” all filter through Lira’s trained perception. Rhythm compresses under stress—fragments like “Between breaths” mirror acid staccato. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens as fumes shorten breath. Distinct perceptual signature sustained to last line.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “acid sea lapped… fumes eating air” does double sensory duty. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or choice. Mixed metaphors avoided—acid as thief, mirror, teeth stay within corrosive logic. One clause (“a sound like a million teeth grinding”) skirts cliché but fits POV.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Floating alchemy workshop on acid sea feels fresh, yet grounded by tactile tool-use. Kintsugi trope is inverted: not golden repair but scar-acceptance. Risk taken in lyric compression pays off—constellation map reweights maternal quilts. Could edge higher with sharper world-rule specificity, but transformation is evident.</comment>
