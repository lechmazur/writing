<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory impulses—yearning for past selves while hating their certainty—are dramatized in embodied beats (the limping climb, trembling hands). The final micro-choice to “shed the weight” is foreshadowed by the scroll’s imperative and costs him the safety of denial, earning a credible renunciation. Interiority occasionally drifts toward diagnostic self-labeling (“feral nostalgia,” “chronologically confused”) that flattens immediacy, but the hierarchy of values is legible in the climb. Character remains individual, not archetype, though the jealousy mechanism is stated more than enacted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the blank scroll fills with words not from Elias’s pen, reweighting the premise that the past is fixed; the cost is the loss of authorial control over his own narrative. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each object (grave, scroll, ledge) adds density until the final image crystallizes. Orientation is clean within 120 words; the grave date anchors time, the cabin anchors space. Causality is loose but coherent under the dream-logic pattern taught early; no teleporting props or retroactive patches.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Weathered cabin, half-buried headstone, and ice-slick fissure are selective, tactile, and filtered through Elias’s limping perception. The mountain environment constrains the final approach—each step is a physical tax that mirrors the psychic ascent. Micro-setting (the crevice) functions as gatekeeper, forcing a literal narrowing that prefigures the conceptual narrowing at closure. Sensory hierarchy favors the kinesthetic and haptic over visual cataloguing, keeping description purposeful under pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether Elias can escape the fixed narrative of his own death—tightens once: the scroll’s blank page demands he surrender authorship, foreclosing the option to keep rewriting the past. Escalation is textural: each artifact (grave, birch scroll, blank scroll) increases the density of memory until the final reconfiguration. No external antagonist is needed; the pressure is the accretion of selves. Cost is conceptual—the loss of narrative control—made legible in the moment the blank page writes itself.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the past is not a text to be edited but a force that writes us. The blank scroll’s inversion of authorship offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in the silence after the words appear—Elias does not speak again, implying acceptance. The final image reweights earlier jealousy into a recognition that continuity of self is illusion; ambiguity lingers without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>First-person voice carries a distinct perceptual signature: smoke-and-memory metaphors, jaded diction (“sick joke the universe played”), rhythmic alternation between long sentences and fragmentary perception under stress. No dialogue appears; interior monologue stays in Elias’s plausible lexicon. Compression (“I was everywhere at once”) is taught early as dream-logic and pays off at closure. Filter verbs are minimal; immediacy dominates.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, with high information density: each sentence advances atmosphere, character, or mythic logic. Figurative language is selective—no stacked metaphors clutter the climax. One paraphrase loop (“I hated them all… I hated them”) is purposeful, enacting obsession. Occasional elevated diction (“jaded wonder,” “conceptual repricing”) is earned by the narrator’s chronicler persona.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—encountering one’s own grave and then a self-writing scroll—feels fresh because the focus is narrative ownership rather than cheap twist. The transformation of jealousy into surrender is specific to this voice and mountain setting; swap names and the emotional arc collapses. Risk is taken in the textural, dream-causal structure, but coherence holds. Minor deduction for near-echo of “green-eyed monster,” quickly subsumed into Elias’s idiom.</comment>
