<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Lila’s impulse to “rescue dying arts” is declared early and re-articulated through bread-making and festival planning, but the interior contradiction between grief and hope is summarized rather than dramatized in-scene. Micro-choices (handing children dough, lifting “LV” loaf) are visible yet low-stakes; no moment forces her to risk social credit, time, or the lens itself. The final “fragile optimism” is earned, but the cost is atmospheric rather than embodied—no foreclosed path or tangible loss is shown on-page. The lens-carrying gesture could have crystallized a harder trade-off; instead it remains symbolic.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the emerald lens refracts torch-light over singing children, re-weighting displacement into communal continuance with felt cost in the undertone of absence (beekeeper). Accumulative/textural lens holds—density rises from water/roar/yeast to final green-gold flare. Orientation clean by line 5; causality intact. Escalation is gentle pattern-deepening rather than narrowing options; the tightening is lyrical, not tactical, which keeps the score sub-9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Grotto waterfall, moss-carved arches, crystalline pool, and cottage oven are filtered through Lila’s curator gaze; each sensory layer is chosen to mirror cultural erosion or revival. Spatial choreography is flawless—bodies move from public cavern to cottage to pool without drift. The emerald lens functions as micro-setting: its green refraction literally colors the final image, constraining where torch-light can fall on the children’s faces. Professional detail (museum guide) stays tacit, surfacing only in interpretive gestures, satisfying economy.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“arts dying”—is signaled in paragraph 2 and escalates via accretion: vanished bees → empty hives → fewer practitioners. The single meaningful tightening is the decision to host a festival; it narrows Lila’s private grief into public action, but no credible loss (time, reputation, lens endangerment) is dramatized. Pressure is atmospheric, not tactical; options never contract on-page. Coincidence absent; escalation remains coherent under Accumulative lens, but cost is only implied through absent beekeeper.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of cultural displacement as continuity emerges through bread initials, children’s off-key songs, and lens-light on young faces—no explicit thesis stated. Subtext resides in gesture (kneading “CV” for Celeste) and silence (empty hives). The final image offers quiet conceptual repricing: exile becomes legacy when filtered through green glass. avoids sentimentality, but theme is slightly diffuse because the festival decision feels low-risk.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Lila’s curator perception: “moss-carved arches,” “rosewater dread,” “history as life raft.” Syntax lengthens with reverence, shortens under urgency (“First, we bake.”). No dialogue to judge; interior monologue avoids filter verbs. Free indirect style clean: “She’d host a festival…”—knowledge bounded by her reach. Voice is consistent, textured, and purpose-driven; slight rhythmic repetition of participial openers (“Later, kneading…”) is pattern-taught and pays off in final oven-heat cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid, readable aloud, with purposeful paragraph variation and strong verb choice (“seeped,” “refracted,” “smudged”). One minor paraphrase loop: “The thaw had begun” echoed twice within four lines (−0.2). No mixed metaphors or register drift. Information density high—each sentence advances emotional or sensory layer. Closure image untouched by clutter. Would benefit from pruning two adjectives (“emerald-tinted,” “crystalline”) to let nouns stand naked.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Fusing bee extinction, subterranean opera exile, and initials-in-bread yields a fresh cultural-emotional synthesis. Displacement trope is inverted: not trauma-locked but art-leavened. Risk is quiet rather than bold; structure stays conventional. Specificity of green lens repurposed as stage beacon feels inevitable in hindsight. No close echoes of famous scenes. Emergent rather than clever, earning its resonance through sensory accretion, not conceptual twist.</comment>
