<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Lira’s analytical lens is credibly threaded—she counts trajectories and times her dissonant note to drop the spoon. The bishop piece does double duty as tactile anchor and symbolic shorthand for strategic art, but the interiority never complicates her stance; she stays calmly above the fray, muting the cost she supposedly extracts from others. The teen’s tattoo and five-dollar tip sketch a follower, not a crucible, so the relationship axis reads thin. A single, embodied contradiction—her fingers trembling as the bishop vibrates—would have vaulted her into the high band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The causal chain is elegant: hidden pattern → teen’s pause → fountain flare → collective drift, each step legible and on the page. The closure beat lands as Charged Poise—the arcade freezes, lights refract, Lira packs up—so the cost is atmospheric rather than personal, satisfying the lens but soft. The Orientation Test is waived: the tidal arcade’s salt breath and cracked clown are taught early and refract in the final image. The only drag is a mild explanatory nudge (“Not ordering. Guiding”) that tells us the trick we already see.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The salt-stung neon, whale balloon, and jammed clown gears are vivid, selective, and filtered through Lira’s tactical gaze; they never stall momentum. Micro-setting succeeds: the bishop’s weight against her collarbone and the fountain’s sudden spectrum physically steer the crowd’s drift. Spatial choreography is flawless—bodies track from vendor cart to fountain without teleport. A hairline slip from 9-band: the tidal mechanics (moon drag, brine mist) are atmospheric but never constrain her next bow stroke; they merely garnish.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—prove chaos can be art—tightens when the discordant note drops the spoon and the fountain flares, forcing collective movement. Agency is performative attention: Lira never risks bodily or social loss; the price is paid by the arcade’s stasis, not her. The escalation is single yet decisive, satisfying the length, but the lack of a personal trade-off keeps it shy of 8.8+. Coincidence is ruled out: the flare is cued by her note, not luck.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly: art as gentle hacking of public rhythm, with the bishop standing for strategy made tangible. Subtext stays in gesture—the teen’s compass tattoo silently agrees to be steered—never lectured. The cracked clown loops horror/humor and mirrors monotony, but its metaphoric payoff is only a flicker, not a reweighting. Resonance lands in the hush before applause, not in a moral, satisfying the quiet-ending allowance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person close stays tight to Lira’s tactical attention: “lightly attentive gaze,” “bishop’s chess piece vibrating,” syntax mirroring her counting mind. No head-hop; the teen’s interior is inferred only through tilted head and five-dollar tribute. Diction is specific—jagged riff, crane game prize—without purple tilts. Dialogue is minimal but natural; the single spoken exchange is functional, not ornate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes: long salt-inked sentences swell, then clipped bow strokes punch. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; each detail (cracked clown paint, compass rose glint) advances image or stakes. Metaphors stay coherent—neon as nervous fish, melody as collision—never mixed. Information density is high: one sentence can anchor place, reveal character priority, and cue sound.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The “orchestra of strangers” trope is refreshed by the bishop’s physical weight and the arcade’s salt-soaked circuitry; the idea feels local, not imported. Synthesis of chess strategy with busker improvisation is specific and memorable. Risk is moderate—quiet flash-mob without personal peril—so no bonus. The final image of rainbow-lit applause is familiar, but the causal path to it is non-obvious and earned.</comment>
