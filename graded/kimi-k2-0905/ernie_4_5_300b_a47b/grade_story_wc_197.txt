<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Mara’s scrapper backstory is vivid, but her interior contradiction—yearning to prove worth yet fearing failure—only surfaces in label-speak (“she’d prove them wrong”). The key-as-father relic and the lagoon’s sensory chokehold nicely externalize motive; still, no micro-choice in the climax visibly prices her flaw—she escapes unscarred, so the renunciation feels light.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Causal linkage holds: key → tunnel → terminal → explosion. Orientation is clean by word 90; the puddle-map beat is seeded early and repaid at entry. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the relay blown up is a cost, yet the emotional price is under-projected—the final smile asserts rather than dramatizes the reconfigured stance, keeping it shy of 8.8.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The lagoon’s molten-gold glare, boots sinking in mud, and bioluminescent tunnel are selective, urgent, and POV-filtered. The auric water literally guides the swim path, satisfying the 9+ gate by constraining tactical choice. Only the “steel vultures” drone metaphor is familiar, muting full freshness.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—“truth vs. erasure”—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens when the terminal files copy under drone threat. One visible price: the station’s explosion deletes future access, foreclosing extraction again. Agency is active, but the escape feels slightly convenient (drones retreat off-page), nudging cost toward reported rather than witnessed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory-as-resistance emerges through the iterative image of reflective water and the key’s obsolete telecom past. The closing silvered lagoon reweights the earlier gold—truth dulled but still present—achieving quiet Conceptual Repricing without moralizing. A touch more character-specific loss would deepen resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person close stays locked to Mara with consistent sensory filtration; “auric,” “molten,” and algae glow mirror her alert, star-reading mind. Syntax flexes under pressure: clipped “Dive!” versus languid submerged clauses. Jax’s voice is less individuated, but he speaks only twice; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; sentences propel without scaffold. Only two mild loops: “the key…a promise” and “the key…symbol” restate the same equation. No mixed metaphors, no filter-verb bloat; the final line lands clean. The minor repetition caps it below 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Fusing obsolete phone-booth tech with submerged cyber-relay is a fresh angle on dystopian data-heist. The puddle-reflection map twist refreshes the familiar “submerged tunnel” beat. While tyrant-drones and slum-underdog tropes are stock, their synthesis here feels specific and inevitable.</comment>
