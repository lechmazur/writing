<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—zen detachment vs. the need to anchor memory—remains abstract; her single on-page decision (leaving the oasis) is causally clean but cost is stated, not embodied. The younger-self vision supplies back-story motive yet no present-tactic pressure; embodiment stays in “hands steady, heart quiet” shorthand rather than sensory tension.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: sunlight skips, glass thrums, sunflowers endure—pattern intensification rather than causal chain. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the lantern’s pulse reweights the premise (“small acts of care could bend reality”) with conceptual cost foreshadowed by the “stubborn hive of memory.” One shard, no orientation debt; the skip-stones sunlight teaches the pattern early and pays off in the final ripple.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Beekeeping graveyard, black-to-gray sand gradient, and the lantern’s chipped rim are tactile, choice-guiding micro-settings; the sunflowers’ impossible survival literally anchors the timeline fracture. Spatial choreography stays clean across Mara’s kneel-place-pack-walk sequence. Environment constrains the climax: only here can the glass glow, so departure = foreclosed path.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—why entropy spares this patch—signals early; pressure deepens via pattern (sunlight denial → glass thrum → vision split). Escalation is textural density, not causal twist; cost is conceptual (oasis chooses which memory to keep) rather than bodily or tool forfeited. Sufficient for 600-word scope but could use one visceral price to hit 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through iterated phototropy: kindness as photosynthetic force that grafts past onto wasteland. Subtext in the rusted pump’s silence and sunflower bow avoids overt thesis. Final image (“light within it”) offers conceptual repricing without moralizing. Complexity lingers: the oasis keeps its memory, Mara keeps the lesson—no binary triumph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Mara’s sensory filter; perceptual signature in clay-wheel metaphors and “still-water mind.” Rhythm modulates: long sentence for vision rush, clipped for pack-up. No head-hop; diction plausible for self-taught artisan. Filter verbs minimal; “she realized” is earned after dramatized evidence.</question>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is lean, lyrical, image-dense: “horizon bled orange,” “air tasted of ash.” No mixed metaphors; lantern thrum threads cleanly through beats. One paraphrase loop—“timeline where kindness had once flourished” echoes earlier line—drops score a notch. Otherwise high density, varied cadence, clean grammar.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: zen potter + phototropic glass + beekeeping necropolis converts eco-collapse into quiet temporal horticulture. Tropes (wasteland, oasis, lantern) are re-angled through phototropy-to-kindness mechanic. Risk in abstract timeline vision pays off because pattern is taught early and re-anchors final image. Specificity of “sunlight skips stones” keeps it from generic post-apocalypse.</comment>
