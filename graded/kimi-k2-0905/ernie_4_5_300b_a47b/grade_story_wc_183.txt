<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Lira’s interior contradiction—hope vs. Veyra’s scorn—stays embodied (card-clutch, wing-brush) and drives the descent. The final micro-choice to sew their joint name into soil crystallizes a hierarchy of values (memory > escape) with visible cost: the ship dissolves behind them. No diagnostic speak, no stock labels; flaws complicate rather than decorate. Antler-nudge and serpentine tail keep bodies legible throughout; status shift from skeptic to co-planter is understated but earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: emerald card → hidden door → seed → ship vanishes. Orientation anchored by line 4; no debt. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the meadow’s sunlit expanse reweights “unkindled solace” from hollow to fertile, cost paid by the erased ship. One tightening beat at the calliope key-press narrows options to descent; no outline drift. Persistent constraint: the card’s teeth marks keep earlier damage legible at the end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Setting constrains every move: rusted Ferris wheel blocks retreat, calliope keys caked with salt must be cleared before play, vines swallow the organ—each object alters tactics. Fog thickens perception filter, forcing narrowed attention to sound and touch. Micro-setting (emerald card) returns reweighted as planting tool. Spatial choreography clean: no impossible distances during spiral descent. Final sunlit meadow charges the image by reversing the initial gloom.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find the garden or remain nameless”—signaled early. Tightening occurs once: lullaby key-press forces descent, foreclosing surface retreat. Cost is the ship’s erasure; felt on page (“the ship vanished behind them”). Agency is cerebral (song choice, sewing) yet alters reality; coincidence complicates (fog) but does not resolve. No secondary stake drift; pressure stays under causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as collaborative gardening, not recovery. Subtext in Veyra’s repeated “trapped freedom” modulates from sneer to acceptance, re-priced by the final open meadow. No thesis statement; insight arises from sewing names into dirt. Ambiguity lingers—will the meadow survive them?—without moral tag. Resonance is imagistic, not asserted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric-cadenced yet precise: “peeling paint and broken lanterns whispering” teaches texture early. Perceptual signature—Lira notices stitches, serpentine cold, color swatches; Veyra smells storms. No head-hop; single POV holds. Compression in “because/therefore” ellipses is taught by second paragraph and paid off at closure. Dialogue sparse but distinct: Veyra’s growl-hiss vs. Lira’s murmured lullaby.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: long sentence for fog, staccato for key-press. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new sensory or causal grain. Metaphors stay coherent (garden = memory plot) and do not invade high-pressure beat. One scaffold near “the ship lurched, the fog parting” could trim to “fog parted as the ship lurched,” but artifact is minor and outside closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Fused-chimera twins seeking a garden of erased names is non-obvious synthesis. War-wrecked carnival ship as gate to memory meadow freshens post-apocalyptic trope. Transformation test fails if twins separated—story collapses. Risk of lyric density paid off by legible closure. No close echoes of famous scenes; lullaby is original. Concept commits fully: ship vanishes, meadow remains.</comment>
