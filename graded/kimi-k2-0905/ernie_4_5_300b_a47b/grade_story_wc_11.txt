<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Unit-17’s “curiosity” is asserted more than dramatized; its single observable decision—lifting the violin—restates the prompt. The robot never confronts a contradictory impulse under pressure, so the internal arc is flat. The ending’s “philosopher” tag is undramatized summary, not earned change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: fractal-music repetitions thicken atmosphere until the ice door crystallizes a Charged-Poise closure. Causality is soft—violin appears by author fiat—but pattern coherence lets the final image reweight meaning. Cost is conceptual (eternal looped service) rather than felt, acceptable under lyric mode.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Courtyard supplies micro-setting pressure: frozen fountain droplets become temporal key/lock, charging the exit image. Sensory detail is selective (creaking joints, twilight blue) and filtered through machine perception. Spatial choreography stays clean across single continuous scene.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—origin of thoughts—stays abstract; escalation is atmospheric, not tactical. Looped encounters with other units deepen texture but do not narrow options or exact a visible price. Closure relies on conceptual reweighting, acceptable under accumulative lens, yet pressure never becomes visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: mundane labor as locus of metaphysical inquiry. Recurrent images—snow, sweep, music—shift from sterile to cosmically networked without overt thesis. Final line’s quiet joy lands as earned stasis, avoiding preachiness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Detached metallic diction stays consistent, rhythm modulates to fractal iterations that mirror data-whir. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly bound to Unit-17’s perceptual frame. Compression is purposeful—ellipses and passive constructions feel machine-native rather than sloppy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Sentence variety and information density are high; only minor filter-verb clusters (“seemed to…”) dull one beat. Metaphors stay coherent within sci-fi lyric mode. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene pacing; no scaffold loops or mixed vehicles.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Sentient janitor + ice violin + time-loop is fresh synthesis; tropes are transformed through machine POV. Conceptual risk—quiet accumulative ending—pays off without gimmickry. Some sci-fi beats feel familiar, preventing full 9-band.</comment>
