<comment>Mara’s interiority is lush and embodied—her peripheral awareness feels tactile, not abstract. Yet her motives stay opaque; “preserve the echo” is declared, not dramatized through competing wants. The prophet is a catalyst, not a crucible; no status shift or mutual pressure forces Mara to reveal or rethink anything. The mask drop is honest, but the cost is asserted (“disarming”), not lived on the page.</comment>

<comment>Causal chain is present—prophet arrives → parapet activates → consecration ritual—but the stakes jump from zero to cosmic in one beat (“sages demand consecration”) without intermediate tightening. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the parapet locks, the pavilion hushes, the echo is “safe,” and Mara walks on. Cost is conceptual (eternal vigilance) rather than felt; no forfeiture or irreversible loss is dramatized. Orientation is clean within 120 words; lens is Accumulative/Textural and holds.</comment>

<comment>Whisperfield dunes, murmuring pavilion lattice, kinetic stones—each is sensuously particular and filters through Mara’s skewed perception. The pavilion’s voices coil like smoke, the parapet’s rearrangement is tactile, and the conjured clearings bend time at story’s edge. Micro-setting qualifies: the parapet’s final locked spiral physically anchors the closing image. No geographic drift or white-room gaps; spatial choreography is airtight.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—“preserve the echo”—is signaled early but remains abstract until the final sentence; no intermediate complication tests its fragility. Escalation is single-step: prophet’s touch ignites the ritual; no tactical adaptation or resource loss is shown. Pressure is atmospheric, not operational; the ritual succeeds exactly as intended. Conceptual cost (perpetual vigilance) is implied, notmanifest in a concrete trade-off on the page.</comment>

<comment>Theme of custodial honesty emerges through image rather than sermon: mask falls, lattice stills, dunes bury prints. The idea that wisdom survives only through strange, unpretty guardianship is suggested, not stated. Subtext lurks in the prophet’s recoil and Mara’s wind-chime laugh—moments where honesty exacts social friction. Final image of half-masked walker re-weights “strangely honest” as necessary monstrosity; avoids tidy moral.</comment>

<comment>Third-person hovers at Mara’s shoulder, filtering every detail through her peripheral synesthesia: “voices coiling like smoke,” “clearings as branches on a tree.” Syntax flexes with pressure—short, choppy clauses during parapet surge, then elongates into calm. No head-hop; prophet’s interior is only surface-readable through Mara’s guess. Distinctive diction (“whisperfield,” “kinetic parapet”) is introduced early and paid off in final locked spiral.</comment>

<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene tempo: longer hymnic cadence for ritual, staccato for stone-shift. Metaphors stay coherent (smoke-coiled voices, wind-chime laugh) and don’t stack into purple density. One scaffold detectable: “strangely honest” is repeated four times with near-synonym drift; still, it serves thematic insistence rather than clutter. No paraphrase loops, no filter-verb stacks; information density is high yet limpid.</comment>

<comment>Fresh synthesis: desert oracle tech meets monastic archive guarded by a synesthetic custodian. Kinetic parapet as living gatekeeper is non-obvious and Specific to this world. Ritual consecration via peripheral vision flips familiar fantasy tropes into neuromancy. Risk stays coherent—no late rule patches; the premise commits fully and pays off in the locked spiral image.</comment>
