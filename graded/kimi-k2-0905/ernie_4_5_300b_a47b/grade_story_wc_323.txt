<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lirael’s interiority is serviceable—her quiet need for grounding is anchored to the chain-link relic and the dome vista—but contradiction, micro-choice, and embodied cost arrive late and mildly. The “anchor” object does re-weight her final pedagogical moment, yet no prior beat shows her tempted to abandon teaching or to hoard the relic; the emotional turn is asserted rather than dramatized. Students remain a polite chorus; Tarel’s question is the single pressure spike, too brief to act as crucible. Result: character resonates but does not compel under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Closure is present: Lirael’s stance crystallizes into a deliberate act of teaching-by-feel, reconfiguring her own navigation metaphor with visible cost (she yields the relic’s private comfort to public pedagogy). Causality is thin: the chain-link lesson is introduced the same beat it resolves, so the tightening feels convenient rather than earned. Orientation is clean; dome, abyss, alien stars are anchored by word 60. Lens: situational/accumulative hybrid—pressure accrues through luminous imagery more than sequential turns—holds through the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Selective, purposeful sensory triage: cold glimmer, softened spires, pressure-numbed fingers, metallic bite of rust—each filtered through pedagogy rather than tourist gaze. “Black water” and “energy crystals” world-build without exposition dump; micro-setting (chain link) is handled and repurposed, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography remains coherent in the exterior cluster scene. Occasional softeners—“silhouettes,” “softened edges”—slip toward cliché but are sparse enough to preserve clarity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</question><comment>Dominant stake—can Lirael convert private uncertainty into teachable wonder—surfaces early but escalation is primarily imagistic rather than tactical. Single meaningful tightening: relic lesson converts static object into dynamic compass, shifting class risk from abstract to embodied. Cost is conceptual (she surrenders private talisman), not consequential (no fear of failure, no time squeeze, no external check). Agency is present yet gentle; coincidence absent; fits situational lens but does not foreclose live option.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of adaptive navigation emerges organically through repeated “edge geometry” praxis rather than thesis statement. Subtext is modest: relic as psychic ballast versus public instrument, starlight as shared alien-human grammar. Final paragraph’s “beauty of edge geometry” drifts toward explicit thematizing (−0.4) yet still lands in image, not moral. Emotional after-effect—quiet awe at negotiated darkness—registers but lacks lingering bite because personal stakes stay low.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-limited hovers close to Lirael with consistent perceptual signature—she notices angles, metallic tastes, student face-plate glints. Syntax remains controlled, lightly rhythmic, avoids filter clutter. Dialogue is minimal; Tarel’s line sounds authentic, adolescent, goal-oriented. No head-hop; no register drift; voice modulation under pressure is moderate but adequate for contemplative mode.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is clean, varied, and read-aloud fluent; sentences carry double duty (world + metaphor or action + insight). Few near-loops: “unfolded horizons” appears thrice with slightly varied contexts, not excessive. No mixed metaphors; no therapy-speak; diction stays within POV reach. Minor padding in classroom recap paragraph; could trim 25–30 words without loss.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Premise fuses abyssal steampunk with alien star-chart pedagogy—fresh enough, though “bioluminescent gentle aliens” and “teacher conquers doubt” are familiar strands. Specific weighting comes from chain-link as antique surface relic repurposed into alien-angle tool; this detail feels idiosyncratic and inevitable in hindsight. Risk level is moderate; structure obeys default track with zero formal experimentation. Transformation test passes: swap relic or setting and the emotional calculus collapses.</comment>
