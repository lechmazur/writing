<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s face-blindness is never permitted to complicate a single on-page choice; it stays a label. The one moment she could be forced to trust texture over sight—finding the panel by feel—is handed to her via coincidence of the coin fit. Interiority is vivid (“fractally precise patterns in the grain”) and her final artistic act credibly renounces facile commemoration for codified sky, but the missing causal friction between her supposed perceptual limit and the discovery keeps the arc short of 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the safe and journal survive, the painted constellations will outlive the tree, and Lira walks away having paid the irrecoverable loss of the library itself. Causal chain is clean: coin → panel → safe → journal → repainted sky. The demolition clock supplies relentless external pressure that tightens every beat; no luck resolves the core problem. Cost is legible in the final sentence—“the coin warm in her pocket”—a concrete reminder that future deciphering is still unpaid.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Oak grain, parchment smell, and tool-handling are filtered through a painter’s tactile bias; even the wrecking-ball rumble is felt as dust on canvas. Spatial choreography is flawless—no floating bodies or impossible shelf geometry. The tree-as-setting is not mere backdrop: its hollow dictates where art can be painted and where secrets can be hidden, hence directly shapes tactics. Final image of “light seeming to pulse from within the wood” recharges every prior sensory seed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve the guild’s knowledge before dawn—is declared early and tightened by each mechanical clang outside. Escalation is situational but coherent: every beat reduces time and safe space, forcing Lira from observation to intervention (prying panel, relocating safe, repainting). Visible price is the impending physical destruction of the only archive; her choice to translate star-maps into pigment forfeits any future reproduction. No reversal beyond micro-turn, but one meaningful deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: preservation is an act of translation, not duplication. The guild’s star-maps and Lira’s pigment constellations jointly argue that knowledge survives only by metamorphosis into new media. Subtext is carried in gesture—her thumb testing paint viscosity mirrors earlier scholars testing celestial angles. Final paragraph avoids moral statement, letting the warm coin imply ongoing, unpaid labor of interpretation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Lira’s tactile perceptual field; no POV leakage. Prose rhythm accelerates into shorter clauses during wrecking-ball tremors, then widens into longer painterly sentences while she works, mirroring her pulse. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated (“she saw fractally precise patterns”). Diction—“ultramarine and gold,” “fractally precise”—is within a visual artist’s lexicon and never drifts into show-off register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Zero loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; each sentence advances image, causality, or interiority. Figurative language is sparse and precise (“spirals that mirrored the constellations”). Opening line anchors voice and stakes simultaneously; final line crystallizes the continuing burden. High information density packed into 726 words without padding or synonym churn.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Synthesis of face-blind portraitist + star-atlas hidden inside a doomed tree-library is fresh and non-obvious. “Fractally precise” is transformed from gimmick into genuine perceptual tool that drives both discovery and final aesthetic. Risk of quiet, non-confrontational climax is embraced and paid off with a Charged Poise that feels earned, not evasive. Premise could not survive relocation to generic setting; specificity is inseparable from meaning.</comment>
