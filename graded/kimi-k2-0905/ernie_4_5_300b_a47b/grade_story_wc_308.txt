<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Kael’s interiority is atmospheric but generic; the arrowhead warmth and “resolve hardened” are stock. The epiphany—alignment not stillness—lands, yet no contradictory impulse is dramatized; we are told decades of failure, not shown one beat of micro-choice under pressure. Cost is asserted (“numbers dwindling”) rather than felt. Earned Stasis is nominally reached, but the price is abstract; the character never risks or loses anything on-page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure qualifies as Charged Poise: the final image of descending with pulse-guidance reconfigures meaning with felt cost. Causality is accumulative/textural: bird-pattern → arrowhead vibration → insight. Orientation is clear by ~100 words. Yet the middle third is reflective montage; no beat tightens options or reveals new obstacle, so escalation is flat. The lens holds, but the single tightening is too gentle for high-band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Canyon of bone towers is vivid, selective, and biases toward Kael’s hush-mode perception; echo, dust, and moonlight are woven through action. The arrowhead functions as micro-setting, constraining the final choice. Spatial choreography is clean. No world inconsistency, but environment never actively endangers or resource-loads—description more than pressure—so stays below 8.8 gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“learn to navigate without moving”—is declared early. Pressure is atmospheric, not tactical: birds signal, arrowhead hums, Kael watches. No visible trade-off or lost option on-page; the “dwindling people” remain off-stage. Closure reweights meaning but does not narrow lived choices; thus escalation is present yet mild.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of alignment-over-movement emerges through image (figure-eight, arrowhead reflection) rather than statement. Final line quietly reprises canyon echoes, inviting reader re-evaluation. No moralizing paragraph. Ambiguity lingers: is Kael consigned to eternal skimming? Complexity acknowledged without forced balance. Theme feels organic, though not deeply surprising.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyrical voice sustains hush-register consistent with reverent culture. Syntax lengthens in calmer beats, shortens slightly at “Kael smiled,” mirroring modulation. No dialogue, so no voice clash. Diction stays within archaic-tonal range; “harmonic stone skimmer” is the one coined phrase that feels slightly writerly rather than indigenous, keeping it below 8.8.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid, with varied sentence rhythms and no scaffold loops. Selective metaphor (“skeletal fingers,” “bruised sky”) avoids over-cranking. One mixed vehicle: “pulse left wandering—a force…in whispers” compresses three metaphors into one line but recovers. No artifacts touch closure; high density throughout, yet occasional elevated phrasing (“relic of ages past”) nudges register above Kael’s plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Stillness-navigation via bird-flight pattern is fresh synthesis; canyon of bone towers is striking. Concept leans on familiar mystic-artifact trope, but arrowhead’s shift from key to “bridge” supplies small reconfiguration. Risk is moderate—quiet lyric rather than structural gamble. Specificity of figure-eight as renewal cycle prevents generic overlay, earning mid-7 band.</comment>
