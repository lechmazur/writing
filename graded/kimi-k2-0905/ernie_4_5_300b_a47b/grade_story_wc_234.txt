<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her “scientifically romantic” lens feels particular, not pasted on. The micro-choice to place the shell atop the core rather than force it shows a credible shift under pressure. Jorin functions mostly as sounding-board; status dynamics stay flat, preventing 9+. Still, her flawed persistence and embodied trembling after past explosions earn the closure renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each sun-engine failure → recalibration → ledger find → shell reposition → resonance. The decisive change lands when she lets the shell guide the engine; cost is the prior three explosions and the audible hum that could still detonate. Orientation anchored by word 60; no teleporting props. Closure reconfigures her methodology, not just the machine.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Ember-lit cobblestones, prismatic lens, cooled-lava shards—details are selective, tactile, and filtered through Elara’s tool-focused gaze. The nexus’s dying glow directly pressures the stakes; twilight hue mirrors the ticking warmth. Spatial tracking clean: shell, engine, Jorin’s doorframe lean all stay accounted for. Final image of spectrum swirling into nebula recharges the setting as lived-in, not postcard.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save the nexus’s light—signaled in first 100 words. Escalation is iterative: each failed engine raises personal and civic cost. The tightening turn comes when she cedes control to the shell, narrowing options from domination to listening. Price is legible: prior explosions, ringing ears, and the still-risky hum at the end.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of “revaluing by returning differently” emerges through the shell’s shift from specimen to co-author; no moral tagged. Subtext lives in the ledger’s singed edges—knowledge itself scorched by past hubris. Final spectrum image reweights earlier gold-only light without commentary. Brief flirtation with theme-label in “palette of resolve” line, but situated inside her POV and immediately enacted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person close stays locked to Elara’s perceptual palette: light as grammar, density as time. Syntax tightens under pressure—“She didn’t fear the explosion”—mirroring her pivot to uncertainty. Jorin’s dialogue minimal but idiomatically distinct, less lyrical, more pragmatic. No filter-verb clusters; metaphor vehicles stay consistent to alchemical lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rhythmic variety: short declaratives at climax, longer clauses during reflection. Information density high—“pocket-sized sun engine” compresses profession + scale + tech in four syllables. No synonym loops; “ember nexus” recurs but each reuse adds sensory wrinkle. One mixed metaphor risk—“palette of resolve” borders concept-label, but is salvaged by immediate physical application to shell and gears.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Familiar “scientist vs. entropy” frame made fresh via logarithmic shell as co-resonator rather than MacGuffin. Pocket-sun engine feels novel yet internally logical; prior explosions ground the tech. Alchemical twilight city kept off-stage, avoiding generic fantasy sprawl. Risk taken in letting solution be surrender rather than triumph; pays off without gimmick.</comment>
