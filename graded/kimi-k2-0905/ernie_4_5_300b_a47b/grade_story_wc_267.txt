<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elric’s shift from muteness to speech is legible and tied to a tangible cost (the bench bolt, the child’s first clumsy chord), but his interiority is couched in abstract sermonizing (“safety is not a cage but a garden”) rather than body-level contradiction. The moment of decision is externally prompted by Lady Veyra’s scream rather than a prior interior fracture we witness in scene, so the change feels managed rather than wrested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: missed bolt → scream → silence ruptures → Elric speaks. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the piano’s pure note reweights the pact, cost felt in the audible shift from void to music. The stain-as-map moment is slightly convenient; the fortress pact logic is told more than dramatized, nudging the turn toward allegory.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Cobalt walls, mercury glimmer, frostbite air: sensory triad is tight and selective, filtering through Elric’s hushed attention. The bolt as micro-setting recurs until it literally steadies the bench and the story’s moral axis—meets 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays clean across corridor, staircase, music room; no floating rooms.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—maintenance of silence versus rupture—tightens when the wobble triggers Lady Veyra’s scream, forcing Elric’s hand. Escalation is one-step but sufficient for 700-word arc; cost is the audible fracture of the fortress covenant, paid in the child’s imperfect chord. Agency is reactive rather than proactive, capping intensity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme of silence-as-contract emerges through the bolt and the piano’s note; explicit thesis statement at climax (“safety is… courage to listen”) slightly over-articulates, trimming resonance. Child’s clumsy music offers a subtler reprise that nearly salvages the moment, but the beat is already sermon-touched.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lush cadence—“shadow’s breath,” “seraphically mundane”—creates a liturgical texture consistent with choir-fortress premise. Syntax stays varied; no filter-verb stacking; dialogue is minimal but idiom-clean. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”) sits just outside bellhop lexicon, yet the effect reads as institutional indoctrination rather than slippage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm pulses without algorithmic pattern; sentences shorten at the scream, lengthen during thaw. Metaphors stay physically coherent—frozen mercury, moonlight cloth. Only nit: “safety is not a cage but a garden” is an abstraction loop that restates rather than deepens the prior image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Frosted sanctuary for nerve-mending elites is fresh; the bolt as covenant-key feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk lies in sermonized ending, but the choice to let the child strike the flawed chord rescues it from cliché. Derivative DNA faintly echoes “The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas,” yet the bellhop vantage and sonic payoff transform it.</comment>
