<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lira’s synesthetic gift and her need to “certify wonder” give her a clear, idiosyncratic drive; the embodied color-perception beats (“sound bloomed as color”) keep interiority concrete. Micro-choice under pressure is thin—only the final bell-ring carries visible cost; earlier beats are more ritual than risk. The sculptor’s switch from skeptic to co-creator is announced rather than dramatized through staged status shifts. Earned stasis is present—the cavern’s new song is irreversible—but the emotional tax is felt more by the setting than by Lira herself.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the cavern’s silence becomes an audible hymn and Veyra’s marble pulses with light, both undeniable conceptual repricings. Causal linkage holds: Lira’s color-song melts the sculpted hush and rewires Veyra’s disbelief, each because/therefore step visible. Orientation is clean within 120 words; ice, aurora, and bell are spatially anchored. The “amber sheet kiss” beat is slightly outline-like—more gesture than trigger—but it does not break the chain. Cost is legible in the final image: the cavern can never return to muteness; wonder is now infrastructural.</comment>

<comment>Ice cavern functions as active antagonist: its sculpted hush literally melts and re-forms under sonic color pressure, constraining tactics—Lira must sing hues, not notes. Synesthetic filter is consistent: frost “spiraled like ghostly breath,” silence “pooled like indigo ink,” keeping every descriptor POV-charged. Tool-as-setting (bell, amber sheet) is handled with tactile specificity: runes hum when tilted, resin scent inhaled. Final image recharges the opening “sculpted hush” now made resonant, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prove wonder essential—is signaled early and escalates once: the cavern’s oppressive silence must be broken or Lira’s art is trivial. Tightening arrives when the aurora colors are weaponized into song; options narrow to “sing or surrender.” Cost is conceptual rather than physical: the cavern’s irreversible sonic birth certifies wonder, but Lira loses her private prism-song monopoly—wonder is now communal. Sculptor’s conversion is luck-adjacent, yet it complicates rather than resolves, keeping causality intact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without moralizing: wonder is reframed from luxury to infrastructure via lived sensory experience, not argument. Recurring motifs—“sculpted hush,” aurora hues, amber sheet—return reweighted at closure, charging the final hymn. Subtext in Veyra’s unspoken envy/awe is carried by color smudge on marble, not exposition. Final line’s “oscillating between repose and revelation” risks thematic echo, but the image is earned by prior color-melting beats, keeping penalty minimal.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice is stable, synesthetic, and rhythm-controlled: “frost spiraled like ghostly breath” teaches the pattern early. Compression—“She pressed the amber sheet to her lips, inhaling its resinous scent”—delivers triple duty: sensory cue, ritual action, foreshadow of color-inhalation. No head-hopping; Veyra’s perception is reported only externally, maintaining distance. Register drift toward poetic litany is voice-motivated and pays off in the aurora-spill closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: long breathy sentences for aurora, staccato “clang” for chisel. Mixed metaphors are rare; “sculpted hush made flesh” is concrete within synesthetic rules. One scaffold loop: “silence pooled like indigo ink” and two sentences later “silence unravel”—similar liquidity trope without added pressure, −0.2. No artifact touches closure; final line is clean, high-density image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Synesthesia + ice acoustics + aurora palette gives a fresh sensory fusion; the “prism-song bell ringer” profession is particularized through color-perception mechanics. Transformation test passes: swap cavern for desert and the entire color-melting logic collapses. Risk—lyric over causal—pays off because closure still delivers concrete reconfiguration. Slight proximity to “bell ringer frees frozen choir” trope is offset by synesthetic color science.</comment>
