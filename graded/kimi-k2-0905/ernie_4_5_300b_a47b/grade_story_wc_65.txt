<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lira’s lone POV is interior-rich, her trembling hands and obsessive cataloging of freeze cycles make the “ignorance cartographer” feel lived-in. The contradiction between scientific rigor and superstitious fetish (kingfisher quill) is onstage throughout, driving every micro-choice. The cost—bloodshot eyes, splintered nib, burnt journals—pays for her earned stance. No secondary character applies pressure, so relationship crucible is N/A; head-count clarity remains perfect.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: every beat links because/therefore from inkwell to thaw. Closure is a clean CR—the burning of journals reweights the premise, showing innovation’s price is erasure of its own record. Orientation anchor hits at word 18; no penalty. Transitions = 0 (single scene). One meaningful tightening at the equinox crack; cost is legible in the final ash image. No closure-touching slips.</comment>

<comment>Obsidian spire and frozen lake act as thermostat and clock; their thermal shifts directly shape her data sets and final prediction. The weathered oak desk, silver inkwell, and kingfisher nib are micro-settings that constrain how she can write (cold thickens ink, ash-blue feather flickers warning). Sensory hierarchy favors touch/temperature over sight, mirroring her obsession with measurable freeze cycles. Final image of burning journals in the spire’s hearth recharges the earlier obsidian motif with conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“seed innovation within constraint of perpetual winter”—is signaled paragraph 1. Escalation is the lake’s groan narrowing options to “document it or admit madness.” Protagonist agency: her nightly climb to record star positions directly causes the equinox crack; luck merely reveals the result. Cost is visible: physical exhaustion, social ridicule, and finally the self-erasure of her data trove.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from pattern: knowledge built on ignorance (she maps what she doesn’t know) and innovation that erases its own footprints (burning journals). No explicit thesis; final image of ash shadows is a non-literal answer. Subtext in gestures—trembling hands, dulled quill—carries the cost of progress. Ambiguity lingers: thaw may still fail next cycle, keeping moral complexity alive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric-scientific: “data without imagination is a corpse” fits her lexicon. Rhythm accelerates with enjambed clauses during the crack scene, then exhales in the final hearth sentence. No dialogue, so no register drift. Perceptual signature is temperature-obsessed—every notice is a thermometer reading. Compression taught early (“To dive is to know”) and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm: long sentences for cataloging, fragments for crack moment. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds data or temperature shift. Metaphors stay physical—gears, lubricant, ledger—no mixed vehicles. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves with ash image that recharges “sketched” future. No scaffolding artifacts in closure third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: climate-science fantasy recast as lone craftspiece. Kingfisher quill as thermometer-pen is specific, not ornamental. Risk of burning her own maps at the end feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Premise could not swap names/places without breaking freeze-cycle logic—high specificity earns the +0.4 risk bonus.</comment>
