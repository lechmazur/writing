<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Clara’s interiority is vivid—her finger on condensation, her half-buried grin under snow—yet the final beat slips into thematic summary (“Maps are lies”) rather than a palpable cost. The renunciation is implicitly earned, but the absence of a visible body-price in the last image keeps her just shy of the 9-band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each condensation trace, falcon shadow, and glowing ice shard layers until the plateau revelation reweights the premise. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Clara’s maps now spiral with light, a felt conceptual cost that forecloses her old cartographic certainty. No causal gaps; transitions are legible within the two-shard frame.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The rusted outpost, frost-pitted plateau, and pulsing under-ice glow are not backdrop but equipment: the generator’s hiss limits Jorn’s solidarity, the clawed ice dictates camp placement, the glowing shard becomes the new compass. Micro-setting (condensation on tent wall) literally rewrites the map, charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rivers’ secret origin—tightens from intellectual curiosity to existential overturn. One meaningful deepening: the moment she realizes the source is light, not water, narrows her future cartography to spiral symbols. Cost is conceptual but undeniable on-page, satisfying the 8.8+ gate.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of cartography itself: maps erase the living convergence they purport to represent. The final spiral of light on her desk is a non-literal answer that reweights every prior line about “promises” and “lies,” avoiding moralizing. Ambiguity lingers—some truths are chased, not caught—without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Clara’s perceptual signature—condensation patterns, polyglot page flapping, frost spirals. Syntax breathes with her breath-plumes; no head-hop. Jorn’s voice is distinct in two clipped, pine-resin lines that carry subtext of caretaking rivalry. Compression (“Only if the rivers stop flowing”) is taught early and repaid at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence layers image or knowledge. Figurative control peak: “the lake’s surface rippled, though the wind had died” marries external anomaly to internal reconfiguration without purple drift. Rhythm accelerates across the midnight groan, then exhales into dawn quiet, mirroring escalation and release.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The atlas editor who discovers rivers of bioluminescent tectonic light is a fresh synthesis; trope of “mapmaker finds living world” is transmuted through condensed specificity (dog-eared phrasebook, falcon courier). Risk—lyric, light-as-blood geology—pays off because the rule is taught by the plateau’s clawed ice before the reveal. Without this angle, the plot would collapse.</comment>
