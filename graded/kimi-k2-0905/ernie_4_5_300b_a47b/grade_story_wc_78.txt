<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Interiority is concrete and embodied—her soles damp, mallet pulsing in palm, throat humming—yet the psychic cost of her obsession feels slightly undertested; no contradictory impulse surfaces after the first plank fails. The final smile tastes of “salt and victory,” a tidy abstract where a sharper physical or moral price would have deepened Earned Stasis. Still, her attention hierarchy (clouds > driftwood > apples) is idiosyncratic and consistent, and every micro-choice is filtered through her synesthetic calling. Characterization is strong; it only misses the top band because the climax does not force her to relinquish or doubt the gift she prizes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens is declared early and held: each percussive layer thickens ambient tension until the night salt settles in a Charged Poise. Causality is not of the because/therefore kind but of resonance-densification; the driftwood circle’s groan under strain is the visible price, landing on the page in the penultimate paragraph. No orientation debt: who/where/when anchored by word 50. Closure earns its salt: the air still hums with ghost frequencies, a conceptual repricing that reweights the earlier “obstacles are instruments” premise. Minor cap: the absence of a second tightening midpoint keeps it just below 8.8.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The floating driftwood orchard is not backdrop but instrument: each plank’s grain sets pitch, kelp ropes act as dampers, apples become percussive metronomes. Spatial choreography is flawless—Leeward pivots inward as the circle narrows, forcing her body to angle strikes differently. Micro-setting rule satisfied: the mallet’s tactile grooves and the lightning-scarred trunk constrain her final, gong-like strike that fractures the clouds. Environment directly charges the final image; only a hairline slip of generic “salt spray” keeps it from 8.8.</comment>

<comment>Single dominant stake—transmute chaos into harmony—signaled in paragraph 3 and tightened once when the first plank sounds flat, forcing grip adjustment. The escalation is purely textural: density of sound layers rises until the driftwood itself threatens to splinter; this deepens rather than narrows options, satisfying Accumulative lens. Cost is present (raw fingers, aching arms, circle groaning), but because no live option is foreclosed—she could still fail or quit—the price reads as effort rather than irreversible loss. Still, the audible hum that survives the silence functions as a conceptual tightening, meriting high-band flirtation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</question>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: the equation of obstacle = instrument is enacted, not declared, and the final “ghost of her composition” reweights the premise into a resonant afterimage. No moralizing, no thesis line; the only near-echo (“Obstacles are just instruments waiting to be tuned”) is uttered mid-scene under breath, acceptable as self-exhortation. Subtext resides in the seabird’s screech repurposed as trill—nature colluding yet indifferent. Complexity acknowledged: harmony is restless, not redemptive, leaving plausible counter-readings of obsession versus artistry.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</question>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Leeward’s synesthetic perception; diction skews musical—”cumulus scrolls,” “fractal generating,” “tessellations”—yet always filtered through her trained ear. No head-hop; perceptual signature is consistent, down to the sweat that “sticks her hair to her neck.” Rhythm modulates: short declaratives under pressure, longer cadenzas during dub layering, mirroring her mounting tempo. Dialogue is absent, so voice evaluation focuses on narrative texture, which is controlled and idiosyncratic enough to avoid committee-voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</question>
<comment>Lyrical density is high but patterned and purposeful; mixed-metaphor risk is avoided by keeping cloud = sheet-music equation continuous. A single scaffold detectable: “the sound was a gong, deep and reverberating” restates what “struck the tree’s bark” already shows (−0.2). Filter verbs minimal; strong verbs (“fractured,” “thudded,” “bloomed”) dominate. No synonym churn, no template cadence in final third. Sentence variety strong; only minor paraphrase keeps it beneath 8.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Floating orchard-as-marimba is a fresh synthesis of eco-fantasy and sound-art; trope of the mystic sailor is transmuted through acoustical science rather than prophecy. The sketched-resonance mallet and fractal generating method are not gimmicks—they dictate tactics and closure image. Risk taken: a percussion crescendo replacing traditional plot reversal, yet coherence never falters. Specificity high—kelp ropes as dampers, apples as metronome—making the concept inseparable from this setting. Only the sobriquet “tide prophet” feels lightly generic, preventing a 9.0.</comment>
