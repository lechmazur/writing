<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elias’s motivations—grief, guilt, the need to speak the unspeakable—are vivid in the graffiti beats and in the tremble of the bolt-plate; interior contradiction is shown, not told. The final “Speak” mirror-stroke crystallizes a credible micro-choice that costs him the safety of silence. Missing is one beat where the ghost resists or complicates his act; the stakes stay internal, so the external world feels slightly frictionless. Still, the arc of pressing flowers and pressing secrets into stone gives a felt, character-specific cost that lands as Earned Stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the bolt-plate now holds both flower and encoded silence, a charged poise that reweights every prior stroke. Causality under an Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each glyph thickens the courtyard’s emotional density until the storm and the dropped plate make the cost tactile. Orientation is clear by line 6; no teleporting props. The only slip is that the ghost never pushes back, so the tightening is entirely Elias’s self-pressure, narrowing but not fully foreclosing external options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The mist-cobbled aerie is sketched through Elias’s knees on stone, charcoal hiss, rain metallic on the bolt-plate—tactile, selective, never touristic. Spatial choreography is clean: plate, wall, cloak, storm track believably. The courtyard’s altitude and weather actively constrain (charcoal run, storm timing) and charge the final image: a bluebell pressed into now-warm metal. No world-rule inconsistency; “above clouds” is accepted as given.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—articulate unsaid love/grief—signals early and deepens through each graffiti stroke; the storm provides the tightening cadence shift. Cost is felt (soaked clothes, trembling hand, plate clink), but the ghost remains passive, so external pressure is ambient rather than antagonistic. One credible loss is the irreversible fading of the glyphs, yet this is acknowledged rather than dramatized as a live obstacle. Sufficient for this length, but a beat of resisted decoding would sharpen trade-offs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of pressing: flowers → memories → secrets into stone; no moral is stated. Subtext lives in the graffiti alphabet the reader can’t read but feels. Final image reweights the bolt-plate from heirloom to portable reliquary of unspoken needs—quiet, non-literal, resonant. No echo of platitude; ambiguity lingers about who will “listen.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-limited stays strictly with Elias; perceptual signature is cloud-frayed, metal-cool, ink-smoke rhythmic. Diction (“tinkersong wonder,” “driftingly alert”) is taught early and paid off in the storm’s electric hum. No head-hop; psychic distance compresses under stress (“faster now”). Dialogue absent, so no contamination. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated; syntax mirrors breath-spiral of the first glyph.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with the graffito process—long sentences for swirl, staccato for storm hiss. Mixed metaphors are rare; “sky cracked open” is earned by lightning. One scaffold loop: “the flower press bolt plate” is repeated four times with near-identical noun stacks; this dulls immediacy and caps excellence. Otherwise density is high; every sensory detail also encodes emotion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The “ghost in code” trope is refreshed by treating graffiti as ciphered sheet music for a spectral reader; bolt-plate as memory phonograph is lovely. Specificity of the courtyard-above-clouds setting keeps the concept from feeling generic. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulation rather than causal duel—yet coherence holds. Transformation test fails: swap bolt-plate for lock-box and story still works, preventing a higher band.</comment>
