<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The vow of silence and “preserve the color of wonder” give Elara a clean, if abstract, motive; she acts—tuning, descending, building—but her interior contradiction never sharpens into a moment where speech would have saved or cost her something. Seasonal muteness stays a label; no beat forces her to choose between voice and bell, so the muteness never complicates tactics. The iceberg fragment triggers the arc yet the stakes feel external to her body; the cost is borne by the ice, not her psyche. Closure is elegant renunciation, but the lack of a prior fork where voice/bell trade off keeps the arc short of 7+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of melting→music→crowd silence accretes meaning; final bell-stroke is Charged Poise with undeniable cost (“the symphony had not ended—it had simply transformed”). Orientation clean by line 3; causality is lyrical, not because/therefore, yet holds. No meaningful tightening beat inside the spiral—ice drip is steady, not a turning screw—so escalation stays flat. Closure lands with conceptual repricing (“truth made audible”) and felt environmental cost; suffices for 7-band, lacks persistent constraint that would push higher.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Bluff above clouds, bronze bells, obsidian pedestal, prismatic pendulums—each tactile detail is filtered through Elara’s tuner-eye; tools and weather constrain every move. Spatial choreography is flawless: descent, cradle, spiral build, final droplet—no floating props. Micro-setting doubles as macro: the bluff itself becomes instrument, charging the final chord. Missing body-as-setting leverage keeps it shy of 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keep wonder audible—signals early; pressure is steady melt-rate, not intensifying choices. One meaningful deepening: last droplet → stillness → chord that reweights meaning; under Accumulative lens this qualifies, but no option is foreclosed for Elara. Iceberg shrinkage is environmental clock, yet Elara’s agency stays observational; she never risks failure or resource loss. Cost is ecological and conceptual, not personal, keeping escalation modest.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through recurring sonic images—bell, whisper, glisten, silence—culminating in “truth made audible.” No summarizing maxim; final image reprises opener with transformed weight. Wonder is shown via crowd hush and cloud parting, not named. Subtle counter-reading: art commodified into spectacle yet still sacred. Stays clear of moralizing, earns 8-band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person lyric adheres to Elara’s perceptual signature—precision of pitch, color of light—without filter-verb clutter. Diction stays within artisan lexicon; cadence swells and ebbs with melt-drops. No dialogue, so voice coherence is internal; steady psychic distance. Occasional lofted phrases (“liquid light,” “muted vigor”) flirt with purple but stay pattern-consistent. Rhythm in final chord sentence is ear-tested and propulsive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Most sentences carry double duty—sound + motion + light—achieving high density. A few decorative triads (“like the ringing of a bell, like the glisten of ice, like the whisper of the clouds”) edge toward template cadence but serve closure echo. Metaphors stay coherent; no mixed vehicles. Minor scaffold: “she began to build” is filler before the kinetic list. Overall ear is musical, flaws cosmetic.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: glacial fragment as tuning core, bluff converted to kinetic orchestra—concept feels inevitable once enacted. Muted-wigilence trope is familiar, but sculptor-musician archetype is gender-flipped and materially grounded. Risk lies in lyric stillness; payoff is resonant hush. Does not retreat into safe middle—commits wholly to acoustic metaphysic. Lacks one startling inversion that would push 8+.</comment>
