<question>1</question>
<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Lirael’s shift from passive recorder to active participant is embodied in her kneeling to trace shadows and feel the crystal’s hum; the final decision to leave the archive and “let her own story unfold” carries earned cost. Interiority stays concrete—her palm on frosted glass, vibration in her bones—avoiding label-speak. No second on-page character, so relationship bullets N/A. The only drag: “preemptively nostalgic” is declared early but never complicates a mid-scene choice with visible trade-off, keeping the arc tidy rather than contradiction-laced.</comment>

<question>2</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the crystal’s continuing hum and her lighter steps reweight identity from archivist to living memory, cost felt in the evaporating puddles she’ll never record. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of solid fog → fractured sky → evaporating puddles escalates density and reweights stakes without causal reversals. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) arrives by line 3, no penalty. No teleporting props or plot amnesia; shadow lengths obey internal logic. Minor loop: “the hush deepened” repeated twice in adjacent paragraphs (−0.2 in Q7); does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Observatory, forecourt, and crystal slab function as micro-setting that constrains choices—she must kneel, measure, listen; the final image of continuing hum charges the closing beat, meeting 9+ gate. Sensory hierarchy reflects archivist bias: she notices reflections, grooves, vibrations more than temperature or smell. Spatial choreography clean; boots click down spiral staircase, puddles tracked until evaporation. Selective detail avoids tourist catalog; only named anchors are First Observer and archive elders, reused.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—identity vs. archival distance—signaled in paragraph 2 and tightens when she conjectures that fog density warps time, forcing her to choose participation over observation. Accumulative escalation: solid fog thickens → fractures → evaporates, each stage reweighting the cost of losing versus living memory. No coincidence; pressure grows through her own measurements and listening. Cost is legible but modest—she forfeits completeness of record yet loses no tangible tool or social credit, keeping pressure high-band but sub-exceptional.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.0</question>
<comment>Theme of memory as living material emerges through concrete pattern: fog → crystal hum → evaporating puddles, never abstract assertion. Final image of continuing hum offers non-literal answer—identity is not archived but resonant. No moralizing or thematic echo in dialogue. Ambiguity lingers: will the archive miss her, or will the hum fade? Complexity embraced rather than tidied.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly lashed to Lirael’s archivist perceptions: shadow angles, vibration frequencies, nostalgic ache. Distinct perceptual signature—“pearl-like droplets,” “jagged line, sharp and unyielding”—avoids generic fantasy diction. Rhythm modulates: longer cadences for contemplation, clipped fragments under time pressure (“Time was running out”). No head-hopping; narration never claims knowledge she doesn’t access. Filter verbs minimal and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often does two jobs—“Rainwater still pooled in the grooves of the monuments, each puddle reflecting a fractured sky” sets scene and mirrors stakes. Minor loop penalty −0.2 for repeated “the hush deepened”; otherwise no scaffold or synonym churn. Metaphors stay coherent within physical logic (solid fog, gelatinous sheen). Opening and closing lines anchor voice and image cleanly. No artifacts in final third; 9+ not disallowed.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh angle: memory as literal weather phenomenon (solid fog) rather than metaphor, integrated into archivist procedural. Transformation test passes—swap fog for rain and the entire conjecture/measuring scheme collapses. Risk is moderate; concept stays internally consistent without late rule bends. Some phrasing edges toward familiar lyric fantasy (“memory’s breath”), but specificity of crystal hum and shadow calculus offsets drift.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Setup in first paragraph; drives three beats—descending to forecourt, measuring shadows, deciding to leave archive; closure linkage in final step onto clouds. Cost visible: she abandons completeness of record. Irreplaceable occupation motivates noticing details others wouldn’t.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Present in first third; returns with amplified hum after each measurement; charges final image where hum continues after fog gone, crystallizing her new identity. Mechanics matter—vibration frequency changes as she participates. Could not swap for generic stone.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Concept shapes tactics: she measures shadows because fog-altered light changes collective memory’s imprint. Middle development when hum grows louder in response to her presence. Closure participation—hum endorses her shift from observer to participant. Cost: she surrenders detached record.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>Early label; no visible trade-off mid-scene—she never hesitates to leave archive, so nostalgia informs mood but does not constrain choice. Functions as texture rather than crucible. Final reprise implicit in her lighter steps, yet no contradictory impulse dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Conjecture about fog warping time directly prompts her to measure shadows differently, enabling the realization that past bends. Appears twice, shapes tactics, and feeds closure insight. Swapping “guess” or “theory” would weaken causal link.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Signaled early (“began examining shadow lengths”); mechanics matter—longer shadows contradict records, proving fog’s density alters memory. Two distinct beats; feeds conjecture and final note “past bends.” Closure linkage indirect but essential to thematic reweighting.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>6.6</grade>
<comment>Stormlit observatory supplies vantage for fog phenomenon and spatial pressure—she must descend to forecourt to engage memory. Micro-setting inside observatory and forecourt matter more than broad vista. Could be swapped for tall tower without breaking logic, so irreplaceability moderate.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>“After fog becomes solid” sets live clock—she must finish measurements before fog fractures. Time tracked through cracks widening → sunlight spill, prompting her final descent. Alters pacing and prioritization, not merely backdrop.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Desire declared in paragraph 2; dramatized through choice to kneel, listen, and finally walk away from archive. Conflict between wanting to preserve versus live memory resolved on page with visible cost—she forfeits complete record. Identity sculpting reweighted in final image of continuing hum.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>“Deepening hush” recurs, modulating with pressure—first ominous, then musical, finally approving. Tightens atmosphere and signals collective memory’s response. Final hush carries resonant approval of her stance, charging closure image. Swapping “silence” would lose sonic personality.</comment>
