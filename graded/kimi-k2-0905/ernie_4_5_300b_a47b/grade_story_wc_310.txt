<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Kael’s quiet enthusiasm is shown through tactile coin-handling and sensor-tuning, but interiority drifts into abstract cosmology-speak (“wavelength align with purpose”) that blurs contradictory impulses. The final stance crystallizes when the coin-tower circuit becomes a bodily conduit, paying visible cost as the deck shudders and coins spark; still, the emotional before/after is more conceptual than embodied. No secondary character appears, so status/relationship bullets are waived; micro-choices stay coherent but never truly risk failure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Kael’s raised hands accept the surging wavelength, reconfiguring the prophecy from intellectual puzzle to lived circuit with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain holds—coins → receiver/transmitter insight → alignment protocol → personal conduit—taught early and paid off. Orientation is anchored by word 50; lens is causal throughout. One accumulation cap applies (−0.4) because the contraction stakes are declared cosmic yet the on-page price is primarily metaphysical, not tactile.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The crystalline amber deck, worn coins, and white-hot sensor lenses constrain every move; the coin’s crescent-and-tower icon literally rewrites the hologram战术. Selective sensory hierarchy (visual warmth, tactile smooth edges, console vibration) filters through Kael’s goal-directed manipulation. Spatial choreography is immaculate—coins circle, levitate, spark; body and tool states evolve causally. Environment could charge the final image even more if contraction’s external void visibly pressed against the dome, but interior micro-setting still fulfills the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“decode or be erased by contraction”—is signaled early and tightens when static bursts refuse pattern until Kael risks bodily fusion. Agency drives escalation: arranging coins, selecting the moon-tower piece, activating distillation, accepting wavelength surge; each narrows options. Cost is legible (deck shudders, coins spark, body becomes conduit), though cosmic scale dwarfs personal jeopardy. One non-closure accumulation cap (−0.2) for minor redundancy between “static bursts” and “fractured timelines” descriptions.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: coherence through surrender—static not noise but test, contraction not death but calibration. The moon-tower coin’s reappearance as living circuit reweights earlier symbol without authorial statement. Final image offers resonant non-verbal answer (raised hands, symphony of intent) rather than moral. Ambiguity remains purposeful; complexity intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly pinned to Kael’s perceptual signature—grooved coins, dial clicks, amber reflections—without head-hop. Syntax lengthens under wonder, fragments under sensor flare, matching emotional cadence. Diction stays within his plausible lexicon until final “symphony of light and intent,” a forgivable lift for climax. No dialogue, so voice distinction bullet waived.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and propulsive, but three adjacent sentences open with “He” in the coin-circle beat, creating template cadence (−0.3); one mixed metaphor (“memory of light… pooled like honey”) momentarily blurs physics (−0.2). Otherwise density is high, rhythm varied, no scaffold or loops near closure. Artifacts do not touch final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Reverse-time prophecy + entropy coins + observatory distillation fuses cosmic SF with mystic initiation in a fresh configuration; transformation test fails if elements swapped. Specificity of crescent-and-tower icon evolving into literal transmitter circuit feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking is present but moderated—no formal fragmentation or genre subversion. Closest cap is derivative-premise guardrail, but bespoke detail lifts it.</comment>
