<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lira’s yearning to “outlast indifference” is tangible, but her interiority leans on stock phrases (“mirror, reflecting humanity’s fleeting presence”) rather than idiosyncratic thought. The sand-grain act is a clear micro-choice, yet the emotional cost feels declared, not embodied—no bodily stress or sensorial degradation under vacuum. Curiosity is asserted, not tested by contradiction; she never hesitates or recalculates, so stakes flatten. The final smile is unearned because the story summarizes rather than dramatizes her relinquishment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the archived shadow reweights her gesture, cost legible in “gather dust.” Causal spine holds—sand grain dissolves because dawn arrives, photo taken because drones arrive—yet the drones’ arrival is external, not worsened by her choices. Orientation is swift (<120 words) and the lens is stable (Accumulative/Textural). No teleporting props; chronology clean.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lunar vacuum is more than backdrop: temperature breach creeps through gloves, visor fogs, chronometer ticks—environment actively squeezes the body. The crater edge, visor glow, and distant Earth triangulate a micro-setting that orients every camera framing. Tool-as-setting succeeds: the vial’s glass and laser trigger constrain the exact placement and timing of her gesture. Final image reuses summit geometry (shadow against void) to recharge the stake—environment directly charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“to photograph the last hush”—is signaled early and tightens once: drones en route at 17 min, dissolving grain at dawn. Escalation is situational pressure, not causal reversal; no option is foreclosed by her agency, only by sunrise and drone schedule. Cost is conceptual (archive obscurity) rather than visceral or tactical. One meaningful deepening suffices for length, but the absence of a protagonistic trade-off caps intensity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges inductively: the futility of human markers against time, crystallized in the fading gas spiral and dusty archive. Subtext resides in the shadow margin—presence registered but unseen—avoiding overt thesis. No moralizing line; final smile on Earth lets the image argue. Conceptual repricing of “some truths don’t need an audience” feels earned because the photo’s dusty fate is already dramatized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Lira’s perceptual filter—“gloves trembled,” “visor fogged”—with no head-hop. Syntax is controlled, rhythmic variation supports the hush cadence. Diction stays within a tech-poetic register believable for a lunar inspector. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero; internal monologue avoids filter verbs. Occasional elevated phrasing (“melancholy of this moment”) edges toward editorial, but remains consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is fluid; sentence lengths vary, no template cadence detected. Information density high—each line advances camera setup, chronometer, or sand-grain mechanics. Minor scaffolding: “She checked her chronometer: 04:57…” is necessary timing, not loop. One metaphor string (“golden gas that danced”) is restrained and pays off in final image; no mixed vehicles. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and echo motif cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: lunar last-worker + chemical hourglass + archive shadow is non-obvious. Trope of “final photographer” is tilted by chemistry-encoded message that dissolves at dawn. Risk—quiet ending without heroic triumph—heightens coherence rather than gimmickry. Specificity (Lunar Survey Corps, Nightwatch grain) prevents generic transplant; deletion would collapse the conceptual payoff.</question>
