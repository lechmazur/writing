<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Elias’s interiority stays concrete—goggles, finger on grooves, tool names—yet never slips into cliché. His micro-choices (needle into mainspring, palm to wall) visibly wager competence against the stone’s moral infection, so the final “smile” feels earned. Lira’s single contradiction—clenched hands vs. stepping closer—gives her enough presence for a two-character crucible at this length. No stock therapeutic labels; even “cowardice” is pinned to the husband off-stage, keeping diagnostic speak out of peak beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the lullaby is not restored but re-defined as “truth,” reweighting the covenant’s rule-set with undeniable moral cost. Causal chain holds: because Lira confesses, the stone flares → Elias can tether → the melody re-tunes. Orientation is clean by word 80; chamber, dais, and toolkit are spatially tracked. One soft spot: the exact moment the confession “infects” the mechanism is off-page, but the flare immediately signals the linkage, so the causality beat is only thinned, not broken.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Resonance chamber functions as micro-setting that literally constrains every adjustment Elias makes; its copper walls and runic pulses dictate tempo and tool choice. Sensory selection is POV-driven—goggles, brass, syrup of sound—never touristic. Starlight thread and obsidian needle are specific, not Ikea-fantasy props; their qualities change (glow seeping into cracks) so the objects evolve with the action. Spatial choreography is airtight: box on dais, widow at glass, Elias between them—bodies never ghost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can the box be re-aligned to truth without destroying the widow—is signaled by line 3. Pressure escalates through Elias’s tactile gambles: each needle pass narrows options until confession becomes the only remaining “tool.” Cost is visible on-page: stone’s dimming star, widow’s crumpling face, the single crystalline note that fills the world—audible price paid. No coincidence; the moral mechanism demands human candor as fuel.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question>
<comment>Theme emerges from the covenant’s creed without final moralizing: decay as preservation, cracks as light-holders. Subtext operates in gesture—widow’s fogged breath on glass equals unspoken guilt condensing into visibility. Final image reweights “midnight steals light” into “shadows must breathe,” a resonant non-literal answer. No tidy maxim; the lullaby’s return is left ambiguous—comfort or haunting—supplying meaningful ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Voice is tactile, metallic, rhythmically controlled—“hummed with the ghosts,” “syrup of sound”—yet stays within Elias’s plausible lexicon. No head-hopping; Lira’s interior is read only through Elias’s perceptions and her external tells. Free indirect slides cleanly: “He knew the truth: the box’s ailment was not mechanical but moral.” Dialogue is sparse, indirect, goal-driven—“Can you fix it?” carries stakes, not exposition. Prose breathes under pressure: short bursts for needlework, lengthened cadence for the final note.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence detected. Figurative language is dense but patterned—copper skin, syrup, starlight—each image pays off in the closure image of the crystalline note. No mixed metaphors; “stone wilted near lies” keeps vegetative logic consistent. One minor scaffold: “the act of concealment had corrupted both artifact and owner” restates prior beat, but it compresses necessary context and does not recur, so penalty is minimal.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: steampunk music-box repair meets alchemical moral physics, yet feels inevitable because every gear serves the confession engine. “Tethering” as a technical-spiritual procedure is a non-obvious angle on truth-as-mechanics. Risk taken with lyric escalation pays off: the final note is both sonic and metaphysical. Could not swap setting or artifact without collapsing the causal rule-set—high specificity anchors universals.</comment>
