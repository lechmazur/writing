<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Clara’s timpanist identity is more costume than crucible; her musician-specific skills never face a real test under water. The “ghost-code” obsession is dramatized through tactile choices—dunking the program, memorizing symbols—so the motive feels lived-in rather than declared. Interiority stays concrete, but the moment of crystallizing commitment (“I’ll finish it”) is slightly under-prepped; the cost is promised, not yet embodied. Still, her flawed obsession and solitary agency carry the arc convincingly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each dunk, surge, and symbol reveal tightens Clara’s options until the promise to finish the symphony forecloses retreat. Closure is a Charged Poise: the theater “held its breath” while Clara exits, reconfiguring her life’s trajectory with the cost felt in that held breath. Anchors (who/where/when) are nailed inside 120 words; no orientation debt. One minor scuff: the pipe burst is external coincidence, not her agency, yet it functions as final intensifier rather than resolver, so allowed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The flooded pit isn’t backdrop—it constrains every step, dictates the cello bow’s drift, and supplies the very medium that reveals the code. Lantern-light flicker is filtered through Clara’s percussionist ear for visual rhythm, making environment feel like score. Final image of drums thrumming through water uses the setting to charge the promise with audible cost. Meets 9+ gate: setting sonically charges the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove the ghost exists by decoding the score—signals early and tightens when each water-gush risks obliterating the symbols. Agency stays personal: she kneels, dunks, memorizes; luck (pipe burst) complicates but does not save. One visible price: the program is lost to sodden fragments, leaving her with only memory—an on-page forfeiture. Escalation is linear, not reversed; sufficient for length, but a second tightening would push it higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of “in-between spaces” emerges through action—pit as literal limbo, music as unfinished conversation between living and dead. No overt thesis statements; meaning accrues via soggy paper, half-submerged drums, breath-held theater. Final whispered promise offers resonant non-literal answer: art as collaboration with the absent. Avoids moralizing, though the concept flirts with abstraction once too often for 8+.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</comment>Free-indirect style stays locked to Clara; perceptual signature is musical—light “danced across the pit,” water “hum[s] with melody.” No dialogue, so voice must carry idiom through interior cadence; it does. Sentence rhythm mimics timpani crescendo without drumbeat monotony. Register stays within a musician’s lexicon; no POV leakage. Distinct enough, though not yet unmistakable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is lean, high-density: each sentence advances water-level, symbol-read, or emotional register. Figurative control tight—no mixed metaphors even in peak soak. Scaffolding virtually nil; no filter-verb stacks. One paraphrase loop: “water seemed to hum with a melody only she could hear” followed by “melody only she could hear” echo—minor, does not touch closure. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; final line lands with kettle-drum thud.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Flooded-ghost-opera-house is familiar gothic furniture, but fusion with orchestral limbo and musician-protagonist who “plays” the disaster gives fresh resonance. Water-as-developer for hidden score is neat mechanic, not seen before in this guise. Risk taken: no antagonist, no verbal dialogue—relies on sensory escalation and code ritual; succeeds. Could edge 8+ if composer-ghost backstory were more than whispered legend.</comment>
