<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Kael’s cool-headed stoicism stays consistent, but interior contradiction is only hinted—no clashing impulse is dramatized in-scene. His single visible cost is the goddess’s dissolution, yet the emotional price is felt more through atmosphere than through Kael’s body or choice. The rail-spike micro-choices are present, but they read as competent technique rather than wrenching gamble; still, the calm-grief fusion is memorable and specific to him.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the goddess becomes substrate, constellations snap to order, and the garden’s hum is now feral-lullaby memory—cost is legible in the soil’s shimmer. Causal chain holds: spike strikes → frequency harmonizes → goddess revealed → she willingly diffuses. Orientation is swift; “sound-wave garden” and “rail spike” anchor by line 3. One meaningful tightening only, but it reweights the sky itself, satisfying the single-scene lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The garden is rendered through Kael’s tool-mediated perception—crystal trees, humming moss, rail spike as conductor—so setting actively shapes tactics. Sensory hierarchy obeys his fisher-professional bias for vibration and light. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves. The final image (soil shimmering around the spike) recharges earlier motifs, meeting the 9+ gate for environment-as-constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“catch the echo before patterns collapse”—is signaled early. Escalation is accumulative: each spike strike thickens sensory density until the goddess’s touch crystallizes the tear-shaped constellation. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral: the goddess’s erasure stabilizes the sky but silences her forever. Agency is present—Kael chooses the final strike—but the price is felt more by the world than by him, keeping it just below top band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of translation-loss emerges organically: emotions → frequencies → visible patterns → void. No explicit thesis; final “garden had spoken” reweights prior motifs without moral. Subtext operates in gesture (goddess’s tilt) and silence (Kael’s refusal to mourn aloud). Complexity is honored: order is restored through erasure, a bittersweet repricing that resists tidy comfort.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close stays locked to Kael; perceptual signature is fisher-practical, cool, vibration-attuned. Diction—“calloused fingers,” “lullaby sung by wolves”—is concrete and sensory. Rhythm mirrors pressure: short clauses for strikes, longer cadences for garden response. No dialogue, so voice carries all texture; the slight lift toward lyric at the end is earned and coherent.</question>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, vivid, almost every sentence advances image or beat. No scaffold loops; metaphors stay consistent (sound = light = geometry). One mixed image—“lullaby sung by wolves”—but it’s purposeful, feral-lullaby tone-motivated. Final line is crisp, recharging “listened” against earlier “voicing silence.” High density, zero artifact drag.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses eco-acoustics, celestial neurosis, and mythic erosion into one coherent micro-cosm; not a trope mash-up seen before. Risky lyric compression taught early (spike = translator) and paid off at close. Specificity of “rail spike driven to anchor frequency emitter” anchors the fantastical in rusted real. The inversion—goddess saved by being lost—feels inevitable yet fresh.</comment>
