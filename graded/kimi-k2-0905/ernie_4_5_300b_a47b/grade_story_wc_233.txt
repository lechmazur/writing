<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The queen’s interiority is vivid—her fear of irrelevance, the taste of iron, the damp sheets—but the climactic recognition (“you are not disenchanted, you are afraid”) is delivered by an external chorus rather than forced out by her own contradictory choices. No micro-choice on the ridge visibly tightens the screw; she climbs, listens, accepts, and leaves without a fresh wager or forfeiture. Earned stasis is hinted at but not paid for in an on-page cost that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Causal spine holds: dream → climb → grotto → mirror-speech → descent. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): she descends still bleeding, starlight on her hands, options re-weighted. Cost is conceptual but legible—the wound is now acknowledged—yet the beat is narrated rather than dramatized; the queen does not speak or act to seal the change, slightly blunting the decisive moment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Setting is filtered through her body—condensation on stone, ozone-and-iron air, gravel that sparks like crushed glass—each detail chosen for tactile immediacy. The grotto itself is a micro-setting that charges the final image: bleeding walls mirror her own wound, constraining her stance at exit. Spatial choreography is clean; no orientation debt. Environment actively mirrors internal state without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she keep numbing or own her fear?—is signaled early and tightened once: the figure’s pronouncement collapses her denial. Pressure is coherent under a situational lens; coincidence (fireflies) complicates mood but does not resolve. Cost is conceptual (acknowledged wound) yet visible on the page; a second, more visceral forfeiture would push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from image pattern: bleeding starlight = suppressed pain. Subtext operates in silence—she never answers the figure’s final challenge, only turns away, letting gesture speak. No moral is stated; the re-weighting is felt. A touch more ambiguity about what ruling-with-the-wound would actually cost could deepen resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person POV stays tight inside the queen’s perceptual filter: cobalt grotto “above clouds” reads as her disorientation, not omniscient flourish. Rhythm modulates—longer clauses during climb, staccato replies in grotto—mirroring breath. No head-hop; diction remains within her courtly yet fatigued lexicon. Distinctive without mannerism.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is lean and image-dense; every sentence advances mood or position. No loops or scaffold. One mixed vehicle—“cobalt grotto above clouds stretching like a bruise beneath her feet”—momentarily scrambles verticality, but context recovers it. Otherwise metaphors stay coherent and purposeful, never clogging the climb’s momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Familiar queen-vs-inner-wound arc is refreshed by the astronomical wound metaphor and the inverted vertical geography (grotto above clouds). Specificity of bleeding stone and iron taste keeps it from template drift. Risk is moderate; payoff solid but not startling. A bolder tactical choice on the ridge—perhaps trying to seal the wound and failing—could sharpen inevitability.</comment>
