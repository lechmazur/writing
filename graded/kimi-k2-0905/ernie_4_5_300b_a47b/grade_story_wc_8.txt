<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elara’s historian drive is present from line 1, but her contradictory impulse—whether to expose or protect the compromised truth—only surfaces in the chamber scene. The internal split is named, not embodied; we get no bodily cost or micro-choice that dramatizes the tug. Tomas functions as pressure, yet their status dynamic stays flat; he hands her the final insight rather than forcing her to pay for it. The closure choice (“she would write…as a cautionary parallel”) is declared, not dramatized, so the cost is conceptual, not felt on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the inscription “Truth is not a weapon. It’s a seed” reweights the premise under an Accumulative lens, making the lie’s cost legible. Causality is clean: petal-drop → tunnel → chamber → re-dated ledger → reframed mandate. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no debt. Single transition (platform→tunnel) is legible. The −0.8 non-closure cap applies: one telegraphed twist (Tomas’s quiet follow) and one soft reset (she “smiled” without on-page forfeiture) keep the ending shy of 9-band purity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The station’s ivy, rust, and flaking gold leaf are filtered through Elara’s scholarly eye, constraining entry and pacing her descent. The illuminated A and T act as micro-settings: their etched map and altered timeline physically redirect her path and rewrite her thesis. Sensory hierarchy adheres—smell of damp earth, tactile flaking gold—mirroring the softened brick without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography is clean: rosebush → Track Three arch → rusted door → chamber; no impossible positions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover the real story before the petal deadline—is signaled early and tightened when the tunnel door resists. Escalation is Accumulative: each graffiti motif layers meaning until the shifted decade on the T reweights the stake. Cost is present but abstract—her prior narrative is invalidated, yet she forfeits no concrete resource. The lack of a visible price on her body or future keeps the beat just outside the 8.8 gate.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The noble-lie theme emerges through the shifting ledger dates and the collaborative graffiti, never sermonized. The final seed metaphor reconfigures the premise: lies are not barriers but temporal compost. Ambiguity lingers—she will plant truth, yet the station remains a ruin—inviting reflection without tidy moral. No thematic echo penalty; the insight is imaged, not stated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-close distance stays tight to Elara’s cataloguing mind; perceptual signature is crisp—“softened into greenish folds,” “serif curves still gleamed.” Syntax flexes with pressure, shortening as she descends. Tomas’s dialogue is emotionally rational without slipping into encyclopedic monotone. No head-hopping; no filter-verb clutter.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is clean, no loops or scaffold; information density high—one sentence often layers sensory detail, historical inference, and forward motion. Metaphors are spare and coherent (“ivy-choked archway”). Paragraph cut test passes: every graf advances knowledge or charge. A lone template cadence in the final smile line keeps it from 9.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The “negotiated truce” reframing of smuggling lore is a fresh twist on a familiar ruin-exploration plot. Specificity of the shifted decade and collaborative graffiti prevents generic transfer. The illuminated letters as data carriers feel inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk is moderate—concept-driven rather than structural—so no bonus bump.</comment>
