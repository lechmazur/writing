<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira’s anosmic synaesthesia—reading emotion through rusted tools—gives her a sharp, particular interiority; the micro-choice to polish and annotate the screw crystallizes her values. Yet the text summarizes rather than dramatizes the moment she connects “E” to Eleanor, so the decisive change feels lightly earned, not paid for under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the polished screw returned with the note reweights Mrs. Voss’s guilt into grace, and the cost—Lira’s irreversible sensory exile—remains palpable in the final chime. Causal chain is clean: engraving → photo → letter → delivery; no orientation debt; one smooth shard.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fog, drip, brass, and lantern-light are filtered through Lira’s haptic gaze; the shop’s micro-setting (bench, vat, mainspring curvature) constrains her comparison of screw to spring, shaping the thematic tension. River reflection in the last line recharges the water-clock motif with earned resonance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can Lira gift Mrs. Voss absolution by decoding the screw—tightens once the engraving surfaces; her choice to intervene narrows her safe detachment and exposes her own loss. Cost is legible: she trades anonymity for emotional intimacy, measured in the audible chime that ends the hush.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of “ordinary miracles” emerges via tactile detail, not label; the screw’s redemption arc reconfigures trauma into continuity. Final image of fog lifting while the clock strikes offers quiet, non-didactic resonance—no moralizing, only reweighted light.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Lira’s synaesthetic lens; perceptual signature (“phantom scent,” “golden haze”) is consistent and rhythmic. No head-hop; syntax breathes with scene tempo; no filter-verb clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; figurative language is selective and purposeful. One scaffold loop—“the screw wasn’t just a tool; it was a vessel…”—restates without new pressure, but it does not touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Anosmic aromatherapist who repairs water clocks and decodes memory through oxidized obstetric metal is a fresh synthesis; the risk pays off in specificity. Conceptual reweighting of a clamp screw into sacrament feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
