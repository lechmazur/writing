<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lira’s interior contradiction—poetic reverence vs. pragmatic mending—surfaces in her raw fingers and backward walk, but the “hauntingly optimistic” trait is declared more than dramatized; no visible error compounds ruin-to-reverence zeal, yet the final smile feels lightly earned because no prior beat tests that optimism to a break-point.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each stitched thread literally reweights the labyrinth’s fabric, culminating in a Charged Poise—the glowing maze as hymn—whose cost is the emptied, color-bled plates; causality is lyric rather than plot-strict, but the before/after of cracked→living stone is legible and felt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Red stone grooves, damp air, and iridescent thread are selectively layered so the canyon body becomes both obstacle and canvas; the thread’s glow reacting to song provides the micro-setting twist that charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restore sacredness—tightens when murals revive under her touch, but escalation is tonal (brightness returns) rather than a narrowing of options; the price (drained plates) is present yet not dramatized as a trade-off that threatens failure, so pressure climbs lyrically, not causally.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>“Broken precedents” evolves from thematic label to embodied reality as cracked frescoes re-knit, letting theme emerge through texture rather than sermon; the closing hymn-image offers a non-literal answer—reverence re-made—without moralising, though the idea is more wonder-filled than morally complex.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Lira’s perceptual signature—sonar-like echo of footsteps, synesthetic colour-sting, weaving syntax of “thread trails behind her like a question mark”—remains consistent and rhythmic under pressure; no head-hopping, no filter-verb bloat, and final crystalline image (“labyrinth…hymn”) modulate voice to match uplift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High information density: one line nets scenery, body, tool (“anchored…walked backward…letting the thread trail”); metaphors stay coherent (thread = question mark) and no looped stems clog the climax; minor dock for two adjacent adjectives (“color-bled plates”) that could compress tighter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fusing dream-path topology with textile restoration feels fresh; the sleepwalker encounter, however, lightly echoes labyrinthine ghost tropes, and “storybook plates” verge on enchanted McGuffin, trimming full daring—yet the overall synthesis remains memorable and specific to this voice.</comment>
