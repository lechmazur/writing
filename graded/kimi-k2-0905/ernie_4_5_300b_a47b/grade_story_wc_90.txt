<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lira’s pacifism is active—she refuses the weapon, faces the AI’s challenge, and chooses to stitch with words, embodying Earned Stasis. The gravitational lightness is shown only in her floating laugh; it never constrains a tactical choice, so the trait stays ornamental. Interiority is rich and embodied (“hands that trembled only when she laughed”), but the lack of physical cost keeps her arc just shy of highest band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the door opens, the ship reboots, and Lira’s pacifism is recast from avoidance to courageous engagement. Causal lens holds—because she confronts her shadow, the Tear dissolves and the dimension unlocks—visible cost is the shattering locket and her body’s new weightless state. Orientation is anchored by word 32; no penalty. One micro-turn (locket dim → flares) tightens stakes cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>“Recycled spaceship patched with fused asteroid metal” is tactile and specific; the meditation chamber’s hologram forests act as micro-setting that charges the shadow-work beat. Kwan Yin’s Tear functions as both tool and setting-in-miniature, its collapsed-star locket constraining her grip and final decision. Garden beyond door reweights Earth-memory motif, satisfying 9+ gate. Spatial tracking remains coherent across zero-g float.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—open the sealed dimension or let the ship die—is signaled early. Escalation tightens once: locket dims → ship shudders → shadow confrontation required. Agency sits entirely in Lira’s choice to undertake shadow work; cost is the locket’s destruction and her permanent bodily levity. Pressure stays causal and coherent; no reversal, but one meaningful deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: peace is not absence but engaged courage. The twinning of grief/love via “long-dried tears on faded photographs” reweights the premise at closure. Subtext sits in the AI’s rustling static and the garden’s singing leaves, inviting reflection on post-human gratitude. Final image of weightless laughter offers Charged Poise that resists moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet controlled: “ghostly resolve,” “droplet of liquid light,” syntactic variation mirrors zero-g drift. Perceptual signature is Lira’s—she notices patch-metal, forest holograms, gravitational lift in her own bones. No dialogue to test, but AI chorus voice remains distinct from narration. Filter verbs minimal; only “she saw” appears and is justified as memory projection.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; sentences multi-task (“She closed her eyes and let the memories wash over her—not just her own, but the ship’s”). One paraphrase loop (“long-dried tears on faded photographs” echoed twice) deducts −0.2. Metaphors stay coherent; no register drift. Rhythm accelerates into the final paragraph without artifact touching closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusion of Buddhist relic, quantum-gravity DNA, and post-human birth feels fresh yet inevitable. Shadow-work as literal door key reconstitutes familiar therapy trope into speculative mechanic. Risk-taking in lyric compression pays off: “stitch the裂缝 (fissures) between worlds” uses bilingual glyph without exoticizing. Conceptual integrity holds—every tech or myth element loops back to pacifist ethos.</comment>
