<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—clutching the torture-strap while craving mercy—grounds every beat; the embodied PTSD (UV spores burn like needle-light) keeps emotion specific. Micro-choice chain (presses forehead to pulsing bark → catches slipping strap → exhales spores) steadily tilts his stance from quantifying forgiveness to accepting unmeasurable choice. Final “I’m bracing” crystallizes Earned Stasis: he forecloses the path of numerical absolution with the strap still splitting his palm—cost felt, not lectured. Voice stays coherent, never slides into therapy-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the forest dims, strap still in hand, mathematics of mercy now an open question—conceptual cost undeniable. Accumulative lens holds: UV pattern intensifies → spore snow → fractal glow reweights survival stake without causal reversals. Orientation clean by line 3; no lens ambiguity. Slight over-reliance on environment to deliver the final shift rather than a new micro-decision keeps it from 8.8.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>UV forest is no backdrop—its light flares in reaction to Elias’s skin, forcing tactical breath control; tree-pulse sync literally steadies his heartbeat. Pewter strap functions as micro-setting: cold bite against palm anchors spatial choreography and signals memory intrusion. Final dimming reconfigures the environment from interrogator to reluctant teacher, charging the closing image. Sensory economy tight (only visual/tactile needed), no tourist catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can survival be quantified into mercy?—tightens when fractals in the glow offer a false equation, then deepens when the woman’s touch collapses that option. Escalation is accumulative: each UV flare → spore burn → glow pattern increases density until “choice not equation” becomes the only remaining stance. Protagonist agency present in decision to keep walking with strap in hand, foreclosing numerical absolution. Cost visible: strap edge still breaks skin at close.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from pattern, not statement: UV purification trope inverted—forest continues torture but ends in possible forgiveness, reweighting “penance” as ongoing choice rather than earned score. No moralizing lecture; final question “might one day make sense” is resonance, not thesis. Subtext in gesture: woman’s pewter-bright teeth echo strap metal, hinting she too wears her scars as tools—left unexplained. Ambiguity lingers cleanly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is cat-eye sharp: “shadows shifted like liquid,” “bioluminescent veins”—diction never exceeds traumatized soldier’s narrowed attention. Rhythm compresses under stress (fragments like “*Brace*”) then elongates with breath, mirroring proprioceptive metronome. No head-hop; woman’s interior left opaque, as it must be. Filter verbs rare; immediacy sustained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: long sensory sentence → staccato imperative → quiet declarative. No mixed metaphors; UV vehicles stay consistent. Information density high—single sentence often fuses setting, memory, and bodily response. Minor scaffold: “the forest’s light intensified” echoes twice within 30 words but does not dull closure beat. Clean copy, no typos.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: enhanced-interrogation PTSD retooled into bio-forest that literally continues the experiment—survivor seeks algorithm for mercy inside the very spectrum once used to break him. Fractal/golden-ratio motif rescues math trope from cliché by tying it to unreachable self-forgiveness. Woman’s entrance risks familiar mystic-guide trope but is saved by metallic teeth echoing strap, implying shared survivor status. Could push further if math imagery recurred in bodily rhythm earlier.</comment>
