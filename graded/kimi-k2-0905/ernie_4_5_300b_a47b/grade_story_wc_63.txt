<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lirael’s lineage duty and tactile care for the tower give her a believable stake; the rake-handle discovery triggers a micro-choice that re-weights her stance. Interiority stays concrete (“hands raw,” “throat tightened”) and the final endurance costs her skin and solitude. Yet the ethical-diligent trait is asserted more than tested under competing pressures, and no contradictory impulse complicates her ascent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the pendulum’s slow re-start and ridge self-sealing show visible cost under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is internal and lyrical—rake inscription meets bob runes, tide answers—rather than external antagonism; the pattern is taught early by the stalled swing and holds through the final image. One soft spot: the rake’s prior history is conjured rather than dramatized, slightly thinning the “earned” feel.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The obsidian ridge is handled like a living antagonist: shards cut boots, cracks mirror her face, final sealing answers her act. Salt-slick texture, low resonant hum, and spiral stairwell situate every move; the tower’s iron veins and bob scars integrate world-rule learning into action. Environment directly constrains her climb and final alignment of rake to bob, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“restart the swing before chaos”—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when the Hush lengthens. The rake’s inscription provides the single deepening that reframes her task from mechanical fix to ritual absolution; tide surge and ridge groan supply escalating sensory cost. No second reversal is needed under the lyric-accumulative design; agency remains hers, price is the searing palm and spent daylight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of “incremental absolution” emerges through the rake’s weather-worn carving and the slow re-start arc, avoiding explicit thesis. Final image—smooth glass ridge—reweights earlier fractures as healed layers of shared guilt, offering conceptual cost without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: whose absolution, and for what original sin?—inviting reflection while remaining tethered to Lirael’s embodied act.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Lirael’s perceptual filter: she notices gear-thirst, tastes salt, reads runes by touch. Syntax lengthens during the Hush (“air thickening like syrup”) then contracts with the bob’s tremor, mirroring emotional cadence. No dialogue appears; therefore no voice-convergence risk. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”) sits in narrator, not focalizer, but remains within tolerable distance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical; figuratives (“blackened spine,” “jagged teeth”) serve the ridge’s body imagery without overcrowding. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; sentences vary in length and opening. One mixed vehicle—“pendulum bob…scarred by centuries of friction” followed immediately by “metal seemed to shiver”—momentarily blurs animate/inanimate, but the effect is brief and closure clarity intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Merging tide-tectonics with a clockwork absolution machine feels fresh; the rake-handle palimpsest repurposes trash as sacrament, transforming familiar eco-fantasy repair tale into ritual archaeology. Specificity of salt-crusted obsidian and rune-etched iron keeps the world from feeling generic. Risk lies in the quiet, internal climax—yet the slow swing lands as earned rather than gimmick, meriting the upper band.</comment>
