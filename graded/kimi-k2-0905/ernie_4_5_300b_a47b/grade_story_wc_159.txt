<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lirael’s caretaker-caregiver contradiction drives every beat: her oath to freeze feelings collides with her refusal to let the chime die. Embodied micro-choices—tracing the crack, dismantling the chime, risking orchid bloom—show systemic method warped into creative transgression. The earned renunciation of pure preservation lands as personal cost when she accepts a “new harmony” that leaks extinct joy and grief into the air. Interiority avoids label-speak; instead, trembling petals and her own tight chest externalize the stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of resonance > causality. Anchors—who/where/when—arrive by line 5; orientation waived because disorientation is later paid off in the auroral reveal. Closure is a Charged Poise: the cracked tube becomes a new conduit, reweighting the whole preservation ethic; cost is felt in the swirling mist of liberated feelings. No plot amnesia; every object (etched runes, toolkit, orchid shimmer) recurs with altered meaning, tightening the final cadence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The opal library’s light-fracture rules are taught early and constrain every move: humidity, resonance, auroral sight-lines dictate Lirael’s toolkit and song pitch. Spatial choreography is flawless—apex chime, bamboo fragments, orchid shelves triangulate without drift. Sensory selection favors resonance over visuals, mirroring internal shift from silence to new chord. Final image of rainbow-casting petals is inseparable from the repaired crack, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“preserve dormancy vs allow evolution”—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens when the irreparable crack forces a creative breach. One meaningful deepening: the refusal to accept loss shifts from passive caretaking to active song-weaving, visible price paid as extinct feelings escape. Agency remains hers; no coincidence resolves the break. The cost (equilibrium shattered, director’s flicker of approval) is on-page and scaled to micro-setting.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between preservation and transformation; no character states it aloud. The reframed chime acts as a Conceptual Repricing: extinction is no longer sealed but sung. Subtext resides in the gradually welcoming stance toward “half-formed” emotion. Final resonance is felt, not sermonized, leaving plausible ambiguity about whether the library will survive the new song.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Lirael’s perceptual filter—“prismatic whispers,” “foxglove regret”—with syntax that lengthens during song, compresses during dismantling. No head-hop; director’s flickers are external data only. Free indirect style is clean: “she’d learned that preservation demanded creativity” carries her diction, not authorial thesis. Dialogue is sparse but tonally distinct—director’s opalescent static versus Lirael’s internal lullaby cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rhythmic control mirrors acoustic theme: longer, resonance-rich sentences during singing; clipped fragments during toolkit work. No mixed metaphors; figurative language stays within light-sound domain. One paraphrase loop spotted (“the crack… its crack”) but does not touch closure beat. Information density high—single sentences layer setting, tool, emotional stakes. Read-aloud ear test passes; final line hums back to opening image, sealing cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Fusing extinct emotions into glass-orchid horticulture feels fresh, as does the cracked bamboo conduit that re-tunes rather than repairs. Synthesis of memory-botany and acoustics is specific to this piece; swapping elements would collapse the metaphorical engine. Risk in lyric escalation is rewarded by coherent closure. Minor −0.2 for proximity to “library of forgotten X” trope, but transformation through song-fracture redemption outweighs familiarity.</comment>
