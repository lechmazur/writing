<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elias’s reflective, peripheral focus is shown through his methodical mirror-work and preference for “looking sideways,” but his interiority remains mostly observational; the moment of triumph is reported rather than embodied, so the cost of success feels external. The keepers’ desperation is stated, not staged, so the crucible of relationship never pressures Elias into a visible trade-off. A stronger internal contradiction or a renunciation scene would have lifted the score.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The causal chain is clean: broken timer → reverse-engineering via light angles → successful harvest restart; each step grows from the last with visible mechanism. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing—“wonder bottled for later” reweights the premise and leaves Elias descending into a cellar that now feels like a grave. The Orientation Test is passed early; lens is Causal throughout. A crisper cost image at the final beat would have nudged this into 8+ territory.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The marble cavern is not backdrop: its quartz veins become the calibration grid Elias uses, and the changing noon/midnight light angles directly constrain his tactics. Spatial choreography is steady—spiral staircase, fissure, hidden compartment track cleanly. Sensory detail is selective (damp stone taste, harmonic hum) and mirrors internal state. The setting passes the 9+ gate by functioning as both tool and final image charger.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“can the harvest resume?”—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens when Elias discovers the last intact gear must align with live light angles. One meaningful deepening occurs: the realization that the cavern itself is the instrument, not merely the container, narrows his options to synchrony with earth-tides. Cost is present (daily returns across the wounded season) but not viscerally felt at the climax; the victory feels frictionless, capping the score below 8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: preservation versus evanescence, bottled wonder versus lived wonder. The cellar-of-reason image and the final descending staircase let the reader feel the conceptual grave without moralizing. Subtext hums in the timer’s cold hum and Elias’s warped mirror reflection—wonder captured is wonder distorted. No thematic echo penalties; the idea is left resonant, not resolved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly lashed to Elias’s perceptual filter; diction—“peripherally focused,” “looking sideways”—is character-specific and recurs without feeling branded. Rhythm modulates: longer reflective sentences in lull sections, shorter percussive bursts during gear clicks and harmonic eruption. Mirror and quartz return as charged objects, not tokens. One syntactic loop (“the timer… the timer…”) is minor enough to withhold 8+ but not penalize.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical; metaphors (frozen starlight, silent wound) are sparse and paid off. Information density is high—each sentence advances mechanism or stakes. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks. One mixed metaphor—“store wonder in the cellar of reason”—is ear-catching but purposeful, so waived. Final third is artifact-free, allowing 8+ band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The “harvest of echoes” premise feels fresh because it is treated as engineering problem, not fairy tale; reverse-engineering acoustic geology via mirror angles is specific and non-obvious. Risk is taken in quiet climax—no villain, no explosion—yet resonance is earned. Transformation test: swap cavern for any cave and story collapses; setting is integral. Minor deduction for thematic territory (preservation vs. loss) being familiar, but execution is singular.</comment>
