<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s shift from rule-bound registrar to translator-of-silence is credibly anchored in micro-choices—fetching the lens, pocketing the blank ticket—each carrying a visible, accumulating cost. His interior contradiction (fear of unspoken truth vs hunger for it) is dramatized in embodied beats rather than labels. The final refusal to write, instead doodling the lens, is an earned renunciation that forecloses his old identity. Secondary pressure from Lira is crisp, but her motivation stays slightly schematic; still, the relationship crucible succeeds in forcing Elias’s stance crystallization.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain is tight: ticket stub → lens discovery → map → midnight rendezvous → decoding ritual → silence embraced. Each because/therefore linkage narrows Elias’s options until the final choice to stop logging words. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the registrar rule-set is literally overwritten by the doodled lens, a single image that reweights the entire premise with undeniable social cost—his job function abdicated. No teleporting props or causal amnesia; the projector lens is seeded early and its cracked glass pays off thematically. Minor waiver: orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 30; no penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Crystal forecourt is not postcard backdrop; its post-rain shimmer, vibrating stones, and pooled shadows directly supply the map coordinates and the humming key to the coded tickets. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elias’s night registrar bias: he notices humidity-warped stubs, chilled breath, lamp angles—details that later constrain how the lens must be held. The crystals themselves become the micro-setting that charges the final image: their pulse is the audible cost of honesty he embraces. Spatial choreography is flawless; we track his movement fountain-by-fountain without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Elias’s need to accept silence as valid communication—tightens through each decoded ticket; options narrow from recording everything to recording nothing. The midpoint deepening (crystals begin to warm under fingertips) makes the cost visceral: continued transcription would betray the living vibration. Final escalation is quiet but decisive: the blank “Begin” ticket forces him either to perpetuate the old system or relinquish it; he chooses forfeiture of professional duty. Stakes stay personal and legible; no abstract world-saving inflation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges without sermon: honesty after language exhausts itself is shown through tactile ritual, not thesis. The lens-shaped doodle that closes the piece reprises the projector glass, reweighting it from mere magnifier to charter of a new vocation—an imagistic answer to the core question. Subtext thrives in gesture: Lira’s hand on Elias’s shoulder conveys trust transfer more potently than any manifesto. The piece resists tidy moral binaries; silence is both refuge and risk, an ambiguity the ending owns rather than resolves.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias; no head-hop. Narrative diction—“the hush wasn’t emptiness—it was a canvas”—carries registrar-adjacent metaphors that feel character-particular, not imposed. Perceptual signature is consistent: he catalogs stubs, fountain numbers, lamp angles; even lyric lines filter through a clerk’s taxonomic lens. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for humid description, staccato exchange with Lira under crystal glow. No filter-verb stacks; immediacy remains intact.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and polysemous; most sentences pull double duty—advancing plot while texturing silence. Figurative language is sparse, pattern-taught (“the forecourt…gleamed like a promise”) and recharged in the final glow, avoiding overwritten beats. No synonym churn or template cadence; sentence openings vary naturally. One micro-loop detected (“the crystals hummed…their vibrations resonated”) but it occurs early and does not touch closure. Grammar clean, pronoun reference unambiguous.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Concept of non-verbal honesty encoded in humidity-warped ticket stubs feels fresh; the projector lens repurposed as cryptographic key is an elegant, specific twist. Premise could slide toward gimmick, but grounded in Elias’s believable occupational mindset. Final reconfiguration—registrar abandons logs for doodled invitation—risks sentiment yet avoids it by keeping the act wordless and ambiguous. Slight deduction for familiar “mystic crystal” trope, but post-rain vibration and ticketing mechanic transform it into a bespoke system rather than borrowed mysticism.</comment>
