<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Lila’s interiority is vivid—her mother’s laughter in the farmhouse silence, the brass telescope against her palm—but the “spooled wholeness” belief is asserted more than dramatized in contradictory choice. Voss functions as skeptic foil only; no status shift or mutual pressure alters Lila’s stance. The final “it’ll change me” lands as self-summary, not earned renunciation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure is a lyrical Resonant Reconfiguration: the gondola drifts into dawn while Lila feels the sky’s memory as undeniable conceptual cost. Causality under Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each cloud entry thickens emotional density until the empty air itself reweights meaning. Orientation is clean by line 5; no teleporting props. Minor slack: the snapped tether is mentioned once and never constrains later tactics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The brass telescope is handled every few beats—cold barrel, patina like old coins, final raised beacon—its tactile states tracking emotional intensification. Lantern light, wicker sway, and cloud hues are filtered through Lila’s meteorologist gaze, never tourist catalog. The vanished tower horizon at climax reconfigures spatial stakes, charging the “empty” sky with remembered weight.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prove emptiness remembers—signals early and tightens through each cloud notation; the final drift into dawn crystallizes stance with conceptual cost. No reversals or resource losses, but density of emotional cloud-data escalates under Accumulative lens. Voss’s skepticism complicates without forcing adaptation; pressure remains internal and coherent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme—memory resides in absence—emerges from concrete cloud catalog rather than thesis statement. Final image of cirrus spes reweights prior sorrow/joy threads into quiet possibility without moralizing. Subtext in Voss’s shrug and Lila’s trembling hand invites ambiguity about whether proof matters; avoids tidy epiphany.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Lila’s perceptual signature—meteorologist taxonomies, brass weight, farmhouse echo—no head-hops. Syntax modulates: longer reflective sentences in calm, clipped fragments during lurch. Voss’s gravelly diction contrasts with Lila’s precise Latin cloud names, maintaining distinct idiom under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, image-dense; figurative language is selective (patina like old coins, mourning veil) and never stacks into purple. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances cloud-data or emotional charge. Minor filter verb “she felt” appears once in closing beat but does not dull the final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Clouds-as-memory-archive is fresh, grounded in professional practice rather than metaphoric gimmick. Brass telescope reprises as both scientific tool and emotional reliquary, its evolving gleam charging closure. Risky lyric structure pays off: accumulative catalog replaces causal reversals yet lands resonant reconfiguration. Specificity of cumulus joyus, nimbus iratus prevents generic abstraction.</comment>
