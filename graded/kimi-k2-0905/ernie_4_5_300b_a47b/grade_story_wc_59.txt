<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“tears streaming,” “bones ache”), but the epiphany-into-orchard pivot is articulated in thematic shorthand (“We’ll grow”) rather than a final micro-choice that costs him something concrete; the renunciation is felt yet not dramatized on-page. Still, motives escalate cleanly from solitary obsession to shared stewardship, satisfying the 9- gate minus the hairline soft landing.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the glowing orb reweights the world’s rule-set with undeniable conceptual cost (“the metal fading, the stone blooming”). Causal linkage is tight—each assembly tweak is reacted to by the egg—so lens holds. The −0.1 reflects the slightest over-crank in the final “we” beat, which tells the reconfiguration rather than letting the image fully own it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vyrthra’s suspended stalactite palace is not postcard scenery; its resonant anchors and marble cracks literally answer the egg’s pulses, guiding Corvin’s apparatus placement. Micro-setting succeeds: the copper-wire nest is a tactile “tool-room” whose parts are handled, reconfigured, and finally transmuted. Sensory selection stays under POV duress—oil-taste, keening stone—without tourist clutter. Gate met, but one clause (“world reduced to…”) drifts into overview, capping at 8.7.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“can beauty be engineered?”—tightens through each failed gear-hum until the orb’s flare forecloses the mechanist path. Price is legible: centuries of metal dominance literally peels away. Minus 0.1 because the palace’s shift feels partly off-stage, slightly blunting the cost immediacy for Corvin’s own body/choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organistically: “flawed genesis” re-prices from defect to necessity once the cracked shell releases imperfect light. No final moralizing; the last image of orb-in-hand crystallizes the thematic answer. Bittersweetness is earned—beauty reborn but forever fragile—without abstract sermon. Micro-ding for the tutor’s single line that nudges toward thesis-statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains coherent psychic distance; diction (“tattered velvet doublet,” “liquid starlight”) is prince-specific, not wallpaper. Rhythm accelerates into breathless fragments as the egg cracks, mirroring escalating panic. Filter verbs rare; perceptual signature consistent. No dialogue to judge; voice never slips into committee exposition. Clean 8.8, borderline 9 except for one templated “as if” simile pair.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sentences vary cadence from rolling cumulative clauses to staccato fragments during the crack. Information density high—each descriptive touch also telegraphs world-rule (starlight vials = prior theft). Metaphors stay physically coherent; no mixed vehicles. A single scaffold clause (“the world had withered…”) is unavoidable summary at this length. Final third avoids purple overload, sustaining momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Familiar eco-rapture trope is refreshed by crystalline stalactite palace and song-bird genesis lore; specificity of copper-prism nest makes the contraption feel invented, not checkbox. Risk: turning mechanical dystopia into verdant Eden in 700 words could read facile, but the piece keeps the transformation visibly costly (orb’s flawed glow). Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight. Not quite a 9 because the Mechanist backstory remains genre-standard, albeit economically sketched.</comment>
