<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Lira’s curiosity and “powerfully gentle” stance are consistent, but interiority stays safe; no contradictory impulse is dramatized under pressure. The final “keep questioning” is credible yet costs nothing on the page—no risk, forfeiture, or visible flaw confronted—so the arc feels complete but not paid for.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the lab falls silent, mountain song ascends, reconfiguring the premise with conceptual cost—human devices cede to older voices. Causality holds under Accumulative lens: each beat layers texture until the pattern breaks in the final hush. The pilgrimage generates tightening, not reversal, satisfying the short-form requirement.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Brass, cracked tubes, carbide beam, and cave symbols are tactile and selective; the lens-as-recording-groove reweights the final image. Spatial tracking stays clean; environment actively supplies the song once the lens unlocks it. Micro-setting (lens) constrains the climax, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“feel connection”—is signaled early and deepens when the cave’s hum turns tangible. One meaningful tightening: lens pressed to carving transforms abstract quest into visceral vibration, foreclosing the need for further machines. Cost is felt as intellectual humility, visible in Voss’s awe; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—connection pre-exists, awaiting listening—emerges through the lens’s reweighting, not statement. Final silence re-prices prior engineering hubris with undeniable conceptual cost. No moralizing; resonance lingers in the mountain’s ongoing song.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-limited stays tight to Lira; perceptual signature favors sound-texture metaphors and light refraction. Rhythm modulates—longer sentences during cave descent, clipped phrases at discovery—without losing clarity. No head-hopping; diction remains within her plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, image-dense; no loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated phrasing (“iridescent threads catching light like a whisper”) borders on poetic but stays pattern-consistent. No mixed metaphors; information density high throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sound-mining, carbide-lens-as-vinyl, and cave-instrument are fresh syntheses; premise feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk lies in quiet climax—letting machines fall silent—which pays off under Accumulative design. Could edge higher with sharper cultural specificity.</comment>
