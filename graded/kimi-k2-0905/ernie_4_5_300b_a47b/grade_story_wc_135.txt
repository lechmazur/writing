<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lirael’s “reactively visionary” method is shown through embodied ritual (kneeling, listening, placing the valve) rather than label-speak; her patience is dramatized, not declared. Interior contradiction arrives when each returned valve re-awakens private guilt about the exile she survived—yet this stays subtextual. The final micro-choice—handing the reassembled trumpet to the girl—crystallizes her value hierarchy: memory over anonymity, repair over archival purity. Cost is visible: the valve leaves her custody, severing her exclusive claim to the past.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the trumpet’s first public note reconfigures the harbor’s silence into shared heritage; cost is felt because Lirael surrenders custodial solitude for communal sound. Causality is mosaic-style accumulative: each placement of the valve summons a new witness whose story tightens the weave; no single event causes the next, yet pattern coherence grows. Orientation is swift: “ivory harbor… after the rain” locates us inside two sentences, then docks, plaza, lighthouse keep spatial logic. Lens stays Accumulative/Textural; final image re-weights prior absences into audible presence, satisfying cost test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Ivory stone, salt-sting, gull-cries, tide-puddles—selective sensory triads root every beat. The valve itself serves as micro-setting: its brass chill on thresholds constrains where Lirael kneels and how long she'll wait. Weather remains causal: rain-washed cobbles mirror her wiped-clean exile status; polished queen-stone reflects collective guilt at closure. Spatial choreography across quay, plaza, cottage is tracked without drift; no impossible distances or teleporting props.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“compile fragments into meaning”—escalates as each interval widens the pool of living testimony, raising social stakes of who owns memory. No external antagonist; pressure is situational: the harbor’s silence versus the risk of breaking it. One meaningful tightening: the girl’s locket reveal forces Lirael to relinquish sole curatorship, trading private archive for public resurrection of sound. Cost is visible—she hands over the valve; this forfeiture narrows her future solitude and cements communal reclamation of voice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the reframing of silence from wound to instrument: absence becomes a resonator waiting to be charged. Subtext resides in the unspoken guilt of survivors (fisherman’s barnacle-rough pause; vendors skirting the plaza) rather than thematic exposition. Final image—trumpet’s note ringing off wet stone—offers non-literal answer: history is not retrieved but performed, requiring present bodies to breathe life into relics. No moralizing summary; complexity remains (the queen’s “curse” still frightens children) without forced equivalence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Narrative voice maintains consistent lyric distance, filtering perception through Lirael’s archivist bias: “fragments into meaning,” “ghosts of memory.” Syntax lengthens during contemplative beats, fragments during encounters (“‘That belonged to my grandfather,’ he said, his voice rough as barnacles.”) to modulate pressure. No head-hopping; fisherman and girl speak but interiority stays anchored to Lirael. Lexicon stays within her plausible diction—no sudden academic register—and brass, tide, ledger motifs recur without self-conscious ornament.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose breathes with scene needs: long porous sentences for silent listening, clipped couplets for discoveries. Figurative language is sparse and targeted (“salt-sting of absence”) avoiding density overload at climax. No synonym churn or template cadence; each valve placement uses fresh verbs (places, kneels, waits, observes). Opening and closing lines echo “ivory harbor”/“symphony waiting to be played,” creating resilient frame without loop artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Premise—archivist healing post-exile silence through staggered relic intervention—feels fresh against familiar post-conflict return narratives. Specificity of herald’s trumpet valve as both key and beacon avoids generic MacGuffin; its acoustic logic ties climax to setting. Accumulation structure (three sites, three encounters) synthesizes oral-history tradition with lyric cadence, avoiding standard confrontation arc. Risk resides in quiet stakes and absence of villain, but coherence of pattern keeps it from gimmickry.</comment>
