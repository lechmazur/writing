<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lira’s contradictory blend of cerebral detachment and emotional hunger is dramatized through micro-choices (tracing chalk, trembling fingers, the decision to teach children). The grandmother reveal supplies a potent interior shift, but the cost feels conceptual rather than visceral because the prior emotional stakes were stated in abstract “ghost-chasing” terms rather than embodied loss. Interiority avoids label-speak and maintains a consistent perceptual signature tied to decoding. Motive intensifies cleanly to the final stance crystallization.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each beat (margin scan → fountain dip → chip insert) obeys a because/therefore logic that progressively narrows Lira’s options to “teach.” Closure lands as Decisive Change with legible cost—she forecloses anonymity by accepting the grandmother’s public baton. Orientation is anchored within 50 words; no set-up teleporting. Only minor slack: the arcade AI’s approval is unmotivated by any prior constraint, a hairline softening of causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Golden arcade at dawn is more than postcard: refracted light through fountain water literally unlocks the compartment, so setting constrains the pivotal choice. Texture is selective—honeyed glass, brass rail, cyan chalk—filtered through Lira’s decoder gaze. Spatial choreography is sound; body positions track from balcony to staircase to fountain. Sensory hierarchy favors the visual, but that bias is POV-justified. Phoenix seal recurs to charge closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will she decode the family signal before the carrier arrives?”—is signaled early and tightens once: the chalk margin under the wax seal forces a now-or-never dip. Cost is visible (tears blur vision, anonymity foregone) but not physically taxing; still, the conceptual price of stepping from shadow to mentor is legible. Escalation is single-thread but sufficient for 750-word scope. Agency drives every turn; coincidence is decorative, not resolving.</answer>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-declaratively: data vs. tactile memory, how marginal marks become inheritance. Chalk codes and surface mail reframe nostalgia as active resistance rather than sentiment. Final image—“clipboard humming, ready to juxtapose again”—offers Conceptual Repricing that reweights the arcade from bazaar to archive. No moral is stated; the thematic answer is the gesture itself. Complexity is honored—no tidy redemption of the city’s collapse.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited sustains a consistent decoder’s diction—“alphnumeric sequences,” “frequency match”—without drifting into technician exposition. Rhythm modulates: longer synth-light sentences in opening calm, staccato clicks during descent. Perceptual signature—attention to spirals, light refraction, wax texture—remains character-bound. Filter verbs are minimal and purposeful. One minor register slip: “emotional honesty” line edges toward meta-commentary but is saved by immediate tear image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is taut, high-density; most lines do two jobs (move, describe, or theme). No loops or scaffold; metaphor vehicles stay coherent—phoenix seal returns intact. Opening and closing lines are image-driven, satisfying ear test. Occasional elevated adjectives (“honeyed,” “cyan”) risk decorative stacking, but they serve POV’s chromatic obsession and never clog a beat. Minor punctuation elegance: em-dash in vendor interjection keeps momentum breathing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Premise fuses crypto-chalk with retro-mail in a way that feels specific, not gimmick: the grandmother’s microchip retroactively justifies the arcade-as-archive. Sidewalk ciphers transform from ambience to plot engine, avoiding quirky ornament. Risk—using a fountain as lock—pays off because light-frequency setup is seeded early. The synthesis of nostalgic residue and futuristic salvage is internally coherent; removing any core motif would collapse the causal chain. Fresh angle on “analog resistance” trope.</comment>
