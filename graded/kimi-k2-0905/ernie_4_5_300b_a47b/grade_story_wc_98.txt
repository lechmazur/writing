<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is lyrically sketched—her perceptual lens is vivid—but we never see contradictory impulses acting at once; doubt is declared (“luminous doubt washed over Lira”) rather than embodied in tense micro-choices. The single decisive act—pressing then surrendering the seed—holds, yet the cost feels conceptual, not personal; she smiles immediately after, muting any felt forfeiture. No secondary character appears, so relationship/status crucible is N/A. Overall, a strong poetic consciousness, but emotional stakes remain safely abstract.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands: the seed’s surrender + mirror re-formation create a Charged Poise that reweights the island’s future. Causality is lyric-accumulative: seed → dream → mirror-test → resealed memory; each step is legible under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is clear by line 4; no penalty. The “cost” is collective (possible amnesia averted) rather than personal, so the price feels faintly external, keeping the score sub-9.</comment>

<comment>Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered: color-shifts, jasmine/iron scent, soap-bubble seed. The ridge itself doesn’t constrain tactics, but the seed-as-micro-setting does; its iridescence and warmth directly cue Lira’s dream-entry. Spatial choreography in the dream-mirror cavern is coherent. One hairline slip: “the ridge would drown in storms” tells weather future rather than letting us feel it press the present beat.</comment>

<comment>Stakes—“memory erasure vs. preservation”—are declared early; pressure heightens once when mirrors shatter and Lira must choose to surrender the seed. The tightening is conceptual (fear vs. courage) rather than tactical; no live option is foreclosed for Lira herself. Agency is present but symbolic; cost is off-loaded onto the collective. Sufficient for this length, yet lacks a visceral price that alters her personal path.</comment>

<comment>Theme—memory as compass, not cage—emerges through the mirror-test and seed sacrifice without sermon. The final smile reconfigures the monsoon from threat to renewal, offering Conceptual Repricing. No overt moral appears; subtext operates in image. Minor deduction for the chorus-of-islanders line (“to remember is to choose”) that flirts with thematic echo.</comment>

<comment>Voice is lush yet controlled: long cadences for ridge beauty, clipped fragments for dream dissonance. Diction stays within mythic register; no head-hop. Compression in the dream cavern is taught by context and paid off at closure. A few adjective stacks (“iridescent as a soap bubble”) verge on purple but serve the fairy-tale texture, so permitted.</comment>

<comment>Strong rhythm contrast: rolling anaphora in outdoor ridge, brittle fragments in mirror cavern. Information density is high—most sentences do two jobs. Two micro-loops: “colors deepened, and the air thickened with the scent of jasmine and iron” + next paragraph’s “colors deepened” echo; slight scaffold. No artifact touches the closure beat, so 9+ gate stays open but not reached.</comment>

<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Fantasy “memory guardian” trope is refreshed by making the land itself the client and the seed a one-time key. Dream-mirrors as living archive feels non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Risk is taken with lyric structure over causal plot; coherence holds. Specific detail (soap-bubble seed, jasmine/iron scent) anchors freshness.</comment>
