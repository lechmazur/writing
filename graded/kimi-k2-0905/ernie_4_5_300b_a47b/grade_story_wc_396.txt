<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is lyrically rendered—“shadow-laced peacekeeper,” “quiet fire”—but contradiction is asserted rather than dramatized; we never see her tempted toward violence or withdrawal, so the alleged anomaly stays ornamental. Micro-choices (walking the mirror circle, placing the fragment) are ritual, not crucible; no moment forces her to pay or renounce. The earned smile at the end feels un-taxed because no flaw or blind spot is exposed on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the ice stilled, aurora brightened, cost implied by the personal energy spent, lens held (Accumulative/Textural). Causality is soft—fragment → empathy → calm storm—but pattern is taught early and re-weights the stake at the end. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) is clear within 60 words. No meaningful tightening inside the arc; escalation is atmospheric, not option-narrowing, so cost feels diffuse rather than specific.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>“Lighthouse orchard above shifting ice floes” is a fresh, high-impact anchor; every subsequent frost, groan, lantern glow is filtered through Elara’s aurora-weathered perception. The mirrors, lantern, fragment act as micro-setting that physically channel the climax, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays clean up the spiral stair to attic semicircle; only nit-pick is that “orchard” implies soil yet trees root in permafrost—glossed, not explained.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—quiet the fear-storm—is signaled early; pressure is ambient, not option-narrowing. No reversal or trade-off is forced; Elara’s tactic succeeds exactly as planned, so escalation is aesthetic (aurora brightens) rather than tactical. Cost is implied, not dramatized; agency is present but consequence-free, limiting high-band entry.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—empathy as active force—emerges imagistically through mirrored griefs and final warming flare, avoiding overt thesis. Subtext resides in frost/ice versus color/light motifs that reverse at closure. Final smile lands as conceptual repricing rather than moral sermon, meeting the 9+ test. Slight deduction for thematic echo in the penultimate clause “courage wasn’t in the absence of fear …” which restates the insight already shown.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person close maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature is consistent—aurora tint, frost weight, mirror shimmer all filtered through Elara’s sensory hierarchy. Lyric cadence is controlled, with purposeful compression (“weighted breath before reply”) that teaches its pattern early and pays off in final stilling. No head-hopping; diction stays within aurora-tempered lexicon, no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is fluid; sentences vary in length and opening, avoiding template cadence. High information density—one line often paints frost, emotion, and myth in a stroke. Occasional stacked modifiers (“shadow-laced peacekeeper,” “faint silver sheen”) flirt with purple but stay voice-motivated. No scaffold loops; figurative vehicles stay internally consistent; tiny paraphrase echo (“storm was coming … storm was a manifestation”) is the only detectable loop.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Premise—empathic lighthouse-keeper on ice orchard—feels fresh, synthesizing climate-fantasy with introspective magic. Vintage mirrors as memory portals is not new, yet pairing with aurora-forged crystal gives it local specificity. Risk is moderate; no structural subversion, but lyrical compression and ecological metaphor elevate familiarity. Transformation test passes: swap aurora for ordinary sea and the whole aesthetic collapses, proving integration.</comment>
