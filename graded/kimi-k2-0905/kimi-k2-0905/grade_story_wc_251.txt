<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is richly particular—she “hears unspoken words” as wind, a trait that drives every micro-choice from pocketing the grotto to wiring the town’s windows. The contradiction between her disciplined coach identity and illicit nighttime planter is dramatized in action, not labels. Cost is visible: she steps into pale morning “coat collar soaked in starlight,” having foreclosed her own safety for a rule-set she can never again enforce. Only the faint safety-hedge of “nobody had asked for” keeps her from full moral ambiguity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the library exhales, boards move “like rooks,” and the town wakes to moss-between-cracks questions—undeniable social cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each window display adds density until the final image reweights the premise. Causality is clean—Ellis’s note → Mara’s method → sapling grafted into grotto → windows animate. No teleporting props; the grotto’s magnetic tug is taught early and paid off when real roots entwine iron.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The cobalt library breathes cold hush; later it “creaks like rooks,” turning setting into active pressure. Mist, starlight, and window glass constrain stealth tactics and echo the thematic hush. The magnetic grotto functions as micro-setting—a shoebox that literally reorients Mara’s compass, charging the final graft. Only the mayor’s daughter’s house interior remains a white-room blip.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—liberate the town’s rigid rule-set—signaled in line 3. Escalation is accretive: each mannequin-window plants a visible question, tightening institutional surveillance risk. The final graft costs Mara her coach authority, foreclosing future matches on “sixty-four squares.” Price is legible; no coincidence resolves the tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inverse of winning: “losing is the only way the game learns.” The refrain of second thoughts grows from pawn-gardener whispers to sapling roots cracking sidewalks—no moral stated. Subtext lives in gesture: coins stacked so the register breathes, bulb left loose so the school dreams. Final image of moss between cracks offers resonant, non-literal answer to rule-bound stagnation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person hovers at Mara’s shoulder, filtering every perception through her wind-hearing bias. Syntax mimics chess-clock tension: “She closed the library, pocketed the grotto, stepped into the method…” No head-hop; collective “they” at the end preserves focalization. Diction stays within a night-wandering coach’s lexicon—no academic register creep. Dialogue is sparse but distinct: Ellis’s “voice barely dust on the air” vs. cashier’s coin-stacking brevity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with stealth: long sentences for misty approach, staccato for window hops. Mixed metaphors are controlled—“library breathed,” “shelves creaking like rooks”—each extends the chess conceit. No scaffold loops; every line advances image or stakes. Only one paraphrase flutter: “the town itself were leaning in to listen” re-states the mist’s sharp edge.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fusing magnetic diorama, chess rebellion, and arboreal insurgence is non-obvious and feels inevitable in hindsight. The “amplified quiet” conceit freshes the familiar stealth-rebellion trope. Risk—lyric compression of a town-wide conspiracy into 755 words—pays off through taught pattern of window constellations. Specificity roots novelty: dented tin of chess pieces, sapling roots dripping night, loose bulb so the school dreams.</comment>
