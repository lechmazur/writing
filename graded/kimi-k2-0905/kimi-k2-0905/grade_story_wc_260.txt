<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Miren’s interior contradiction—preaching trust while complicit in harm—drives every micro-choice; the ring-drop, hair-loosening, page-burning triad embodies visible cost. The final release of Aster is credible renunciation earned by prior dismantling of ego. No second character on page, so no status dynamics penalty. Slight diagnostic tilt in “balanced like equal weights on a scale arm,” but embodied heartbeat-through-scales rescues it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the cedar plaque of tail-tip vertebrae reweights her future practice with undeniable social/ethical cost. Accumulative lens holds: each shed layer intensifies density until smoke carries away fraud. Orientation anchored by line 3. Final image—cage left hollow, Aster vanished—makes before/after legible. Cost is visible: she walks back “poorer in pride and richer in doubt.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Misty workshop under stars functions as micro-setting that constrains ritual: the iron stove, cedar table, refrigerated drawer supply the only possible sequence of purge-and-rebuild. Tail-tip circle acts as object-as-setting, charging the final plaque. Spatial choreography clean; no impossible positions. Weather (fog, night chill) mirrors internal dulling then clearing. 9+ gate met: cedar plaque reconfigured from setting object to ethical compass.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—redeeming her creed after fatal betrayal—tightens through each shedding act; every layer forfeited narrows future options. Moment of meaningful deepening: clipping tail segments from corpses to build promise-vertebrae; cost is visceral and irreversible. No coincidence; pressure coheres under accumulative lens. Escalation resides in density, not external threat, satisfying short-form requirement.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete ritual rather than assertion: trust cannot be woven without cost, and expertise must be cracked open to stay alive. Tail-tip compass reprises “quietly vivid” motif with reweighted meaning—beauty now tied to grief. Final image refuses triumph, embracing tender ambiguity. No moralizing statement; resonance arises from particular objects.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct lyric texture: compressed metaphor (“tiny paintbrush dipped in moonlight”), synesthetic fog-wet hair, percussive clink of ring into dish. Rhythm accelerates with sentence fragments during page-burning, then exhales in long release sentence outside. No dialogue, so no voice convergence risk. POV stays tightly interior; perceptual signature consistent—Miren notices heartbeat through scales, smoke carrying fraud, star-color on grass.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High information density: each sentence layers job—action, atmosphere, metaphor, emotion—without Scaffold. Figurative language patterned and paid off: “thin ice beneath her boots” foreshadows actual cracking of creed. No mixed metaphors; vehicles stay physically coherent. Minor template cadence in “she would…” conditional trio but serves ritual rhythm, forgiven at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: wildlife-handler scandal turned ritual autopsy of profession via chameleon tail-tip relic. Risk of preciousness ducked by tactile gore (clipping corpses) and refusal of triumph. Conceptual integrity sustained—every shed layer has ethical consequence. Could not swap chameleon for generic pet; color-shift mechanic essential to visibility theme.</comment>
