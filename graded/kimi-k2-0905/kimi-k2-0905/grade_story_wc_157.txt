<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Arlo’s charming-rogue voice is vivid—spectacles cracked, gourd rattle always in hand—and every beat is filtered through his taxed-synapses POV. Internal contradiction is alive: he audits his own dreams while seeding rebellion, a tension held to the last image. Micro-choices (burying the seed, reciting Lucretius) visibly cost him surveillance risk. The final smile is earned stasis: he forecloses safety for the city’s spark, price paid on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens: each seed-planting act is a therefore-link that tightens drone heat. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—"Resist" vine rewrites reality rules, cost legible in satellite-proof illegibility. Orientation is anchored within 120 words (who/where/when inside greenhouse). No causal amnesia; pollen-cloud trick is set up by earlier orchid tendrils.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Greenhouse is tactile micro-world: orchid stems snap as code, beetle trajectory is legible surveillance threat. Moonlit soil, passionvine rows, drone-lens scythe—all constrain how deep Arlo can bury contraband. The vine-as-message weaponizes setting into final image. Spatial choreography tracks across benches and gate without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—guard personal defiance before surtax on hope—is signaled in paragraph two and escalates each seed. One meaningful tightening: Inspector Voss’s arrival collapses time to satellite pass, foreclosing delay. Price paid: anonymity lost, seed pouch lighter, dawn exposure inevitable. Agency remains Arlo’s; luck (pollen sneeze) complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: taxed thoughts → flowering graffiti → refunded dreams. No moralizing; final cursive "Resist" read only by fireflies reweights prior pollen-code without statement. Ambiguity lingers: will drones learn to parse petals? Complexity embraced—rebellion is both joyous and punishable. Emotional after-effect: reader feels own untaxed thought unfurl.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is compressed scholarly-rogue: Lucretius quotes, synapses auditors, charming smile that once torched records—idiosyncratic diction sustained. Syntax modulates: long clause-heavy loops for intoxicated thought, staccato clauses under drone glare. Perceptual signature stable—everything noticed through risk-filtered attention. No head-hop; experimental pollen-cloud elision is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density: sentences carry metaphoric payload and causal push ("moonlit soil" doubles as burial site and surveillance timer). Mixed-metaphor risk ("converging chaos pressurized inside a jar") but jar image recurs in closure warp, earning its keep. No paraphrase loops; each orchid detail introduces new code syllable. Rhythm accelerates with alley sprint, mirroring ticking satellite clock.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise—taxed dreams, vegetal cryptography—is fresh synthesis of surveillance dystopia and eco-sabotage. Tropes transformed: gourd rattle becomes data-packet, bees become couriers. Risk taken: whole rebellion encoded in living plant grammar; payoff legible at end. Specificity makes it unswappable—only orchid bees can carry subversive pollen in this world.</comment>
