<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is concrete and sensor-rich: she “presses her palm to the damp boardwalk” to feel erased footsteps, a character-specific ritual. Contradictory impulses—fear of drones vs. need to speak—coexist in-scene, not in summary. The final act of wiring the ringer to the city tower grows directly from her carefully-resourceful trait shown in reel-alignment; the cost (arrest, loss of stealth) is legible in her raised hands. Voice remains distinct: a seventeen-year-old graffiti artist who thinks in waveforms and Morse glints, never drifts into adult diagnostician.</question>

<comment>Causal lattice holds: because she steals the key → learns the reels → drones reappear → she sprints → rigs the booth → voices flood the city. The “map” revealed in puddle waveforms is set up by word 120 and pays off when the golden path appears at climax. Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost: the city hears its own erased lullabies while Mira forfeits freedom. No teleporting props; the tape, key, and emergency tower linkage are planted and tracked.</question>

<comment>Auric lagoon is not backdrop—it reflects drone timing, provides the waveform map, and its starlit surface literally guides her sprint. The cracked booth glass, salt-corroded reels, and copper-wire guts are tactile, lived-in tools. Spatial choreography is clean: crouch → sprint → threading tape → turning key; no impossible motion. Final image—puddle mirror showing “voices impossible to silence”—re-uses setting as thematic mirror, satisfying 9+ gate.</question>

<comment>Single dominant stake: recover erased voices before drones erase her. Pressure ratchets via because/therefore: each drone pass shortens her window; aligning the heads correctly is a visible skill struggle; the final ring forfeits stealth forever. Cost is on-page: “hands raised, key still in her fist” = immediate arrest, yet the broadcast can’t be un-rung. Escalation is coherent causal tightening, no coin-flip rescue.</question>

<comment>Theme emerges from particularized images: winged-phone stencils, magnetic reels, copper uphill—never abstract “truth” lecturing. The closing refrain “Indifference is a lock; memory is the key” is spoken once into the loop, not moralized to reader. Conceptual Repricing lands when officers hesitate at their own lullabies—tyranny’s tool rewired against it. Ambiguity lingers: city may still jail her, but the sonic archive is now un-erasable.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person close hovers at Mira’s sensorium: “starlight ripple like a secret language” is her artist-perception, not tourist filler. Syntax compresses under drone threat—“she sprinted barefoot... shadow stretching like an unapproved footnote”—yet stays legible. No head-hop; retired switchman’s pixelated face is exterior observation only. Final choral voices arrive via external speakers, not omniscient ventriloquism, keeping POV modest.</question>

<comment>High-density lines: “glass cracked but intact” does triple duty—setting, risk, metaphor. Rhythm varies: long lyrical opening sentence, then staccato sprint clauses. Zero paraphrase loops; “reels” not repeated needlessly. Figurative layer is controlled—no mixed metaphors in peak beat. Copy-clean: pronouns, tense, punctuation flawless; “azimuth” used correctly by a teen who learned from discarded manuals.</question>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Familiar tropes—dystopian drones, erased memory—are re-cast through obsolete analog tech (reel-to-reel, copper landlines) and street-art cartography of puddle waveforms. The “map” is not GPS but starlight waveform traced with a wet finger—specific, non-obvious. Risk of lyric density pays off: the final image of starlight braided into copper wire feels inevitable yet fresh. Transformation test fails if Mira is renamed—her graffiti gaze and analog fluency are inseparable from the concept.</question>
