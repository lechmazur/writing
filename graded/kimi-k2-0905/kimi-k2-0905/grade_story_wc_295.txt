<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The chronicler’s interiority is lyrical and consistent—her gift to “heal with words” is not abstract, it is dramatized when her spoken petal-syllables physically bloom into daylilies that lift grief off stone. The moment she recognizes the temple’s grief as her own insomnia is a earned, embodied epiphany that fuses flaw to vocation. The boy’s single tear naming her for the first time is a micro-choice that crystallizes their new shared burden, paying the visible cost of connection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the dome dissolving into desert sky, the chronicler’s pulse now carrying the temple’s echo, is a Charged Poise that reweights every prior grief into future lenses for others. The causal chain holds—telegram → star dim → temple inscription → spoken petals → brass healing → tear naming—each because/therefore link narrows options until only mutual bearing remains. Cost is unmistakable: the temple will crumble, the chronicler will keep transcribing insomnia into glass-smooth stories, the boy loses his silence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The copper-domed observatory is not backdrop; its brass cracks and refractor lens are micro-settings that literally heal when the flower’s spectral ink touches them, constraining the chronicler’s final act. Spatial choreography is clean: we track the telegram’s migration from hand to telescope to vellum, the dome’s dissolve into desert sky is a seamless projection. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV—ink scent, star rustle, petal warmth—each filtered through her synesthetic vocation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“decode before the next variable star dims”—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens when the 19.3-hour pulse begins. The deepening occurs inside the fade: the inscription rearranges only when she blinks, forcing her to speak aloud and thereby shoulder the civilization’s grief. Cost is visible: the temple will collapse, her future insomnia is foreclosed into lifelong transcription, the boy permanently trades constellation silence for her human name.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the particular alchemy of daylily ink, stellar cycles, and spoken grief; no character ever declares “sharing burdens heals.” The final whispered inscription rides electromagnetic winds—an earned, non-literal answer that reweights every prior sorrow into future lenses for strangers. The ambiguity is purposeful: the temple crumbles yet the sky remembers, refusing tidy moral closure while still offering palpable relief.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is synesthetic, compressed, lyric—telic yet legible: “petals bearing bruise-shaped syllables” teaches the metaphoric pattern early and pays it off when ink literally lifts to heal brass. Rhythm modulates with stellar pulse; clauses shorten as the star fades, mirroring perceptual collapse. No head-hopping; the boy’s interior is rendered only through external gesture (tear reflecting unnamed constellations), preserving strict single-POV coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is dense: “the star’s dimming was not darkness but a doorway” compresses causality, image, and stakes into one clause. Metaphors stay physically coherent—spectral ink as pollen, grief as glass—no mixed vehicles. Minor scaffold appears in the repeated “shared burdens” echo, but it is thematic glue, not filler, and is reweighted at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The fusion of lucid-dream chronicling, Morse-pulsing variable stars, and daylily-pressed telegrams is a singular synthesis; nothing reads like a checklist. The inversion—“only when understanding dawns can shared burdens become shared light”—flips typical healing narratives into astronomical engineering of sorrow. Risky lyric compression never obscures causality; the payoff feels inevitable yet unforeseeable.</comment>
