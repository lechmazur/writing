<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elias’s jittery nature is embodied early (“jittery hands,” “jittery waltz”) and converts into trembling awe at the climax; the interior contradiction between fear and wonder is kept alive in-scene. Micro-choices—tightening grip, stepping forward—track the rising stakes. Missing: a clearer cost for his transformation; the fade from courier to legend is declared more than felt, keeping him just shy of 8+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the pendant dissolves, Elias steps into myth, and the villagers’ future talk supplies the conceptual cost. Causal chain holds: pendant’s vibration → stranger’s arrival → surrender of the artifact → transformation. One minor tautness: “every relic you’ve carried… were all preparation” is retrospective patch, not dramatized cause, but it arrives after the decisive image, so closure remains intact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The aurora-lit ridgeway is never a postcard; the sky drips color onto the path, narrowing Elias’s footing and sightlines, then re-absorbs the pendant’s light at the end. Micro-setting (the pendant’s filigree, his worn boot soles) constrains grip and gait, feeding the final dissolution. One hairline slip: “liquid sky” is almost mixed metaphor, but the physical logic stays coherent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will Elias remain merely a courier or cross into myth?—is signaled when the pendant first vibrates. Escalation is accumulative: each pulse thickens the air until the path itself becomes seam-thin. The tightening is visible (options narrow to step-forward-or-not) and the cost is the loss of human memory, but the price is slightly abstract; a more visceral forfeiture would push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges without thesis: wonder is cultivated by relinquishing certainty, and mentors must absent themselves for myth to germinate. Final image of the ridgeway “eternal dance” reweights earlier footsteps as seeds, not deliveries. Avoids explicit moral; one soft echo—“courier must become the message” flirts with prompt-speak but is saved by immediate physical enactment.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyric-elevated but stays in Elias’s perceptual register: fragile appendages (“dragonfly-wing,” “filigree”) mirror his own trembling. Rhythm swells with aurora flares, contracts in short beats (“He walked forward”) at the threshold. No head-hopping; stranger’s dialogue carries subtext via gesture (palm-up mimicry). One clause drifts toward template cadence: “every story you’ve told, every wonder you’ve coaxed”—a necessary litany, forgiven because it precedes the luminous dissolve.</comment>

<comment>Compression is high; most sentences carry double duty (image + interiority or action + atmosphere). No paraphrase loops, but three successive “every” anaphoras flirt with scaffold; they serve the liturgical build-up, so momentum survives. Metaphors stay physically loyal (sky as honey-thick air) and do not collide. A single typo-risk: “germinate” used four times—acceptable because the word itself is being re-seeded with new meaning.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Familiar ark—mentorless apprentice meets threshold guardian—but the aurora as literal seam and the courier-turned-message give a fresh lateral tilt. Risk is taken: mythic tone could have slipped into fantasy boilerplate, yet specificity of the ridgeway and the pendant’s entomology keeps it local. Not fully non-obvious, but the synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
