<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mireya’s calm competence and methodical ritual are vivid, but her interior contradiction—yearning to serve both valleys while fearing failure—remains reported rather than dramatized in body or micro-choice; the final stance is credible yet the emotional cost is stated, not felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the lullaby modulates the amphitheater’s acoustics, turning discord into harmony, and Mireya pockets the now-warm chain—palpable conceptual cost under Accumulative lens; causality from adhesive pattern → coordinates → lullaby is tight, and mountain-as-mediator rule is taught early and held.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Basalt benches “silver coins of light,” copper-tinted mortar, and the volcano’s breathing create a tactile, choice-guiding environment; the surveyor’s chain functions as micro-setting that charges the final image when it warms with shared pulse.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent bloodshed between valleys—tightens once via the lullaby’s acoustic test that forces delegations to hear one another; price is the permanent vulnerability of future cycles, but the tightening is single and the felt cost is more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of mediated compassion emerges through the volcano’s acoustic alchemy rather than assertion; the final image of the river singing the lullaby reweights prior material with quiet authority, resisting tidy moral and inviting lingering ambiguity about next season’s discord.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains volcanic breath as perceptual filter; diction stays within machinist-engineer lexicon (“crystalline lattice,” “brass loops”) and modulates to lullaby cadence at climax without head-hopping; rhythmic control heightens pressure while preserving clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with varied sentence cadence; metaphor strings serve pattern rather than clutter; minor overwriting in “mountain sighed… tuning fork” line but no loops or scaffold; closure image pristine.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Floodgate machinist decoding volcanic acoustics through antique chain and adhesive micro-analysis is fresh synthesis; risk of mystical volcano mediator is fully committed and paid off; transformation test passed—story collapses without these exact particulars.</comment>
