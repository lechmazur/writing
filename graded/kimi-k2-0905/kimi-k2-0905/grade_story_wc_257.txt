<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The jeweler’s grief is palpable through tactile ritual (folding, placing), but interiority drifts into abstract thesis (“teach the dead to bloom”) rather than embodied contradiction. The renunciation of preservation is legible, yet the moment of decision to leave feels summarized, not pressured. No secondary character present, so status crucible unused. Earned stasis is declared rather than dramatized with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: dissolving the stencil into the final origami reweights “genuinely artificial” into living transformation. Causal chain is lyric-accumulative; each placed figure thickens pattern rather than forcing external turns. Orientation is delayed but functional—who/where taught by ~140 words and pays off in dome imagery. One paraphrase loop (“coordinates…coordinates”) blurs prop logic slightly but does not break cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Observatory functions as micro-setting: telescope eyepiece, acoustic dome, and curtain fabric constrain placement of figures and absorb their essence at climax. Sensory triangulation is tight—candle glow on vellum, lake scent recalled under glass—filtered through grieving attention. Spatial choreography holds across thirteen chambers; no floating props. Curtain-water dissolving stencil is final image-setting fusion, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—release daughter vs. freeze her in memory—is signaled early. Escalation is textural: each origami deposit thickens the pattern until dissolution of the stencil forces the exit stance. No external antagonist; pressure is interior and coherent under Accumulative lens. Cost is conceptual (surrender of the map) rather than viscerally felt on page, capping entry to 7-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through recurrence of “genuinely artificial” becoming life: mementos as love-made-touchable, not resurrections. Final dissolution of stencil into paper-water constellation reweights premise without moralizing. Subtext resides in folds—precision as substitute for touch, coordinates as time-not-place. Avoids explicit thesis until last clause (“we teach the dead to bloom…”), a minor echo (-0.3) but resonance persists.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lyric third-person hovers close to jeweler’s tactile attention; perceptual signature favors weight, scent, fold. Syntax stretches in long anaphoric clauses that mirror ritual repetition, then contracts at dissolution: “She gathered her tools.” No dialogue, so voice purity maintained. Filter verbs minimal; “she began leaving” is sole scaffold. Register consistent with artisan precision; no corporate drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies through enjambed clauses and single-word beats. Information density high: each sentence advances placement or symbolism. One paraphrase loop (“coordinates…coordinates inside”) and one template cadence (“She placed… She placed…”) but both serve liturgical pulse. No mixed metaphors; dissolution image stays physically coherent. Artifacts do not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Premise—timeless observatory tracking soul trajectories—puts fresh spin on grief-magic realist fusion. Mourning jewelry and origami coordinates are specific craft vectors not seen together elsewhere. Risk of abstraction is high but held in check by concrete folds and curtain-water alchemy. Does not retreat into generic afterlife tourism; transformation stays material, earned.</comment>
