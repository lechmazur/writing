<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Thistle’s quiet determination is shown through embodied action—every ladder rung is a micro-choice that costs him old identity. The “bartered awakening” confusion is dramatized in-scene (touching silk, descending shafts) rather than diagnosed. His flaw (meekness) visibly complicates the climb: he pauses, trembles, yet keeps ascending. Final renunciation of the forge is earned by the prior causal chain; the cost is the cold forge left behind.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because the silk glows in the shafts, therefore Thistle keeps building; because he builds, the arches descend. One clear transition (surface → mine → surface) is legible. Closure is a Decisive Change: the grounded arch bridge with visible cost—the villagers now trespass where he once worked alone. Orientation anchors who/where by line 3; no penalty.</comment>

<comment>Floating rock arches constrain the final image—they must physically lower to create the bridge; specificity of “azure moonlight filtered through stone” is tactile and POV-filtered. Mine shafts function as micro-setting whose collapsed state is altered by Thistle’s silk-lined reinforcements, directly enabling the ladder. Sensory economy favors touch (cold forge, silk warmth) over visual catalog. World rule (arches respond to silk) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—“coax resilience from rubble”—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightens when each ladder rung risks cave-in. One meaningful escalation: the seventh-night singing arches force Thistle to climb or lose collective belief. Cost is legible: he forfeits solitary safety and former blacksmith identity when villagers ascend his ladder. Agency is continuous; no coincidence resolves the descent.</comment>

<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the iterated image of reclaimed rubble becoming bridge; no explicit moralizing. Final image—silky knots catching moonlight—reweights “azure defiance” from sky-refusal to communal ascent. Subtext in villagers’ silence-turned-wonder shows social reconfiguration without dialogue. Resonance lingers in the paradox that grounding the arches = freeing the people.</comment>

<comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains consistent perceptual signature: metallic cold, silk shimmer, stone song. Syntax elongates during ascent (“each rung a bartered awakening…”) then contracts on descent, mirroring breath. No head-hopping; villagers remain external mirrors. Diction stays within rural blacksmith lexicon; “azure” is repeated motif, not register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: long anaphoric sentences for climbs, staccato fragments for arch shudders. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or causality. Metaphors are coherent (arches as sleeping giants) and paid off. Minor density spike in “azure defiance” phrase but pattern is taught early and echoes at closure, earning its repetition.</comment>

<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Premise fusion—blacksmith + anti-gravity silk + mine shafts—feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk of lyric accumulation pays off: the arches’ song is not magical hand-waving but acoustic consequence of silk-stone resonance, grounded in taught rule. Tropes (meek outsider, village skepticism) are rotated through tactile specificity. Final grounded-bridge image is fresh synthesis rather than twist.</comment>
