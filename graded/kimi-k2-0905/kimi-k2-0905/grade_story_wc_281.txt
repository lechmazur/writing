<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is specific—her “affectionate skepticism toward inanimate objects” is lived in the first beats—and her micro-choices (grabbing the camera, tuning discs) are traceable to her drive. Contradictory impulses appear only in summary (“skepticism giving way to hope”) rather than simultaneous scene tension, and the final renunciation lacks a visible cost on the page. Still, her perceptual signature stays consistent and the embodied emotion is concrete enough for this length.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The static-shock inciting incident is causal, immediate, and lands by line 3; orientation (who/where/when) is anchored within 60 words. Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the final image of the geode on the bench reweights all prior light-path photos into “instructions for thought-shields” with undeniable social cost—hundreds now depend on her discs. The lens (Causal) is held without waver; only the neighbor test and rapid word-of-mouth escalation are slightly telescoped, but the beat still tightens options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The light-painting studio is evoked through selective sensory detail—colored beams, mirror angles, projector hum—integrated into action as Mira adjusts hardware. Micro-setting (the geode’s mica layers, the static pop) functions as tool and constraint, directly enabling the resonance breakthrough. Exterior world is skimmed, but the basement’s spatial choreography stays coherent and the final image returns to that circumscribed space, charging it with new social weight.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restore mental privacy for pill victims—tightens once: the first successful Mrs. Chen test collapses Mira’s private studio into a public sanctuary. Cost is legible in the dawn exhaustion and the geode’s aching vibration, but the escalation is compressed; a single beat of community influx stands in for wider stakes. Under the causal lens, the tightening is sufficient and protagonist-driven.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the fusion of ancient mineral and modern neuro-disaster; no explicit thesis is stated. The fractal-light motif reweights at closure—what began as aesthetic pattern becomes civic infrastructure—achieving a quiet Conceptual Repricing. The insight feels earned because it is tied to Mira’s一夜劳动 and the geode’s literal layers, though the final line flirts with editorial summary (“sometimes the most profound solutions…”) that slightly blunts resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Mira’s perceptual filter—“her teeth ache,” “fractally precise movements”—with rhythmic compression that accelerates during camera adjustments. Diction stays within her artisan lexicon; no corporate register drift. The only dialogue is a single mutter to the geode, which fits the quirky interiority, so dialogue criteria are waived. Voice is distinct and consistent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence runs. Figurative language is sparse and scene-driven (“glowing threads,” “willowglass hope”) without metaphor clash. One minor paraphrase loop: “fractally precise” appears three times in close proximity; not severe enough to dull closure. Information density is high—each sentence advances action or light mechanics—and the final line lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The telepathy-pill recall + muscovite optics pairing feels fresh and conceptually committed; the story follows the mineral’s dielectric properties to their logical shield-building end. Risk is taken in making a static shock the trigger for civic healing, yet the causality holds. Transformation test fails: swap “muscovite” for “quartz” and the plot still works, keeping it from the top band, but the specificity of mica layers and resonance adds enough irreplaceable texture.</comment>
