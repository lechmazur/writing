<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Arden’s interiority is concrete and idiosyncratic—his refusal to call the ferry “vanishing” but “slipping sideways” instantly reveals his coping logic. Micro-choices (tipping the hourglass twice, speaking barnacle numbers, reversing flow) track a hierarchy of values: save half-seen commuters at personal cost. Internal contradiction is live: hope vs. recognition that one timeline must die. Final laugh that ricochets multiplied shows embodied emotion under maximum pressure; the brass caps in pocket are earned relic of renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: ferry entire, passengers real, Arden frozen on bow feeling “single arrow pointing toward one coherent tomorrow.” Cost is the hourglass turned to frost-glass dust—irreversible loss of future resets. Causal lattice holds: every maneuver (port, steady, reverse) answers heartbeat Morse; hourglass reversal triggers final merge. Lens is Causal throughout—because/therefore links tighten until the last image reweights possibility.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Environment functions as micro-setting: the grotto’s knitting stalactites physically narrow escape route; phosphorescent barnacles provide coordinates that steer the helm. Ferry hull flickering starboard/portside is a tactile constraint that determines when Arden dares flip the hourglass. Brass rail, radio chrome-ice, and hourglass temperature-shift are handled tools that charge final image. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV—salt-taste language, melting-moon visual—never tourist catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.1</question><grade><comment>Dominant stake—“anchor ferry in both timelines or lose half-seen people”—is signaled by third sentence. Escalation is one continuous tightening: translucent hull → hourglass burn → grotto closing → must choose which timeline to pour. Agency drives every beat; no coincidence resolves. Visible prices: hourglass destroyed, Arden forecloses ever stepping onto a dock that remembers him; the merged ferry becomes his permanent transient home.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</question><grade><comment>Theme emerges from pattern rather than statement: transit as identity, refusal to surrender motion even when destination dissolves. Subtext lives in objects—empty hourglass filled with star-constellation reweights “empty” into vessel of possibility. Final image of brass caps in pocket that “no longer measured time” offers non-literal answer: time isn’t kept but carried. No moralizing; resonance is felt through frost-dust settling like chosen exile.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</question><grade><comment>Third-person limited clings to Arden’s sensory filter: “world tasted like salt and regret,” “radio ice-cold.” Diction stays within plausible lexicon of deckhand—“tie the next line,” “helm to auto.” Rhythmic compression under stress—hard port / two beats / steady / three—mirrors heartbeat Morse without drumbeat monotony. No head-hopping; when passengers blink awake, we see them only through Arden’s external read. Voice modulation: off-key hum swells to multiplied choir of refusal.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</question><grade><comment>Zero loops, scaffolds, or mixed metaphors. Sentences carry double duty: “moon dripped like melting silver” fuses visual and causal cue (time leakage). Opening line anchors voice and stakes simultaneously. Final line resolves by image that recharges “sideways” motif. No filter-verb stacks; strong verbs—“knitting,” “guttered,” “shuddered”—propel. Paragraph cuts are surgical; each advances choice, perception, or atmosphere. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with acceleration at grotto collapse.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</question><grade><comment>Vanishing-ferry trope is re-forged into existential commuter rescue; hourglass as timeline merger device is fresh synthesis. Barnacle constellations and heartbeat Morse steering feel inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk of dense lyricism pays off—closure image remains legible. Specificity of “Malaspina commuter ferry” roots concept in real geography, avoiding generic nowhere. Transformation test fails—story collapses if Arden is not a deckhand on a half-slip ferry. Bold structural compression (single scene, real-time merge) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
