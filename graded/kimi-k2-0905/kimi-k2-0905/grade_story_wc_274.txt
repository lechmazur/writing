<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sera’s contradictory impulses—obedient archivist vs. incendiary truth-teller—are alive in every beat; the thermal-sleeve concealment and pod re-entry are micro-choices that visibly cost her safety. The final smile under sedation crystallizes her earned stasis: she renounces personal survival to keep the archive honest. No stock phrases; even “bravely conflicted” is re-translated into bodily risk. Interiority stays concrete, never diagnostic.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal chain is immaculate: cracked seal → discovery → secret upload → city-wide scandal → re-freeze with grin. Each beat tightens options until the only exit is self-sacrifice. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the city’s sky-lit names reweight the library from tomb to cradle with undeniable social cost. No teleporting props; the dormant network is seeded early (“stolen power”) and paid off in the crawl-shaft upload.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The glass columns, falling snow, and hissing copper shaft are tactile constraint machines, not décor. Snow melting on live copper supplies both sensory immediacy and a literal short-circuit clock. The atlas-quadrant hatch orients spatial choreography; every meter crawled costs skin and time. Final red-blue-white aurora reconfigures the same snow as public spotlight—setting becomes the scandal’s projector.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—archival truth vs. civic lie—tightens once: the upload decision permanently forecloses personal safety. Escalation is causal under the Causal lens: each paragraph subtracts another option until only the pod remains. Cost is visible on-page: distant explosions and sirens translate abstract stakes into live city trauma. No coincidence; scandal is self-triggered, not discovered.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges without sermon: memory as public commons vs. curated weapon. Subtext lives in gesture—snow once burying now revealing—and in the paradox of a librarian becoming arsonist of lies. Final whispered promise to books crystallizes theme as Earned Stasis: knowledge, once thawed, cannot be re-frozen. No late moralizing; the sky itself speaks the thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is ice-fire fused: syntax alternates long frost-bitten clauses with staccato heart-drums. Diction stays within cryogenic lexicon— “permafrost,” “data veins,” “thermal sleeve”—without jargon spill. Compression taught early (“dizzying quiet”) repeats at closure, now thrumming with possibility. No head-hopping; single POV remains locked inside Sera’s frost-lidded sensorium.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm breathes with action: short sentences under crawl-shaft pressure, longer coils during reflection. No scaffold loops; each sentence adds temperature or spatial data. Metaphors (“live coal,” “distant applause”) are sparse, precise, and physically coherent. Zero typos or tense drift; punctuation clean even through experimental en-dashes and fragmented breaths.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Frozen-memory archive as active insurgent node is fresh synthesis of familiar dystopian tropes. The librarian-anarchist fusion flips the usual rebel profile; her weapon is metadata, not guns. Specificity of “dream implants” and “billboards” prevents abstract anywhere-setting. Whispered valediction to books risks sentimentality yet feels earned by prior bodily risk. Risk-taking (upload via maintenance shaft) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
