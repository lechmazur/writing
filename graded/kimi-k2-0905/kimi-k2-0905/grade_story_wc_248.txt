<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Ember’s pyromaniac/archivist contradiction is vivid, but the interiority leans on abstract labels (“volcanic tenderness,” “analytically intuitive mind”) rather than embodied contradiction in scene. The climactic self-redefinition is prepared but stated more than dramatized; we are told she is now “keeper of truth,” not shown a micro-choice that seals it. Grandmother’s off-screen whisper acts as external motivator rather than internal fracture line, blurring cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the tapestry’s re-weave is a Conceptual Repricing that flips arson from destruction to illumination, carrying felt cost as the real archive collapses behind her. Causal chain holds: each artwork chemically encodes coordinates that unlock the map—smart, taught early, paid off. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no penalty. The lens is Causal; because/therefore linkage tightens options until the final image reweights meaning.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Soot-stained walls, lavender-sulfur perfume, threads warm to touch—sensory specifics are filtered through Ember’s pyro-poetics, never catalogue. The crumbling archway and false wall guide her choices spatially; the tapestry’s evolving temperature becomes a micro-setting that signals revelation. Environment directly constrains the final act: archive collapses once fragment is taken, charging the exit with tangible cost. Some phrasing edges toward symbolic convenience (“volcanic tenderness” repeated), but detail density stays high.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover truth behind grandmother’s promise—is signaled in paragraph four and sharpened by the collapsing archive that forecloses return. Escalation is incremental but coherent: each artwork decodes a layer of map, tightening the noose of knowledge until the tapestry re-weave flips destruction into preservation. Cost is visible: the real archive is lost again in the collapse, making her new knowledge irreversible and solitary. Agency is present—she burns false libraries, descends, claims fragment—but the final beat could foreground a sharper micro-renunciation to push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—destruction as prerequisite for preservation—emerges organically from plot rather than sermon. The tapestry’s re-weave and the collapsing archive reweight the meaning of arson without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture: fingers “tracing soot-stained walls with volcanic tenderness” conflates ruin and love. Final image reframes prior fires as curatorial, achieving resonance, yet a single overt thesis sentence (“sometimes we must destroy to truly save”) slightly dilutes ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Voice is pyro-poetic, syntactically controlled: long breathy sentences mimic smoke, then compress at the reveal. Perceptual signature is consistent—heat, ash, chemical scent as primary filters. Diction stays within Ember’s visionary lexicon; no filter-verb stacks. Repetition of “volcanic tenderness” is patterned and paid off in the final clause, justifying the lyric return.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is varied; sentence openings rotate across participial, prepositional, clausal. Information density high—each sentence advances map, memory, or metaphor. Minor scaffold: “volcanic tenderness” appears thrice with diminishing returns; “burning artistic creations” vs “artistic trail” is near-paraphrase. Metaphors stay coherent (fire = knowledge), but one mixed moment—“eyes that now seemed to follow her through the darkness”—leans cliché.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Combines library-arsonist with archival cartography via chemical cipher—fresh synthesis. Vandalized self-portrait reweaving into grandmother’s face is a non-obvious reversal that feels inevitable after the chemical-map setup. Risky lyric intensification heightens stakes without clutter. Could edge higher if the grandmother’s torch were seeded as chemical-flame earlier, but the concept remains memorable.</comment>
