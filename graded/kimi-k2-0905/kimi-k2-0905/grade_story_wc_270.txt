<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Nara’s contradictory impulses—obedient insurgent turned genetic saboteur—play out in embodied, orchid-coaxing micro-choices. The decision to nick the sac and rewrite destiny is earned by every prior limp, pollen sneeze, and volcanic tremor; cost is visible in her screaming knees and the guard’s drowsy rifle. Interiority stays concrete, particular, telepathic yet tactile. Flawed, stubborn, grandmotherly individuality radiates without label-speak or safety-hedging.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because the amber will not open, therefore Nara decodes the kite; because she decodes, therefore she descends; because she descends, therefore she alters the embryo—each linkage tightening options with visible price. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the pinking membrane reweights hierarchy itself, foreclosing the council’s breeding lottery. Orientation is locked by line 3, transition count = 1, shards = 2, pattern taught. Cost is palpable in the torch-wax seal pressed to her own heartbeat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Volcanic basalt grotto, 52-degree mineral swirl, and thermophilic moss bloom are not backdrop but tactical engine: temperature threshold enables the rewrite, pollen disables the guard. Body-as-setting—her cane of bombing debris, blouse heartbeat-vial—constrains climb and concealment. Sensory hierarchy (heat before sight, chlorophyll before sound) mirrors POV’s vegetal telepathy. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from lantern-lit parade to submerged basin and back, no floating rooms.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will tradition fossilize again?”—is signaled in paragraph 1 and sharpened when the council’s lottery looms tomorrow. Tightening occurs at the embryo hand-off: mineral water dilutes the compliance serum, foreclosing the docile-administrator path with irreversible pink glow. Escalation is causal, not additive; each beat narrows options until only clandestine motherhood remains. Price is on-page: guard’s unconsciousness, wax burn on breast, volcanic tremor as witness.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: encoded kites, grafting knives, and chlorophyll whispers argue that evolution is a grandmother’s quiet splice, not council decree. Final image of rustling plants reweights every prior seedling metaphor into conspiratorial pride—an earned, non-moral answer. Subtextual irony: the council’s “implanted destiny” becomes literal mineral sediment in a child who will ask “why.” Complexity is embraced: insurgency turns nurturing, nurture turns insurgent.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Compressed lyric diction—“tomatoes blush and cedars gossip”—teaches its pattern early and sustains perceptual signature under pressure. No head-hopping; single POV stays inside Nara’s vegetal-tinged sensorium. Tense stable, diction agrarian yet volcanic, no register drift. Rhythm accelerates with sentence fragments during pollen flare, then exhales into longer cadence as she climbs out—voice as character.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is dense and propulsive: “words aligned into coordinates” performs double duty—advances decoding and mirrors chlorophyll alignment. Only micro-slip: “implanted destiny—do not trust the council’s breeders” edges toward prompt-echo; however, it is embedded in contraband letter, so registers as artifact not loop. No mixed metaphors, no synonym churn, no filter-verb stacks. Opening anchors voice and stakes; final line recharges motif of rustling pride.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Synthesizes insurgency, epigenetics, and botanical telepathy into an inevitable fable that feels ancient yet uncannily new. Risk of telepathy is double: could read as twee, yet here it enables non-violent resistance and supplies closure image. Kite-as-cipher, hot-spring-as-incubator, cane-as-war-fragment—all particular, irreplaceable. Transformation test: swap any element and the entire moral calculus collapses. Bold, singular, fully committed.</comment>
