<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara’s reverse-aging physiology and Marcus’s desperation are vivid, but the interior contradiction between her need to teach and her inevitable erasure is told more than embodied; the final fade lacks a micro-choice that costs her something we can feel.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: withheld knowledge → stone drop → ripple images → Marcus sees his own reversal → Elara vanishes. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing that reweights existence itself; the price is legible in Marcus’s recognition that he too will disappear. One transition, single scene, orientation anchored by line 3.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Magnetic grotto hum and starlit sycamore canopy create a tactile micro-world; the floating rock platform constrains movement and the stone-as-tool reappears to charge the final image. Selective sensory triage—iron in blood, hush of leaves—keeps density high.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can Marcus receive the lesson before Elara ages out of reach? Pressure tightens as each ripple shortens her voice; the final ring forecloses his option to remain merely observer and forces acceptance of the same vanishing. Cost is conceptual but undeniable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through image, not statement: existence is circular, vanishing is return. The withheld truth reframes all prior academic “truth” as gentle deception, a kindness that lets the lesson arrive only when the student is ready. No moralizing—resonance lingers in the empty stone.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyric third-person hovers close to Elara’s perceptual filter—silvering hair toward childhood, voice pitching up—then widens to Marcus’s stunned comprehension. Rhythm modulates from incantatory listing of rings to the hushed single sentence of her disappearance. No head-hop, no filter clutter.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and cadence; figurative language is spare and tethered to physics of water and magnetism. One paraphrase loop (“through the trance… through the patterns”) costs −0.2. Otherwise clean, propulsive, no mixed metaphors.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Reverse entropy as pedagogy feels fresh; the ripple-as-data-channel literalizes “teaching by vanishing.” Risky circular structure lands because the stone’s return to hand reconfigures the premise rather than repeating it. Specificity of iron-in-blood magnetic tug keeps the concept embodied.</comment>
