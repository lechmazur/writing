<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mireya’s contradictory hunger—private yet communal—drives every beat: she bargains an unnamed memory for the horizon shot, steps into tide despite hollowness, and accepts palette-cracking saturation as fair price. The cipher’s inscription across her veins is the earned cost that forecloses any return to prior silence, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each painted contrail layers density until the shutter inhale reprograms the coral shelves, a Conceptual Repricing that makes the archipelago’s erased voices audible forever. The movable horizon as shy animal is taught early; its capture extracts an unnameable memory, paying visible cost inside the final image of the paper-boat mobile now circulate-loaned to patrons.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Coral shelves that hum when loss is sensed, shell-pages that glimmer when greeted, and the sunrise-darkroom that develops the sky itself all constrain tactics and charge the final image. The palette’s mending with dawn-gold literalizes setting-as-tool, passing the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover the runaway dream cipher—tightens when each snap inhales a ribbon of painted light, thinning the air until lighthouses rearrange; the cost is the palette’s crack and her skin’s saturation, a visible price that alters tactics. Under the accumulative lens, density escalation is driven by her agency, not coincidence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Longing is encoded not in abstraction but in salt, star-ground pigment, and the library’s coral heartbeat; the final image of patrons checking out a cold-fire paper boat to remember an unlived yet vital absence reweights the premise without moralizing. Theme emerges from the lattice of particulars, culminating in conceptual repricing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyric, compressed diction—“tides rehearse new syllables,” “heat lightning outlining invisible things”—teaches its pattern by line 3 and holds to the cathedral-of-salt click. Perceptual signature remains stable under pressure; no head-hopping or register drift; rhythmic control heightens the snap beat without obscuring causality.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sentences perform double duty: “she greeted them and waited” both characterizes and activates the shell-pages. Mixed metaphors are avoided; “lighthouses flickered, rearranged” is precise; no loops, scaffold, or filler stacks; high density with propulsion intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The whispering library that shelves silence instead of books, star-ground watercolor that paints light rather than paper, and a horizon traded for an unnameable memory synthesize into an inevitable yet non-obvious whole. Risky lyric compression heightens rather than obscures stakes; the final conceptual repricing feels freshly minted.</comment>
