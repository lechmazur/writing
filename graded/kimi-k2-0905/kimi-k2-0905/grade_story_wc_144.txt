<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lira’s embodied blindness and tactile expertise are vivid; her “magnetic calm” under deadline pressure feels earned. The micro-choice to use water ripples to retrain the drone’s gyro is character-specific and stakes her reputation. Col remains a functional helper rather than a crucible, so relationship pressure is thin. Still, her final silent release of the drone carries visible cost—she forfeits tactile confirmation of success.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal chain is tight: cracked wing → battery swell → spectrum diagnosis → water retraining → launch. Closure is a Decisive Change: drone departs, village antidotes now possible, Lira’s method validated. Anchor lifts at seven-minute countdown supplies a hard external clock; orientation is clear by word 60. One minor causality fuzz: how the rain-barrel light pattern actually rewrites the drone’s feedback loop is asserted rather than shown, but the emotional logic holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The depot’s hiss, glass drippers, and kiln heat are filtered through touch and sound, giving blind POV authority. Micro-setting—the drone’s wing as refractive surface—directly enables the repair and final calibration. Mist, steam, and sea breeze evolve with the action, tracking time to sailing. Spatial choreography never drifts; every tool and body position is traceable.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—medical seeds must sail—locks in first paragraph and tightens with the horn. Escalation is causal: each spectrum reading narrows options, battery swell adds jeopardy, clock drops to seven minutes. Lira’s agency drives every turn; no coincidences rescue her. Cost is felt: she risks sending a still-jittery drone, her reputation and villagers’ lives on the line.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of “translating damage into direction” emerges through refracted light and retrained flight, never stated. Subtext lives in gesture: Lira’s palms floating above the trembling drone mirror its panic. Final image—drone as “artificial star”—reweights the premise: blindness can still pilot light. No moralizing, only embodied resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays glued to Lira’s tactile perception; no head-hop. Syntax lengthens under calm, shortens during test pulse, mirroring heartbeat. Col’s two spoken lines carry apprentice deference; Lira’s commands are clipped, professional. Refractive vocabulary (“copper bleeding into violet”) remains within POV’s trained lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “molten silica drawn from her kiln” does triple duty—material, heat, skill. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or causality. Metaphors are coherent: “iron filings sliding into perfect order” sustains magnetic calm motif. One near-mixed image—“oceanic horn”—but context salvages it.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Blind artisan who reads fractures through water prisms is fresh; steampunk-medical courier angle avoids cliché. The rain-barrel retraining turn feels inevitable yet non-obvious, growing from established light logic. Risk taken: no villain, only internal tech panic, yet tension holds. Specificity of lumen-veins and spectra prevents generic “broken machine” trope.</comment>
