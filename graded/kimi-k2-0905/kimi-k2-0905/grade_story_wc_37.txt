<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The keeper’s amnesia and gradual self-reclamation drive every beat; her choice to drive shards into her ribs crystallizes identity under pain. Interiority stays embodied—“memories flutter like moths,” “sting of remembered joy”—without label-speak. The final refusal to speak her name is an earned renunciation that costs her mystery, capping growth. Micro-choices (press mica, exhale lullaby, alter song) consistently reveal value hierarchy: realm > self > pain.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the keeper’s blood-mica lens reframes the mirror world’s problem as mutual reflection failure, then her canon invitation reweights the rules—cost is the shattered window and scarred ribs. Causal chain holds: lullaby → orchard answers → chorus invitation → dawn erupts. Orientation is taught early—mirror greenhouse, night, mica tool—all anchor by line 4. Single-scene default met; transition unnecessary. No lens ambiguity; final image of “fields that remembered color” reconfigures meaning with felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Alchemical orchard is lived-in: alembic roots, phosphor smears, clockwork seeds—details constrain tactics (songs must be sung to tick backward fruit). Micro-setting body/tool rule satisfied: mica window evolves from palm pane to blood-fused lens, directly enabling final revaluation. Sensory hierarchy skews tactile/auditory—chiming pomegranates, tin-foil leaves—mirrors keeper’s synesthesia under pressure. Spatial choreography clean: aisle walk, branch brush, pane slam track without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—revive dying realm—signaled paragraph 1; tightening occurs when silence severs the dawn-loom, forcing keeper to shift lullaby → invitation canon. Escalation causal: each sung verse tightens weave → night counterattacks → keeper pays with rib shards, narrowing options to singular coherence. Cost is visible blood and crumbling tool; price alters tactics (must use own body as lens). No coincidence; all pressure generated by her sonic choices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges inductively: collective amnesia healed only when mirrors reflect each other’s song—no explicit thesis. Subtext in silent silhouettes’ open mouths conveys regret without statement. Final image of “communities gathered…in rehearsal” reweights early silence into ongoing praxis. Resists moral; ambiguity lingers in keeper’s unsaid name, implying vigilance is perpetual.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyric omniscient voice sustains fairytale distance yet stays filter-tight through keeper’s perceptual lens—“reflections ripened into realities.” Syntax flexes with pressure: long breathless sentences during weave, fragments at rib slam. No dialogue, so voice must carry texture; does via coined compounds (“quicksilver dreams,” “tarry vines”). No head-hopping; reflections remain external until keeper re-names herself. Diction stays elemental/mineral, consistent with mica-and-mercury world.</question>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
Comment>Rhythm varies: cumulative anaphora (“each dawn…each repeated line”) mimics loom, then staccato “She slammed” breaks it. Information dense—one sentence can world-build, advance plot, and embody emotion: “fruits split to reveal clockwork seeds ticking backward.” No scaffold loops; no mixed metaphors. Minor overwriting in two adjacent “woven” phrases mid-story (−0.2) but does not touch closure. Final line earns cadence release: “dawns that no night could smother again.”

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
Comment>Mirrors-as-song-refusal is fresh synthesis of familiar trope; inversion orchard inverted again via mica lens delivers non-obvious reconfiguration. Specificity grounds novelty—coriander-scented lullaby, tin-foil leaves—preventing abstract allegory. Risk taken with lyric compression pays off: reader must assemble causality, but pattern taught early enough. Transformation test fails if swapped to generic fantasy: mineral lens, song-as-loom, rib-blood optics are irreplaceable.</comment>
