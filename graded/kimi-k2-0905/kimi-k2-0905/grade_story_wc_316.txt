<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara/Zero’s shared origo is vividly particularized through the ego-death hollowing and the violet-taste memory; the synthesis woman’s final tear carries visible cost. Interior contradiction is shown, not told: her hand trembles while her psyche is hollow, and the later synesthetic child echoes both. Motivation pivots on the paradoxical creed and the custodial ritual, not external plot puppetry. The only drag is a slight over-articulation of “emotional numbness” twice; otherwise embodiment is strong.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the merged guardian steps onto new earth with felt grief-joy-terror, brain-fire metronome inside chest—undeniable conceptual cost. Causal lattice holds: each history-rewrite shrinks options until the pour-out choice forecloses dual survival. Drive lens is Hybrid—accumulative lyric texture with situational ritual pressure—taught by the second line and coherent at end. One micro ambiguity: “legal guardian” letter appears before we know whose law matters, but the ritual quickly re-anchors.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The floating rock dojo, jar-fluid sunrise glow, and bamboo creaks constrain every move; the brain-as-micro-setting literally steers the custody outcome. Sensory hierarchy skews synesthetic—color is tasted, silence weighs—mirroring ego-death perceptual warp. Spatial choreography is immaculate: blade between them, hands joined, fluid poured over skin, cloud dissolution. No generic placeholders; even “rewritten Pacific” is re-anchored by the crèche’s solid earth after the fall.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—who parents the clone—tightens through ritual rounds that each erase one future self. Pressure escalates by knowledge: each confession makes the brain blaze brighter, vivifying nerves until refusal-to-lose becomes impossible. Zero’s faltered silence is the visible price that crystallizes the stakes. The final rewrite wave is coincidence that complicates, not rescues; the fusion choice is agency-driven with irreversible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the paradox “only by holding the opposite do we become real,” embodied in the synthesis woman and the child’s untranslatable word. No moralizing; the final image reweights all prior splits into one footprint already fading. Subtext lives in gesture—tremor in Zero’s wrist, violet pulse of brain—never thesis. The untranslatable word itself is the Conceptual Repricing, refusing tidy explication yet charging the whole.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyric-lean, compressive, patterned: “history rewrote itself for the seventh time that week” teaches the cadence early. Metaphors stay sensory-anchored (“pale jellyfish,” “struck crystal”) without purple drift. Syntax modulates: short declaratives under blade tension, longer coils during memory pours. No head-hop; focalization glides from Mara → Zero → merged observer without leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: paragraph lengths breathe from one-line punches to sinuous memory coils. Sentence openings avoid monotony; no template cadence detected. Figurative density spikes only at ritual beats where the pattern justifies it—no clutter in closure beat. One micro-loop: “slicing through pretense” appears twice; the second use is earned callback, not scaffold, so minor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The clone-custody-via-brain-jar ritual is a fresh hinge on the old “which self survives” trope; synesthetic child payoff is unforeseeable yet inevitable. Risk taken: merging two POVs into one body could read gimmick, but here it is the only path that satisfies the paradox creed. History-rewrite as live clock is genre-subverted into intimate stakes. Specificity—“tasting color,” “struck crystal”—prevents abstract drift.</comment>
