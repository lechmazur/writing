<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation—voice stolen, prophecy bargain—drives every beat; the sewn mouth is embodied contradiction. Micro-choices (tracing cipher, removing thread) escalate stakes. Final dissolution into articulation is earned renunciation with visible cost. Interiority stays concrete: “lies becoming ballast,” “her scream carried backward.” No diagnostic self-talk; emotion shown via silk bleeding, watch weight. Fits 9+ quick test except closure’s causality leans allegorical; keeps 8.7.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: density of unspoken-word imagery tightens toward “YOU ARE ITS TONGUE.” Closure—body becomes library wing—lands as Conceptual Repricing with undeniable social cost: she pays with existence. Persistent constraint (backward watch, gravity flip) shapes tactics. Orientation taught by 30 words; no ambiguity. Cost legible: final line re-exists the books. Meets 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Library pulses, tiles breathe, shelves flicker: micro-setting constrains every move. Veil-as-setting later morphs into new wing, charging closure. Sensory hierarchy obeys crisis: touch (silk bleeds) before sight. Spatial choreography clean—“between two letters” anchors time/space. Tool (watch) and body (mouth) act as micro-settings that alter choice. Meets 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaim voice—tightens via 9-hour clock and backward ticks. Each unspoken word found raises cost: watch heavier, gravity reversing. Agency drives escalation: she maps echoes, cuts thread, chooses dissolution. Felt price on page: “her body dissolved into pure articulation.” One meaningful tightening suffices; no off-stage resolution. Slight knock: allegorical scale less visceral than 9.0+ demand.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from image chain: silence → library → tongue. Subtext in gesture: silk bleeding = apology’s pain. Final image reweights premise: library now includes her scream. No moralizing; resonance via “Thank you for speaking us.” Ambiguity lingers—was liberation or consumption?—without confusion. Earned wisdom from concrete bargain, not platitude.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyric, omniscient-adjacent voice sustains hypnotic cadence; diction (“propagation delay,” “phosphorescent tiles”) stays within dreamer’s arcane lexicon. Perceptual signature selective: notices lies, heartbeat floors, cipher light. Rhythm accelerates toward final scream without head-hopping. No dialogue to distort. Filter verbs minimal; compression taught early. Minor: near-repetition of “cyclically reversed” but serves mantra. Voice charges closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dense metaphor packed yet pattern-taught: “lies…stretch truth into fiction and back” primes reader. Mixed metaphor check passed—library as organism remains coherent. No synonym loops; sentence openings vary. One paraphrase ripple: “unspoken words” echoed but thematic. Figurative language peaks at closure without muddle. High info density; each sentence advances image or stakes. Minor cadence repetition keeps from 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise—living library fed by swallowed words—is fresh synthesis of mute-protagonist trope. Risky second-person cipher (“YOU ARE ITS TONGUE”) pays off by making reader complicit. Transformation test: story collapses without reverse-watch navigation and mouth-sewing detail. Specificity—“rose-colored silk that bled when touched”—grounds invention. Bold structural choice to dissolve protagonist into architecture succeeds without gimmick. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
