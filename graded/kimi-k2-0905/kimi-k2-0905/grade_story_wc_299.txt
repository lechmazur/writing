<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mason’s contradictory impulses—clinging to past glory while craving new legitimacy—play out in embodied micro-choices (patching the mic, speaking the set-list). The final shift from souvenir hoarder to community listener is earned by the quarry echo that costs him his isolating nostalgia. Interiority stays concrete, avoiding label-speak even at peak beat. One notch off because the foreman’s entrance is slightly too convenient as relationship crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each beat (bugle humiliation → deposit return → Polaroid → mic repair → quarry broadcast) tightens options because/therefore. Closure lands as Decisive Change: he forfeits solitary appraisal for communal archiving, cost legible in the grille cloth now “part of something larger.” Orientation is anchored by word 60; no teleporting props. One hairline slip: the taped envelope feels slightly engineered, not strictly因果.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Quarry bowl, diesel stink, and the torn mic grille act as micro-setting that constrains the final repair and broadcast. Sensory selection filters through Mason’s roadie priorities—sound, voltage, copper wire—never tourist-catalog. The starlit water reflection reweights the earlier “hollowness” image, passing the 9+ gate. Only the courthouse steps remain a vague sketch, keeping it just sub-9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“can he still make sound matter after public shame?”—tightens when the bugle failure costs his contract, then deepens when the Polaroid dangles a new audience. Agency drives escalation: he chooses to test the patched mic publicly, risking further ridicule. The quarry’s natural delay forecloses retreat, forcing stance crystallization. Cost is visible (deposit cheque foregone, nostalgia repurposed), but the foreman’s instant job offer slightly blunts the price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: salvaging beauty from residual noise. The grille cloth migrates from souvenir to membrane without thematic announcement. Final image—echo valley returning his words—offers a non-literal answer to “where is the applause now?” No moralizing, only charged poise. A fractional deduction for the phrase “purpose aligns with breath” edging toward abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice carries a roadie’s sonic lexicon—“+52 volts, signal return, safety earth”—woven into rhythmic, varied syntax. Perceptual signature is consistent: he notices distortion, delay, copper sheen. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens intelligently under pressure. Compression like “confidently uncertain” is taught by context and paid off at the mic test.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet musical, sentences doing double duty (action + atmosphere). No scaffold loops or synonym churn; figurative language is sparse and precise. The one mixed metaphor—“vacuum it left, a hollowness”—is minor and early. Closure beat stays crystal, allowing high-band entry.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fusing antiques authentication with rock-roadie residue feels fresh; the patched microphone as archive tool is a specific, non-obvious synthesis. The quarry turned echo chamber reconfigures a familiar redemption arc without gimmick. Risk is moderate but coherent. Could push higher if the Civil War bugle fake-out had echoed later in the closure.</comment>
