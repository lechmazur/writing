<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The mapkeeper’s silence-craft and memory-preservation motive are vivid and embodied; her tactile micro-choices (ice augury, stone-knotting) show a hierarchy of values under pressure. Interiority stays concrete, but the apprentice remains a functional echo rather than a crucible, so the relationship axis is under-used. The final renunciation—“We were here”—lands as earned stasis because every swallowed word has been dramatized as cargo. Still, Jalen’s absence of interiority keeps the dyad from becoming a true relational furnace.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the released sigh reweights silence from survival tool into legacy medium, cost paid by the cracked stone and the unknowable future. Causal chain holds: ice reading → circle scored → beings folded → map left → words released. Orientation is anchored by word 70 (“echo chamber stone”), well inside the 120-word window. One transition (Mirror Pool → Abyssal Gate) is legible; mosaic pattern is not needed. Lens is Causal throughout; no late ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Harmonic caves function as pressure system: breathing too hard chimes stalactites, silence becomes tactical. The echo chamber stone and ice shard act as micro-settings that constrain every gesture. “Gently luminous” lichen and mineral lace are selective, never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is clean across the bridge and dome; no impossible positions. Environment directly shapes the final image—stone cracked open on the altar of quiet—so the 9+ gate is met.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“carry the last map out alive”—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightens when the circle reading shows only one hour. The scored circle is a decisive, irreversible act that forecloses sound travel; price is the stone’s destruction and the mapkeeper’s self-exile from future voice. Agency is continuous: she scores, Jalen sprinkles, both wager death. No coincidence resolves; the beings’ dimming is direct consequence of the silence fracture. Cost is visible in the cracked relic and the unknowable reception of the sigh.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges as memory vs. erasure: stories persist only if silence can be weaponized against devourers of sound. The bloom of hush shifts from tactical window to sacred offering, reweighting silence from absence to artifact. No moral is stated; the final image of wordless meaning flowing forward is a non-literal answer. Subtext operates in gesture—pressing stone to lips, knotting moon-moth silk—rather than exposition. Complexity lingers: survival demanded silence, yet legacy demands release, leaving an ambiguous future.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited clings to the mapkeeper’s perceptual signature: she “reads futures in frozen fractures,” notices cadence of reckless whispers, projects silence as glass bubble. Syntax lengthens under stillness, shortens under threat; diction stays within her artisan lexicon. No head-hopping; Jalen’s interiority is withheld, consistent with her guarded stance. Compressed lyricism (“hammered repose,” “fossilized chords”) is pattern-taught early and paid off at climax without obscuring causality.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty: “She lifted a shard of ice newly formed, tilting it toward a gently luminous lichen lantern, and began the augury” advances action, setting, and stakes. Rhythm modulates from long breathy clauses to staccato peril without drumbeat monotony. Mixed metaphors are avoided; “bloom of hush” is singular controlling image. One scaffold trace: “footsteps, soft as hammered repose” is immediately repeated in the climax; because the phrase is motif-central, the echo reads intentional rather than loop artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise flips the trope of sound-as-life: here silence is cultivated seed, sound is predator. Ice-fracture cartography and echo-absorbing stone are fresh world-logic that constrain every beat. The Warden fused into fossilized chords transforms guardian archetype into living casualty. Risky lyric density pays off because causality stays legible. Final reconfiguration—stories released as wordless sigh—feels inevitable yet non-obvious, a synthesis of prior particulars rather than twist for twist’s sake.</comment>
