<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maris’s interiority is vivid—her bones “humming,” the fingerprint “smelling of glacier wind”—and her micro-choice to release the flower drains memory with felt cost. The double who “mimed with a half-second delay” externalizes her split without diagnostic speak. Yet the stranger remains a cipher: his collapse imports death but gives no reciprocal pressure, so her motivation to “decode” him is abstract, not a crucible. Still, the earned renunciation and the cleaner isolation that follows qualify for high-band even if the relational axis is thin.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: releasing the Edelweiss repays the debt, gulls and ferry sounds return, reflection syncs—undeniable cost on the page. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each “gap” observation layers density until the final cadence shift reweights isolation into cleansed solitude. Orientation is swift—opal dock, nautical twilight, stranger’s collapse within 60 words. One hiccup: the handwriting entry “He gives the flower…” feels like a retroactive patch rather than a taught pattern, but it pays off in the loop, so the flaw is cosmetic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The mist “catches the light like milk stirred with silver” and the lighthouse beam refracts through it, constraining Maris’s ability to verify gaps; environment directly shapes tactics. The spiral stairs swallowed by fog make each step “erased,” turning setting into temporal erasure device. Micro-setting—the dried petals pinned beside the logbook—functions as forensic anchor. Spatial choreography tracks clean from dock to shed to tower to balcony; no floating rooms.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: break the memory-debt cycle or remain its custodian. Pressure tightens when each lens rotation “spins the debt tighter,” foreclosing the option to keep the flower. Releasing it costs slices of personal recollection—visible price that alters her interior ledger. The escalation is single-cycle but sufficient for 700-word scope; the stranger’s lack of on-page resistance keeps it from the top band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through image pattern: memory as currency, lighthouse as keeper of what the sea forgets. Subtext operates in silence—absent gulls, missing horn—rather than exposition. The final image of the dock as “a closed eye that had finally dreamed the same dream as the light” offers non-literal repricing of isolation into mutual witness. No moral is stated; the cycle is paid, not explained.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is consistent: maritime sensory hierarchy—salt, tide-slap, fog swallowing iron—filtered through a keeper trained to “read absences.” Syntax lengthens under contemplation then compresses during the release: “she released the dried Edelweiss; the tide accepted it…” Rhythm mirrors lens rotation. No head-hopping; the stranger’s interior is never ventriloquized. Compressed lyric diction (“borrowed memories of alpine sun”) stays within Maris’s plausible poetic lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences advance atmosphere, stakes, and sensory layering simultaneously. No paraphrase loops; each metaphor extends rather than restates (“petals like borrowed memories… petals loosening into tiny rafts”). One mixed vehicle: “fog hums in a bell” stretches auditory metaphor, but the pattern is taught early and recurs without clutter. Filter verbs are minimal; strong verbs dominate (“slapped,” “pinned,” “swept”). Clean grammar and tense stability throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Freshest synthesis: memory-interest paid to a lighthouse—a keeper obligated to erase herself to keep the sea’s ledger straight. The Edelweiss/alpine/sun fragment motif transforms from alpine souvenir to mnemonic currency to dissolution raft—inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric compression succeeds because pattern is taught immediately (“brittle bloom… borrowed memories”). Not a retread of “keeper sees ghost” trope; the loop is transactional, not sentimental.</comment>
