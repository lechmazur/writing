<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Voss’s gentleness is credibly embodied—he cradles corpses, refuses to demand forgiveness—yet the interiority sometimes drifts into abstract self-diagnosis (“he understood the ritual demanded more”) that flattens the peak beat. The clipboard-cradle transformation is earned, but the chorus of arriving mourners is observed more than chosen, so the shared burden feels bestowed rather than seized. Still, his trembling hands and cracked syllables give visceral cost to the name-recital, satisfying the 9- gate for embodied contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the clipboard’s shattering disperses memory into shared aurora-light, making peace a practice rather than a treaty. Causality holds under Accumulative lens—each offering layers density until the altar becomes cairn—though the arrival of enemies relies on ritual “pull” rather than prior motivation. Cost is legible in Voss’s empty hands and the terrace’s erosion, meeting the 9- test, yet a slight causal fuzz at the crowd’s ascent keeps it just below the excellence tier.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The terrace’s obsidian-silver vasculature literally drinks starlight and mirrors the war below, constraining Voss’s choice to burn versus release the treaty. Micro-setting (clipboard, altar stone, feather-scale-lily triad) doubles as ritual technology, guiding every beat of offering and reconstitution. Spatial choreography stays clean across the climb and dispersal, fulfilling the 9+ gate for environment-as-constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—memorializing the dead without erasure—tightens when Voss shifts from burning to naming, a reversible micro-turn that escalates emotional cost under Accumulative lens. No external antagonist is needed; pressure accrues via each name spoken and fragment placed, foreclosing the option of forgetting. Price is visible in cracked voice and crumbling terrace, meeting 8-band criteria, though the crowd’s unanimity softens the final pinch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through ritual images—clipboard becomes cradle, treaty becomes constellation—never sermonizing. “Flawed beauty” is dramatized by lily dipped in starlight, its imperfection accepted rather than fixed. Final image reweights peace as daily gardening, not victory, achieving non-literal resonance without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person lyric achieves perceptual signature: “obsidian drinking in the starlight” filters cosmos through geological gaze. Rhythm swells and breathes with name-recital cadence, no head-hopping. Compression (“he spoke the names, one by one…”) is taught early and paid off in auroral dispersal.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High information density: each sentence layers ritual, sensory, and emotional work without scaffold. Figurative language is patterned (starlight, vein, cradle) and avoids density penalty. Minor loop risk in “every scream, every surrender, every silent death” is offset by cumulative litany effect, so artifacts do not touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Elevates familiar post-war memorial trope via blood-ink treaty on lily petals and clipboard-cradle transmutation. Ritual mechanics are concrete rather than symbolic garnish. Fresh angle: peace as shared scar-tending rather than treaty-signing, though cosmic backdrop edges toward archetype.</comment>
