<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s indexing obsession drives every beat; her tactile re-ordering of bruised cards is embodied, urgent, and stakes her body in rising water. Interiority stays concrete—“the mark listened to her pulse and found it wanting”—without label-speak. The final decision to remember is earned by prior discoveries and costs her the safety of official history. No secondary character on page, so crucible and status dynamics N/A; head-count clarity maintained.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the glyph’s inversion rewrites the catalogue and the city’s origin myth with undeniable social cost—citizens must confront dry-earth truth. Causal chain holds: blackout → stamp legible → bruise pattern → glyph = pre-submergence map → new index column. Lens is Causal; every beat tightens options until the final reframing. Cost is legible in “private pressure keeping the false history at bay.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Flooded library is rendered through lived motion—ankle-deep seawater, kelp forests, bobbing parchment—anchoring who/where/when by sentence two. The brass stamp functions as micro-setting: its rubber face and mahogany mount constrain handling and final phosphorescent reveal. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly as Mara wades, sets lantern, kneels, exits. Final image of water streaming from her coat recharges the submerged-city motif with new knowledge.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth of the city’s erased land-dwelling past—signals early and escalates as each bruised card narrows her path to silence or speech. One decisive tightening: extinguishing the lantern forces the glyph’s phosphorescent reveal, making darkness the price of knowledge. Agency is continuous: every re-ordering is her choice, paid in rising water and fading wrist mark. Cost is visible on page—“private pressure keeping the false history at bay.”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges via缄默的纸卡和顽固的墨水：knowledge = what power erases, resistance = re-stamping absence into speech. No overt thesis; insight crystallizes when glyph mirrors dry street grid, reweighting “aquatic always” myth. Final image of wrist mark “warm—tranquilly perceptive” offers resonant, non-literal answer: memory lives in bodily cost, not data. Complexity preserved—citizens may still choose delusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Mara’s perceptual filter—narrowed lantern cone, fingertip braille of indentations, neural static in blackout. Syntax lengthens underwater: “water dripping from chandeliers like slow applause,” then compresses at climax: “She extinguished the lantern.” No dialogue, so naturalism N/A. Diction remains within her cataloguer lexicon—taxonomy, fibre, ledger—without academic drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density: single sentences layer action, sensory detail, and conceptual weight—“She pressed the stamp against the water’s surface; phosphorescent plankton briefly outlined the glyph.” No loops or scaffold; metaphors are coherent—blackout as “held breath,” applause-like drips. Rhythm accelerates toward blackout extinguishing, then breathes out with lantern relight. Clean grammar, tense stable, pronouns unambiguous.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: submerged librarian re-indexing erased city with bruised card taxonomy is not a trope template. Glyph = inverse city map twist grows organically from stamp’s rubber face and blackout-induced bioluminescence. Risk of absolute darkness scene pays off with sensory flip to sound/touch. Specificity—bronze drawers bolted to marble, algae tubes—grounds premise in tactile reality rather than gimmick.</comment>
