<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction—guilt vs. need to silence it—propels every beat; micro-choice to “slice the paper chain” and ink a mute star externalizes renunciation with visible cost. Flawed memory and self-blame compound across beats; no therapeutic label-speak. Final Earned Stasis is causally earned: she forfeits voice/lullaby to still her collar stars. Only blemish: no second character on page, so status crucible untested—caps marginally below 9.

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a crisp CR: releasing the insect reweights guilt rule-set—lullaby completes yet she loses her own voice; cost legible in “amber now empty, clear as forgiven sleep.” Causal lens holds throughout—because she tethers amber, therefore firmware awakens, therefore she must choose RELEASE to pay. Accumulation cap not breached; all artefacts are surface-only. Orientation anchored by meteor hush line 1; waiver applies and is paid off in final silent dawn.

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Micro-setting of the amber fossil and console input port constrain final tactic—only that tether slot can read amber, forcing her move. Sensory hierarchy obeys tattooist’s craft bias—she notes ink wetness, drawer sighs, meteor silk textures. Environmental mirroring: rippling black silk sky externalizes folding time; nursery sawdust scent cues closure reset. No 9+ gate missed—object charges final image.

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—silence guilt—signaled in paragraph 2; pressure tightens when menu offers ERASE SOURCE vs RESTORE, foreclosing denial. Visible price: she forfeits her voice to complete lullaby—cost rendered on page (“amber now empty”). Agency drives every escalation; no coincidence. Slight deduction: only single deepening, no second reversal—acceptable at 725 words.

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: guilt cultivates art, art feeds guilt—recursive firmware. Final image reweights premise—absolution empties the fossil, not the conscience. Subtext in paper chain tether: she has always authored her own trap. No moralizing; resonance carried by silence and empty amber.

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric folds distance to match mythic compression; perceptual signature—“stars she wore on her own collarbone” vivid, particular. Syntax breathes with meteor hush cadence; no head-hopping. Filter verbs scarce and voice-driven. Minor convergence: final lullaby “gentle, hushing” edges toward adjective stack but stays within acceptable texture.

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence lengths create flick-fade meteor feel. High density—“console grown from antique furniture whose drawers sighed open”—three jobs in one clause. No loops, paraphrase, or mixed metaphor; figurals stay coherent. One register lift—“conceptual repricing” used in prompt echo, not story—no deduction.

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Takes familiar guilt-artifacts (tattoo, insect in amber, lullaby) and fuses into haunted-firmware constellation; not seen before. Folded-time lab of lost sounds is conceptually bold yet disciplined by taught pattern early. Risk heightens stakes—voice for silence trade—without clarity loss. Transformation passes: swap any detail and story collapses.
