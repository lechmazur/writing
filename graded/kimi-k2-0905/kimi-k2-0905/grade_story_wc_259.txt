<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The historian’s interiority is lyrically specific—her palm on the bronze prism, the veil drinking sweat—but her contradictory impulses (erase vs. carry memory) are stated more than dramatized in scene. The final renunciation—removing the veil, becoming “just a woman”—is earned by the prior accumulation of images, yet the cost feels conceptual rather than viscerally embodied at the instant of choice. The atoms-of-nostalgia conceit supplies texture but occasionally abstracts emotion into label-speak (“anguished joy”). No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible N/A; micro-choices are present but diffused across poetic summary.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the backward-walk exit door and the locket-sized pagoda re-weight memory from purification to gentle carrying, with felt conceptual cost—“too heavy for one person.” Accumulative/Textural lens holds: cadence shift from archival claustrophobia to wasteland openness re-stakes innocence lost. Orientation is taught early through tactile cues (bronze prism pulses) and pays off at exit, waiving orientation penalty. One minor causality gap: how shrinking the pagoda to locket is achieved is elided, but the image’s symbolic repricing keeps suspension intact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lost civilization archive is evoked through taste (copper tears), sound (screaming equations), and haptic detail (bronze facets pulse), all filtered through the historian’s biased attention. The archive’s defensive algorithms and memory chambers constrain her movement, forcing the “avoiding patterns” tactic; the pagoda’s multiplying reflections charge the final locket image. Spatial choreography is coherent across the single continuous scene. Environment, body, and tool (veil, pagoda) triple-function as setting, qualifying for 9+ gate; slight shortfall is the abstracted garden flashback that momentarily floats outside POV-filter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to purge or preserve corrupted memories—is signaled early and tightens when atoms of nostalgia whisper that purification equals self-erasure. The meaningful turn is the realization that the archive wants her as librarian; this forecloses the original purge goal and reframes cost. Agency is mostly interior/cognitive, acceptable under Accumulative lens, but external pressure remains largely metaphorical (whispering atoms) rather than concrete obstacle, muting visceral cost. Escalation is present via pattern avoidance and exit discovery, yet stakes stay philosophical; the price is legible but not physically dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as beautiful contamination rather than sterile purity. The bronze prism’s shrinking to locket and the veil’s conversion to banner reprice earlier motifs without moralizing. Subtext operates through recurring opposed images—garden vs. wasteland, erasure vs. carriage— culminating in “light through cracked stained glass.” No thematic echo lines in final paragraph; the songs that make atoms dance provide Charged Poise that resists tidy closure, inviting counter-readings about collective vs. individual memory.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Lush, lyric third-person POV maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is historian’s synesthetic bent (tasting copper, hearing equations). Prose rhythm modulates from dense, clause-stacked sentences inside the archive to shorter, open-air cadences in the wasteland, mirroring emotional release. No dialogue, so voice evaluation rests on narrative texture, which remains singular and unpunctuated by filter verbs. Elisions (“three centuries ago”) are patterned early and paid off in locket exit, satisfying experimental tolerance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</question>
<comment>Figurative density is high but patterned—twilight, bronze, atoms, dust—forming an accumulative music that teaches its own syntax. One mixed-metor risk: “screaming equations that beg to be human again” personifies math jarringly, yet the archive’s surreal logic justifies it. Occasional modifier stacks (“luminous dust,” “dying heart”) flirt with purple, but rhythm stays varied. No loops or scaffold; final paragraph avoids artifact, allowing 9+ eligibility elsewhere despite minor texture excesses.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</question>
<comment>The fusion of data-archive tropes with lyric memoiristic nostalgia feels fresh; the “purification = self-erasure” inversion is non-obvious. Specificity of saffron veil woven from last pre-forgetting sunset anchors abstraction in sensory memory. Risk-taking—mosaic of Reflection-led shards, backward exit door—pays off in Charged Poise without obscuring causality. Derivative premise guardrail waived: digital-memory stories exist, but contamination-over-purity angle and communal locket compass are transformed through lived detail.</comment>
