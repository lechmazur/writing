<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is lyrical yet concrete—every beat is filtered through her dancer’s proprioception and decoder’s logic. Contradictory impulses (survive vs. swallow the seed) coexist in the same moment, embodied in the spiral she dances. The final renunciation—ingesting the data-page—costs her body and agency, fully earned. No label-speak; even “vulnerability is the hinge” is spoken through muscle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: swallowing the dance-diagram re-weights vulnerability from weakness to weapon. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—each pirouette and dice-cast thickens the pattern until the final snap-open. Cost is legible in the ink bleeding into her bloodstream and the moonlit exhale that seeds a stranger’s body. No orientation drift; dome, shaft, and rise are spatially tracked.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The drowned lab constrains every choice—flooded consoles, sputtering valve, jellyfish journals—while the spider-web clock externalizes tightening time. Body-as-setting is masterful: ankles write cursive keys, spine arcs to the current. The dice settle on silt whose texture we feel, guiding trust. Final image—constellation-lullaby on water—re-uses the medium that once drowned the scientists.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake is singular: transmit the scientists’ seed before the web is finished. Escalation is textural—each decoded plate adds density until the dice-double-three vortex forces the shaft descent. The swallowing of the page is the tightening that forecloses surrender; the buoy’s silver sigh is the visible price. Agency remains hers throughout—she rolls, she dances, she chooses ingestion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the spiral image: encryption as dance, vulnerability as hinge, defiance as calm. No moral is stated; the child’s involuntary first step is the non-literal answer. Subtext lives in silence—the scientists who stayed to drown, the executioner’s dice now compass. The final constellation re-prices fear into shared kinetic alphabet.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Voice is unmistakable: syntactic choreography mirrors content—long flowing clauses for current, staccato dice-clicks for节拍. Perceptual signature is dancer-quantified: “ghost-thrum,” “salt and singing,” “moonlit sigh.” No dialogue, so rhythm and diction carry all characterization. Compressed lyricism taught by line one and paid off in the last exhaled code.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops, scaffolds, or mixed metaphors; each image advances story or body. “Hangman’s dice clinked...like two tiny bones agreeing on a verdict” does triple duty: object, sound, moral frame. Sentence length modulates with breath and current. Final line achieves constellation spread without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: underwater danse-macabre meets cryptographic choreography. Dice as compass, dance as decryption, vulnerability as key—none feel gimmicked because grounded in tactile detail. Risk—swallowing inked paper—pays off in bodily carrier twist. Child’s unwitting first letter prevents abstraction; specificity makes premise memorable.</comment>
