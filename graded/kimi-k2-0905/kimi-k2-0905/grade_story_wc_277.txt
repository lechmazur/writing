<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cordelia’s contradictory impulses—guilt for her father’s lies vs. her reflex to rewrite them—are dramatized in every inscription she makes on the dome; the broken nib and sunrise ink are visible cost. Motivation stays anchored to “stop the returning swing” of regret, and her micro-choices (loading photographic fixer ink, pressing until the nib snaps) foreclose the old orbit with felt price. The only bar to 9 is that the internal moment of forgiveness is slightly abstracted; we see the orbit crack, but her emotional surrender is implied rather than embodied in a final flush or tremor.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The causal chain is immaculate: each inscribed line physically warps the glowing ellipse, turning logical contradiction into literal motion. Closure lands on-page—”The story continues” hovering in place of the shattered orbit—with conceptual cost: she accepts that her identity will forever be rewritten, not erased. The projector gears, ink chemistry, and slate floor are anchored by 120 words; no orientation debt. Persistent constraint: the splintered rosewood remains in her pocket, a sliver of sunset she can never again use, proof that some tools must break to falsify a false cosmos.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The copper dome, slit roof, and clockwork projector are not backdrop but instruments: mirror angles rewrite microfiche below, slate floor catches starlight to become parchment. The observatory’s acoustic echo is a tactile pressure that softens after the crack, making the final descent audibly lighter. Micro-setting supremacy: the antique stylus slot accepts only her grandfather’s nib, a dimensional constraint that decides tactics. No slips; world rules consistent; the sky itself is the palimpsest.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“stop the orbit of regret”—tightens with each inscription; the ellipse literally lowers perihelion until it must shatter. Agency is pure: every line she writes collapses the orbit further; no coincidence resolves anything. Cost is visible—nib snaps, sparks burn dates, aphelion drifts like a bored planet—foreclosing the option of eternal return. Minor deduction: the journalist off-page could have tightened time pressure even more, but on-page clocks (dawn crawling, presses thundering) supply sufficient cadence shift.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from reversal of astronomical law: if regret is Newtonian, truth is quantum—mutable under observation. The final image reweights the premise: “The story continues” means narrative gravity is widen-able, not escapable. No explicit moral; readers must decide whether a gentler orbit is mercy or self-deception. Rosewood → sunrise ink progression quietly argues that decay (splintered wood) fertilizes new inscription, a conceptual repricing that lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person focalization hovers at Cordelia’s shoulder, diction tasting of ink and thunder—never explanatory, always perceptual. Syntax lengthens during inscription, shortens during cracks, mirroring the orbit’s stress. No head-hop; Orlan’s suspicion is read only through Cordelia’s sensory filter: “a bow equal parts reverence and suspicion.” Elision taught early—“starlight dripped through the slit roof”—and paid off when starlings scatter, proving light can reassemble as life.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet aerated: “headlines glowing brighter as it neared perihelion” fuses physics and metaphor without crowding. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances orbit or character. figurative muddle zero—vehicles stay consistent (orbit, planet, cometary debris). One near-purple phrase—“solemn playroom for absent gods”—earns its keep by thematic payoff when gods are proven absent. Rhythm accelerates across the crack, then exhales on “quiet sentence,” a cadence shift that charges closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Freshest synthesis: astronomic projector + investigative journalism + formal logic proof = emotional law. The rosewood nib as stylus sliver of sunset is specific irreplaceable tech; swap to steel and the familial guilt link snaps. Conceptual risk—using geometry to disprove grief—pays off because rupture is physical on the dome. No template echo; no “write your pain away” cliché because the sky literally rewrites archives below. Bold, legible, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
