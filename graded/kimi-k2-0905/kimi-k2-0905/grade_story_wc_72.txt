<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The alabaster sentinel’s interior contradiction—stone yet newly sentient—drives every beat; telepathic bloom and the gardener’s braided presence externalize conflicted values. Choices (cradle ampoule, glide, crack) are traceable to the awakened hunger for nuance, and the softening to “possibility” lands with visible cost. Minor slip: the wave to guards feels narrated rather than embodied, keeping this just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the cracked ampoule propagates memory through sugar-weak mortar, reconfiguring the entire drowned court while the sentinel waits beneath the arch. Causal chain holds—droplet → mortar dissolve → statues pivot; cost is palpable in the city-wide shiver and the sentinel’s own mineral skin softening. Orientation is taught by lyric disorientation early and paid off; no lens ambiguity. A hairline slip: “I walked—no, glided—” momentarily stalls propulsion.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Foxglove-stained glass ampoule functions as micro-setting: its violet film and captured twilight constrain the sentinel’s grip and later decide the fracture point. The keystone arch turned to sugar is tactile, rule-consistent, and determinative. Moonlight as “bruised glow,” barnacle grief, and rust-panic are filtered through mineral telepathy, never tourist catalog. Final image of corals of ambiguity growing from the arch is inseparable from closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will the city remain a museum of certainties—tightens when the ampoule warms and the sugar mortar weakness is revealed. Single meaningful escalation: crack releases memory, dissolving certainties into glittering silt. Price is on-page: sentinel loses stone certainty, city loses structural integrity. Just shy of 9 because the external pressure (ships unaware) is observational rather than interactive.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of nuance versus verdict emerges through cascading image-set: poison/remedy share foxglove roots; statues pivot from judgment to recognition. No overt thesis; final invitation “come down if you wish to welcome nuance” is imagistic, not moral. Gardener’s treason-as-mercy reweights heroism without pronouncement. Complexity maintained—enemy was “their own refusal to adapt.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person mineral consciousness sustains distinct perceptual signature throughout: “mineral skull,” “stone skin soften to possibility,” “telepathy humming through every crack.” Rhythm modulates from stately procession to final humming cadence under the arch. No head-hopping; free indirect folds cleanly. Diction stays within plausible mineral-poetic lexicon; no corporate register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Density is lyric-high yet information-rich: single sentences layer stone physiology, telepathic taste, and historic guilt. No template cadence or synonym loops; metaphors stay coherent within aquatic/mineral logic. Micro-clip: “gardens of sea-grass that bowed like courtiers” risks ornament but is immediately grounded by flake-shedding calcified certainty. Closure line breathes without scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—sentient drowned statue triggered by memory-ampoule—combines myth, eco-SF, and lyric essay without precedent. Synthesis feels inevitable: stone guardian must crack sugar mortar of certainties. Risk of over-lyric density is embraced and paid off in the final coral-growth image. Transformation test passed; swap any element and the story collapses.</comment>
