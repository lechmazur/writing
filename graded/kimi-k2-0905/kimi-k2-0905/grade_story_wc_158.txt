<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zale’s centuries-long insomnia and the ache it carves are kept embodied—forehead on limestone, knees on spiral stairs—so the exhaustion feels lived-in. His micro-choice to peel the postcard apart crystallizes the arc: the act both surrenders the relic and plants its charge, a visible cost. The interior contradiction (to keep vigil vs. finally rest) is dramatized, not narrated. Only the “galaxy postcard” knowledge edge feels fractionally smoother than his lived memories; still, motivation holds across the sweep.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the glowing petals drifting outward re-weight every prior sleepless hour into breathable oxygen, a conceptual cost that reconfigures the war-to-come. The accumulative/textural drive is taught early—droplets as planetarium—and holds: the final bioluminescent throat is the pattern’s payoff. Orientation is clear by line 5; no debt. Causality is lyric-associative rather than plot-sequential, permissible under the chosen lens. The only hairline slip is a faint echo of “shyly unstoppable” twice in the last third, mildly overstating the already-seen.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The nautilus cathedral is never catalogued; instead its limestone drinks voice and exhales song—an environment that literally re-casts sound into lullaby, directly shaping the climax. Micro-setting triumphs: the postcard film glued to the apex becomes the transparent skylight through which peace is vented, a tool that constrains the final gesture. Spatial choreography stays clean as Zale climbs, descends, presses, seals. Sensory economy favors taste of salt and ammonite-shaped cracks—precise, never decorative.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—will the poet ever release the longing into something that breathes?—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens when he dares finish the postscript. The midpoint bead-touch revises knowledge, showing his child-self already tried mailing peace, doubling pressure. Escalation is accumulative: each dew-drop reflection thickens the cost of sleeplessness until the only remaining option is to surrender the card itself. Price is legible: the postcard, once planted, can no longer be clutched as relic—an irreversible forfeiture.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges without dictation: the story posits that art (lullabies, postcards, shells) can metabolize historical pain into pre-emptive blossom-armistices. The final exhale of glowing petals is the non-literal answer—no moral appended. Subtext hums in the off-key wind’s syllables, never translated. Reef-shadow joy’s oxymoron captures the necessary union of bright sorrow and iridescent hope, an emotional after-effect that lingers past the page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice owns a hypnotic, ecclesiastical cadence—long vowels, shell-echo sibilance—perfect for an insomniac poet who hears language as music. Compression (“shellgram,” “reef-shadow joy”) is taught early and pays off; no head-hop. Psychic distance stays shallow inside sensory immediacy: wind slips, limestone drinks, postcard flakes flutter. The diction never exceeds Zale’s lexicon; even “photosynthesize” is repurposed into poetic transmutation rather than science jargon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Syntactic variety ripples: spiral sentences mirror staircase ascent, then fragment into petal drifts. Every clause advances image or pressure; no scaffold. Figurative density is high but patterned—shell, pearl, throat, reef—so vehicles cohere without collision. A single paraphrase echo (“shyly unstoppable”) is the lone micro-loop, too minor to dull the final chord.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The premise—an immortal poet turning centuries of sleeplessness into a photosynthetic cease-fire—feels inevitable yet未见 elsewhere. Risky lyric structure (no antagonist, no dialogue, no battlefield scene) is embraced and vindicated by the charged closure image. The synthesis of nautilus architecture, cherry-blossom armistice, and self-mailing galaxy postcard is non-obvious and fully committed. Transformation test fails: remove any node and the whole reef-shadow ecosystem collapses.</comment>
