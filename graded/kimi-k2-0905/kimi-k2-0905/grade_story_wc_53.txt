<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The scavenger’s contradictory drives—clinging to spin-memoried plastic yet breaking it—are dramatized in the final click-break beat, and the shared erosion pact carries visible cost. Interiority is sensory, not therapeutic; the camera wheel’s cracked vertebra line shows thought through tactile injury. Chronological confusion is embodied in backward-name hisses and three-second-delayed reflections, not explained. Only minor cap: the ghost’s hand-wave is a touch generic; more idiosyncratic gesture could have sealed full 9+.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the frozen lagoon fracture reweights ambition into dissolved emulsion; cost is the undeveloped squares lost forever. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each camera click thickens regret-density until the pattern breaks. Orientation is taught early (steam, 03:17, cloudwater) so no penalty. One causal micro-slip: how undeveloped squares season water is left magical, but the effect is consistent with taught surreal physics and does not rupture cost legibility.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The obsidian mare’s empty-cartridge eyes and the upside-down star-projections are not ornaments; they anchor the negotiation and freeze the final image. Micro-setting (camera wheel, mirrored tiles) constrains gait and tactics. Brass animals exhaling steam and violet lagoon underside provide multisensory economy; no tourist catalog. Spatial choreography across floating walkway to center horse tracks cleanly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—whether to keep or surrender regret-laden futures—is signaled in line 4. Escalation is textural: each click densifies sand-voices until the wheel breaks, foreclosing the map-every-island option. Negotiation itself is stasis, but the dissolved images pay the felt price. No reversal, yet the deepening tightens under Accumulative lens; cost visible in dissolving squares.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the metamorphosis of cartographic ambition into shared erosion; no authorial thesis stated. The backward-name hiss and upside-down constellations quietly reprice “mapping” as narcissistic residue. Final image of ghost waving with “my own weary hand” reweights earlier denim-jacket drowning without moralizing. Ambiguity—whether surrender is growth or defeat—lingers credibly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>First-person voice carries a distinct scavenger perceptual signature: disposable camera clicks compared to cracked vertebra, ticket-stub lining rustling like birds. Syntax stretches under pressure—“I am chronologically confused”—yet stays within lexicon of a self-taught archivist. No head-hopping; ghost’s flickering filmstrip voice is externally observed. Rhythm modulates from propulsive list of passenger losses to crystalline final fragment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High information density: “cloudwater lapped at the copper deck, hissing where it touched the hot brass animals” does world, sense, and temperature in one stroke. Figurative control holds—no mixed metaphors—though “syllable of my own name spoken backwards” flirts with abstraction it later justifies. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or pressure. Minor over-decoration in “emulsified dreams” during closure, not enough to dull reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses antiquated carnival tech with aerial oceanic afterlife; synthesis feels inevitable rather than quirky. Risk-taking—negotiation with personal ghost via shattered consumer plastic—pays off in conceptual cost. Transformation test fails if scavenger or carousel is swapped, confirming specificity. No close echoes; the upside-down star-fish dream is fresh image-making.</comment>
