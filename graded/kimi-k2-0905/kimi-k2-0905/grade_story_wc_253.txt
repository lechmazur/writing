<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The blank-faced performer’s interior contradiction—reporting neighbors yet forging joy coupons—embodies ambiguity under grief, but her micro-choices (narrating to flowers, carving the feather) feel slightly performative rather than stake-altering; the final stance crystallizes with visible cost, yet the shift from blankness to “lighter shoulders” leans on image more than earned causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the planted stems darkening under one real tear reweights the remade hush rule-set; crow + officer + performer each pay a sliver of cost, satisfying felt-price test; causality holds under Accumulative lens—pattern of shavings→feather→planted stems tightens meaning without causal reversals.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Farmhouse porch, turbine updraft, and wooden feather function as micro-setting that constrains every beat; wind snatching shavings and later flapping the empty wrapper charges the final image; spatial choreography stays clean, sensory economy leans visual but justifies POV bias of a watcher.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can anything grow in post-mandate grief—tightens through pattern-break: first fake hydration, then real tear darkens soil; performer’s agency drives each shaving/narration beat; cost legible in officer’s scratched badge and crow’s lodged feather; escalation is accumulative deepening rather than reversal, sufficient for lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from particulars: silence as shovel, grief as soil; final image of empty stems darkening refuses tidy moral, invites reflection on voluntary planting; subtext in crow’s request and gift avoids explicit thesis; emotional aftereffect earned through concrete acts, not assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains perceptual signature—“remade hush,” “three-armed giants”—without head-hop; patterned elision taught early (“emotional void that passed for voice”) and paid off in final log line; diction stays within performer's haunted lexicon; rhythm modulates with blade-scrape cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High density: every sentence advances image or stakes; no loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent (turbine as choreographer, guilt as splinter); minor register lift in “conceptual repricing” fits POV’s bureaucratic residue; final line tightens cadence, no artifact touches closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: post-happiness-mandate valley + turbine-shaved shavings + crow barter creates inevitable-feeling myth; risk in lyric accumulation pays off when real tear falls; premise commits fully, no retreat; transformation test passes—story collapses without these exact objects/rules.</comment>
