<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is lush and embodied—sap on palms, salt of future tears—yet never drifts into label-speak. The refusal to cross the door crystallizes a hierarchy of values: witness over escape, cost felt in bark replacing veins. Contradictory impulses (remember vs. let go) torque every beat; final renunciation is earned by the prior vision of herself as ghost-memory. Only the absence of a second on-page character keeps this from the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: sealing the fragment into the hawthorn reweights the entire maze from trap to perpetual reliquary, cost legible in her future root-veins. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of rings/photographs mounts until the single tear-salt image reconfigures meaning. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive by line 3 and never drift. No causal break; every hedge-turn is a because/therefore of memory’s erosion.</comment>

<comment>The living bridge garden is not backdrop but instrument: hyperbolic yew vectors force her backward gait, hawthorn hourglass literally pinches time’s flow. Micro-setting of the halo pressed to bark becomes the final scalpel that rewrites the garden’s anatomy. Spatial choreography is immaculate—footprints fill with past selves, planks curl like burning film—each image tracks. Environment constrains the final choice: root-for-veins price is impossible without the vegetal architecture already grown.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will she escape the maze or become its archive?—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens when the door appears, foreclosing eternal witness. Escalation is accumulative: each turning dissolves another photograph, raising the cost of remembrance. The decisive reversal is her active sealing of the hour-tree; refusal is agency under duress. Price is on-page: “roots replacing veins, leaves replacing hair,” a living constraint that alters all future tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: memory’s texture is serrated, loss the only soil in which moments root. The final image—kneeling to listen to time grinding itself sharp—reprises the opening pulse of sap, now reweighted as chosen burden. Subtext operates in gesture: dust slipping through fingers = surrender to impermanence. No moralizing; the garden’s breathing walls offer a resonant, ambiguous after-echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric remains tightly focalized; perceptual signature is botanical-photographic—emulsions, celluloid rings, sap-drip—never generic. Syntax elongates then snaps in the corridor collapse, mirroring Möbius loosening into Euclidean line. No head-hop; knowledge stays bound to her retrocognitive trap. Voice modulates from reverie to serrated clarity when bark peels into images, aligning diction with escalating cost.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm breathes with maze curvature—long horticultural clauses tighten into staccato door/dissolve. Figurative layering is dense yet every vehicle (burning film, cold smoke, serrated ring) returns to the central photographic ontology; no mixed metaphors. Zero paraphrase loops; each line adds new sensory or causal information. Only a single filter verb cluster (“she understood then that…”) keeps this from 9+ perfection.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses memory-architecture with hyperbolic horticulture—fresh, yet inevitable once stated. The hedge maze as periscope into helical causality is a non-obvious synthesis that cannot survive transplant to another setting. Risk of arboreal self-immolation is taken to the hilt; no retreat into metaphor. Specific detail (hawthorn hourglass, celluloid growth rings) renders abstraction visceral, transforming familiar tropes of time-travel and memory-loss into lived vegetal ordeal.</comment>
