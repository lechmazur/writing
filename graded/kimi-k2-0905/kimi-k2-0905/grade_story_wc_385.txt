<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lira’s contradictory pull—yearning to finish what her mother could not while fearing her own echo—grounds every beat; the final choice to dissolve the cocoon is earned by her sensory-embodied journey. Micro-choices (pressing shell to cocoon, singing the missing cadence) reveal value hierarchy: completion over clinging. Emotional cost is visceral when the canyon falls silent for the first time. No stock interiority; perception remains salt-and-bone specific.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens taught early via pattern of returning echoes; closure lands with Conceptual Repricing—echo is no longer trap but door that shuts. Orientation anchored by 120 words: who (canyon echo singer), where (switchback trail), when (starlit night). Causality intact: because mother’s echo loops, therefore Lira must finish farewell. Cost legible in final line “life would travel rather than reverberate.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Basalt trail, corkscrew cavern, moth-silk gallery are filtered through Lira’s iron-tasting perception; each detail tightens her choices—canyon walls bounce questions, cavern absorbs song. Micro-setting of the fused seashell constrains final gesture. Starlight and dawn timestamps evolve with action. No static catalog; environment alters when cocoon dissolves into “motes of quiet light” that drift upward, mirroring internal release.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will Lira free herself from endless echo?—tightens once: unfinished farewells loop, completed ones travel. Agency drives escalation: descent into nexus, joining moth-weaver, singing closure. Tactic-altering cost: she forfeits the familiar ache of rebound for uncertain silence. No coincidence; every turn stems from her sonic choices under accrual of grief-threads.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-declaratively: completion as liberation. Subtext lives in sensory strands—moth silk spun from human yearning, shell warm as heartbeat after fusion. Final image reweights premise: absence of echo is not loss but portability of endings. No moralizing; resonance lingers in “rooms of air.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyric third-person hovers close to Lira’s sensory synesthesia; reed-blown syntax mirrors river-bend cadence. Perceptual signature precise: “taste the iron in a stranger’s blood memory.” No head-hop; old woman’s dialogue stays external, filtered through Lira’s recognition. Voice modulates from melancholic echo to forward-leaning fade without register drift.</comment>

<comment>Density high: “Their overlapping voices braided into webs of intrigue that tightened around her lungs until she sang to survive” does triple duty. Rhythm breathes—long winding sentences for descent, short beats at cocoon dissolution. Zero loops or scaffold; no mixed metaphors. Figurative language tied to sonic physics; cliffs “absorb and release” cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—echo as unfinished psychic residue—is non-obvious and fully committed. Moth-weavers feeding on yearning, seashell dream pre-cognition, canyon as archive: synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk of lyric excess disciplined by sensory specificity. Transformation test fails: only this voice, this gorge, this mother-cocoon could yield this closure.</comment>
