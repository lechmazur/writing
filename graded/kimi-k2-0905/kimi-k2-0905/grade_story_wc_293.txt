<comment>The fiddler’s contradictory impulses—cling to grief vs. risk belief—are dramatized in embodied bow-pressure and glass-flake heat; the final renunciation (crush/palm-dust) is earned by the father-memory and tarp-code causality. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. The only bar to 9.0 is that the hitchhiker remains a symbolic wire-frame; his lack of interior cost keeps the relationship crucible one-sided.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/textural lens: each paragraph adds a layer of sonic/emulsion residue until the final image reweights “never” to “maybe.” Closure is a Charged Poise: the lens-door and light-hand crystallize options with undeniable cost—the violin abandoned, pixels sacrificed. Orientation is taught by sentence-one dusk-photo metaphor, waived penalty. Cost is legible: “she crushed the glass flake,” dust clings, mountain exhales go-go-go.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Mountain pullout, gorge echo, tarp-flutter, and violin body form a micro-setting that actively constrains bow speed and foot placement. Every sensory pick is filtered through her luthier-ear and wind-reading heritage; no tourist cataloging. The final shadow-door is spatially coherent and charges the closing image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“never” vs. “maybe”—tightens when the flake squares drift apart, forcing the choice to crush/let go. Agency is continuous: each arpeggio translates tarp-code into an off-mountain path, narrowing escape options until the wireframe hand is the last live option. Cost is visible: loss of the violin and the flake itself. Slight reserve: escalation is more accretive than sharply reversed, keeping it below 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the reconfiguration of pixels/amnesty: art can re-author fate. No moral spoken; the final dust-hand offers conceptual repricing—permission is granular, destructible, renewable. Father-bridge fall and tarp-code give concrete particulars; ambiguity lingers about whether the new road is real or imagined, inviting reflection without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly focalized; perceptual signature is wind-pitch and emulsion-cracks, never ventriloquizing the hitchhiker. Syntax coils like rosined hair, then snaps short at crush-point—rhythmic control mirrors tension. No head-hop, no filter-verb stacks. Diction stays within a wind-reader’s lexicon; scaffold-wrap Morse is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud ear: varied cadence, no template runs. Information density high—one sentence often does image + memory + causal cue (“glass flake vibrated in her palm, squares shifting like a stop-motion confession”). Metaphors are coherent under photo-emulsion logic; no mixed vehicles. Minor scaffold: “keep going” triple reprise is purposeful wind-code, not artifact. Closure beat is crystal-clear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: violin + wet-plate + scaffold-tarp code = new myth of pixel-forgiveness. Risky lyric compression pays off in legible Charged Poise. No familiar plot echoes; father-fall and hitchhiker dissolve into grain-light. Specificity of “minor seventh the tarp had made” anchors the invention in lived craft.</comment>
