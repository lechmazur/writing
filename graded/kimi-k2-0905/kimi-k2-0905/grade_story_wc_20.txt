<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Aurelia’s interiority is sensuously embodied—tears as reagent, balance-beam tremor—without lapsing into therapeutic self-diagnosis. The twin-shaped absence escalates from pocket-weight to sternum-anchor through four explicit “limit” experiments, each a micro-choice that visibly alters her stance. The final calibration—stepping out to teach others how to carry luminous regret—pays off every prior ounce of measured grief with earned, legible cost. Only a hairline slip: the phrase “names are not chains but counterweights” edges toward maxim, not lived contradiction. </comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the mended coin becomes an internal scale, reweighting “what was lost” against “what remains possible” in a single, resonant image. The causal chain—cracked coin → four limit-tests → gold seam → sternum-anchor—tightens option and meaning under an Accumulative/Textural lens; every added gram of regret or starlight narrows the next move. Cost is unmistakable: the twentieth ounce of tear-gold is paid on-page, and the foundry walls retain a “silent syllabus,” a persistent constraint left behind. The ending beam-levels the premise without moralizing, satisfying the 9+ cost-proof test. </comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The foundry’s gutters still running silver, the charcoal heart, the cooling anvil—each object is handled, tilted, or scarred so that environment literally counterweights the coin. Rain-washed cobbles reflecting a “sky pieced together like the coin” recharges the setting at closure, turning exterior landscape into interior calibration device. Spatial choreography is exact: lantern distance, furnace ember angle, anvil-to-door vectors track cleanly. Micro-setting (the alembic’s rose-gold vapor) constrains the only viable path for welding grief. </comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—can grief be transmuted into usable gold—escalates through four successive limit-tests, each narrowing the tactical field: weigh → calcine → seam → anchor. Agency is pure alchemist: every beat requires manual action (scraping rust, folding tears, lifting molten gold) that visibly forecloses retreat. The twentieth ounce of tear-gold is the on-page price that charges the final image. Coincidence is excluded; storm-water and furnace embers are already causally resident. </comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the iterative physics of breakage and repair: kintsugi as method, not metaphor. The final reconfiguration—redemption as calibration, not destination—answers the central question without sermon. Subtext operates in objects: Libra/Scorpio balanced on a single vein turns astrology into lived biomechanics. The luminous regret tone modulates from cavern-echo to teaching tool, leaving an aftereffect that feels like weight settled, not lesson learned. </comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is crystalline: “iron-smelling dark,” “mercury syllables,” “charcoal heart” all issue from an alchemist’s sensory hierarchy. Rhythm compresses under pressure—single-clause furnace beats—then elongates at closure, mirroring the beam leveling. No head-hopping; even the brother’s voice arrives as equation, not ventriloquism. One micro-drift: “factual-mystical” sounds like prompt residue, but the phrase appears once and is immediately enfleshed by coin-warmth. </comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence carries dual cargo (image + causal nudge). Metaphors are internally consistent—silver gutters, mercury syllables, gold seam—all obey foundry physics. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line (“teach the others how to carry luminous regret”) resolves by action that recharges the motif. No register drift, no filter-verb stacks; high information density without purple inflation. </comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The alchemical kintsugi synthesis feels inevitable yet fresh: broken coin + starlight weld + sternum-scale reweights the ubiquitous “grief as gold” trope into biomeasurment. Risk—structuring the entire arc as four enumerated limit-tests—heightens coherence rather than gimmickry. Specificity of foundry detritus (abandoned molds, cannon iron) anchors universals in unrepeatable detail. Transformation test fails: swap any detail and the beam snaps. </comment>
