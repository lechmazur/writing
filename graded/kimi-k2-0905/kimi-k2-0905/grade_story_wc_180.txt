<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The mender’s contradictory impulses—defiance and caretaking—are dramatized through embodied choices (barred doors with pruning hook, grafting at dawn). Interiority is specific to profession: quartz monocle, pollen, cambium under fingers. The final stance of refusal carries visible cost: orchard bars elders, ribbon rots into bark, scent of coconut/copper drifts citywide—earned stasis that forecloses reconciliation but preserves the grove. Daughter’s awed touch on new cambium crystallizes the generational transfer without sentimental summary.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/lyric lens holds: pressure mounts through sensory density and pattern of deciduous vows composting into new wood. Closure is a Charged Poise: the city’s scent becomes an unspoken covenant—conceptual cost legible in the drift of coconut/copper over strangers. Orientation anchors by line 4 (crumbling nave, plaster saints) and spatial choreography stays clean across scaffold, rafters, rose-window gap. No causality breaks; each graft, ampoule crack, and pollen release is a tactile micro-choice that reweights the stake.</comment>

<comment>Cathedral-orchard is vividly selective: absent rose-window stripes light across bark, roots coil round corbels, pews toppled beneath tracery of boughs. Micro-setting of copper gear biting bark constrains the graft and charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy obeys mender’s lens—goggles, pollen, ribbon’s coconut oil—never tourist catalog. Spatial track stays clean: scaffold → rafters → buttress → nave floor; daughter’s entrance via broken buttress is legible.</question>

<comment>Dominant stake—“will the orchard survive breach?”—is signaled in paragraph 2. Escalation is accumulative: each forgotten-bag artifact (gear, pollen, ribbon) tightens the repair ritual and raises sap, new buds, barred doors—on-page cost visible in copper hiss and rotting ribbon. No coincidence; every intensification is mender’s agency under acculative lens. Final tightening: elders arrive with amended contracts—option foreclosed by pruning hook, orchard now autonomous.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from concrete inversion: vows must rot to feed the tree; promises are leaves, not chains. Subtext lives in objects—ribbon’s shift from childish token to living banner—never stated abstractly. Final reconfiguration reweights “breach” as necessary compost, not tragedy. Avoids moralizing; the city’s shared breath is an image, not a thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is compressed, lyrical, pattern-taught early (“deciduous vows that had fallen like leaves”). Diction stays within mender’s guild lexicon—cambium, pectin, corbel—without jargon dump. Rhythm modulates: long sentences for sap-slow time, fragment bursts for graft tension. No head-hopping; daughter’s perception filtered through mender’s lifted gaze, maintaining single focalizer.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences do setting, metaphor, and interiority (“Sunlight poured through the absent rose window, striping aisles of air and bark”). Figurative layering is patterned, not decorative—deciduous vows reappear in scrolls, sap, scent. Zero paraphrase loops; each mention of ribbon adds physical change (bow catches moonlight → satin shredded by pollen → fibers absorbed). Minor register lift in “conceptual repricing” phrase—docked −0.2, still within POV stretch.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses post-apocalyptic caretaking with arboreal cathedral—fresh yet inevitable. Ribbon-as-graft is a non-obvious synthesis of sentimental relic and biological suture. Deciduous vows encoded in fruit-scrolls decouple memory from stone, making memory living tissue. Risk of lyrical overload is embraced and paid off in final scent-covenant that drifts citywide, reconfiguring social contract without dialogue.</comment>
