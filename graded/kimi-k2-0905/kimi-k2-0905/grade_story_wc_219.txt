<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is dense, embodied, and contradictory—her drive to “prove return is a reaction, not a reunion” collides with the involuntary inhalation of spores that floods her with body-level memory. Micro-choices (pressing amber to eroded bronze, inhaling against will) externalize the conflict; the final renunciation—burying the emptied shard—pays the cost of her stance. No safety-hedging: she is brilliant, abrasive, and still poisoned by nostalgia. The fly-dissolution beat crystallizes her hierarchy of values: knowledge > belonging, even when the price is cellular.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the fly’s 40-million-year wings beat once, then dissolve into golden spores that rewire Mara’s map of home at a molecular level—cost is visible, felt, and irreversible. Causal lattice holds: each sculpture failure → tower resonance → spore release is a because/therefore chain triggered by her deliberate amber placement. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by line 4; no disorientation persists. The tower’s gentle collapse is not coincidence but the logical exhale of an experiment concluded, erasing the return-path she refuses to take.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Rain-softened moss, rust-breathing stone, and the scent of wet lichen are filtered through Mara’s chemist gaze—every sensory note is a reagent in her test of belonging. The fly-amber itself becomes micro-setting: its lattice of light constrains her choices (she must carry, then surrender it). Tower dome’s dormant field is not backdrop but active apparatus that catalyzes the spore-release. Final image—empty amber pressed into soil—reweights the entire path from pilgrimage to fossil record, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“chemistry of homecoming” vs. nostalgia’s isotope—tightens through each sculpture failure; the seventh bronze figure’s eroded face signals the last narrowing option. Escalation is driven by her agency: placing amber on bronze → tower hum → spore inhalation; each step raises molecular cost. No reversal is required—the deepening is the revelation that belonging is a toxin she must metabolize. Visible price: wings dissolve inside her bloodstream, foreclosing any future return the offworlders promised.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges as a molecular critique of nostalgia: home is not a place but a metabolic residue the body hoards. The fly’s extinction-shadows on the dome reprice “return” as a chemical illusion—no moral is stated, only a record that will fossilize again. Subtext lives in silence: no offworlder appears; their absence is the vacuum that lets Mara falsify their gift. Final image—shard buried to become future amber—offers a resonant, non-literal answer: memory is the only homeland, and it decays beautifully.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is crystalline, skeptical, and scientifically compressed: “she believed the offworlders had lied—not out of malice, but nostalgia.” Perceptual signature is chemist-biased—she smells cyanotype rinse and iron from a paper cut, not “mother.” Rhythm breathes with ascent: longer clauses for moss-earth, staccato for spiral climb, then hush in the dome. No dialogue needed; interior diction never drifts into therapeutic self-labeling. The final sentence—“the reaction had begun”—is a perfect Charged Poise cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances molecule, myth, or motion. Figurative language is sparse and precise: “chord struck on a cello made of bone” is the single metaphor, earned by the tower’s resonance. High information density: one line can span geological time, Guild politics, and personal exile without stalling. No register drift; technical lexicon (cyanotype, isotope) stays inside Mara’s cognition. Final clause—“she walked on”—is a blade of momentum that cuts sentiment.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise flips the alien-contact trope: invaders gift us our own deep past, then flee their inability to metabolize it. The amber-as-map-of-returns becomes a toxin that dissolves into personal memory—fresh synthesis of paleontology and homesickness. Risk in structure—collapsing tower erases pilgrimage path—pays off by forcing Mara to abandon pursuit and study decay instead. Specificity of the bronze quiet figures and extinct fly prevents abstraction; the concept could not survive relocation to generic ruins.</comment>
