<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Kael’s serene anger and tracker skills are vivid, but his interiority is mostly declarative (“he understood then”) rather than embodied contradiction. Lyra exists only as theory and echo, so the sibling crucible never pressures a live choice. The final surrender is telegraphed, not wrestled—no micro-choice shows him abandoning the search for something else. Competence is asserted; struggle is offstage.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Kael accepts the desert’s folded-time logic and steps into the ink portal, cost legible in his vanishing glow. Causal chain is thin—why the drone’s dissolution triggers his leap is asserted, not driven—but the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds: ink patterns accumulate meaning until the final image reweights the premise. Orientation is swift; no penalty. One soft patch: the mother’s disappearance is retro-added motive.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Sandstone corridors, eclipse warmth, and drone-wing wind are tactile and selective, filtering through Kael’s tracker gaze. The ink fractals and hourglass symbol serve as micro-setting that directly shapes the final choice. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating rooms. Environment constrains—ink dries faster in drone-wind, forcing quicker decisions—meeting the 9+ gate requirement even if not yet at 8.5.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“find Lyra or lose her to time-folds”—is signaled early and tightens once when the portal opens. Escalation is textural: each ink drop increases pattern density until stepping through becomes the only option. Cost is conceptual (eternal displacement) rather than visceral, but legible. No reversal, but the accumulative deepening satisfies the 600-word bandwidth.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme—time’s stretch as gift rather than glitch—emerges through ink imagery and Kael’s final surrender, avoiding explicit moral. Subtext rests in the drone’s programmed “wildness” mirroring human obsession. The hourglass-to-sand motif reweights at closure, achieving resonance without tidy thesis. One minor echo: Lyra’s voice states the defense-mechanism thesis aloud, trimming 0.2.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Kael; perceptual signature is tracker-specific (“pink eyes narrowing,” “desert’s language”). Syntax lengthens under temporal stretch, mirroring theme. No dialogue, so voice contamination is absent. Occasional elevated diction (“consciously wild,” “ephemeral patterns”) feels authored rather than Kael’s, keeping it below 8.8.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Rhythm varies from short tracker beats to lyrical elongation at the portal moment. Figurative language is dense but patterned—ink, wind, time—so density penalty waived. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or knowledge. One mixed metaphor (“time folded like origami” beside “drowning in consciousness”) blurs physical logic, −0.2.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Temporal-defense desert, ink-map tracking, and wild AI drone synthesize into a fresh mythic science-fantasy angle. The “disappearing ink as time-key” is non-obvious and indispensable to closure. Risk—lyric ellipsis over causal grit—pays off in resonant final image. No close genre echoes; transformation is complete.</comment>
