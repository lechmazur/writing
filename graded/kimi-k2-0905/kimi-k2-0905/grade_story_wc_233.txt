<comment>Contradictory impulses—dread of erasure vs. need to save her people—pulse in every beat; the final self-crowning is earned by the prior memory hemorrhage. Micro-choice chain (climb / press bleeding starlight to palms / step onto dais) externalizes the hierarchy of values with escalating cost. Interiority never drifts into diagnostic labels; instead, “tasting iron, tasting endings” bodies out her terror. Flaw drives action: her earlier blindness to prophecy directly hastens the forgetting that forces her ascent.</comment>

<comment>Causal lattice holds: dream warning → reflection blur → climb → shard reveals self as source → crown absorbs remaining memory. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: her name is released to the kingdom precisely because she accepts erasure, a cost legible in the cracked mirrors. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3 and are re-anchored each floor of altitude without stall. No plot amnesia; every glowing basalt step and coagulating star-drop pays forward to the final burn.</comment>

<comment>The cobalt grotto above clouds is not backdrop but pressure engine—air thins to “lace … threads of ice,” forcing shorter breaths and quicker decisions. Micro-setting inside the ember grotto uses temperature inversion (“warmth cradled skin while frost flowered on eyelashes”) to force the paradoxical comfort/sacrifice choice. Recurring “bleeding starlight” physically pools, then becomes crown, binding environment to stakes. Spatial choreography is flawless; each basalt step is tracked, never floating.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—existence in others’ memory—tightens from first paragraph’s “kingdom would forget her name” to last line’s cracked-mirror release. One meaningful escalation: starlight thickens from mist to crown, trading remembrance for cosmic repair. Agency is continuous climb; no outside rescue. Cost is paid on-page: “every mirror in the kingdom cracked at once,” audible price of her ascension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through recursive circuitry: memory as both identity and currency, sacrifice as authorship of one’s own erasure. Subtextual payload carried by fireflies—tiny lanterns guiding future climbers—shows the cycle will repeat, resisting moral simplification. Final image reframes earlier “softly commanding voice” as self-authored warning, reweighting premise without exposition. No final-paragraph sermon; meaning stays in the objects (crown of molten silver, cracking mirrors).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature favors synesthetic fusion (“air thinned into lace,” “tasting iron, tasting endings”). Syntax flexes with altitude—longer, breathless sentences at height; fragmentary percussions at crown moment. No head-hop; future queen appears only in reflective shard, staying strictly visual. Dialogue absent by design; voice coherence held through lyric narration without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is high-density yet lean: one sentence often delivers image + causality + emotional valence (“She pressed forward, driven by the need to unravel…”). Figurative layer is patterned early (“bleeding starlight”) and therefore paid off, avoiding purple overload. Zero paraphrase loops; no filter-verb stacks. Rhythm mirrors oxygen debt—sentence length contracts as air thins, a physiological metronome.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis folds monarchical trope into Möbius time-loop where queen must orphan herself from collective memory to preserve sky. Specificity of “ember grotto” as womb/tomb and memory-as-blood-in-starlight feels inevitable yet unborrowed. Risk of lyric recursion is embraced and landed: circular plot intensifies stakes rather than spinning wheels. Emotional truth—power requires self-erasure—transcends gimmick.</comment>
