<comment>Asha’s interior contradiction—her early universalism vs. the fire-hardened refusal to judge—is embodied in the tactile cataloguing of tesserae and the night-long placement of the forgetting-map. The renaming is dramatized: she lifts the cracked stepping stone and leaves, so the “Iron Cradle” identity is not merely asserted. Cost is visible: she forfeits home, reputation, and the archive dream. Yet the moment of transformation is slightly under-delayed; one extra beat of her hand on the cracked Judge-star before she pries it free would have pushed the earned change to 9-band.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the map of forgetting crystallizes a before/after in the plaza and in Asha’s stance, with conceptual cost (she will carry the stone and exile). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each tessera placed intensifies the pattern of release, culminating in the dawn image of infinite arms. Causality is clean—vision loops → ethical rupture → physical map → departure. One micro-drag: “They never discovered…” is external exposition that slightly dilutes the poise; if the watch had found only the empty stone, the beat would have landed pure 9+.</comment>

<comment>The shattered sky and heat-fractured Merciful Judge mosaic are not backdrop but constraint: the cracked star-pattern literally guides finger placement, determining the final image. Micro-setting (tessera in pouch, stepping stone under knee) supplants broad vista, fitting 700-word scope. Sensory hierarchy—glass edges, starlight temperature, dawn pallor—mirrors internal cooling of judgment. Spatial choreography is flawless: circumference walk → center crouch → vanished footprints toward gate. Slight reserve: “ancient plaza” remains generic; one concrete civic relic (a fire-scarred hydria, a broken astrolabe) would have nudged 9.0.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—how to exercise mercy when memory kills—tightens through each tessera placed, each memory relinquished. Agency is continuous: Asha selects, arranges, lifts, leaves; no external rescue. Visible price: she abandons city, name, and past. The 49-day numeric spine (days of fire) supplies a discreet accelerant, but escalation is emotional, not clock-driven. One micro-flattening: the mother-book-flame image is recalled three times with near-identical phrasing; a slight variation (once as scent of burning vellum, once as child’s sooty thumbprint) would have propelled 9-band.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges as the paradox that forgetting can be a form of mercy; no character sermonizes the thesis. The infinite-armed figure literalizes the idea without abstract assertion. Subtext operates in silence: Asha never defends her choice to leave; the citizens’ later additions happen off-page, inviting reader adjudication. Final image reweights “knowledge as burden” into “knowledge as gift one may refuse,” a Conceptual Repricing with social cost (who controls memory?). The lack of tidy moral balance—some books did burn—keeps ambiguity alive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Asha’s perceptual filter: “feeling for the telltale edges,” “her fingers reading history.” Syntax lengthens and compresses with fatigue: pre-dawn clauses stretch, then snap into “she was gone.” No head-hop; the watch’s viewpoint enters only after she exits. Diction stays within her wrought-iron lexicon—tesserae, retrocognitive, aberrant—without academic sprawl. One hairline slip: “the city had never seen” momentarily owns omniscient certainty; tightening to “she believed the city had never seen” would preserve modesty and hit 9.0.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm: long anaphoric “who…” clauses build incantatory pressure, then fracture into single-clause release at dawn. Sentences carry double duty—e.g., “heat had fractured the star-pattern into something that resembled outstretched arms” simultaneously describes object and prefigures final image. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new angle (glass edge, constellation memory, citizen additions). Metaphors stay coherent (blade efficiency, map of forgetting). Micro-qualm: “knowledge became fuel for survival” edges toward aphorism; replacing “fuel” with “ember” would keep sensory specificity and crest 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The post-catastrophic mosaic-as-memory trope is refreshed by making the artist renounce remembrance rather than preserve it. Retrocognition as psychic fire-witness avoids standard time-police cliché by focusing on ethical rupture, not data retrieval. The Iron Cradle moniker feels earned, not steampunk ornament, because it grows from her literal cradling of broken glass and ethical steel. One near-echo: the mother-burning-book image recalls Fahrenheit 451, but the inversion—mother choosing warmth over text—flips the critique toward mercy, keeping originality intact.</comment>
