<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mireya’s interiority is palpably embodied (“salt, iron, whale song” tears), her contradictory calculus—save artifact vs. lose town—acts in-scene, and the final renunciation (key worn smooth) costs her the tool itself; the glacier-heartbeat sync is a micro-choice that re-weights her stance, though the “logically emotional” label is asserted more than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the marina stays whole, bone restored, but the key’s teeth are gone—persistent price legible on-page; the accumulative lens (pattern of sonic callbacks) holds from first ear-bone shriek to final star-spiral, though a causal purist could wish for clearer because/therefore linkage between bow-strokes and ice-calving stall.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The drift-ice marina is handled as tool, not backdrop: ice slabs tilt underfoot, forcing Mireya to bow faster; the azure coat absorbs the Echo’s thrum, charging the final seated image; spatial choreography is immaculate across the calving sequence; environment materially constrains tactics and reappears in the closing lens, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—nightmares solidifying—announced early and tightened when shadows actually stumble onto ice; escalation is textural: density of creak, shriek, glow increases until the third-path vibrational invitation reweights options; visible price is the key’s destroyed teeth, foreclosing future use—cost on the page under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from sonic particulars rather than thesis: mercy becomes a frequency you can teach darkness to hear; the final star-spiral image offers a non-literal, reweighted answer without moralizing—resonance earned through whale-mother call, glacier memory, and the coat’s absorptive thrum.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is distinct—salt/iron/whale lexicon, rhythm that mimics organ-pile resonance, compression under pressure (“bow of whale baleen across the key’s teeth”)—with no head-hopping; lyric elision is pattern-taught early (“breathing of something ancient and logically emotional”) and paid off in the final star-map.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies from long oceanic sentences to staccato beats mirroring ice-knocks; information density high—“each note spilled out like warm blood, fleshly ethereal” does three jobs (sensorial, metaphorical, tonal); zero paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors; final line recharges “horizon’s last gold” without scaffolding—clean cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Risky synthesis—whale-ear-bone as sacred absolution device, lighthouse engineer as resonance tuner—feels inevitable in hindsight; trope of saving town from nightmares is inverted by teaching darkness to listen rather than destroy; conceptual integrity sustained without retreat; specific maritime sonic lore anchors freshness.</comment>
