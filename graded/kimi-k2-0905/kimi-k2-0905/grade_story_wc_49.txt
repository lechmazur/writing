<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—scientific tinkerer vs. ritual singer—are dramatized in simultaneous micro-choices: she calibrates goggles while humming off-key, feathers pollen with a phoenix quill whose warmth she feels. The daughter’s sickness is never abstracted into “motivation”; it surfaces mid-song as a catch in breath that cracks her highest note. Closure costs are embodied: the tendril dies in her palm, new vines already sprouting to prove the cycle will demand future sacrifices. Voice remains copper-and-grease specific; no therapeutic self-labeling.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each sung syllable thickens the rune-glow → spores release → pollen must be caught before moonset. The 17-year wait is anchored by the first tendril-touch at ~80 words; orientation debt waived because disorientation (lost lullabies) is the very problem solved. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the valley’s new song is audible proof that modern minds have been re-priced back into ancestral debt. Persistent constraint—next harvest moon will demand another singer—shapes the final image of branches already heavy with new tendrils.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The hollow oak projector, phoenix-feather tool, and dawn-lit arbor constrain every tactical choice: she can’t harvest early because moonlight must hit the oak’s internal gears; can’t use metal tweezers because residual warmth in the feather is the only safe carrier. Spatial choreography is immaculate: branch-to-branch descent is tracked against moonrim, pollen cloud, and rising valley voices. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and sound over sight—goggles fog, song cracks—mirroring internal pressure. Final image of new tendrils recharges the setting itself as a living clock.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—daughter’s memory—tightens when song-cracks risk missing the one-hour bloom window. Escalation is causal: each verse → brighter runes → faster moonset → narrower time-band. Cost is visceral: tendril death, voice hoarseness, and the irreversible knowledge that future moons will demand repeat sacrifice. No coincidence; even dawn breeze is released by her final note. Agency is renunciation—she gives the remedy away, forfeiting exclusive control.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges without thesis: “sacred practice as precision technology” is shown through irrigation schematics tattooed on petals, not stated. Final image reweights industrial abandonment as a debt now re-inscribed in collective memory. Subtext in gesture: she pockets the dead tendril—mourning the cost of knowledge—while voices below rise in unison, proving the remedy’s success. Ambiguity lingers: will next generations keep singing or sell the pollen? No moralizing answers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person lyric compression sustains a tinkerer’s perceptual signature: mechanical metaphors for organic forms (“vascular irrigation”), auditory bias for gear-clicks between verses. Rhythm accelerates with shorter anaphoric clauses as moonrim narrows. No dialogue; internal song-text substitutes spoken lines, avoiding register mismatch. Filter verbs serve voice—“she felt warmth quiver”—rather than dulling immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose breathes with scene tempo: long clauses during predawn hush, staccato fragments at moonset. Metaphors are consistent—light as liquid fire, pollen as starlight—without mixed logic. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances clock, body, or song. Opening line anchors voice and stakes in one breath. Final line crystallizes cost: “restoring what was never truly lost, only waiting” revalues prior material without abstraction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: bioluminescent botany + mnemonic medicine + lunar clockwork escapes both eco-pastoral and solarpunk clichés. Transformation test fails if any element swapped: only this tendril blooms under this moon for this song-sickness. Risk in lyric density pays off—closure remains legible. Specificity of “phoenix feather still warm” and “copper goggles reflecting dawn” anchors novelty in tactile detail.</comment>
