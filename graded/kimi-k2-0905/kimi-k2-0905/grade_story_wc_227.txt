<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lira’s interior contradiction—yearning to mend yet fearing the cost—drives every micro-choice; the moment she straps in and accepts the sinking, her endurance is earned by the prior liturgy of dots and the mother-charm’s weight. The only drag is a sliver of diagnostic self-talk (“Damage accepted. Meaning achieved.”) that momentarily surfaces mid-crisis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the workshop’s deliberate sacrifice crystallizes options—statue healed, vessel lost—under an Accumulative lens where each dotted scar tightens density until the final image reweights the premise. Causality holds; the snapped chains are the visible price paid on-page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The acid-eaten anchor-chains, rebreather countdown, and mercury-charm function as micro-setting that directly constrain tactics; every sensory pick is filtered through Lira’s alchemist gaze and charges the final sinking image. Spatial choreography remains exact as tools slide with the list.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—quilt memory into meaning before chains fail—tightens via each crater-to-dot translation; the irreversible snap of the last link forces her stance crystallization with a felt price (the workshop). Escalation is coherent, single-cycle, and sufficient for the length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the kintsugi logic: repair that includes the break itself. The ending’s reversed-gravity star reconfigures the premise—meaning survives the vessel—without moralizing. Subtext resides in the mercury-swirled heartbeat and the statue’s opened eyes, inviting multiple readings.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice carries a distinct alchemical cadence—compressed, metallic, ritual—without losing clarity; perceptual signature is consistent (“acid sea kissed the iron”). No head-hopping; psychic distance compresses credibly under the thirteen-second breath cycle.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative layering serves the accumulative design. One mixed-metaphor risk—“tectonic teeth grinding”—is brief and does not obscure causality. No loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts are crisp.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The acid-sea kintsugi workshop feels inevitable yet unseen before; merging memory-cartography with underwater alchemy yields a fresh synthesis. Risky choice to sink the POV with the achieved meaning pays off and reweights genre expectations.</comment>
