<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is textured and embodied—pulse-counting, frost travel through wrists—without label-speak. Renunciation of escape (he “would never leave”) is foreshadowed by micro-choices: breath-matching, rip-free page lift; cost is felt in the throat hollow where her name lived. No second character on page, so status/relationship bullets inactive. Single flaw: motive phrasing drifts toward abstraction (“translate heartbeats into maps”) in a couple of lines, slightly thinning the contradiction in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the crater-orchestra beats audibly, options reconfigured—exit path renounced, listener role embraced. Cost is palpable: lifelong stillness, grief kept flammable yet unlit. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—pattern of arranged refuse → arranged beats—final cadence shift undeniable. No causality breaks; spatial/temporal anchors taught early via crater, orchard, frost circles.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Micro-setting (cracked vial, scarecrow torso) becomes the amplifier that constrains final choice; subarctic cold literally slows all motion, enforcing patience. Sensory economy is lean yet pervasive—sound of snow pausing, copper chill settling in throat. Setting mirrors internal state without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography immaculate: plate, vial, scarecrow form one legible constellation.</question>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover the lover’s map—shifts to irrevocable stillness when plate fuses to vial; this tightening forecloses departure. Agency remains interior yet decisive: sealing = conscious choice to become conduit. Price—eternal listening in frost—is visible on page. Situational pressure coherent throughout; no coincidence used to resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme—grief as translation—emerges through concrete pattern-making and final acoustic map; no explicit thesis stated. Ambiguity is productive: we never know if the returned beat is real or imagined, yet the cost is undeniable. Motifs (starlight, copper, breath) recur with shifting meaning, culminating in living score. Ending reweights stillness from paralysis to voluntary guardianship without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyric third-person channels alchemist’s perceptual signature: synesthetic cold, metallurgical diction, breath-paced syntax. Pattern-taught elision (“while the world holds its breath”) is paid off when literal stillness enables fusion. Rhythm modulates—long sentences for kneeling, single clause eruptions for heart-thuds—mirroring pulse map. No head-hopping; diction stays within plausible arcane lexicon; punctuation clean, fragments serve breath control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varied; sentence lengths contract with pressure. Metaphors are internally consistent—starlight as forge, orchard as score—no mixed vehicles. Information density high: one line often layers sensory, emotional, conceptual work. Minor scaffold: “demonstrates patience physically” appears twice; does not obscure closure, so −0.2 only.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: flash-paper alchemist + meteoric copper plate → heartbeat cartography is non-generic and inevitable in hindsight. Risk of suspended-time lyricism is embraced and paid off by diegetic stillness that enables sealing. Transformation test fails if elements swapped; scarecrow-as-drum requires exact accumulation. Concept commits fully; no retreat to conventional arc.</comment>
