<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The inspector’s interiority is precise—her calculation of the grain’s split, the haptic heartbeat sync, the cracked voice on “intervention”—and every micro-choice (burying the slower grain, waiting past the rose signal) is driven by a contradiction between scientific duty and private grief. The final refusal to stop shooting until the last click is an earned renunciation that costs her dawnlight and memory. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived. Flaw: “wondered if curiosity was just another form of mourning” drifts toward diagnostic-speak (−0.3); still, embodied cost holds.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the split grain timers, Earthrise glow, and anemone folds build density until the shutter clicks compress the stakes into one frame of extinction. Closure is a Charged Poise—camera frozen on ghost flower fossil, crimson grain confirming no margin left—cost is the irreversible loss of both species and her own future memory. Causality intact: pink bloom signals exact shutter release, no coincidence. Orientation anchored by line 3 (“moonlit summit of Mount Selene”) and pattern taught early; no ambiguity at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The moonlit summit is not backdrop but tactical constraint: vitrified regolith crunches under tripod legs, terminator wind electrostatically triggers the grain blush, basalt shard hides the slower reactant. Micro-setting objects—antique film camera, visor shadow, hip-flask water bead—are handled and alter timing. Earth’s blue glow paints the final exposure, charging the melancholy closure image. Spatial choreography flawless: boots, ridge, vein, shard, shutter sequence tracked without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: document the last blooming before UV sterilization. Escalation is accumulative—each anemone pulse tightens the countdown until the rose flush signals zero margin. The inspector’s agency is to keep the shutter open past the safe cue, enduring the full cost. Price is paid on-page: neural backup lost at sunrise, film now sole survivor. The tightening is single but decisive; no reversal, yet option set narrows to one final click.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the impossibility of preserving beauty without also preserving loss; the camera becomes both archive and grave. Subtextual ache is carried in objects—hourglass grain, fossil imprint—never stated. Final image reweights “curiosity as mourning” from interior question to material fact: the photograph is the ghost. No moralizing; resonance is imagistic and irreversible.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is science-poetic: “vitrified regolith glittered like shattered glass,” “bioluminescent regret,” each metaphor filtered through a geologist’s precision. Rhythm modulates—long breaths during Earthrise melancholy, staccato clicks at shutter release. No dialogue, so dialogue mechanics waived. Perceptual signature is exact: tooth-marks on focus ring, haptic heartbeat sync, suitspeak field notes. Compression and elision (“no political will for intervention”) are pattern-taught and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Prose is dense yet aerodynamic: every sentence layers sensorium and stakes. No loops or scaffold; no mixed metaphors. One register drift—“conceptual alarm set to the dawning hush” leans academic (−0.2) but recovered immediately by concrete handling. Peak beat (“quiet congregation greeting the invisible dawn”) sustains clarity under pressure. Final line cadence mirrors anemone fold, achieving sonic closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: lunar extinction event told through chemical hourglass, film camera, and bioluminescent anemones—no prior template matches. Risk of lyric overdrive is embraced yet controlled; specificity keeps it from ornament. The stolen grain as twin timer is an indelible device that could not be swapped. Emotional truth—grief for ungrieved species—feels urgent, not derivative. Concept commits fully to selenic melancholy without retreat.</comment>
