<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The guardian’s shift from cataloguer to frost-laced sentinel is dramatized through her ritual of approach/retreat at the threshold; the final refusal to cross charges her stance with visible cost—she returns “wearing the expanded boundary…like a second fur.” Interior contradiction is alive in scene: she both longs for the pre-sleep plane of stable knowledge and protects the mutable garden that replaced it. Pendant negotiation and paw-print erasure are micro-choices that re-weight her identity without explanatory labels.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: she renounces passage, placing the pendant on the ice, a renunciation that costs her the talisman and the certainty it pulses. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each frost layer, mist breath, and boundary pulse accrues until the final image reconfigures meaning—“the expanded boundary of light she now wore like a second fur.” Causality is internal yet legible: because she waits without forcing, the boundary thaws just enough to reveal the alternate garden, making her refusal meaningful. Cost is unmistakable: the warm spring garden stays unattainable, the pendant abandoned, uncertainty adopted as companion.</comment>

<comment>The frozen garden is no backdrop; its rosemary parchment shrubs and topiary ice sculptures constrain movement and supply the scent-track she follows. The copper pendant’s temperature shifts (warm→cool) tether reader to micro-climate changes that foreshadow her final choice. Spatial choreography is exact: paw prints fill with mist behind her, erasing path evidence, a visual correlate to the boundary’s refusal to resolve. Environment, body, and tool converge in the final image—boundary-light as second fur—charging the closing beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—guardian’s negotiation with uncertainty—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens through nightly ritual repetition; the final refusal forecloses crossing, crystallizing her stance. Pressure is textural: each frost strand, Morse blink, and mist exhalation thickens until choice becomes binary—step through or retreat. No external antagonist is needed; the threshold’s tidal light is sufficient opposing force. Cost is legible yet diffuse (loss of pendant, un-frozen garden glimpsed but renounced), barely missing the visible-price bar for 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from concrete ritual: knowledge as living garden that refuses stasis. Subtext resides in pendant Morse and paw-print erasure—meaning is made by relinquishing proof. Final image reweights earlier “books as exteriorized souls” idea: the guardian herself becomes an open text, fur pages turning in moonlight. No moral is stated; resonance lingers in the copper eye staring at a moon that might once have been a reading lamp.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric, syntactically varied, and fur-filtered: “breath crystallizing into tiny suspended commas” is perception-specific, never generic. Compression taught early (“dimensionally homesick”) is paid off in final fur-as-boundary image. No head-hopping; POV remains inside the guardian’s flickering between beast and librarian memory. Rhythm modulates with pressure—long accumulative clauses build, then break into the decisive “She did not cross.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Figurative density is high but patterned: frost as marginalia, moon as illuminated initial; mixed metaphors avoided. One scaffold spot: “interiorizing exteriors” is repeated verbatim; however, the phrase is concept-charged and re-prices at closure, so the loop is functional. Information density strong—single sentences deliver scent, temperature, and metaphysical rule. No artifacts touch the final beat; last line is clean, rhythmic, and propulsive.</comment>

<comment>Feral librarian + frozen dream garden fuses tropes into fresh image-system; guardian who catalogues by waiting is non-obvious. Pendant-as-eye/blinking Morse converts generic occult object into epistemic device. Final refusal to cross re-invents “threshold guardian” as self-guardian, a conceptual twist earned by prior ritual. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off: closure image recharges every frost comma and unread scent without gimmickry.</comment>
