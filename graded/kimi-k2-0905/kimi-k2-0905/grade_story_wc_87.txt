<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory pull between dead charts and live water is dramatized in every paddle stroke; the compass gash baptizes her so the choice to keep paddling emerges from body-level cost, not lecture. Interiority stays salty and specific—no psych labels, only marrow listening to marrow. 9.0+ gate met: contradictory impulses act in scene and renunciation of old navigation is paid with the cracked glass still leaking cold water.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: each pole light and swell thickens texture until “the widening yes” re-prices prior motifs. Closure (Conceptual Repricing) lands when she smiles at the uncharted black—cost is the lifelong absence of any reliable star, accepted on-page. Transitions are legible (shore → channel → open sea), anchors set by line 3, pattern taught early; no orientation debt. 9+ quick test passed: cost is visible (“compass pressed to her chest like a stethoscope”), lens holds, cracked compass constrains final tactic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Body, tool, and water micro-settings constrain every decision: cracked compass slashes suit, salt enters, route changes. Pole-light hues and dolphin neon are not garnish—they are the only map she allows herself, charging the final image when poles end and “black and uncharted” becomes the new medium. Airy risk of 9.0 withheld only because one sodium-orange descriptor edges toward cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—whether she will dare to paddle without certainties—tightens when each pole light (her improvised map) is swallowed by fog, forcing the final paddle into total black. Cost is visible: suit breach, compass useless, prior lover’s demand foregone. Agency drives every beat; coincidence (dolphins) complicates rather than rescues. Just shy of 8.8 because the tightening could be sharpened by an explicit moment where she could still turn back and refuses.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: navigation after betrayal of self requires inventing maps that acknowledge their own fiction. The merrily melancholic tone prevents nihilism—each loss becomes percussion in “night’s orchestra.” No final moralizing; the widening yes reweights earlier “latitude by longing” line into lived freedom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct—navigational lexicon filtered through grief: “charts were just paper apologies,” “latitude by longing, longitude by loss.” Rhythm swells and contracts with paddle cadence; no filter-verb fog. Lyric compression is taught early (“blinking sentinels”) and paid off in final “widening yes.” Minor dock for one hyphenated coinage that borders cute.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High metaphor density but pattern is taught (“merrily melancholic god”) and sustains rather than obscures causality. No mixed metaphors, loops, or scaffold; information density excellent—one sentence flicks paddle, faith, and black water. Slight register lift in “conceptual repricing” phrase nudges below 8.8.</comment>
<question>8</question><question>8.5</question><comment>Taking utility poles as constellation is fresh, specific, and inevitable in hindsight; risk heightens stakes without gimmickry. Tropes of sea-redemption are transformed through occupational detail and cracked compass. Only minor deduction for faint echo of “living lighthouses” image seen elsewhere.</comment>
