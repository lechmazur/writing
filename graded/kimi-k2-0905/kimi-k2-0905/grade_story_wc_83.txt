<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The survivor’s grief-driven obsession is viscerally embodied through the geode’s weight and the telescope hunt; every micro-choice (smashing the breaker, stepping onto the rail) is credibly compelled by loss. Interior contradiction—savior vs grave-robber—survives the lyric compression. The final renunciation costs his life and is earned by the prior cascade of harvested futures.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the protagonist’s suicide dive re-aims the telescope .003°, trading his remaining life for a village’s survival—cost is unmistakable. Causal chain holds: geode maps → breaker smash → wind shift → drone rerouted. Orientation is taught by line 3 (“floating observatory…three miles above”), waived penalty. One shard, single POV, 738 words—scope clean.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transparent floor, hissing helium sacs, cooling breakers—each detail is filtered through grief-urgency and later weaponized (breaker smash, telescope tilt). The geode’s jagged edges against ribs function as micro-setting that literally cuts and guides choice. Final image of desert rushing up recharges the opening crater, environment constraining the fatal decision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“harvest unlived futures to reroute death”—is signaled in line 5 and tightens when he chooses to smash the breaker, sacrificing more geode and self. Each hunt beat raises cost: geode fragments → stardust → final crumble; options narrow to one last dive. Escalation is causal under lens; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: grief commodifies possibility, turning tragedy into resource. Final image reframes earlier “unfiltered awakening” as the survivor becoming someone else’s unused future—resonant, non-moralizing. Geode dust echoing champagne flasts reweights wedding memory into lethal currency.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>First-person voice maintains distinct perceptual signature: scientific diction (“perturbation theory,” .003°) collides with synesthetic grief (“tasted like wedding cake”). Rhythm accelerates into staccato final paragraph without losing clarity. No head-hop; compression is pattern-taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences layer sensory, emotional, and conceptual work (“geode’s dust swirled into patterns resembling wedding guests raising champagne flutes”). Metaphors stay coherent under physics-of-grief logic. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; final third is artifact-free.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: quantum grief-hunter who weaponizes unused futures via broken wedding gift. Risky second-person address to deceased bride and suicide-as-redirect feel inevitable, not gimmicky. Concept commits fully; no retreat into safe sentiment.</comment>
