<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The carpenter’s interior contradiction—scepticism versus need—is dramatised in the moment he touches the fragment; the ache in his throat and the wooden horses’ impossible neigh embody embodied emotion. Micro-choices (kneeling, singing in memory, stepping onto the mirrored pool) expose a hierarchy of values where reclaimed wonder outweighs physical safety. The Earned Stasis is fully paid: he walks away carrying irreversible internal music, leaving carousel notes spinning in dirt—a visible, felt cost. No stock phrasing; every trait emerges through sanding-rough sensory memory.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because the carpenter seeks silence-as-possibility, therefore he enters the train; because he sings memory, the fragment dissolves into him, reconfiguring the world. The Decisive Change lands on the page—his throat opens to “a new silence—full, round, and singing”—with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“abandoned circus train rusted beneath a sky of misting hush”). Persistent constraint: the halo’s dissolution means he can never again hear silence as absence; this shapes his final purposeful wrong turn.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The train itself—curved ribs, torn velvet, shattered mirror corridor—functions as both geography and moral maze, constraining his path to the overturned car pool. Micro-setting objects (sawdust glittering with gold paint, brass pole warming under a child’s palm) are handled, not catalogued, and return transformed in memory-song. The vines threading “green notes on a staff of starlight” charge the final image by equipping the pool that mirrors sky, making the halo legible. Environmental logic stays intact: rainwater collects only where ceiling is torn open; reflection physics respected when he steps onto unbroken surface.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“interpret silence as possibility”—is declared early and tightened when the fragment projects the trapeze artist’s unfinished song, forcing him to supply the missing music. Escalation is singular but sufficient: the fragment’s hover reweights knowledge, proving silence houses melody that demands voice. Cost is visible: the halo dissolves inside him, foreclosing return to wordless carpentry. No coincidence; every intensification stems from his tactile engagement with fragment and pool.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: the muteness of abandoned art is repaired only when a witness consents to supply the missing sound. Subtext lives in gesture—wooden horses flaring nostrils at scent of memory—rather than declaration. Final image of rails shimmering with carousel notes offers Conceptual Repricing: the world itself becomes sheet music for the brave. No moralizing; resonance is visceral, inviting reflection on who bears responsibility for completing unfinished performances.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is relentless lyricism—“misting hush,” “chime of wind bells,” “whispering gleam”—yet every neologism is taught early and paid off at closure. Compression (“a lullaby of almost”) is patterned, not decorative, and remains legible under causal lens. Syntax mirrors emotional arc: clauses lengthen during memory-song, then fracture into single-note sentences as halo dissolves. No head-hopping; single POV maintains consistent psychic distance even during impossible sensory events.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density: “the sigh of a brass pole warming under a child’s palm” does triple sensory and emotional work. Rhythm alternates between long breathy sentences and hammer-short fragments, accelerating through the fragment hover without algorithmic pattern. One coherence slip—“rainwater had collected… forming a shallow pool that mirrored the sky so perfectly he stepped onto the surface expecting to fall upward” risks mixed metaphor (fall upward), but physical logic is instantly restored by next clause. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; figurative language is selective, never stacked in closure zone.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fusion of abandoned-circus and music-as-light tropes is made specific through carpenter’s occupational memory and the physics of rainwater sheet-music. Risk-taking—singing without mouth, wooden horses neighing—pays off because internal causality (memory = notes) is established early. Fresh inflection: the halo does not grant voice but reveals pre-existing internal choir, repricing silence itself as fertile medium. Transformation test fails if names changed; carousel carpentry and trapeze physics are irreplaceable.</comment>
