<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses—illicit rooftop gardening and tender mentorship—co-exist in every beat; the final renunciation of the stolen tooth is earned by her prior thefts of soil and sky, paid for with the literal fall of the rose petal and the lavender pressed into the boy’s palm.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative-textural lens: the rose’s last petal → stolen gauge → basement darkness → lavender sprig chain escalates density rather than causal reversals; the final Charged Poise on the parapet reweights “reflect light” from metaphor to lived stakes with the visible cost of the dropped brass tooth and the boy’s pocketed moon.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The harbor moonlight functions as both blade and lamp, constraining Mara’s stealth path up the fire escape and later illuminating the boy’s face; the rusted railing, paint-bucket soil, and gutter-bound brass shard are micro-settings that charge the closure image where nasturtium will root in stolen inches.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A single meaningful tightening: the bolted stairwell door narrows options to one illicit entry; the price—permanent loss of the gauge tooth and exposure risk—lands on-page and forces the stance crystallization atop the parapet.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the organic chain of stolen earth, forbidden blooms, and transplanted light; no moral is stated—only the final image of lavender in a pocket reweights “garden” as portable, contraband hope, inviting reader reflection without sentimentality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person hovers at Mara’s shoulder, filtering moonlight through gardener-perception: “tomatoes fruit in paint buckets,” “homesick for Provence”; rhythm swells and subsides like oar-strokes, teaching the pattern early and holding it to the final glide down the stairs.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Few scaffolding loops; occasional modifier clusters (“papery petal like a tiny eviction notice”) ride the lyrical wave without muddling causality; high information density—each sentence layers scent, texture, and stakes—propelling to the clink of brass in gutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fire-escape agriculture as night-time heist, moonlit rower as living metronome, and lock-tooth sacrificed for a leaf—specific synthesis feels inevitable; risk of lyrical overload is embraced yet controlled, yielding a fresh angle on urban trespass as nurture.</comment>
