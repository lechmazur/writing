<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ambrose’s contradiction—archivist of promises now forced to become the living archive of broken ones—peaks when he writes the Hittite word and feels the orchard tilt; the cost is embodied, irreversible, and foreshadowed by his childhood memory. Micro-choices (tweezers, quince-ink stylus, pressing forehead to palm) tether occult premise to corporal stakes. Interiority stays concrete: “a low note that would hum whenever someone…broke a promise” gives the cosmic curse a bodily residence. Flaw: passive reception of prophecy slightly outweighs active decision, capping at 8.9.</question>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: wax shaving → vision → dissolving ribbon → ledger braille each intensify texture and re-weight the stake (“the archive had inverted”). Closure is a Charged Poise: Ambrose waits to answer in “a voice neither alive nor dead, only remaining,” making the conceptual cost undeniable. The 1958 memory is the single allowed reflective block (~18% of text) and it tilts present stance by revealing he has always been the vessel. Orientation, transitions, and causal ripple all serve this final crystallization.</question>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rooftop orchard, phonograph shard, quince-ink, and 2 000-year palm seed are all specific, never decorative; each constrains choice (wax demands tweezers, tree hosts the ledger, ink becomes stylus). The foghorn’s absence is felt as atmospheric pressure, not mentioned color. Spatial choreography stays clean across single rooftop zone. Sensory hierarchy obeys an archivist’s gaze: grooves, translucence, braille texture prioritized over visual panorama. Only micro-slip: date-palm seed detail late-introduced yet accepted as accelerant for final image.</question>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: will Ambrose silence the accidental prophecy or embody it? Escalation is textural: every beat adds density—wax lands, speaks, dissolves; fruits bear faces; ledger rises in braille—until the only path left is endurance. Cost is visible: his pulse is “stored in their unresolved chords.” No reversal, yet deepening forces stance crystallization precisely as accumulative design demands.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme—memory as debt—emerges through images rather than assertion: the shaving “remembering something it had never been given,” fruit-mouths silently accusing, braille that wants to be read after sight fails. Final image reweights premise: the city will feel “an ache it could not name,” turning the entire skyline into a braille text of broken promises. No moral is offered; ambiguity is purposeful and haunting.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyric-archivist: precise Latinate diction (“medlar,” “xylem,” “consecrated”) yet modulates into liturgical cadence for prophecy. Perceptual signature filters world through tactile antiquity—sound grooves, wax warmth, ink sinking into fiber—never sliding into tour-guide exposition. Compression (“quinces rustled without wind”) taught early and paid off at closure. No dialogue, so cadence control carries entire emotional arc; succeeds.</question>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentence music is deliberate but never cloying: long breathless clauses mimic foghorn sustain, then fracture into single-word fragments (“only remaining”). Metaphors stay internally coherent (wax as ribbon, orchard as tuning fork). Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, knowledge, or pressure. Minor density spike in paragraph 4 where three metaphors stack, but pattern serves accelerando to vision release, hence forgiven.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</question><comment>The premise—urban foghorn spirit migrates into rooftop orchard via children’s Edison cylinder speaking Hittite—synthesizes steampunk relic, linguistics, and hauntology in a way that feels both inevitable and unwritten before. Specificity seeds freshness: Judean date palm from 2 000-year seed, medlar fruit faces, quince-ink stylus. Risk of occult technobabble embraced yet controlled through sensory grounding. Transforms rather than uses prompts.</comment>
