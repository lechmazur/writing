<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Posy’s translator-mission is vivid and embodied; her micro-choice to speak memories into the box is a visible cost. Interiority is specific, not therapeutic: “bones humming with the lonesome splendor.” Contradictory impulse—hoarding voices vs. giving them away—drives the climax. The child’s arrival is external pressure, but relationship shift is implied, not dramatized on page, keeping this just below 9.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: hologram “We are still becoming” reweights every prior coin and jar. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of bottled sounds tightens until release. Cost is felt—Posy “weightless,” pennies revealed as invitations, not currency. Causality is lyric rather than because/therefore, but pattern is taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Half-buried ship ribs, driftwood altar, and music box form micro-setting that constrains the ritual. Apricot-salt air and rose-gold sunrise charge the final glow. Spatial choreography is clean: jar-to-box-to-hologram sequence is trackable. Environment and tool jointly deliver the closing image, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Dominant stake—save generational memory from dissolution—signals in paragraph 3 and tightens when child requests great-grandmother’s song. One meaningful deepening: empty jar accepts the child’s whispered hope, foreclosing Posy’s hoarding option. Cost is conceptual—she gives the memories away, loses sole ownership. Escalation is lyrical, not causal, but remains coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Theme emerges from image pattern: coins as invitations, jars as offerings, music box as communal hearth. No moral statement; final hologram lets reader reweight meaning. Particulars—kelp-stitched blankets, enamel ocean faded to bruise—keep universals tethered. Child’s hope reprises earlier pennies, creating resonant reconfiguration without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Lyric third-person POV stays tight to Posy’s perceptual signature: wind “slithered,” gulls “preached.” Syntax swells and contracts with ritual cadence; no head-hop. Diction (“salt-bleached arches,” “apricot salt”) remains within poet-vagrant lexicon. Compression and elision are pattern-taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: long breathy sentences for dawn swell, staccato clauses for jar sealing. No scaffold loops; each sentence adds image or pressure. Metaphors stay coherent—music box heart, pennies as seeds. Information density high; no filler adjectives. Closure line “bridge built of every voice” lands clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Fresh synthesis: refugee music box + sound-bottling + penny toll creates non-obvious ritual. Risk of lyrical accumulative structure pays off with coherent closure. Specificity of “apricot salt” and “faded enamel ocean” anchors magic in sensory truth. Premise is not transplantable; voice and stakes collapse if any element swapped.</comment>
