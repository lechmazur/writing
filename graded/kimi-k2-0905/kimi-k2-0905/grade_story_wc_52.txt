<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mara’s grief is embodied in tactile micro-choices—thumb tracing grain, sweeping shavings into labeled jars—so her interiority never drifts into label-speak. The contradiction between clinging and letting-go is held in scene, not summarized. The final renunciation (hanging the latch, accepting rust-hued peace) is visibly foreclosed by every cut she has made. Hairline slip: “eyes closed in mercy or grief—she could no longer tell” edges toward explanatory abstraction, but the next sentence immediately re-grounds in sanding the photograph.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: rain-light, sawdust curls, and kettle steam layer into a density shift that reweights memory’s cost. Closure is a Charged Poise—finished carving on sill, latch hung, skylight reflecting both her face and “empty ring below”—a crystallized moment where containment and release coexist with undeniable conceptual cost. Causality remains intact: each carving cut is because/therefore linked to Emil’s absence. No orientation debt; anchors (who, where, when) are clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Rain-beaded skylight, ash blank, cold latch, and labeled jars form a tight micro-setting that constrains every move: the loft’s hush dictates her whispered commands, the windowsill’s first-light determines the carving’s placement. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—circus-widow notices rope-callus, sawdust color, gutter drip—never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is clean: bench → windowsill → nail → jar shelf. One hairline slip: “tent sighing” is an aural memory without present tent, but it is brief and symbolic convenience is avoided.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—contain memory or be consumed—signals in paragraph one and tightens with each curl fallen. Agency is renunciation-carving; each cut narrows options until the latch’s relocation forecloses reopening the cage. Visible prices: blood-soaked sawdust color transmutes into “rust-hued peace,” a felt pigment stain on every curl. Escalation is accumulative density, not causal reversal; one meaningful intensification suffices and lands with conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of containment vs. release emerges organically from the carving act; no character sermonizes “grief must be shaped.” Subtext lives in gesture—three whispered commands to an absent lion and dead husband—implicating that obedience now belongs to memory, not predator. Final image reweights “here and gone” without moral: skylight mirrors both her face and empty ring, making the reader feel the double exposure. No thematic echo sentences; abstraction is resisted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is circus-widow specific: mane-ribbon memory, safety-rope callus, scent of thunder, “wait, watch, come” as private liturgy. Rhythm modulates—long breathless coils for carving, clipped fragments for kettle clicks—mirroring emotional pressure. No dialogue, so voice remains pure interior; register never drifts into academic diction. Compression taught early (“here and gone” repeated) pays off in final line reprise.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud ear varies cadence; no template stems or synonym loops. Metaphors stay coherent—wood grain = mane, rust = blood = peace—without mixed vehicle crash. Information density high: “curl that fell carried rust-hued peace” does double job (action + color theme). Minor scaffold: “the way” twice in two sentences mid-text, but not in closure beat, so −0.2 only. Opening and final lines anchor and recharge voice cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Lion-tamer’s widow carving a memory-cage from wagon latch and tent-stake chisel is non-obvious synthesis of circus grief and craft. Risk of lyric accumulative structure pays off: closure image would collapse if any shard (rain, kettle, sawdust) were swapped for generic equivalent. Transformation test passes—story would fail without circus specificity of mane-ribbon, cage commands, sawdust soaking blood. No close echoes of famous scenes; emotional truth trumps surface novelty.</comment>
