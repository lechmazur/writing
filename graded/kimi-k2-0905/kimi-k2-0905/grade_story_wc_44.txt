<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lyra’s quietly deliberate nature is shown through her methodical winding of the key and her willingness to trade her own shadow; the interiority is concrete (“she whispered a new rune…”) and the final renunciation is earned. The flaw is that her contradictory impulses are told more than embodied—no moment where she visibly hesitates or her body betrays her. Still, the hierarchy of values is legible: knowledge > personal wholeness, and the cost is felt when her shadow waves goodbye.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: Lyra’s shadow is re-united with her, a Decisive Change that reweights the world’s physics. The “closed loops” logic is taught early (orrery rings) and paid off when she walks the Möbius night; cost is visible in the fused key-heart of the automaton. The only micro-slip is that the spoons’ reality-bend is declared, not demonstrated, but the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds because the final image reconfigures absence itself.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The observatory’s brass orrery and mirrored automaton chest function as micro-setting that literally constrains her choices—she must slot the key, must walk the spiral. Sensory film is selective: moonlight angle revealing ᚦ, iris diaphragms widening “like memory.” Spatial choreography is flawless; the island’s drift and the balcony’s vantage are tracked without drift. The final image of continents brightening as shadows reattach shows environment evolving with event.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“where shadows go at noon”—is signaled in line 5 and tightened when Lyra sees her own shadow wave goodbye inside the automaton. The reversal (she must give her shadow away to restore everyone else’s) narrows her option set under Accumulative pressure. Cost is visible: the automaton’s fused key-chest, her own silhouette lost then returned. The escalation is one steady crescendo rather than multiple turns, fitting the lyric mode.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the concrete image of a shadow that waves goodbye: absence as a living piece of the self. The final rune “shaped like an open eye balanced on a spoon” offers a Conceptual Repricing that reweights the earlier spoon-bending gimmick into a metaphysical lesson—remembering what absence teaches. No moral is stated; the note left for visitors crystallizes the cost without sermon. The ambiguity is meaningful: did she lose or complete herself? Both readings coexist.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric, compressed, rhythmically controlled: “stars smeared into silver spoons” marries sound to sense. Perceptual signature is scholar-precise: angles, brass, runes, equations. The diction stays within Lyra’s plausible lexicon yet reaches for metaphor without purple drift. Patterned repetition (“quietly deliberate”) is intentional, taught early, and paid off in the final hush. No head-hopping; the single POV is rock-steady.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentence density is high: “she set the rings to rotate backward, clicking the key into a dormant automaton” does three jobs in one breath. No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors; figurative language is sparse, precise, and coherent. The final paragraph’s lullaby cadence is earned, not template. Minor nip: “continent brightened” could lose “suddenly,” but this is below artifact threshold. Closure image is crystal.</comment>

<comment>The spoon-bent reality could have been whimsical gimmickry, yet here it becomes a serious metaphysics of absence. The floating isle-as-orrery is fresh, and the idea that noon is the moment we remember how to hold our shadow reconfigures familiar folklore. Risk is high—lyric accumulation rather than causal plot—but the closure reweights everything that came before. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight: rune, key, loop, shadow, spoon all converge in the final sigil.</comment>
