<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Corin’s interiority is vivid—his “throat tightened,” “scientifically romantic mind,” and the exact micro-choice of crushing the sphere enact a hierarchy of values. The contradiction between quantifying emotion and surrendering to unmeasurable presence is dramatized in scene, not summarized. Mira’s status shift from friend to chosen co-architect of the new method is legible in the deliberate-accidental finger brush and her whisper. Final renunciation is earned: seven years of distilled suns abandoned in one beat whose cost glows on their joined palms.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: crushing the pocket-sun releases rather than traps light, reweighting the entire premise. The columella curl’s return charged with Mira’s breath is the visible, felt cost. Causal lens holds throughout: every beat is a “because” leading to the renunciation that forecloses the old commerce. No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) appear by line 3 and tighten.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ember nexus is not backdrop but active crucible—volcanic glass sings when irradiated, luminous veins guide body placement. Micro-setting of the shell constrains choice: spiral geometry teaches the “return differently” mechanics that close the story. Sensory hierarchy obeys crisis: twilight heat narrows perception to boot-sole glass and palm-pressed spiral. Final gold bath reconfigures the physical space, turning shadows into ribbons that literally tie past to future.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“how to capture presence without killing it”—tightens the instant Corin decides to crush rather than sell the sphere, paying the visible price of seven years’ commerce. Escalation is causal: each reflection on “absence” he has sold propels the final act of release. Pressure peaks when Mira’s whispered breath charges the shell, forcing the either/or between preservation and sharing. Cost is on-page: the pocket-sun’s destruction sears their palms and ends his Guild-protected livelihood.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the spiral image: presence is not a substance to bottle but a path to re-walk together. Subtext resides in silence—Mira’s unheard whisper and the unspoken history of joint discovery—rather than exposition. Final image offers conceptual repricing: light shared sideways instead of stored upward becomes the new currency. No moralizing; the reconfigured rule-set is shown by gold washing the glass, not told.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Narrative voice is scientifically romantic—oxytocin milligrams beside caramel-stretch time—without register drift. Perceptual signature is Corin’s: spirals as mathematics, starfire as commerce, shadows as ribbons. Syntax tightens under pressure: single-sentence paragraph “I’ve been selling absence” delivers peak confession. No head-hop; Mira’s interiority is accessed only through Corin’s interpretation of her touch and tear-salt.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with scene needs: long accumulative sentences build density, then fracture at climax. Information density high—“compressed light without context, heat without hearth” does triple lexical, emotional, thematic work. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances choice or image. Metaphor vehicles stay coherent: volcanic glass sings, light becomes ribbon, spiral equals return path—no mixed logic.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Pocket-sun commerce converted into anti-commodity gift is fresh synthesis of alchemy and anti-capitalist romance. Nautilus heart as calcified mentor wisdom transforms familiar mentor relic trope into geometric instruction manual. Risk of crushing living light paid off by literal re-illumination of shared past. Specificity—columella curl, ember nexus, glass flowers—anchors universals; swap any detail and the mechanism collapses.</comment>
