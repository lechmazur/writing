<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is lush, embodied, and idiosyncratic—her catalog of corpses’ final thoughts is a character-specific lens. The final dispersal is earned because every beat has shown her converting grief into cosmetic ritual; the cost is the literal dissolution of self. No contradictory impulses are staged in-scene, only recollection, so the arc rides one steady vector rather than twisting—still, the vector lands with visible price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a crystal-clear Resonant Reconfiguration: she becomes the ferryman by dissolving into the river—cost is the image of her shoes liquefying into color. Accumulative lens holds: each static pattern she harvests tightens the lattice that finally replaces her bones. Orientation is taught early via the repeated nightly pilgrimage; no causality breaks. The ending reweights every prior cosmetic act as self-portraiture—an undeniable conceptual repricing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The skyborne grotto is not backdrop; its mirror pool and aurora condensate are the tools that enable the infusion and final transmutation. Micro-setting—the emerald chip pressed to sternum—literally becomes her new skeleton. Spatial choreography is immaculate: kneel, brush, step, dissolve. Environment constrains the only possible resolution, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capture oblivion-bound sparks—signals in paragraph 1 and tightens with each corpse-pattern added. One meaningful deepening: when she sees her own aged face inside the chip, the task flips from rescue to self-sacrifice. Cost is legible the instant green light threads her veins. Under accumulative lens the pressure is density-driven rather than reversals, sufficient for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: beauty as ferryman is enacted, never named. The emerald chip’s shift from souvenir to heart-valve reconfigures “make-up” as make-self. Final image seeds new constellations—an unspoken answer to how art defends against forgetting. No moralizing, only charged poise.</comment>

<question>6</question><<grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is irreducibly her own: the mortician’s professional cataloguing of rigor maps sits beside dragon-scale bioluminescence without wobble. Syntax lengthens under aurora hush, then fragments as shoes dissolve—rhythmic control mirrors bodily dispersal. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent—every noticed detail is either cosmetic or stellar. Compression (“water—or whatever element the pool truly was”) teaches the reader to accept elision early and pays off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet aerated: each sentence carries image + emotion + mythic referent without clog. No loops or scaffold; figurative chains are coherent—static constellations, cooling maps, lattice of bones extend the same metaphor field. Register never drifts above the character’s arcane craft lexicon. One hairline slip: “radiant hush” is repeated verbatim; still, the reprise feels ceremonial rather than accidental.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Core combo—cosmetologist of the dead + sky aurora grotto—feels instantly mythic yet never seen before. Dragon tear duct as memory chip fuses fantasy and mortuary science into one inimitable object. Risk of full bodily dissolution is embraced, not hedged, making the metaphor literal. The synthesis is so specific that swapping any detail collapses the entire edifice.</comment>
