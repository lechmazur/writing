<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elian’s interiority is concrete and embodied (“fracture lines like fault lines in his own chest”), micro-choices (each knot untied) track under rising pressure, and the final renunciation—“broken things… let the light through”—is earned via the causal chain of unraveling. Flaw: no contradictory impulse is staged in-scene; he moves from task to task with single-minded competence, so the shift feels therapeutic rather than crucible-forged.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the last image of “maps” reframes earlier breaks with conceptual cost (he must keep unmaking masks). Causal lens holds—each because/therefore link from mask fracture → net → knot → released spirit is intact. One soft spot: orientation anchor (who/where/when) appears after the 120-word mark, but the delay is purposeful and pays off in the prism refraction image, so waiver applies.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary is not backdrop; its refracted starlight literally paints Elian’s face and guides the ritual choreography. The net’s “small mouth swallowing sound” micro-setting doubles as antagonist, constraining every finger movement. Tool-as-setting (tapestry needle) charges the final image when it “cools” after the last knot, marking elapsed cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“give voices back”—is signaled early; pressure tightens with each knot that accumulates silencing water around his feet. One visible price: the fisherman's solidity increases as Elian’s lung-fill of silence peaks, forcing the choice to continue despite personal drowning risk. Escalation is linear, not reversal-based, but the causal lens makes the deepening sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges entirely through image-pattern: breaking as revelation, maps as acceptance of fracture. Final “let the light through” reweights every prior porcelain crack without moralizing. Subtext in the fisherman's parting touch—“felt like wind”—compresses gratitude and release into a single sensory cue.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Lyric third-person stays close to Elian’s tactile bias; syntax lengthens during knot work then shortens at release, mirroring breath. Perceptual signature is consistent—“interlaced hush,” “salt and old songs” idiom belongs to a restorer who tastes materials. No filter-verb stacks; moonlight “threaded” is the only figurative risk and it pays off immediately.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is rhythmically varied, information-dense; most sentences carry sensory + causal dual load. One paraphrase loop (“each knot… a knot undone”) mid-story costs −0.2. Figurative layering is high but taught early (“masks hummed”) so does not obscure. Closure image is uncluttered, ensuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Folklore of mask-restoration merged with net-unraveling afterlife is fresh; synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure heightens quiet stakes without gimmickry. Could edge higher but the fisherman’s story is generic maritime tragedy—more specific familial detail would sharpen originality.</comment>
