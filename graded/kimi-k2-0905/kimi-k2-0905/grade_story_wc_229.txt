<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical and consistent; the assistant’s grief and need to “prove whispers travel farther” drive every beat. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene—intent is monolithic—so the psychological edge is blunted. The final beckoning gesture is credible and charged, earning the endurance stance with felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: scent, glass, and light repeat with intensifying density until the final prism-scatter reweights the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise—options crystallize as the boat turns, the cost is the lifelong transmission she accepts. Anchors (who/where/when) are taught by line 3; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cobalt tower, vial cork, night garden, and salt air are filtered through a perfumer’s nose; each constrains the ritual mechanics. Spatial choreography is flawless—stairs, lamp room, fountain, horizon track cleanly. The micro-setting of cork-on-railing charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“prove soft vibrations reach farther”—is signaled early and tightens as each sensory beat purifies intent. The boat’s barely perceptible course change is the earned reversal, visible price paid in lifelong vigil she embraces. No external antagonist is needed; pressure is internal and atmospheric.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from iterative images: glass, scent, pulse, beam—each re-priced by the final prism. No abstract thesis is stated; meaning is accrued through sensory particulars. The tenderness-is-louder-than-rage proposition is left resonantly ambiguous, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a perfumed, salt-tinged diction that is unmistakably singular. Rhythm modulates with climb-descent-climb structure, mirroring heartbeat beacon. No dialogue, so no voice convergence; perceptual signature remains coherent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Metaphors are dense but internally coherent—glass, scent, vibration logic stays consistent. No loops or scaffold; sentences vary in length and syntax. One mixed vehicle (“screaming tenderness”) is forgiven at climax because it is the core tonal coin.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The lighthouse-as-scent-transmitter is fresh; familiar grief ritual is retooled through perfumery physics. Risky lyric compression could have collapsed into perfume-ad pastiche, but specificity of cobalt, mercury, jasmine grounds it. Final prism-image feels inevitable, not gimmicky.</comment>
