<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The returnee’s interior contradiction—yearning to heal a faith she no longer trusts—drives every beat; her choice to plant the gnomon in the ruins crystallizes the arc. Micro-choices (kneeling to a skull, aligning the dial on vertebrae) embody embodied cost. The caretaker’s secondary pressure is thin but sufficient; her flaws (exile’s guilt, need for proof) compound until she accepts rooted stasis. Cost is felt: she forfeits further exile and accepts guardianship of an unfinishable rebuilding.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the prayer house re-assembles itself at sunrise, shadow by shadow, reconfiguring belief without declaring victory. Causal linkage holds: each noon alignment of the dial shortens the shadow, foreshadowing the bell that rings tongue-less. The opening orients by 50 words; mosaic shards (tomb, orchard, ruins) braid cleanly under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Persistent constraint—the sundial cemented into chapel floor—guarantees she is now planet-anchored, exile foreclosed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard functions as micro-setting: root-bone arches literally reroute her steps toward the ruins. Sensory hierarchy narrows to scent (myrrh exhalation), temperature (warm bronze), and haptic shadow—each constrains her next placement of the dial. Spatial choreography is flawless; bodies, bones, and root growth track across days without drift. The environment’s final reconfiguration (wood remembers shape) charges the closure image under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can interrupted belief be re-circuited?—tightens when each vertebra alignment shortens the shadow, proving time still votes here. One meaningful deepening: brass mirrors fracture her face into twelve ancestral departures, making exile’s cost visceral. No reversal is needed; pressure accrues through root-bone knitting and the caretaker’s question that cannot be answered by theft. Final cost is the permanent caretaking she accepts, foreclosing further flight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from image pattern: shadow, seed, bone, ring—each reweights the meaning of return without moralizing. Subtext lives in silence: the boy’s copper-colored eyes watch her kneel, asking if return is pillage; her hymn answers without apology. Final image—planet’s spin confirmed beneath cemented dial—re-prices faith as orbital, not absolute. No thematic echo is spoken; the bell rings without tongue, letting reader feel the re-circuiting.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric distance stays stable, filtering perception through exile’s sensory disorientation. Syntax lengthens during unearthed-mirror awe, then compresses into breathless clauses at bell-rebirth, mirroring pulse. Diction remains within returnee’s plausible lexicon yet allows “warmly curious fingers” for roots without register drift. No head-hopping; caretaker’s interior is implied only through gesture and laughter “bright as breaking glass.”</comment>

<comment>Read-aloud rhythm modulates: fossilized petals / boots crunch / sundial base pulses—three stressed beats that echo heartbeat. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new sensory layer or causal cue. Metaphors are coherent: “reluctant mouth” for gate, “clay drums” for skulls—both extend setting logic. One near-muddle: “time had not forgotten this place even if the gods had” skirts abstraction, but is saved by embodied shadow proof two lines later.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: diaspora return meets ossuary arbor meets horologic resurrection—three unlikely domains fused through organic root circuitry. Risk of enchantment is high, yet the story teaches its rule set early (shadow shortens on bone) and pays off in a bell that re-members itself without miracle speech. Specificity anchors novelty: oxidized-copper eyes, myrrh-scented exhalation, rib-polished gnomon. Transformation test fails if any element swapped; orchard-bone-dial triad is irreplicable.</comment>
