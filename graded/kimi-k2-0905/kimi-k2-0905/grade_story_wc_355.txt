<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Mirelle’s pacifist-velvet-coat iconography is vivid, but interior contradiction is narrated rather than dramatized; the final “broadcasting” renunciation is earned yet telegraphed in self-mythologizing tone that slightly softens felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the clasp becomes a public “lighthouse” whose cost is the lifelong carrying of every named silence; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds as each frequency deepens the density of hush. Orientation is clear by word 60, causality intact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Workshop micro-setting constrains every move—radio on bench, skylight stars, sawdust under boots—and charges the final image: doors left open transform the space into an ongoing invitation. Sensory selection is POV-driven, never touristic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—catalogue silence before fireworks—tightens via each tuned frequency; the “final stillness” clock is live, foreclosing further listening once explosions start. Cost is visible: relinquishing the clasp itself, now warmed and broadcasting.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the accretion of silences; the ending’s “silence that lets the world speak” is an image, not a sermon. Subtext lives in gesture—tears glittering like rehearsal fireworks—avoiding abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is consistent—cedar smells like truce, iron like surrender—maintaining lyric distance without head-hop. Rhythmic compression (“boots creaking like polite applause”) is taught early and paid off in the mute blooming chrysanthemum.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High figurative density stays purposeful; no mixed metaphors or loops. One scaffold phrase—“velvet patches over bullet holes” appears twice—minor, outside closure beat. Otherwise propulsive syntax, varied sentence lengths, clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The “tuning silence” premise is non-obvious and fully committed; brass clasp as tuning fork reframes trauma therapy into spectral radio repair. Specificity of named silences prevents generic nowhere setting; risk heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
