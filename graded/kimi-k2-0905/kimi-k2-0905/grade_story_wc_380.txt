<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Miren’s grief-driven obsession is embodied in every micro-choice—pressing her palm to cold iron, kneeling to lay flowers on a salt-shadow—so the interior contradiction between mourning and mission is alive in scene. The final decision to scatter the dust and keep lighting lanterns earns its cost: she forecloses personal possession of the memories in exchange for diffused civic duty, visible in the steady flame despite trembling hands. No secondary character applies pressure, so relationship crucible is N/A; headcount stays coherent. The only drag is a hairline slide toward poetic diagnostic-speak (“she understood then that…”); still, the choice is causally grounded and carries felt ballast.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the gravity pockets collapse, memories disperse, and Miren accepts the role of lantern-keeper—an Earned Stasis with visible cost (dust released, sister’s laughter settling as ballast). Causal chain holds: whale sighting → tracking → chamber ritual → memory dispersal → lantern vigil; no teleports or retro-fixes. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (dock-side, dawn, cold iron) and again at ~100 words inside the salt chamber; no penalty. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: the tightening spiral of sensory density (salt, mist, fireflies) reweights the stake until the final image reconfigures meaning.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The salt crystal chamber functions as both micro-setting and tool: its breathing rainbows and thickened gravity arcs physically constrain Miren’s steps and force the ritual trajectory. The whale’s vanished carcass and the lantern pole serve as recurring objects whose altered states (steam → gone; flowers → dust) charge the final image. Spatial choreography is spotless: railing, pier, descent, cluster pathways, ascent track without drift. Sensory economy is exemplary—cold iron, steaming blubber, iron-tasting mist—each filtered through Miren’s professional attention to weight and light.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—retrieve/deal with deleted memories—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightens when the gravity pockets collapse into a single point, forcing the choice to release rather than keep them. Escalation is textural: each sensory layer (salt, mist, fireflies) increases density until the option to possess the memories is foreclosed. Cost is palpable: flowers crumbled to dust, Miren’s hands tremoring as she lights the last lantern. No coincidence; all pressure emerges from whale-borne world logic.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme—deleted memory as communal sediment, not erasure—emerges through the whale-as-archive and the final dispersal into city lungs; no moralizing statement. The wildflowers’ color return→crumble arc reweights meaning without symbolic bullying. Subtext resides in silence: the dockworkers’ unconscious dreaming is the socially distributed cost of state deletion. Final image of “gleaming silence between flame and dawn” offers a non-literal, charged answer to the core question of where lost memory goes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited clings tightly to Miren’s perceptual bias—she notices gravity’s tug, lantern codes, sailors’ coffee spirals—creating a distinct maritime-occult idiom. Syntax tilts toward lyric compression (“gravity like broken glass,” “gleaming silence”) but stays legible and pattern-taught early. No head-hopping; psychic distance shortens under stress (“taste of iron and forgetting”). Register remains within a dock-worker’s plausible lexicon; no corporate drift. Dialogue is absent by design; voice coherence is high.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally: long breathless accumulations mirror gravity arcs; fragmentary percussive lines mark the collapse (“They did not return as narrative but as sensation…”). Figurative language is sparse and purposeful—no mixed metaphors, no filler scaffold. Information density is high: one line often does two jobs (“Its massive body had breached at midnight, crushing three warehouses and scattering the gravity like broken glass”). Minor template echo in “she would return tomorrow, and the next day” −0.2, but it serves cadence rather than clutter. Closure image is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The whale-as-roving-archive is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of climate-fantasy and surveillance critique; the deleted-memory pollen dispersed into sleeping citizens feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk—lyric accumulative structure instead of plot reversals—pays off when the final lantern flare reconfigures civic memory without exposition. No stock tropes; even “pressed wildflowers” is transformed from sentimental keepsake to data cartridge. The conceptual commitment never blinks; specificity throughout anchors universals.</comment>
