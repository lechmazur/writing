<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The titan’s contradictory impulses—guardian precision vs. mercy that erases the usurper from memory—are shown in embodied micro-choices: climbing the carrel, whispering clues, letting the pellet hover. Each action reveals a hierarchy of values (balance > revenge) with visible cost: the choice to forget the man’s face, narrated as an active renunciation. Interiority is concrete (“voice calm as closed winter”), never diagnostic. The final moral calculus is earned because the pellet’s drift is first dramatized in the library gutters and then paid for on the pretender’s skin.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the ink droplet sinking through mist reconfigures both identity and cosmos, undeniable conceptual cost under Accumulative lens. Causality is immaculate—each marginalium is a because/therefore beat that funnels the pretender to the pellet. The “constellations inhale” anchor is given by line 3 and paid off when they exhale at the end; orientation debt is waived because the disorientation is pattern-taught and serves the final image. No teleporting props, no retroactive rules; the pellet’s logic is established before it becomes the agent of sundering.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The library is not backdrop but hydraulic system: spines crack, gutters press pellets, dust motes rise into a coronet that dissolves—every surface exerts choice-pressure. Sensory hierarchy is POV-filtered (the titan smells rust where pages forget meaning). The iron pellet functions as micro-setting; its mite-size and iron-gall chemistry constrain how it can be hidden and later weaponized. Final image of shelves “an inch closer to earth” is a physical echo of the cosmological rebalancing, charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“illusion must be weighed or the future skews”—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightens when the pretender licks his thumb, smearing accusation. One meaningful deepening: the pellet waits not for entitlement but for someone who feels epochal vertigo; this narrows eligibility to the titan himself, raising cost. Escalation is textural accretion of marginalia + ink smear; the price is the pretender’s face melting and the titan’s active choice to forget—both legible on page. No coincidence; glamour fails because titan’s map-making forced the thumb-contact.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme—“truth drifts until someone chooses to anchor it”—emerges solely through concrete actions: pellet pressed, clues doodled, ink sinking. Subtext is carried in gesture (thumb-lick) and inverse coronet that dissolves before crowning. Final message is renunciation of revenge, not moral sermon; ambiguity lingers in “choose again tomorrow.” The library dust forming an almost-crown is the thematic image: legitimacy is particulate, never fixed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Third-person omniscient is stable, yet perceptual signature is unmistakably the titan’s: distances measured in candlesticks, time in constellation breaths. Syntax glitters with winter cadence (“voice calm as closed winter”) yet never drifts into purple; diction stays within alchemical lexicon. No head-hop; pretender’s interior is surfaced only through external tells (thumb-lick, frown). Register remains mythic without archaism; rhythm accelerates at pellet-flight then closes with monosyllabic forget-jab.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops, zero scaffold; every sentence does double duty (“galvanized dust motes rose like liberated subjects”). Metaphors are coherent: ink as constellation, glamour as brocade, collapse as graceful. No filter-verb stacks; verbs are strong (“threading,” “quivered,” “unraveling”). Final line anchors the motif: “every throne is only ink yet to fade” recharges earlier pellet and marginalia, satisfying read-aloud ear test.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fusion of pocket-sized titan with astrological jurisprudence is fresh; “rune of drift” rewrites identity theft as cosmological accounting. Library-as-galactic-clock and ink-pellet-as-sceptre are non-obvious syntheses. Risky second-person address to “you” in final colophon is earned because the whole story is a set of marginalia addressed to a future reader. Transformation test passes: swap titan for human and the stake collapses; the scale-specific body is integral.</comment>
