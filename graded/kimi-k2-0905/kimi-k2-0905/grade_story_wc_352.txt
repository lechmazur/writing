<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Ilyra’s single-minded quest is vivid, but interiority is filtered through lush world-detail rather than embodied contradiction; the doodle’s cooling is the only moment we feel her body decide. No conflicting want vs fear is staged on the page, so the final smile feels lightly earned rather than costly. Still, her micro-choices (splitting perception along indigo, modulating whisper) track a clear hierarchy of values under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: inversion → access → kernel mapping → chant risk → tail restored → memory surge, each step because/therefore. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the Archive remembers, but the grotto will reset and she must repeat—cost is the eternal return. The manuscript-page fibers carrying “latent blaze” make the price visible and persistent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ultraviolet quartz veins, upward-droplet lanterns, and gravity-frayed patches are selective, sensuous, and continually steer tactics; the doodle itself becomes micro-setting that constrains movement. Spatial choreography is crystal: she slides along the indigo band, arcs back through threshold effects, lands among ferns—no drift. Environment directly charges the final image as the fibers glow with rescued names.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore Archive memory—surfaces in paragraph four and tightens when seeds stir at the sound of their own names, forcing her to hush or be incinerated. One meaningful trade-off: she spends the doodle’s ink to project the list, forfeiting her compass for the final dash. Cost is legible; persistent constraint established (she must return each inversion).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of cyclical memory-work emerges through refrains: combinations “seek refuge in oblivion,” seeds “resettle into dream,” Ilyra will “remember how to find them.” No moralizing—just the iron-tasting whisper and blank page as earned resonance. The final reweighting: knowledge is never possessed, only re-loaned each cycle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person hovers at a lyric distance that matches the prism-minded POV: syntax fractures into spectral bands, verbs like “drift-walked” and “twitch like a living scale” create perceptual signature. No head-hopping; tense/modality stable. Compression (“she inhaled, fractured her vision”) is taught early and pays off in the indigo swim.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with gravity shifts—long sentences float, staccato beats return when time narrows. Figurative layering is dense but patterned (color-as-motion, ink-as-compass) and never muddies causality. Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence adds motion or charge. Minor over-adornment in “terrestrial kiss” but does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Gravity-inverting archive heist feels fresh, yet the core genius is turning a scrap of marginalia into both map and sacrifice. Threshold-color navigation and kernel-whispering invent credible micro-physics that refract character goal. Risk—lyric overload—could have capsized clarity, but the piece stays legible and emotionally weighted.</comment>
