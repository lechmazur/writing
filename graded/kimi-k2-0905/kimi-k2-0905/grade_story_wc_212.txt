<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The seed saver’s interiority is vivid—gloved palm on glass, acorn cap warming in pocket—but her contradictory impulses (preserve vs. circulate) are stated more than dramatized. The final choice to split the vortex between seeds and self is credible and costly, yet the micro-moment of hesitation that would make it felt is compressed into lyric summary rather than embodied beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: splitting the bead reconfigures time and seeds her pulse with spiral cost. Causal logic holds—sap slows vortex, seeds descend, cap fractures—under an Accumulative/Textural lens where image density, not plot reversals, reweights stakes. The ledger warning and egg hatch are well-placed foreshadow, anchoring the entropy mechanic early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The icebound atrium is not mere backdrop; its frost geometry, starlight, and reversing fountain constrain every gesture. The acorn cap functions as micro-setting—its hollow becomes soil, cradle, and fracture line—directly shaping the final choice. Sensory hierarchy stays tight: cold glass, warm cap, silk-dawn texture of borrowed time, all filtered through the gardener’s tactile priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reopen linear time by decreasing entropy—is signaled in paragraph three and tightened when the bead offers a either/or swallow. The protagonist’s agency drives the turn: she renounces both preservation and surrender, instead circulating the spiral, a choice that visibly costs her the seeds and embeds half the vortex in her heartbeat. Price is legible on-page; options narrow from cosmos to cap to cracked bead.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</question><grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: saving possibility is not hoarding but circulation. The final image—silk tearing and mending beneath her boots—reprises the vortex inheritance without moralizing. Subtext resides in the lullaby shouted across a storm, a contradiction that quietly reweights “wild serenity” from oxymoron to operational ethos.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly focalized; perceptual signature is gardener-specific—starlight as second moon, seeds as constellations. Compression (“time exhaled”) is pattern-taught early and paid off in the final silk-tear cadence. No head-hopping; psychic distance contracts from cosmic to cap to pulse without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmically controlled—long breathless sentences mirror vortex suction, then shorten at the crack. No synonym loops; “furiously tranquil” returns twice, each time reweighted. Mixed metaphors are scarce; one strained “lullaby shouted across a storm” is voice-motivated and legible. Closing line achieves Charged Poise without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cosmic egg, entropy debt, and oak-cap key are welded into a fresh myth that feels inevitable in hindsight. The gardener’s solution—circulate, not clutch—flips the usual eco-apocalypse script. Risky lyric compression is sustained without clarity loss; the final silk-tear image is indelible and non-transferable to another prop.</comment>
