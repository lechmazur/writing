<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marrow’s interiority is sensorily rich (“crevasse-blue ice”, “second heart”) and her stoic vocation holds; the smile at the end supplies a visible earned thaw. Yet her late decisions—lifting the intact globe, leaving the mirror—come almost gift-wrapped by the glacier rather than wrested through a prior contradiction we can feel. Micro-choices inside the shrine (palms sticking, candles lighting) are strong, but the peak beat feels guided by wonder more than by conflicted will.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each shard adds density until the final mirror reweights the stake. Closure lands cleanly (Charged Poise: mirror = resolved tapestry) with conceptual cost. Orientation is waived—disorientation is taught early by dream logic and glacier geography—but a thin “because” linkage between the shrine corridor and the safe-find weakens the final tightening turn, capping high-band entry.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Selective sensory layering (cold candles burning, jellyfish memories) keeps ice/air/body hierarchy credible; glacier and shrine act as pressure vessel and projection screen respectively, both constraining her path and charging the final mirror image. Spatial choreography is fluid and tracked without drift. Micro-setting (the unfrozen water sphere) literally cages the climax object, qualifying for 9+ gate; minor cap because glacier physics stay poetic rather than tactile-crisp.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (salvage something pure) is signaled early; pressure deepens by accretion of dream-cameo fragments that foreclose randomness and force pattern recognition. The tightening is poetically felt—mirror as proof of tapestry—but not a tactics-altering trade-off; price is conceptual rather than option-narrowing, keeping it shy of 8.8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of collective memory vs. individual dream-cargo emerges through image accumulation (snow-globe planetarium, hymn of salt) rather than exposition. Final mirror reweights prior cameos from random to woven without moralizing; ambiguity lingers on who truly needed rescuing. Epiphany is earned, though the thesis line “even wreckage can cradle light” flirts with echo penalty; it is saved by being embedded in an action (leaving the mirror).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Voice sustains lyric compression (“glacier groaned like a sleeping whale”) and perceptual signature of a diver-attuned to pressure, cold, and spectral sound. Patterned repetition (“windows”, “candles”, “snow globe”) is taught early and pays off in final mirror; no head-hopping. Diction stays within poetic register without register drift, though occasional abstract nouns (“connection”, “forgiveness”) soften the final hymn line slightly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence detected. Metaphors are coherent within dream-logic physics. High information density achieved through fused images (“love letters fused into a single diamond of ink”) but two adjacent sentences paraphrase globe projection effect (-0.2). No artifacts near closure; clarity intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: glacier-wreck as collective unconscious archive, snow globe as both artifact and perceptual lens. Dream-cameo framing offers non-obvious angle on hauntology; risk-taking (lyric mosaic, abstract climax) stays coherent under accretive lens and charges closure image. Would fail if transplanted to generic haunted-house setting—specificity drives originality.</comment>
