<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is richly embodied—she kneels, presses sand, hears roots—but the pacifist/bounty-hunter tension is told more than dramatized; no moment forces her to test that contradiction under visible cost. The final graft carries symbolic weight yet feels inevitable rather than a wrenching renunciation. Still, her perceptual signature is specific and sustained, earning high-band character presence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the canvas-woven rose reweights her parents’ opposed legacies with undeniably felt cost under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality holds: father’s violent trace → literal graft into living stem, mother’s peace ethic → hybrid bloom; the quiet dome seals the transfer. One micro-turn at dawn crystallizes options without soft reset; no teleporting props or orientation drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cracked dome, warm sand, torn canvas, and rose canes cohere as micro-setting that constrains every action; the greenhouse becomes a crucible where destruction is metabolized. Sensory hierarchy follows Mira’s gardener bias—scent, soil temperature, petal hue—never tourist catalog. Final image of canvas weave in burnished-copper petal could not occur without this exact glass-enclosed desert pocket.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—continuity versus chaos—tightens once via grafting act that forecloses vengeance and pays visible price: thorns pierce, night labor exhausts, father’s trace is literally subsumed. Escalation is accretive rather than causal-reversal, but pressure remains coherent; each graft thickens the cost of choosing peace. Coincidence absent; no abstract stakes untested on page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: transformation of violence into growth via living medium. No moralizing—final image of “tranquil blaze” reconfigures prior motifs (canvas, roses, dome cracks) without literal statement. Subtext resides in silence, scent, and woven texture; complexity lingers—father’s spirit is both honored and negated. Resonant reconfiguration satisfies high-band requirement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice owns a gardener’s compressed lyricism: “inculcating plants with values,” “senselessly perceptive eyes.” Rhythm accelerates during night graft, breathes at dawn reveal; no filter-verb stacks. Diction stays within Mira’s plausible lexicon; perceptual signature is consistent and distinct. Elision of external dialogue is purposeful—quiet is thematic instrument, not omission.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; sentences perform double duty (e.g., “canvas fragment… resembled the lines etched into her mother’s weathered hands” marries object, backstory, and emotional lineage). Metaphors stay physically coherent—canvas weave transfers to stem pattern. Final line couples sound and image without overwriting. High information density maintained; minor register elevation (“senselessly perceptive”) is earned by voice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fusion of post-apocalyptic ruin with tender horticultural alchemy feels fresh; canvas-from-wreck grafted into living rose is non-obvious synthesis. Quiet revolution via plant inculcation subverts typical vengeance arc. Specificity of coral-cream forgiveness petals could not transplant to another tale. Risk is present—lyric quiet ending—but coherence holds; no derivative template detected.</comment>
