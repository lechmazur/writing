<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Luma’s defiance-of-despair motive is declared early and drives every beat; her micro-choice to trade shell-for-knot, to dust the sentry, to kneel and conceal the fuse all flow from that urge. Interiority stays concrete—“lost starlight pool behind her eyes”—rather than abstract. The final renunciation (empty satchel, road ahead) costs her the literal tools of her craft, so the path is foreclosed on the page. Governor’s stunted antagonism is sketchy, but the single-POV keeps pressure pinned to her, not spread thin; no label-speak in peak beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: eclipse-corked sky → Luma’s arrival → trade → stealth ascent → rocket heart → sky cracked → hourglass sand floats; each beat because/therefore narrows options. Closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost—the fused glass heart orbits the governor’s wrists, sand now playful fireflies, proving order has been mock-gravity-charged. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) appear in first 50 words; no ambiguity at end. No props teleport; the rag knot’s note fuses inside the flame, paying off setup.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fortress “stone petals unfolding violet and gold” is not postcard scenery; the spiral stair murals and dry moat directly shape her stealth path and the sentry encounter. The kerosene rag knot functions as micro-setting, handled in ≥2 beats (trade, fuse concealment) and returns transformed in the fused glass heart, charging the final image—meets 9+ gate. Sensory selection skews visual, but urgency justifies the narrow aperture; no static repetition. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from moat → stair → battlement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—crack the corked sky or surrender her craft—signaled in paragraph 4 and tightened at the governor’s razor-thin consent. Escalation is causal: each covert prep (trade, dust, conceal) raises exposure cost until the single rocket becomes an all-or-nothing wager. Price is on-page: her satchel ends empty, the governor’s hourglass rule-set literally rewired. No coincidence resolves; luck complicates only when the sky first refuses to fall, then yields to her deliberate burn.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete spectacle: playfulness as insurgent gravity against calcified order. The fused mosaic heart drifting higher is the non-literal answer—serious play made artifact—reweighting “Remember” from souvenir to sky-writing without a stated moral. No final-paragraph sermon; the image does the work. Counter-readings (is she just another imposed wonder?) remain plausible, preserving complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly fused to Luma’s perceptual filter: “satchel clinking like distant thunder,” “tiles click like teeth.” Syntax flexes with pressure—fragments accelerate during ignition. No head-hop; governor’s interior inferred only through gesture/hourglass. Dialogue minimal but voice-motivated: Jax whispers, governor speaks “thin as a razor,” each diction calibrated to status. Patterned repetition (“chanting”) is taught early and pays off in final line, legible under causal lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Rhythmic control mirrors ascent—short clangorous sentences at moat, elongated clauses up the spiral, staccato crackle at ignition. Mixed metaphors avoided; “corked heavens” and “glass heart” stay coherent within fireworks lexis. Information density high: one sentence often layers sensory data, emotional stakes, and causal push. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; “stone petals” and “blooming fortress” recur with purpose, not filler. Copy-clean; punctuation exact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses eclipse folklore with pyrotechnic craft; the “note in mosaic” is a fresh inflection unseen in slush. Risky lyric escalation pays off: the sky literally cracks along invisible seams, yet causality holds because every beat prepares the fuse path. Transformation test fails if you swap “fireworks designer” for generic mage—her trade-specific tools (shell, rag knot, silver dust) drive every tactic. Specificity anchors universality; the piece commits fully to its serious-playful tone without hedging.</comment>
