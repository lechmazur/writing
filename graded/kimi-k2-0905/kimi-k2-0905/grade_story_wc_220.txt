<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Scraps’ shift from corpse-tracker to life-finder is embodied in every sniff and limp; the nose-to-syntax beat inside the archive shows interiority without label-speak. Kite’s micro-choices—barefoot slide down rebar, fingers on the crank—externalize grief and trust. Brother’s emergence reprises the riddle, proving the hound’s new vocation costs her nothing yet renames her: the courier who teaches distance to kneel. Only the brother’s sudden poetic fluency feels slightly unearned, a hairline slip at closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the leaf’s softening wax reweights “distance into closeness” with orchard-scented cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (ozone pop, lithium 500, iron 300) densifies until the needle skip crystallizes coordinates. Orientation is taught by the hound’s nose within 120 words; disorientation never materializes. The final image of threshold-leaf and wind-shift from gunpowder to smoke is an earned sunrise.</comment>

<comment>Scrap-yard towers of rusted drones, moon-struck wax, and leaf-veins-as-blood create a micro-setting that literally guides choice: the translucent wax spills “sunrise” across the archive floor, triggering the intuitive leap. Spatial choreography is flawless—rebar perch, Edison player, buried subway hatch—every prop handled, none floating. Weather evolves from bruised sky to rising sun, mirroring tonal shift without overt symbolism. The leaf-as-map constrains the final brother-location beat, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“translate distance into closeness”—tightens when the riddle forecloses every path but naming the leaf. The archive scene is the single meaningful deepening: wax-light reveals answer, needle skip pays cost, tactics irrevocably narrow to olfactory coordinates. No reversals are needed; one escalation under Accumulative lens suffices. Cost is visible: the leaf warms against skin, wax softens, scent of orchard replaces gunpowder—price is sensory, not abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the repeating riddle-structure: preservation that burns yet is not consumed—distance-as-leaf, war-as-wax, memory-as-groove. No character articulates thesis; meaning is borne by sensory returns (wax, copper, orchard smoke). Final image reconfigures premise: closeness was never geographic but nominal—name and you are home. Ambiguity lingers in the humming scrap-metal choir, resisting tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person omniscient stays bloodhound-close: every noticed scent is职业-specific, every color filtered through canine dusk-vision. Syntax stretches—”the wild hush that follows artillery”—yet remains within a hound’s temporal sense. No head-hopping; Kite’s interior enters only via gesture observable to nose/eye. Rhythmic control peaks at needle-skip list (iron 300, lithium 500) where propulsion outruns punctuation without loss of clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances scent, image, or choice. Figurative density serves pattern: copper/iron/blood color-rhyme is taught early and paid off when sunrise-blood becomes orchard-smoke. No mixed metaphors; vehicles stay metallic or vegetal. Filter-verb count is minimal—smells translate directly to syntax without “she could smell.” Final line earns its paradoxical quiet through cumulative sensory reversal.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fusion of phonograph-as-olfactory-GPS and leaf-as-wax-map feels inevitable yet unexampled. Post-war bloodhound repurposed from death to life trackers freshes both genre tropes. Risk: lyric ellipsis (“wild hush”) could tip into abstraction, but is grounded by scrap-metal hum at closure. Transformation test fails—swap hound for human and the scent-syntax collapse dissolves the story, confirming irreplaceability.</comment>
