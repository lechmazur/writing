<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mira’s interior contradictions—yearning for permanence yet destroying her art—are embodied in the tactile act of sweeping the mandala into a straight line; the final silent laugh crystallizes a credible renunciation. The chalk-dust tongue and lilac taste give sensory specificity, but the “socially perceptive” label is merely asserted, never tested by on-page interaction, so the trait stays decorative. Her choice to scatter the hush is clearly foreshadowed by earlier spirals and by the tile’s whisper, so the renunciation feels earned, yet the absence of any secondary character keeps relationship pressure off the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each added grain, echo, and color-density reweights the stake of impermanence until the radial storm literalizes the release. Orientation is swift—within 60 words we have grotto, twilight, mist—and the single scene never blurs. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the blank crumbling flake and lilac-tinted air reconfigure meaning without exposition; cost is felt in the vanished mandala and the empty pocket.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The grotto’s damp stone, quartz circle, and hot-brick scent constrain posture and tool use; the lilac mist becomes a micro-setting that dyes skin and tasting air, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean—kneel, rake, sprinkle, fling—no impossible positions. Environmental rules remain consistent: the hush thickens as material is added, then disperses when the mandala is scattered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—can impermanence hold meaning?—tightens when each added grain intensifies the hush and the tile’s voices beg to stay heard. The decisive escalation is the sweep that breaks the spiral: it narrows options by destroying the artwork, forcing acceptance of erasure as the price of listening. cost is visceral in the vanished sand and the blank flake; no coincidence intrudes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: meaning is motion, not monument. The returning lilac, spiral, and whisper reweight from dread to acceptance through tactile particulars; the final image of “space shaped like a woman” offers a resonant, non-moral answer. No abstract thesis is declared; the insight is earned by the destroyed mandala and the salt tasted in silent laughter.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is consistent: Mira thinks in textures—chalk dust on tongue, porcelain snow, lilac tasting like salt—syntax remains sinuous, mirroring spirals. No dialogue, so no register clash; free-indirect stays clean. Rhythm modulates from long breathy sentences during listening to staccato “She raised… flung” at release, matching pressure without head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: cumulative clauses mimic inhalation, then short verbs mirror scatter. Metaphors stay coherent—mist as watercolor, hush as congregation—and serve action, not ornament. One paraphrase loop (“meaning felt like chalk dust… present but unformed”) is minor; no mixed metaphors or template cadences obscure closure. Information density high: one sentence can anchor, scent, and foreshadow.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of chalk art, acoustic tile shard, and emergent hush as a ritual of unlearning feels fresh and inevitable; no template plot is followed. Specificity—“porcelain snow,” “lilac unease”—anchors the concept, and the risk of a nearly mute scene heightens rather than obscures stakes. The final image of a grotto carrying a woman-shaped cavity is memorable and non-replicable.</comment>
