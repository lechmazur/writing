<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The coachman’s renunciation of violence and embrace of seed-bearing is earned through a chain of embodied micro-choices (pod selection, tongue bleeding, feather placement) that externalize his interior contradiction between mourning and repair. His dead-language fluency is not a label but a visceral pressure—“hummed inside his ribs like bees that had forgotten the sun”—and the final silence of those languages after the scattering feels like a limb amputated on the page. Cost is visible: literal blood on the living tongue, the cedar box now empty, the carriage permanently re-purposed. The gull relationship functions as a crucible, forcing him to translate between species and thereby confront the human-oath he must now keep alone.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the battlefield dissolves into a glowing grove and the coachman whispers “begin,” re-pricing his entire vocation under a new covenant. Causality holds: because he speaks the trilobite syllables, the seeds strike metal and bloom; because the gull answers, he locates the exact acre. Orientation is swift—twilight, blooming jetty, coral dust—taught by line 3. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: each added layer of dead tongue, seed, and floral note tightens the chord until the final cadence widens the “narrow vastness” into a road. Cost is legible in the split pod, bleeding tongue, and the horses now smelling of salt and petals—constraint that forecloses weapon-cargo forever.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The blooming jetty is no backdrop but an active agent: its planks split and become soil, roots crack concrete, and the scent of petal-salt guides the dead soldiers home. Micro-setting extends to the cedar box whose interior state—first glimmering coffins, then vacant—tracks the moral transition. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: the coachman notices taste-of-salt flowers and trumpet-drowned gull-calls, never tourist catalog. The final image of underwater kelp-like grove beneath starlight recharges every earlier reef-death reference with undeniably reversed coralline life.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will the battlefield keep bleeding or be gardened—tightens when the “forgive” pod is chosen; that single act forecloses the option to carry weapons again. Escalation is textural: each dead language syllable adds silt-weight until the metal flowers bloom, releasing the treaty chord. Cost is visible—tongue blood, empty box, rust-feather tucked—and the final road widens only because the bitter acre surrendered its bitterness. No coincidence resolves; the gull’s testimony complicates but the coachman’s agency drives every turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: peace is not declared but planted, a slow vegetal conquest that costs the planter his tongue, his cargo, and his prior identity. The submerged concord re-weights from broken treaty to audible chord, showing memory can be fertile rather than cruel. Moral complexity holds—soldiers remain dead, garden feeds on their bones—avoiding tidy redemption. Final image of coral polyps “remembering the shape of peace” offers a non-literal, conceptual answer to the central question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is singular, compressed, mythic: “narrow vastness,” “flower-drunk sand,” “drowned trumpet” create a perceptual signature that could belong to no other narrator. Patterned elision—absence of articles, stacked noun phrases—is taught by line 2 and held to the final “begin.” Rhythm modulates with pressure: long litany of extinct species accelerates breath, then final sentence slows to match patient vegetal conquest. No dialogue, so interior texture must carry all subtext; dead languages function as inner speech that bleeds outward.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High information density: “wheels grinding coral dust that had once been alive” does world, history, and sensory work in one clause. Figurative coherence remains intact—metal flowers shaped as outstretched hands extend the treaty metaphor without violating physical logic. Minor scaffold: two “then” transitions and one “until” could be cut, but artifacts never approach the closure beat. Read-aloud rhythm varies sentence length and opening, culminating in the monosyllabic release: “He whispered a single word… ‘begin.’”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise—grief-stricken coachman re-seeding a drowned battlefield via extinct languages and gull testimony—feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Transformation test: swap any detail (parrot for gull, coins for seeds) and the entire moral calculus collapses. Risk is high—lyric accumulation, no human antagonist, vegetal resolution—but coherence holds. Fresh inflection: peace as photosynthetic reparations, treaty audible as chord released by blooming metal.</comment>
