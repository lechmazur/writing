<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lira’s pacifist cunning is shown through her weaponized lullaby-box; the moment she accepts her own shadow-anger metabolizes into the same carbon as wheat fields, her interior contradiction combusts on the page and legitimizes the Earned Stasis closure. Interiority stays embodied—”cellar crumble inside her chest”—rather than diagnostic. Micro-choice hierarchy is legible: broken pin over rifle, shared silence over speech, renunciation of the box over possession. The only drag is the late-arriving shadow-self; its blade-sharp accusation is powerful but slightly under-cued, trimming the top band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: leaving the silenced, doubly-broken box reweights the entire rule-set—peace is not mended melody but willingness to keep turning damage. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens; each ghost’s thaw is a density increase signaled by sensory pattern breaks (stone→silk, ceiling→sky). Orientation is taught early via the melting-glass simile; by 120 words we know who, where, and the non-causal dream logic. Persistent constraint—broken pin that can never sound again—shapes every tactic and is visible in the final image, satisfying cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The sanctuary itself is the micro-setting that constrains choice: breathing walls and angle-forgetting floors physically deny weapon-based solutions. Sensory economy is fierce—”juice running like forgotten rivers down her chin” fuses taste and corporeal rescue in one stroke. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly across three shifting environments (stone→silk→lake) without a pronoun or anchor drift. The music box as recurring object charges the final image when abandoned, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can pre-war joy biochemically outvote post-mortem rage—tightens once when Lira realizes her own crates of anger must be metabolized; this deepens rather than reverses, sufficient for 600-word scope. Escalation is textural: each ghost’s thaw adds sensory pattern breaks that narrow pacifist options toward renunciation. Cost is legible—she forfeits the box and any future song, a concrete forfeiture paid on the page. Agency is interior yet active; her cellular surrender drives the final quieting of the sanctuary.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme—peace as biochemical surrender rather than victory—emerges through recurrent carbon imagery (bomb→wheat→drawings) without a single overt thesis. Subtext operates in gesture: the box’s silence after the second snap says more about forgiveness than any declaration. The final image of three silhouettes against a horizon that keeps forgetting where it began performs a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. No moralizing line violates the show-don’t-tell covenant.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyric third-person hovers at a consistent mythic distance; patterned elision (”reappears when needed”) is taught in the first paragraph and paid off when the box is abandoned. Syntax mirrors melting glass—long enjambed clauses liquefy, then snap into fragments at pin-break moments. Perceptual signature is Lira-centric: every sensual note is filtered through her cellular memory project. No head-hopping; even the shadow-self speaks with her own sharpened voice, preserving focalization.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Read-aloud ear test passes: varied sentence lengths create tidal rhythm that breathes with the sanctuary. Metaphors are coherent—glass melting does not contradict later lake imagery because both serve liquefaction motif. No scaffold loops; each sentence adds new sensory or causal grain. Information density is high—”carbon that once formed wheat fields and children’s drawings” compresses cosmology into eight words without crowding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The pacifist-weaponized music-box conceit is non-obvious synthesis of war-ghost tale and cellular-memory science metaphor. Shifting grace as a world rule that reappears objects when needed is freshly deployed to make renunciation possible—she can abandon the box because it will return to the next peacemaker. Risky lyric structure commits fully; coherence survives without causal linearity because pattern is taught early. Final carbon-through-strawberries image feels inevitable only in hindsight, satisfying the transformation test.</comment>
