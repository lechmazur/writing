<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira’s lucid-dreamer lens is vivid—equations in her hair, salt-breath sync—but the “observer’s courage / fear²” epiphany arrives as told equation, not embodied choice. Interiority is lush yet stays cerebral; no bodily toll or micro-choice visibly forecloses a path, so the closure’s cost feels conceptual rather than lived. Still, her perceptual signature is specific and consistent, holding the piece above mid-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the balloon’s ascent reweights the grotto patterns, and “hope = watched becoming watcher” crystallizes new meaning with conceptual cost. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—each balloon, shell, kelp strand layers density until the final image reconfigures reality—so lens holds. Orientation is anchored by 40 words; no teleporting props. Minor slip: the blood-drop equation is declared, not dramatized, so the price is felt abstractly, not viscerally.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The tide-grotto is not backdrop but instrument: phosphorescence guides attention, salt breath syncs pulse, smooth walls force barefoot choreography. Micro-setting rule satisfied—gauge, shells, kelp strands act as tactile tools that constrain pattern creation and later reconfigure into the final sentence. Sensory economy is tight; every gleam or strand recurs with shifted meaning. Only nit: “dawn-before-language” balloon color edges toward purple, but image lands cleanly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—revitalizing consensus reality—signaled early; pressure escalates via pattern accumulation rather than causal reversals. One meaningful deepening: shells spiral into new constellations, braiding wings, narrowing options to “write next variable.” Cost is conceptual (observer now watched) rather than tangible; visible price would lift higher. Agency is attentional—writing equation, pricking finger—but the turn hinges on symbolic surrender, not tactical forfeiture.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from iterative images: balloon = hope, shell = collapsed possibility, kelp = frayed timeline. Final sentence reweights these particulars into “altitude of the watched becoming watcher” without moralizing. No abstract thesis stated; resonance is optical and kinetic. Slight deduction for overt equation utterance, though it is brief and in-character.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric-scientific: “equations in her sleep,” “salt breath synchronize,” syntax mirrors a mind that thinks in spirals. Diction stays within Mira’s compass—no register drift. Repetition is patterned (“lucidly watchful,” “serene upheaval”) taught early and reprised at closure. Rhythm breathes with tide cadence; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image or idea. Figurative vehicles stay coherent—balloon, tide, spiral—no mixed metaphors. One paraphrase loop: “polished smooth by the next wave, the next dream, the next trial balloon” is intentional cadence, not artifact. Opening and closing lines are sculpted, recharging motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: quantum hope-mechanics enacted through coastal craft project. Risk of overt abstraction is embraced yet grounded in tactile shells and salt. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable yet unforeseen. No derivative templates; the speculative equation is specific to this grotto, this Mira.</comment>
