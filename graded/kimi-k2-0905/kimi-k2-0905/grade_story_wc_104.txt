<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Her interiority is vivid—“patient as drought-grass” breathing through rusted manacles—but the endurance/renunciation closure is declared rather than dramatized with visible cost; we are told “liberation is only the first prize” instead of feeling the forfeiture. The strategic patience trait is shown in the piano-bench decoding and the waltz that nets the guards, yet the final scattering of seeds reads as symbolic coda rather than a choice that forecloses a live path. No contradictory impulses collide in-scene; she moves from captivity to savior with unbroken competence, flattening internal tension.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The story lands a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the cellophane-arrow banner and the footprints spelling the minor seventh reweight the premise—liberation is planting, not escape—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is intact: piano cipher → south → vault → scatter, each because/therefore link visible. Cost is present but soft: the chain still drags, yet she walks away light; the felt price is implied rather than etched on the page, holding the score below 8.5.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Setting is the crucible: cracked mirror wall, buckled door, netting of stuffed dragons—every carnival relic is weaponized to impede the guards or guide her hand. The Tilt-A-Whirl hatch and dry soil beneath are not backdrop but the tactical objective whose texture she presses seeds into with reverence. Sensory hierarchy obeys crisis: first groan of concrete, cellophane flash, dust rolling like brass music—perception narrows to immediacies. Spatial choreography tracks clean from mirror wall to netting tangle to operator booth; no impossible positions or floating props.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—resilience planted for post-regime children—is signaled early and tightened once: she must impede guards without gunfire or the vault will be buried. One meaningful deepening occurs when the arrow is repurposed as non-lethal decoy, narrowing tactics and raising personal risk. Cost is legible but light: chain still drags, sirens converge, yet she exits unharmed; the price is conceptual (future peril) rather than embodied wound, capping the band below 8.5.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: seeds outlast carnivals of cruelty—no explicit moralizing. The “staggering grace” tone is earned through imagery: cellophane feathers catching sun like ride lights, soil cracked wider ready to outlast tyrants. Final image reweights prior material: arrow flight becomes banner for underground promise, a conceptual repricing that lingers. No tidy moral, only charged particularity—bread after cotton-candy deprivation—offers resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lush yet disciplined: “ebony splintered like rotten teeth,” “fear lodging like a popcorn kernel,” perceptual signature fused to POV. Compression taught early—“patient as drought-grass”—pays off in final footprints spelling the chord. No head-hopping; interior access remains consistent. Register stays carnival-poetic without purple drift; diction never exceeds her plausible lexicon even at lyric height.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with tension: long inhalations of description snap into staccato “Win a prize, gentlemen—if you dare.” Some scaffolding: “patient and strategic” is repeated thrice; “staggering grace” appears twice without new charge. Mixed metaphor risk—“brass band music” sunlight—yet cadence carries. No loops obscure closure; final line hums chord, resolving by image. Density is high but occasional modifier stacks (“iridescent cellophane peeled from forgotten teddy-bear prizes”) could trim.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fusion of carnival detritus with insurgent botany feels fresh: seed vault beneath Tilt-A-Whirl, piano-cipher mapped to compass, cellophane arrow as banner. Risk of whimsy is offset by grounded stakes—regime artillery outside, sirens converging. Transformation test fails if moved to generic warzone; mirrors, redemption cages, and minor-seventh street cipher are irreplaceable. Specifics accumulate into singular vision; no template echo, no retreat from premise.</comment>
