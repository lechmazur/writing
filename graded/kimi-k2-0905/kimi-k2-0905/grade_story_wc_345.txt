<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mara’s transparent, chill-based agency is consistent and emotionally embodied; her need to be trusted drives every beat. The colonists remain lightly sketched, but their shift from quarrel to collective rope-chain is shown through concrete action (barefoot Kai, coffee aroma, ladder choreography). Interior contradiction is limited—Mara never doubts her own altruism—so the arc is stabilizing rather than transformative for her, satisfying Earned Stasis, yet the living ensemble’s micro-choices do carry visible cost (swaying over cloud, grandparents anchoring with stories). Voice convergence at the communal level reads intentional, not flattening.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens declared early via violet nebula slowing time; each chalk line, dew letter, and bell clang thickens texture until the final violet taste on tongues reweights trust into shared anesthesia. Closure is a Charged Poise: Mara dissolves into the nebula, the living chalk “family is the crop…”—cost is the forever-loss of her singular form, exchanged for collective resilience. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within 40 words and stay lucid. No causal leaps; even anti-grav seed death is foreshadowed. Persistent constraint: ghost intangibility shapes every tactic—she can only chill, balance, gust.</comment>

<comment>Floating rock arches, sideways apple trees, and violet nebula are vivid, selective, and filter through Mara’s translucent perception. The watering bell serves as micro-setting: handled in at least four beats, its bronze timbre modulates communal rhythm and final farewell. Spatial choreography is flawless—bodies, ladders, baskets, seed-fruit chains track across tilting arches without drift. Environment directly constrains choice: only coordinated ladder placement counters arch tilt; nebula’s time-dilation allows three-day harvest to feel like one long dusk.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: saving the orchards = saving the fragile community; signaled in line 5. Escalation is textural—each frost sentence and bell clang layers communal trust until refusal becomes impossible; cost is the risk of arch collapse and the terror of sky-tilt. Protagonist agency is indirect but decisive: Mara’s chill-messages force living hands to act; one mis-catch could doom harvest. Visible price: grandparents’ stories are spent as ballast, toddlers’ baskets hover dangerously, Mara pays with ontological erasure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from image pattern: ghost → gardener → fertilizer; survival is a collective verb. Subtext lives in bell tone shifting from “brambled hope” to “pure release,” implying love hurts before it heals. No final moral—Kai’s chalk aphorism is an act of inscription, not sermon. Ambiguity lingers: future grief will still arrive, but now the nebula is stocked with Mara’s violet patience.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Lyrical, pressure-matched cadence: long breathy sentences for drift, staccato for clang. Perceptual signature—Mara notices condensation ankles, butterfly-wing dust, berry-caught-wire timbre—remains ghost-specific and consistent. No dialogue, so naturalism test n/a. Patterned elision (frost letters, bell ringing itself) is taught early and paid off at farewell gust. Diction stays within ghost-poetic register; no register drift in peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences layer physics (anti-grav seeds), emotion (brambled hope), and motion (ladder sway). Mixed metaphors are intentional—“brambled hope, a clang like berries caught in wire”—and cohere via pain/pleasure fusion. No scaffold loops; paragraph cut test passes. Occasional lyrical stacking (“violet cloud that slowed time for the grieving”) risks purple, but cadence justifies. Final line is clean, propulsive, and typo-free.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Premise splice—ghost horticulture on anti-grav orchard planet—feels fresh yet inevitable. Nebula as communal anesthesia, chalk frost as speech, bell as heartbeat: synthesis of known tropes into new emotional tech. Risky choice to make protagonist already dead pays off by turning altruism into counterweight physics. Specificity anchors universals; no safely median choices.</comment>
