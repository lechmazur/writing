<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elian’s interior contradiction—mechanic arm vs. mother’s voice—and the micro-choice to float the card create a credible, embodied shift; the renunciation of rivalry is earned through the prior coded duel, though Vale’s diplomatic-fierce label stays verbal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens: the sundial’s missing quadrant → brook reflection → joint acceptance forms a clean because/therefore chain; closure lands with visible cost as the foils are sheathed and the card drifts away, foreclosing further duel. The paper slip reversal is tight and legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Glass atrium/brook function as micro-setting: the mirrored dusk angle physically completes the sundial and enables their truce; selective sensory detail (brass fingers, foil song) is vivid without checklist drift, though spatial track of the scholars’ ring is lightly skimmed.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can the rivalry be read into reconciliation—tightens when the paper slip reveals the brook’s coded reflection; price is the public abandonment of the duel, but the cost feels symbolic rather than viscerally felt, keeping it just sub-8.8.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of inquiry-as-collaboration emerges through the sundial’s completion rather than didactic statement; final image of the floating card reweights the mother’s aphorism with quiet irony, achieving Charged Poise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person omniscient remains stable; perceptual signature shows Elian’s gear-whir attention vs. Vale’s riddling stillness; dialogue indirection (“You still sew your arguments?”) carries subtext and advances the blade-to-code turn without voice convergence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Rhythm modulates from hydraulic hiss to soft brook murmur; high info density—each sentence advances image or blade tension; no loops or mixed metaphors; “foils sheathed, the dignified chaos still humming” is a clean, propulsive closer.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Fencing-as-philosophy and sundial-as-code feel fresh yet inevitable; the needle-card’s shift from weapon bookmark to treaty vessel is a specific, earned transformation; risk is moderate—quiet academic duel—but coherence stays high without gimmickry.</comment>
