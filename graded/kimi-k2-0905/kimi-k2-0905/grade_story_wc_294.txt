<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Jonah’s contradictory impulses—clinging to static money yet craving forward motion—surface in the spiral ritual and the final gift; the renunciation costs him one irreplaceable note and lands as earned stasis. Interiority stays concrete (“soft as a moth wing,” “alphabetically… spelled a sentence”). Relationship with Mara is light but functions as crucible: mutual recognition alters both trajectories. Minor slip: “realized” paragraph edges toward summary epiphany, blunting simultaneous contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the burning spiral and traded relics reweight the premise—grief’s loop breaks by willing circulation of the once-static money; cost is the ouguiya itself and the shared fire. Causal chain holds: spiral ritual → shared confession → reciprocal gifts → opposite exits. Orientation anchored by word 60; no teleporting props. One micro turn: Mara pivots from erasure to collaborative rite. Meets 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Trumpet vines, peeling posters, iron floor, synthetic curl of tee-shirt flame—selective sensory triad anchors every beat and constrains the spiral’s edge. Spatial choreography clean: coupling entry, shoulder-to-shoulder sit, opposite exits tracked. Micro-setting (foreign notes) doubles as map and territory, charging final image. Environment does not merely backdrop; it teaches fire “manners,” shaping the ritual outcome—meets 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—break the inherited loop—signaled early; pressure tightens when the spiral ritual forces a public, irreversible commitment to circulate the once-hoarded money. Agency visible: Jonah chooses gift and departure; Mara chooses westward bus. Fire respects boundary, crystallizing cost. No coincidence resolves; escalation is accretive deepening under Accumulative/Textural lens. Could edge higher if price were viscerally felt (pain, poverty) rather than symbolic loss.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—circulation versus stasis—emerges through money changing hands and fire consuming branded past; no explicit thesis stated. Subtext lives in silence inside lion-car and swapped relics. Final image of “unopened roads” reweights prior circling without moralizing. One near-slip: “realized” paragraph flirts with overt insight, but immediate action (gift, exit) restores implication.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Jonah’s perceptual filter: “colors… glowed like dying fireworks,” “polished calm that lived between the drip of rust.” Syntax mirrors tension—long breathless cadences, then clipped “Footsteps.” No head-hopping; Mara’s interior accessed only via gesture and speech. Distinct idiom maintained under stress. Meets 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “dusky harmony,” “exit ramps sometimes braid into on-ramps,” each metaphor internally consistent and scene-advancing. No scaffold loops; sentences vary in length and opening. One mixed image—“fire teaching manners”—but context justifies anthropomorphism. Copy clean; pronouns tracked. High-band control, minor hairline only.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fusing failed tech-startup detritus with derelict circus train and foreign banknotes yields fresh emotional topology; trope of “breaking cycles” is re-cast via monetary circulation ritual. Specificity—“paper plane morphing into an arrow” logo, Namibian dollar hue—prevents swap-out. Risk in quiet lyric ending paid off by charged poise. Not quite revelatory enough for 9+ band, but memorably singular.</comment>
