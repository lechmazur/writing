<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Kael’s survivor-guilt and ritual need are vivid; the contradictory pull between grief and wonder is embodied in trembling hands and the burning compass. The final hand-take is a believable surrender to a mother-shaped “true north,” renouncing linear time. No secondary character pressure, but interiority sustains the piece.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens: silence-sky-compass pattern layers until the hatch-maps detonate into corridor light, re-weighting grief as shared cartography. Closure is a Charged Poise: mother and son eternally sketching, cost paid by eternal exile from normal time. Causality is lyric, not mechanical, but the emotional logic is unbroken.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Frost-rimmed window, humming deck plates, whale-song heartbeat—each sensory hit is filtered through Kael’s navigator eye and grief-narrowed attention. The folded corridor is sketched just enough to feel navigable without white-room syndrome. The compass rose and hatch-maps function as micro-settings that literally steer the final choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can ritualized memory resurrect connection? Pressure tightens when the compass twitches, then explodes via hatch-maps that force Kael to crawl into mother-made space. Cost is permanent exile from chronology; the price is felt but could be even more viscerally foregrounded in the final beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly: “true north” is not a vector but a person-place willing to meet you in dilated grief. Subtext operates through silence, star-maps, and the compass’s false bearing rather than declarations. Final caption risks thematic echo, yet the sentence is brief, open, and earned by the prior image of endless sketching.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Kael’s navigator idiom: “temporally stretched photon,” “lullaby for the blessed pariah.” Rhythm swells from hush to whale-song cadence, matching dilation. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent and memorable under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative layering is dense (“corridor folded like paper”) but purposeful, taught early and paid off. One mixed metaphor risk: “compass rose blazed like a miniature sun” is forgivable in climax. Minor filter verb slips (“felt the station hum”) do not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Relativistic mourning station rotated out of phase as pocket grief-atelier is fresh; star-maps as maternal love letters is specific and moving. Familiar tropes (ghost-mother, time dilation) are re-forged through navigator ritual and the compass’s ornamental lie. Risk-taking structural fold heightens meaning without obscuring closure.</comment>
