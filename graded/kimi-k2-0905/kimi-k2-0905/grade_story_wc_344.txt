<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation to "learn the rhythm of repair" is steadily dramatized via sensory micro-choices (testing gears, aligning key with reflection). Interior contradiction—grief for mentor vs. hunger for mastery—fuels final step into workshop; cost is the vanished return door. Earned Stasis satisfies closure. Minor gap: mentor relationship summarized, not embodied in scene, blunting highest band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain—scrap prophecy → gear test → mirror correction → door opens → mentor room—remains intact; closure (Earned Stasis) turns on healed key that seals exit with audible cost. Orientation established within 120 w via "distant morning" and lift-cage exit; no ambiguity. One mirror-as-storage conceit taught early and paid off. Persistent constraint: exit door disappears, locking him into custodianship. Slight over-reliance on abstract "rhythm" language is the only hairline slip.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Frozen library, spires of glass, cloud-sea sunrise: every environmental beat is filtered through Rowan’s tool-centric perception and directly shapes access ("boots squealing," "lantern twin"). Micro-setting of the black-bronze door and its waning-moon keyway forces gear choice and supplies the healed key payoff. Tools—crescent cogs, eclipse-pawl—function as portable setting that narrows tactical options. Final mirror-room pays off with emotional cost, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mend cosmic/moral "wobble") declared early; pressure tightens when no gear hums, forcing recognition that flawed key must be restored. Key agency: Rowan aligns cracked key with perfected reflection—tactics directly reshaped by setting rule. Cost is immediate exile (door vanishes) and acceptance of lifelong custodianship. Escalation is single but decisive under causal lens; no reversals needed at this scale.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of repair as forgiveness emerges imagistically: cracked gear mended, halted clocks tick "inward," protagonist’s irregular pulse re-syncs—no explicit thesis stated. Subtext resides in mirror conceit: revision of past mistakes is possible only by accepting their flawed originals. Conceptual Repricing lands when Rowan smiles at vanished exit, proving repair sometimes costs the repairman. Final image of "overlapping ticks" offers resonant non-literal answer to rhythm quest.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited sustains lunar-locksmith perceptual signature—mechanical metaphors, tool-based attention, eclipse lexicon. Prose rhythm modulates from languid opening cadence to clipped micro-choices under pressure ("He uncapped...spill...held"). No dialogue = no penalty; free indirect cleanly handles interiority. Occasional elevated diction ("driftwood nostalgia," "conceptual repricing") stays within obsessed artisan lexicon; pattern taught early. Zero head-hopping; psychic distance tightens appropriately.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High metaphor density but each image is anchored to physical action (frost "racing" along key, door "breathing"). No paraphrase loops or template cadence; sentence openings rotate among prepositional, participial, and direct clauses. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene temperature. One stray mixed metaphor—"thawing steel" hissing—costs a hairline notch. Otherwise compression and momentum remain intact through closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Frozen astronomy library, mirror archive of discarded better drafts, eclipse-shaped lock hardware—all particularized world-building that feels inevitable in hindsight. Central synthesis: locksmithing as celestial clock repair is fresh yet coherent. Risk: lyric portal fantasy inside 700 words; success because micro-mechanics keep stakes legible. Could edge higher with one more sensory detail outside visual register.</comment>
