<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lira’s interior contradiction—dealer who never samples yet now risks her own product—drives every beat; her embodied collapse into “porous, aching affection” is earned by the slow thaw staged through scent, static, and kneeling. The micro-choice to press the petal to the lie-spot of her pulse crystallizes her hierarchy of values. No stock therapy-speak; even “insight without empathy was just surveillance” grows from her lived metaphor of bottled lightning bugs. Flaw remains active: her earlier detachment is the very coat she folds beside her, a visible forfeit.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the final palm-to-amber-ground image reweights the entire premise—she pays with reachable pain, not a new product. Causal linkage holds: because she inhales the subsuming scent, therefore her armor strips off. The “vial cracked” beat provides persistent constraint: she can no longer inventory her own stock. Cost is legible in the single line “for the first time, she let it hurt,” making the before/after undeniable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The amber grotto is never postcard; it constrains choice—fossilized sap pool forces chemist to station himself, resin air slows Lira’s breath, cooling stone hastens her kneel. Static electricity is treated as environmental physics, not ornament, guiding the spark of recognition. Micro-setting inside her coat—hidden vials—functions as portable geography that ruptures mid-transformation. Final palm-to-ground tactile beat recharges the grotto’s copper light into stone-cold indifference, anchoring cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Single dominant stake—feel something real—tightens when the scent subsumes memory and forecloses her detachment trade. Pressure escalates via because/therefore: she samples → grief/rage/wonder floods → she cannot sell the next vial. Visible price: a vial cracks, her coat empire literally leaks. The tightening is one decisive intensification, sufficient for 800-word scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the scent echo: commodified half-truths can’t substitute for the pain that proves aliveness. No explicit moral; the final image of indifferent earth humming beneath her hand reweights the entire emotional economy. Subtext lives in silence—chemist never explains his motive, only offers the blank petal, forcing Lira to supply the missing why. Ambiguity lingers: is reachable pain a product or the end of products? The story refuses to answer, inviting reflection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet controlled: “light itself seemed to hesitate” teaches the grotto’s amber hesitation pattern, paid off when walls “shimmered with the last of the sun’s copper light.” Syntax mirrors breath compression under scent—short em-dashed clauses accelerate thaw. No head-hopping; chemist’s interior remains sealed, read only through Lira’s static-charged sleeve. Diction stays within plausible alchemist/dealer lexicon without academic drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is near flawless: “the scent bloomed like a bruise—honeyed regret, sharp with the citrus of almost-joy” compresses three jobs—metaphor, sensory specificity, emotional contradiction—into one sentence. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. Rhythm modulates from long resinous inhalations to the clipped final “It didn’t matter anymore.” Metaphors stay coherent within olfactory/earth register; no mixed vehicles. Final line “But a beginning” is monosyllabic cadence payoff, not algorithmic pattern.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Premise—emotion as distillable commodity—feels fresh yet inevitable in a world of curated personas. Synthesis of scent chemistry + static electricity + amber fossil creates original sensorium without gimmickry. Risk: quiet kneel instead of explosive confrontation; risk pays off by making the closure cost interior yet legible. Could not swap grotto for generic café; fossil sap and resin air are irreplaceable to the transformation logic.</comment>
