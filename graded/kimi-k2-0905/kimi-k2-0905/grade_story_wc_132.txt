<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her palm on the trellis, the burn scar, the laugh of hollow bamboo—yet the metamorphosis leap is asserted more than earned. Her scientific precision is well-established, but the moment she “releases her grip on understanding” is narrated rather than dramatized, so the final surrender feels slightly abstract. Still, the contradiction between control and surrender is consistently held, and the cost is visible in her rooted legs and slowed heartbeat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The causal spine—storm → glowing leaf → body merger → nursery change—tracks cleanly; each beat triggers the next. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the nursery’s new regime of “controlled wildness” is legible, and the felt cost is the silver-veined leaves bearing her face. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no teleporting props. One minor slack: the sprinkler system activation is coincidental, but it complicates rather than resolves, so allowed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The greenhouse is tactile and selective: water pooling in ancient trellis crevices, leaves curling inward, storm patterns mirrored in silver veins. Sensory hierarchy reflects Mira’s scientific lens—she notices pH meters before her own pulse—so description never feels touristic. The mossy trellis recurs as both anchor and final architecture, charging the closure image. Micro-setting (her scarring skin) literally constrains the metamorphosis, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—control vs. symbiosis—signals early and tightens once: the moment the leaf syncs with her pulse, surrender becomes the only path. Agency remains hers: she clips the leaf, laughs at her own sprinkler, then chooses release. Cost is visible—skin splitting, legs rooting, heartbeat slowing—so the trade-off is felt. No external coincidence rescues her; the storm only offers the language, not the solution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from particulars: scientific cataloging vs. ancient plant language, control vs. surrender. No character articulates the thesis; the final image of silver-veined faces reweights prior material without moralizing. Ambiguity is productive—readers can read the nursery as miracle, curse, or evolution. The linden’s “circuitously sincere” growth pattern embodies theme in living form, not abstract assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is sharp—Mira notices nutrient cycles before her own terror—and syntax grows longer, more chlorophyll-drunk as transformation advances, mirroring vegetal sap rhythm. No head-hopping; distance stays tight inside her skin. Diction stays within a botanist’s lexicon until the final spore-scatter, a justified lyric lift. Dialogue is absent, so no voice contamination possible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive: “leaves curled inward during thunderstorms in a behavior her textbooks couldn’t explain” packs world, character, and stakes in one clause. No loops or synonym churn; mixed metaphors are avoided. One near-purple phrase—“creatures from deep ocean trenches”—is forgiven because it occurs at the height of disorientation and is immediately grounded by tactile fall into trellis. Final line cadence mirrors sap-throb, earning rhythmic payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh angle: botanical body-horror that ends not in death but in mutualist nursery. Linden silver-vein networking is novel and internally consistent. Transformation is irreversible yet generative—customers leave “with dirt beneath their fingernails,” a detail that could not appear in any other tale. Risk-taking (lyric metamorphosis) heightens meaning without obscuring closure.</comment>
