<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The poet’s interior contradiction—yearning to erase borders yet fearing the lake’s re-freeze—is dramatized in her slowed heartbeat micro-choice at the water’s edge. Embodied emotion (pulse recognized by quartz, warmth inside ribs) is specific, never abstract. The final renunciation—stepping onto liquid that could still harden—pays the full price of her recusant past and lands as Earned Stasis with visible risk.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the lake rewrites itself into wings, borders become “parentheses we forget to close,” and the citizens will taste “quartz music at the backs of their tongues.” Causal linkage holds throughout—each spoken paraphrase directly fractures ice or shifts pitch; no reversal is coincidental. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of sonic thaw intensifies until meaning itself is re-weighted.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Quartz colonnade, lantern-moths, and ice function as micro-setting that constrain every tactical move: pillars respond to pulse, moths time recitation, ice toggles phase. Sensory hierarchy is biased to sound-touch; A-flat/G-sharp slide is the dominant map. Environment is not backdrop but co-protagonist that dictates when the poet may safely step.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will the poet survive her own linguistic breach?—tightens when each paraphrase risks re-freeze around her calves. Agency is continuous: every voiced phoneme either melts or cracks the surface; cost is legible as hairline fissures and the statue-threat. One meaningful deepening suffices: “None shall stay” replaces “None shall pass,” and the lake lifts into communal wings.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: language as environmental code, decrees as editable light. No moralizing—final image of citizens tasting music invites plural readings. Recurring motif of “tremor of certainty” re-prices from personal pulse to collective cadence, crystallizing the idea that law is a rough draft. Resonance is felt, not stated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is crystalline-acoustic: narrator notices pitch, lattice vibration, breath-fog on quartz. Syntax elongates during sonic thaw, contracts at re-freeze risk: “Ice sheet lifted, folding into translucent wings.” No head-hopping; lyric compression is pattern-taught in first paragraph and paid off in final “door she had already stepped through.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Rhythm modulates with ice phase: long voweled clauses for melting, staccato for crack-threat. Figurative density peaks at closure but stays coherent—vehicles of sound, light, parentheses interlock. One scaffold trace: repeated “tremor of certainty” could trim a use; does not touch closure. Otherwise zero loops, high information per sentence, no mixed metaphors.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Fused premise—poet rewrites jurisprudence through phonics of ice—is non-obvious and fully committed. Risk of lyrical overkill is embraced yet controlled; payoff is communal ontological edit. Specific detail (A-flat sliding to G-sharp) prevents abstract drift. Fresh synthesis makes border dissolution feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
