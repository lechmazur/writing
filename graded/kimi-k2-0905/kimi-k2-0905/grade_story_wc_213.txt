<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—scientific logger vs. mountain listener—drives every micro-choice; the final toggle is earned because her father’s soap-scented rope and the annual pitch-drop anchor the cost of disobedience. Credibly curious trait is embodied, not labeled, in barometer logs and midnight splice. Missing 0.3 to reach 9: no second character on page, so status crucible unused; still, solitary stance crystallizes with felt risk of civic ban.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: six bell waves replace the mandated siren, reconfiguring city-wide meaning and Mara's future options. Causal chain holds—pressure dip → rope tug → toggle splice → bell resonance—with persistent constraint (toggle left in place) shaping next solstice. Cost is legible in the instant of unauthorized tolling and dawn descent “heart drumming.” No orientation or lens ambiguity; mosaic pattern not needed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Windblown sanctuary, brass barometer, pine-tarred rope, and moon-nailed sky are filtered through Mara's tester gaze; each object constrains the final splice. Micro-setting (rope twitch as pulse) literally triggers the climax. Spatial choreography is flawless across corkscrew stair and parapet. Meets 9+ gate: tool (toggle box) and environment together charge the closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“will the mountain speak and will she answer?”—tightens when 03:17 pressure dip forecloses the safe siren option. Single meaningful escalation: rope tug forces bell substitution, narrowing her path from civic obedience to mountain courtesy. Price is instant: illegal toll, public wonder, personal jeopardy. Agency drives every turn; coincidence only complicates (wind shift), never resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: listening as civic disobedience versus instrumental control. Subtext lives in the rope’s smell, the barometer’s tremble, the bell’s warm stones in cold milk—no abstract sermon. Final image of citizens carrying “ghost of six low notes” reweights prior material without moralizing. Minor 0.1 dock: phrase “favor listening over noise” edges toward echo, though it is dramatized, not stated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays pinned to Mara’s sensorium; perceptual signature is meteorological—“electric scent,” “pressure anomaly inside the bronze.” Syntax lengthens then fragments under 03:59 surge, mirroring breath. No head-hop; free indirect slips are clean. Distinctive cadence taught early (“wind that carries sorrow”) and paid off in bell resonance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances log, atmosphere, or stakes. Metaphors are precise and non-contradictory: “clouds surged like slow whales,” “warm stones dropped into cold milk.” Information density high—barometer readings, splice mechanics, civic timer—all braided through action. Rhythm modulates from hush to toll without monotony; final line lingers like after-ring.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: microclimate data + sacred bell rope + civic siren protocol = new myth. Premise is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risk—illegal swap of sacred for civic—heightens meaning without gimmick. Specificity of alpine dawn electric scent and 72-hertz log entry prevents template drift.</comment>
