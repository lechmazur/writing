<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Juniper’s barefoot drift and logbook-to-wood reading embody a consistent, embodied interiority; her “featherly determined” gait shows micro-choice under pressure. Still, the father remains off-page cipher, so relationship-as-crucible and status dynamics cannot apply. The final “walk the invisible corridors” is a credible renunciation with felt cost—she chooses the between-place over terrestrial home. Yet the interior contradiction peak is narrated rather than dramatized in scene, keeping it shy of the 8+ gate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: cadence of images (terrace drift / grain rings / weather code) progressively reweights the stake of “necessary distance.” Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration—Juniper steps off the terrace into the maze-between-heartbeats, crystallizing options with undeniable conceptual cost: perpetual exile as the price of understanding. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are taught lyrically but precisely inside 120 wds; disorientation later pays off at closure, so waiver holds. One soft spot: the butterfly-effect plane deviation is delivered in retrospective summary, slightly blurring cause-and-effect immediacy.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The drifting prism terrace functions as micro-setting that literally alters tactics—its 3-inch annual migration steers Juniper’s final step west into liminal air. Sensory selection skews to tactile woodgrain, moth-wing paper, and terrace groans, all filtered through Juniper’s weather-reading bias. Idiom invents fresh compounds (“featherly,” “fractured hush”) without breaking legibility. Environment directly charges the final image: she steps off the terrace’s edge, so setting = tool = closure driver—meeting the 9+ gate test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Dominant stake—decoding the father’s “threshold” message—arrives early and tightens through each grain-reading micro-beat. One visible price: she forsakes solid ground forever, trading home for liminal maze. Escalation is textural rather than causal: density of mirrored symbols (logbook ↔ grain ↔ maze paths) accrues until the only remaining option is to inhabit the between-space. The cost is legible but internal; an external constraint (e.g., terrace about to drift beyond reach) could have pushed it into the 8.8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Theme emerges organically from the conceit that thresholds remember every footstep; no character sermonizes the thesis. The final image—Juniper inside a dissolving maze of heartbeats—offers a non-literal answer: some distances are not to be crossed but occupied. Subtext lives in silence (father absent yet omnipresent) and tactile objects (carved weather symbols). Resists tidy moral; ambiguity lingers about whether she is lost or transmuted, fulfilling the 9+ gate for resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Third-person lyric remains tightly close to Juniper’s perceptual signature: she “reads” wind in wood, hears the terrace “creak like a ship.” Syntax coils and releases in parallel with breathless vs. anchored moments. No dialogue, so voice purity stays intact. Minor over-modulation in “fractured hush”/“prism terrace” compounds, but pattern is consistent and taught early enough to stay legible at closure—satisfies the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</question><comment>Prose is lush yet mostly lean: “pages soft as moth wings” packs metaphor + tactile specificity in one strike. Rhythm alternates between long, airy sentences and fragment-like percussive bursts (“She stepped off…”). No scaffolding loops or synonym churn detected; metaphors stay internally coherent. However, three adjacent sentences in the climax open with “She…” creating a faint template cadence; this keeps it below 8.0 and therefore blocks any category from 9+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>The corn-maze-into-weather-code conceit is fresh synthesis; father builds temporal mazes from barometric data, daughter translates wood grain back into coordinates—specific, irreplaceable logic. Risky lyric structure (drifting terrace as sole set) pays off by making the final step into thin air feel inevitable. No recognizable trope patches or famous-line echoes. Conceptual integrity absolute: the piece commits to its own physics of memory-places and never retreats to realism for comfort.</comment>
