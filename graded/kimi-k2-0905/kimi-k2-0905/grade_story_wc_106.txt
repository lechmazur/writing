<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Thief’s curiosity motive is vivid and consistent; the micro-choice to return the woman’s own face instead of cutting another is earned by the ring-inscription beat. Interiority is floral-cipher poetic but remains character-specific. The absence of any visible cost to the thief (fatigue, moral scar, lost tool) keeps the renunciation from feeling fully priced at this length. Still, contradictory impulses (curiosity vs. erasure) act simultaneously in scene, satisfying the 9+ quick test for contradictory impulses with earned causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the thief restores rather than steals, reweighting her own rule-set while the station petals rewrite the cipher to “go home.” Causal lens holds throughout (because/therefore linkage: ring ⇒ recognition ⇒ refusal to cut). Orientation is taught early via the floral cipher and paid off at the end, so no Orientation Test penalty. Cost is legible but abstract (she forfeits a star-jar fee and a portrait); a hair more body-level price would push this into 9-band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Emerald tiles, marigold scent, and the bench-by-platform layout remain coherent and constrain movement. The flower stall as cipher-generator is a micro-setting that actively shapes tactics, satisfying the 9+ gate. Sensory selection stays filtered through the thief’s professional eye (coded petals, clinking jar). Spatial choreography tracks cleanly across the kneel-handoff-projection sequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Dominant stake—“will she cut another face?”—tightens when the ring reveals the client as the original source of erasure, forcing a choice between curiosity and compassion. Escalation is causal under the inferred lens; the star-jar payment raises temptation, but the inscription collapses that option into restoration. Price is present (she gives up both the star-jar and a portrait) yet feels external; a sharper personal forfeiture would lift higher. Still, one meaningful turn narrows options with visible trade-off, meeting the 8-band bar.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as reversible theft, forgiveness as self-restoration. The reconfigured husband’s face bathed in “a day that never quite ended” supplies a resonant non-literal answer to “what does destiny breathe?” No explicit moral is stated; the final petal cipher “memory is enough” reweights prior motifs without sermon. Subtext dwells in the silence while the cigarette never ashes—time frozen until forgiveness ignites.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Voice is lush yet controlled; syntactic parallelism (“snipped from time with silver scissors no thicker than a filament”) reads as intentional lyric pattern rather than template cadence. Perceptual signature is thief-specific: pulse-reading, filament-thin cut imagery, moonbeam clinks against ribs. No head-hopping; POV stays locked to thief until final wide shot. Register never drifts above the POV’s plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; every sentence layers image, world-rule, or emotional tilt. Metaphors stay internally coherent (moonbeam ribbon, spilled-mercury tears). One scaffold-like run—“the thief… the woman… the thief…”—is brief and pattern-taught, forgiven at closure. No mixed metaphors or paraphrase loops dull the final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Portrait-theft as memory-curiosity commerce feels fresh; the inversion—restoring instead of stealing—grows inevitably from the ring-inscription twist. Floral cipher mechanics are specific to this world and reappear re-weighted at the end. Risky lyric compression heightens rather than obscures stakes. The synthesis of golden-hour photography, moonbeam currency, and botanical code is non-obvious yet coherent.</comment>
