<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The weaver’s interiority is granular—breath synced to sevenfold symmetry, finger cut by obsidian sheet—and her moment-to-moment choices (tilting the burner, confessing the sister cliff-memory) trace a credible arc from self-shielding to self-sacrifice. The flaw that cost her sister’s hand is seeded early in the “weights of different burdens” premise, so the final disclosure feels inevitable, not convenient. One decimal off perfection only because the sister’s forgiveness is shown through infinite reflections rather than a dramatized micro-gesture; still, the cost is embodied in the blood drop that flares the violet flame.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the grotto peels open, the weave rises, and the valley exhales—an unmistakable before/after reconfiguration. Causality is causal-lens tight: because she sacrifices her own burden (the sister confession), the lattice restabilizes; the burner’s violet flare is the visible cost. Orientation is secure by line 6 (“bronze grotto under starlight”) and the recursive space rule is taught immediately through “no edges; it curved back into itself.” No teleporting props or soft resets; every tile, thread, and flame is accounted for.</comment>

<comment>The grotto is not backdrop but machine: the sevenfold symmetry etched into the floor dictates the weaver’s breathing cadence, and the overlapping metallic tiles become the very loom that traps her. The cracked glass burner graduates from lamp to “small sun” locked in solidified light—an object-as-setting that guides future weavers. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: metallic taste, whalebone hush, and violet flare are filtered through the weaver’s profession-specific attention to weight and resonance. Spatial choreography is flawless; the reader always knows where the pool, the loom of antler, and the reflecting walls sit relative to her crouch.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—valley will fold like crumpled paper unless she balances the lattice—is signaled in paragraph 4 and escalates when the grotto tightens its hush to suffocating density. The decisive turn is her confession; this narrows her options from collector-of-others-grief to self-exposed burden-bearer, paying the visible price of blood and the audible price of the violet flare. Cost is legible and persistent: she climbs out carrying “the memory of their weight,” the lamp left behind as both tool-loss and legacy. A hairline slip from 9.0 only because the valley’s exhalation is reported rather than sensed through her body.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme—only by owning one’s own grief can the communal fabric hold—emerges entirely through image and action; no character sermonizes. The fractal lattice, the amber threads, and the obsidian sheet of her confession braid into a single moral calculus that feels discovered, not declared. Subtext is layered: the sister’s forgiving face repeated into infinity reweights every prior reflection as mercy rather than indictment. The ending offers a resonant non-literal answer: a “small sun” of solidified light—hope literally crystallized from sorrow.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Voice is sustained high-density lyric without purple drift: “shingled hush,” “auric note,” “whalebone reverie” all serve the weaver’s synesthetic profession. Syntax mirrors fractal recursion—clause nests inside clause—yet remains lucid under pressure. No head-hopping; the single POV is locked to her breath, cut, and confession. Register stays within her plausible lexicon of metallurgy, weaving, and mountain folklore.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops, zero scaffold; each sentence advances either the loom ritual or the suffocating hush. Metaphors are internally coherent—sound as whalebone, silence as metallic tiles—never mixed. The violet flare sentence (“The flame flared violet…”) is peak-stress clarity itself. Opening and closing lines act as audible brackets: starlight enters, metallic sigh seals—perfect cadence control.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The “fractal weaver who harvests intangible guilt into amber threads” is a fresh mythic occupation, and the recursive bronze grotto feels inevitable for such a craft. Risk is high—lyric recursion could easily have collapsed into gimmick—but the emotional through-line (sister loss) grounds the conceptual flourish. The only echo risk is the “infinity of forgiving faces,” which faintly recalls Kubrick star-gate, yet the blood-drop ignition re-personalizes the trope. Transformation test fails: this exact voice, tool-set, and moral calculus could not be transplanted without breaking the story.</comment>
