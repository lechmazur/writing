<question>1</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The seeker’s contradictory desire to remember in order to forgive powers every beat; his choice to wade into the lake is earned by the baseball’s orbit and the visceral nausea of returning harm. Interiority is concrete—“shoes filling with cold fire,” “bones like paper lanterns”—never abstract. The single flaw: the silhouettes on the far shore arrive late and remain ensemble symbols rather than crucible characters, so status dynamics stay theoretical.</comment>

<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Lens is Accumulative/Textural: each image layer (backward clocks, ink coordinates, glowing lake) thickens the cost of remembering. Closure lands with Conceptual Repricing: the cracked baseball’s empty tomorrow-dated tickets reweight redemption as a turnstile, not a door. The final image—“moonlight soldered its halves with silver”—makes the price undeniable. One causality micro-gap: how the orderly coat enables unchallenged escape is elided, but the pattern holds.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The baseball, lake, and drains function as micro-settings that constrain movement and meaning; the orbiting ball literally re-stitches his scars. Sensory hierarchy is biased to cold, wet, and luminous—perfect for a man navigating guilt. Spatial choreography is clean: diagonal steps carve “a path of maybes” until concrete yields to living rock. Only the ward’s backward-clock rule is announced, not exploited, so world-rule depth stays suggestive.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—empathy through self-inflicted pain—tightens once: wade and absorb, or retreat hollow. The lake’s bargain is the single meaningful escalation; no reversals needed. Cost is visceral (cold fire under skin, heart restarted with borrowed rhythms) and forecloses the hollow option. Agency is pure renunciation, fitting Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as redemption = consent to fracture, never stated outright. The cracked baseball spilling unplayed tomorrow tickets reconfigures time as iterative repair, not escape. Final image of moonlight soldering the ball offers quiet, non-moral resonance. No echo of prompt language or preached thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric-accumulative: rhythmic lists (“left meant forgiveness, right meant revenge…”) teach the pattern early. Perceptual signature is jaded-wonder—seeing bottled auroras while feeling wet silence. Compression like “silence felt wet” is taught and paid off. Zero head-hopping; POV distance stays tight to seeker’s skin.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; most sentences dual-load image + stakes (“bioluminescence crawled under his skin, illuminating bones like paper lanterns”). One template cadence—“the ___ that ___”—recurs three times but serves incantatory effect, not artifact. Mixed metaphor only once: “cold fire” is justified by luminescent fluid. No loops or scaffold; final line soldered image is razor-clean.</question>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses memory-wipe sci-fi with penitential pilgrimage; the baseball-from-a-redeemed-future is a fresh causal hinge. Risk is high—lyric accumulative structure could collapse into symbol soup—yet pattern is taught early and closure re-stitches time as iterative repair. Specificity (“ticket stubs to games that never happened, each dated tomorrow”) makes the trope un-portable. Tightening loop image earns +0.4 risk bonus.</comment>
