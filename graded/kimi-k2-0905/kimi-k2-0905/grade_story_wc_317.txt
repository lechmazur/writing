<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is vivid—roots seeking “orthogonal angles of her architecture” literalizes her inventive mind—but her contradictory impulses (obedience to the seed vs. guardian instinct) are told more than dramatized. The final smile is a credible renunciation, yet the cost feels conceptual rather than bodily or social, slightly under-weighting Earned Stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the mill rewrites itself into a self-generating puzzle, Mira accepts perpetual mutation, and the brook’s uphill flow is the visible, irreversible cost. Causal lattice holds: each lever-pull redirects vegetal growth, the midnight riddle answer is foreshadowed by the waterwheel reversal, and tomorrow’s empty envelope is the logical payoff. One micro-turn (seed roots erupt outward, not down) re-vectors the entire architecture; no teleporting props. The only hairline slip: “possibility just born” is used thrice as refrain without micro-choice anchoring the second iteration, a minor accumulative texturality leak.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Glass-floor loam, phosphorescent seeds, and backward waterwheel are tactile, choice-shaping micro-settings; the brook’s reversed course physically charges the final image. Selective sensory hierarchy—iron-and-earth scent, vegetal pulse through brass levers—keeps attention tight. Spatial choreography clean: no impossible positions as vines burst through ducts. Weather evolves from storm-born silence to dawn perfume, mirroring thematic shift from threat to covenant.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“safeguard space for innovation”—is signaled early and tightened when the seed threatens to imprison her guests forever. One meaningful deepening: Mira realizes she must surrender authorial control and let the labyrinth co-author itself, paid with the irreversible mutation of the mill. Cost is visible—the brook flows uphill, the building breathes—though slightly abstract. No false escalation; every growth spurt is lever-directed by her own hand.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: innovation demands surrendering ownership to the very systems we create. Subtext lives in gesture—Mira “locks the gate again” now complicit with the living puzzle—and in the corpse flower blooming as lantern, not stench, repricing decay as wonder. No moralizing; final image of “quiet covenant” invites reflection on perpetual mutation versus stasis. The brook’s uphill ride is a conceptual repricing of natural law.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person hovers at calibrated psychic distance: we get “pulse matched the distant storm” but not omniscient exposition. Syntax grows clausal under pressure—“roots erupted outward, not downward, threading between floorboards”—then tightens at dawn lock. No filter-verb stacks; perceptual signature is architect-inventor: every sensation is angle, gear, duct. Dialogue-free design is a valid stylistic choice; voice remains distinct and consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with storm: long sentences for vegetal surge, staccato for lever throws. Metaphors stay physical—“gears that clicked like anxious teeth”—and never mixed. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or causality. Opening and final lines echo “storm-born silence” to create cadence bookends. One near-artifact: “possibility just born” repeats thrice; minor but keeps refrain from becoming drumbeat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: escape-room-as-organism that pollinates other towns with luminous seeds transforms familiar “haunted attraction” trope. Orthogonal geometry as living root system is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risk of horticultural-horror flipped into wonder; conceptual integrity holds without late rule patch. Specificity: glass-floor soil illuminated from below, waterwheel turning backward at midnight—details that would collapse if swapped.</comment>
