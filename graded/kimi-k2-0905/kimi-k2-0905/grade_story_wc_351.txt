<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid—her synesthetic sense of “splinters tugging at synapses” embodies the chaotically precise motif—but the decisive moment of helmet-donning is slightly under-motivated; we’re told she’ll “amplify the resonance,” not shown why tonight’s moon angle is her last window. The sketches she pockets supply a tangible cost, yet the emotional renunciation (what path is foreclosed?) remains implicit rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The causal spine—helmet → entanglement → lattice → collapse—holds cleanly; the mirror-angle rule is set up early and its failure precipitates the collapse, so the reversal lands with visible price. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara’s singular flesh returns but carries alien schematics, re-weighting her future. One minor orientation lag: “the chasm breathed cold light” precedes any geospatial anchor, but the lyrical delay is taught and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The canyon is not backdrop but coolant reservoir and memory bed; its quartz seams literally route the story’s tech premise. Micro-setting—the cracked periscope mirror—constrains every calibration twist and charges the final image when its silver burns out. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV bias: lunar reflections are filtered through engineer’s optics (“milliradian,” “magnetized lattice”). Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from rail to lip to ascent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“resurrect abandoned dreams as machines”—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightens when the lattice mid-birth clatters to dust, costing her the immediate victory and risking motor-cortex overwrite. Escalation is causal: each milliradian error narrows options until moon-slide severs entanglement. The price (blood, burnt mirror, unremembered sketches) is legible on-page; the deeper cost—she is now partly inhabited by alien schematics—emerges as future constraint.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of recursive techno-archaeology emerges from concrete images—gear-sketches that drink moonlight—rather than thesis statements. Final smile “quivering like the reverie” reweights earlier motif: the dream-coolant is now inside her, making her both artifact and archaeologist. Subtext resists moral tag: transformation is hunger, not redemption. One soft echo: “abandoned dreams” is nearly thematic label, but embedded in world-logic soon enough to avoid sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is engineered-poetic: diction of “synaptic plasticity gone feral” marries tech precision to wild image, sustaining the chaotically precise signature. Rhythm accelerates under pressure—“cold fire crawled… scattering silver”—then fractures into shorter units as entanglement collapses. No dialogue, so register stays coherent. Perceptual signature is distinct: Mara measures grief in drill-bit shards and basalt wings, not tears.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “chaotically precise déjà vu” performs its own meaning. One mixed metaphor—“broken periscope mirror abandoned by some giant, long-dead observer”—slightly blurs vehicle, but the image pays off when the mirror dies. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances premise or texture. Final line cadence—“transformation never ceased”—echoes opening helix, closing sonic ring.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses quantum coolant from worker dreams with lunar-angle neuro-archaeology—fresh synthesis that feels inevitable once launched. Risky second-person fragment of collective miners’ POV is brief, pattern-taught by “chaotically precise,” and justifies the helical memory braid. Specificity of “ore carts to the sky” and “submarine graveyard” anchors surreal tech in rusted history. Transformation test fails if relocated: dream-data as ore-slurry coolant is inseparable from this canyon.</comment>
