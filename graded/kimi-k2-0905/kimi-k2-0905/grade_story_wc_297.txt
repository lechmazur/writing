<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrically vivid but drifts toward self-mythologizing; the narrator’s “visions root deeper than fear” is asserted, not dramatized. No contradictory impulse complicates the final surrender; the choice to graft feels pre-ordained by cosmic lyric rather than wrestled through flaws. Micro-choices (pressing fingers to scars, letting the maze drink) are present but lack visible cost until the final image; still, the silhouette-double stepping back supplies a credible enduring price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the hedge-double and voice-in-bark crystallize an ongoing custodial cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of cobalt, clipping, scars, eclipse—tightening until the final image reweights the covenant. Orientation is taught early via sensory anchors (“cobalt glade at dusk,” “metallic hush”) so disorientation serves rather than obscures. The one-line cost (“I would never leave the glade”) is legible but could be sharpened on-page rather than declarative.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>“Cobalt glade” functions as micro-setting that constrains the final graft; the clipped sidewalk leaf at the end re-anchors the urban/organic balance. Sensory hierarchy skews visual—mirrored blades, shimmer, screens—but filtered through visionary POV so selectivity reads intentional. Spatial choreography is dream-logic coherent: hedge unfolds only after clipping tugs, fireflies drift above paths, silhouette steps back. No occupational detail required; environmental evolution (grass coins, sap-circuitry walls) tracks cleanly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keep both city and soil awake—signals early; tightening occurs when the maze demands literal blood-irrigation. Agency is renunciation rather than decisive act; cost is conceptual (eternal rootedness) but felt through pain-flare and silhouette replacement. Escalation is textural: successive projections of paved futures accumulate pressure until the covenant whispers its terms. Coincidence is absent; maze appears as因果 extension of clipping’s compass-needles.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: dream vs. infrastructure, loneliness of separated visions. Subtext operates in image—sidewalk crack irrigated by veins—rather than exposition. Final image reweights “intersection” from spatial to bodily, avoiding sermon. No tidy moral; ambiguity lingers in new dreamers waking with hedge-scars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is consistent: metallic hush, filament-tingle, vegetable-code diction. Rhythm modulates from long breathless sentences to clipped half-lines under pain-flare. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk zero. Filter verbs (“I felt”) are minimal and voice-motivated. Experimental elision (“three suns ahead of schedule”) is taught early and paid off in eclipse reversal.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</comment>
<comment>Metaphor density is high but patterned—cobalt, eclipse, rooting—so reads intentional rather than purple. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or pressure. Sentence variety strong: participial openers balanced with blunt monosyllables (“I let the maze drink”). One mixed-metaphor risk: “lungs fizzing with anxious elation” but saved by embodied specificity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</comment>
<comment>Premise fuses eco-fantasy with body-horror graft; familiar urban-nature covenant refreshed by scar-antenna mechanic. Transformation test passes: visionary surrender to hedge-double is particular to this voice. Risk in second-person embedded imperative (“Heed the scars”) but reads as intentional legacy-device. No close echoes of famous scenes; cobalt/eclipse motif feels idiosyncratic.</comment>
