<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The chronicler’s interiority is vivid and character-specific—her jealousy of past selves, her professional reflex to “distill chaos into narrative,” her willingness to sign a contract with erosion—each micro-choice reveals a hierarchy of values under pressure. The final renunciation (letting the scroll vanish) is earned by the spiral of envy and the felt cost of erasure. Flaw: the eagle-flight is reported memory, not dramatized choice, so the split-self stakes never fully crystallize in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the scroll’s dissolution reweights time from ladder to wheel and makes the cost of chronicling legible—she will keep mapping spokes even knowing the map disappears. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural; density increases until the snow’s white ink dissolves her own words, tightening the stake of erasure. Orientation is taught early by the dislocated date on the scroll and pays off when the grave becomes optional, not mandatory.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The mountain cabin, stove iron, and stone-on-scroll function as micro-setting: the stone pins the scroll long enough for snow to enact erasure, directly enabling the closure image. Cedar smoke, blue-glass snow, and sparks-as-constellations are filtered through a lucid-dreamer’s selective perception, never tourist-catalog. Spatial choreography is clean—footprints lead away before she retreats inside—anchoring the single continuous scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can narrative outrun erasure?—tightens when each new line she writes is literally dissolved by snow, a visible price that forecloses the option of permanent record. The scroll’s vanishing is the decisive reversal: the grave becomes optional, the wheel confirmed, the chronicler’s job reduced to ephemeral naming of splinters. Cost is legible on-page; the stone remains as mute witness that no hiker will ever read.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the recurring image of erasable ink (sparks, soot, snow) rather than overt statement: meaning is not fixed but cyclically consumed. The final reconfiguration—erasure as continuation—reweights “feral nostalgia” from homesickness for sequence to acceptance of recursive loss. No moral is stated; the mountain’s mineral claim is an embodied, non-literal answer to the chronicler’s desire to save anything.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lucid-dreamer particular: “autumn tongues,” “jaded wonder rattling in her ribs,” “feral nostalgia bite”—diction and rhythm embody a mind that metabolizes metaphor for a living. Compression taught early (“time folded like badly stacked paper”) stays legible at closure. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains consistent even during reported eagle flight.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm accelerates with pressure—“Snowflakes landed like white ink, dissolving…”—then breathes into longer cadence for the final monument. Figurative language is patterned (fire, ink, snow as erasable text) rather than ornamental clutter; every metaphor does double duty for theme and setting. Zero paraphrase loops; “scroll” never becomes “document” or “parchment.” Clean grammar and tense throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The lucid-dream archivist who must watch her own words vanish is a fresh angle on the meta-narrative trope; specificity of ranger cabin, eagle over ridge, and mineral mountain gives it lived-in traction. Risky circular structure pays off when the blank center of the spiral becomes the snow-licked scroll. Synthesis feels inevitable: chronicling is revealed as temporary constellation-naming before geological reclamation.</comment>
