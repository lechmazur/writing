<comment>Mara’s interiority is luminous: the zero-g vomit, the spiral shell pressed to her lips, the drain swallowing her birthdays—each beat bodies her panic and curiosity. Her contradictory drives—to keep her past intact yet gorge on future fruit—play simultaneously, not in alternation. The final merger into “book and librarian” is foreshadowed by her lifelong log-keeping and the mirror-page, so the renunciation feels earned, costly, and irreversible. Voice never slips into diagnostic labels; even epiphany is rendered as tactile gesture (tucking the shell into the sky’s spine).</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the sentence “The curator is the catalog” reweights the entire orchard-laboratory system so that forgetting becomes the price of knowledge. Causality is lyric-accumulative: every galaxy-fruit plucked deletes an actual past kindness, a linkage taught in the “page vanished” refrain and paid in the final footnote of starlight. The bathroom-as-chrysalis is seeded early (“only place where telepathy dampened”) and returns to host the decisive inversion—mirror peels into corridor—so the lens holds without ambiguity. Cost is unmistakable: erased birthdays swirl down the drain while new asteroids germinate, making the bargain visceral before the final lullaby.</comment>

<comment>The astral orchard is not backdrop but hydraulic antagonist: its xylem reaches into the pod’s plumbing, flushing memories as fertilizer. Micro-setting—the fogged mirror, phosphorescent moss, toothpaste globules—functions as tool and altar where the spiral shell becomes a stylus that cracks porcelain. Spatial choreography is immaculate: southern root → titanium pod → corridor of books → galaxy-fruit canopy, each transition keyed to a causal threshold. Final image reuses the setting’s matter: the sky itself becomes the spine that holds the new asteroid, so environment literally charges the closure.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—“pursue forbidden knowledge or forfeit sanity page by page”—is signaled in paragraph 3 and escalates each time Mara plucks a fruit and loses a past deed. Agency is continuous: she chooses to press the shell to the drain, inscribing the question that cracks the porcelain and germinates the Index door. Visible price (lost birthdays, apologies, library-book rustling) alters tactics, forcing her to accept curatorship of unlived life. The tightening from orchard to bathroom to Index is a single meaningful deepening that narrows options to fusion or erasure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the impossibility of owning memory and future simultaneously; the orchard literalizes love arriving out of sequence. Subtext operates in gesture: grandmother-voiced black-hole lullabies imply that lullabies are also funeral songs. The final image—“Knowledge is inherited backwards by those who remember to forget”—reweights the premise without moralizing; it is a resonant reconfiguration, not a thesis. Every metaphor (galaxy-fruit, xylem-plumbing, footnote-starlight) is seeded early and harvested at the end, so resonance feels inevitable, not asserted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Voice is irreducibly specific: “brightened disquiet,” “existential steam,” “nonlinear inheritance”——diction that could only belong to this archivist-poet narrator. Rhythmic control under pressure compresses into staccato revelations (“Time folded like origami”) then exhales into lullaby cadence at closure. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains anchored in Mara’s professional gaze (cataloging, grafting, indexing). Experimental elisions (“simply complicated truth”) are pattern-taught by the title-phrase and paid off when the same compression names her final fusion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: every sentence layers image and motion (“her gloved fingers brushing starlight-laden petals that chimed like tuning forks”). No paraphrase loops; each metaphor extends the last without contradiction. Filter verbs are absent; perception is immediate. A single mixed image—“stomachache of revelation”—is forgivable gustatory wordplay that fits the nausea motif. Final third is artifact-free, allowing the closing cadence to ascend without clutter.</question>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The nonlinear-inheritance orchard is not a gimmick but a lived emotional system: every blossom is an unlived memory, every flush of the toilet a forgone kindness. Familiar tropes (forbidden knowledge, memory-erasing fruit) are inverted so that the price of future wisdom is literal loss of past love. Risky structural recursion—story as footnote to itself—pays off when the reader realizes the “gentle warning” is printed in the same starlight they just read. Specificity of science-fantasy botany (xylem-linked plumbing, galaxy-fruit with black-hole seeds) makes the concept inseparable from this asteroid alone.</comment>
