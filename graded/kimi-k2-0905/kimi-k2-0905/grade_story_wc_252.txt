<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her refusal to let the island ghost away from her is rooted in dockside muscle memory and a lifelong choreography between pulleys and rage. The scrimshaw’s heat against her hip and her whispered “I’m not your guilt, Jack; I’m your exit wound” dramatize contradictory impulses in real time. The final renunciation—slipping the carving back to the sea—pays for the new cadence she claims, but the beat is so lyrically compressed that the cost is felt more as image than as palpable forfeiture, keeping her just shy of the 9-band.</comment>

<comment>The lens is Accumulative/Textural: each image—floating street, kelp-locked beam, whale-call echo—adds density until the raft city reconfigures life without blades. Closure is a Charged Poise: Lira’s release of the scrimshaw charges the final image with conceptual cost—the island’s old myth dissolves into an unruled horizon. The cost is legible in the line “taking Brine Jack’s legacy with it,” making the before/after legible without causal over-determination.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The sublittoral fringe is not backdrop but leverage: barnacled ladder rungs bruise calves, breathing rocks decide where feet can pivot, and the whale’s call vibrates through sole and sternum to force the raft spiral. The whalebone itself becomes micro-setting—its heating ivory dictates when memory unlocks and when Lira lets go. This tactile environmental pressure directly shapes the final image, satisfying the 9-gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—will the island stay and what myth will survive—tightens when each floating timber locks into kelp-willed spiral under Lira’s song. The whale-call deepens the cadence, forcing a public stance: she must teach others to dive rather than chain them to decay. The price is visible—old ground dissolves into foam—foreclosing any return to blade-bound identity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of violence-to-coral: gentleness becomes the weapon that can hold a city together. The carved lovers inside a whale’s rib reweight prior plunder into cradle, offering a non-literal answer—tenderness is not soft but the hardest combat. No moral is stated; the final horizon is un-ruled, inviting reflection without tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric-cinematic: “timbers lifting like wings, foundations sighing seaward” compresses spectacle without losing dockworker grit. Perceptual signature is anchored in nautical body—rope-burn palms, salt-cold lungs—never drifting into tourist catalog. Rhythm modulates between war-cry staccato and lullaby legato, mirroring the whale’s own cadence, keeping diction within Lira’s plausible lexicon even at heights of metaphor.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences do triple duty—image, motion, thematic reverb—without paraphrase loops. Only one mixed metaphor risks overgrowth: “island trying to leave her” personifies land yet the image pays off when the ground literally dissolves. No scaffold clogs the final third; the release of the scrimshaw lands clean, so 9-band is reachable despite hairline figurative density earlier.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>The coral-at-midnight rule flip and raft-city that follows a whale’s choir feels inevitable yet wholly fresh; no template plot carries this exact physics of guilt and flotation. Risk—letting an island drift apart rather than defend it—heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity of dock hymns sung to bawdy harmonies and starved lichens on breathing rocks roots the invention in lived texture, making the abstract premise indelibly particular.</comment>
