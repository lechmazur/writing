<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The lore-keeper’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her fingers tracing ruby mortar, her implant syncing with ancient circuits—yet her contradictory impulses (curiosity vs lineage duty) are stated more than dramatized. The final acceptance of bridged responsibility is credible, but the cost feels conceptual rather than visceral because we see no moment where she nearly chooses otherwise. Still, her perceptual signature stays consistent and character-specific throughout.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>A single, continuous scene anchors who-where-when within the first 120 words; the drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of painted layers, ruby fragments, biolum fruit—escalating toward the crown’s reconstitution. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the throne accepts her not as monarch but as living bridge, the conceptual cost (“maintaining the delicate balance”) legible in the final smile. No causal amnesia or teleporting props; mural reveal and spiral staircase are set up by the ruby’s molecular map.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is filtered through goal-directed action: torch peeling paint, neural interface with stone, orchard fruit tasted for futures. The ruby flakes and implant serve as micro-settings that constrain choices—door won’t open without both. Spatial choreography is tight; no floating rooms. Final image of ruby throne charging the crown’s reassembly gives the 9+ gate—environment directly shapes the closing beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“until sunrise to find the stairway”—is signaled early; sunrise light shifting the waterfall colors supplies visible tightening. Escalation is textural: each peeled layer reveals older murals, each spiral step rejoins crown fragments, reweighting knowledge rather than narrowing external options. Protagonist’s agency remains high—she chooses to interface, to climb, to sit—yet the cost is conceptual (lifelong custodianship) rather than a concrete loss on the page, keeping the score just below 8.5.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Theme emerges from the accretion of paint, technology, and memory: progress and tradition need a living bridge, not a conqueror. Subtext lives in objects—ruby flake as both crown shard and historical breadcrumb—never moralized. Final smile at “beautiful absurdity” offers Charged Poise that reweights prior images without sermon. No thematic echo lines; complexity stays intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person tight POV stays locked to the lore-keeper; perceptual signature is consistent—she notices geological strata of paint, tastes memory-peaches, feels quantum key in implant. Syntax grows slightly breathless under spiral ascent, mirroring cork-screwing light. No head-hopping; diction stays within her educated-archivist lexicon. Dialogue absent by design, voice distinction N/A.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive—each sentence layers sensory or historical data without scaffold. Metaphors are purposeful (paint like old skin, ruby like frozen blood) and non-contradictory; no loops or synonym churn. Opening line anchors voice and stakes, final line resolves by image. One minor over-adornment—“impossible colors” repeated twice—stops this just short of 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Futuristic nostalgia is synthesized through lived detail: plasma torch meeting mortar, neural implant handshake with archaic circuits, GM fruit that tastes like childhood. The stairway-as-spiral-light and throne-as-single-ruby feel fresh yet inevitable. Risk—merging tech, magic, and lyric history—heightens stakes without clutter. Not a template echo; the transformation is specific to this voice.</comment>
