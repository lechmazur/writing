<comment>Cassidy’s hierarchy of values—mother’s name > father’s myth > her own memory—emerges through embodied micro-choices (pacing, uncapping the pot, blowing on ink). The final forfeiture of the lullaby is a palpable, irreversible cost that retroactively justifies every prior beat. Interiority stays concrete and character-specific; no diagnostic shorthand. Only hairline gap: the “mathematics” metaphor is voiced twice but never tested in scene, a micro-telegraph that slightly undercuts the interior contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Causal lattice holds: because Julian died → Cassidy waits; because ink demands payment → she sacrifices memory; because Rurik writes → granite melts. The single-scene orientation is locked by line 3, the 2:13 a.m. timestamp tightens the clock, and the closure image—blood-addressed envelope—delivers conceptual cost under Charged Poise. No teleporting props, no policy hand-waving; every rule is paid for on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The prep room is not backdrop but tool: formaldehyde+lilac scent narrows Cassidy’s gut, the bone saw foreshadows amputation of memory, fluorescent flicker externalizes the policy breach. Stainless-steel counter and eyelid-weight drawers supply tactile resources that constrain how she handles the ink. Spatial choreography is clean; the ink pot never drifts off-stage. Final image of lamplight on wet pavement reweights the sterile interior into a live exterior—an environmental pivot that charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—posthumous asylum—signaled in paragraph 4 and tightened exactly once: when the nib drinks the lullaby, “policy” becomes wet soap and options collapse. Protagonist agency drives every turn; no coincidence resolves anything. Cost is visible and felt (melody vanishes, Rurik trembles, cap cracks). Escalation obeys causal lens: each because tightens until the final charged poise.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of con-artist legacy: stories liquefied, not sold; memory traded, not monetized. The refugee memorial wall reframes national grief into personal ledger, avoiding moral sermon. Subtext operates in gesture—Rurik’s refrigerated smile versus Cassidy’s soft courtesy—rather than exposition. Final image of blood-addressed envelope reweights “fair trade” into visceral, non-literal answer: mathematics paid in body.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is knife-clean, synesthetic (“smelling of iron and thunder”), with a perceptual signature that filters every detail through Cassidy’s con-bred precision. No head-hopping; psychic distance compresses under pressure (“she felt the tune vanish”). Dialogue is sparse but subtextual—Rurik’s brittle laugh versus Cassidy’s detonator courtesy—advancing plot without expository spill. Prose rhythm accelerates at breach, breathes at blow-dry, mirroring pulse of ink.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops, zero scaffold; every sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is sparse, pattern-taught (“granite policies” returns as “granite liquefy”) and paid off. Syntax varies: fragment “Trade requires disclosure” acts as detonator click; longer sentence unfurls policy amendments. Opening line anchors voice and stakes instantly; final line resolves by image that recharges blood-as-ink motif. Clean grammar, no register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: magical-realist bureaucratic ink inside a funeral-home heist, inverted so the con is truth, the payment is memory. Refugee politics reframed as alchemical ledger feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk—using a single-scene, low-dialogue, concept-driven arc—heightens claustrophobia without gimmickry. Not quite 9+ because the “mathematics” metaphor is announced not dramatized, a trace of template convenience.</comment>
