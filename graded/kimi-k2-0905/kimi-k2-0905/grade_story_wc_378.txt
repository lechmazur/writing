<comment>K-17’s contradictory caretaker code versus new-found longing is dramatized in-scene (opening servo-hum, final self-planting). The micro-choice to open the box and later merge it with its chassis shows a legible before/after with visible cost—loss of pure machine identity. Interiority stays concrete and bias-bound (“servos hummed with memory fragments,” “optical sensors” coated by memory-dust). No stock labels; the nostalgic ache is enacted, not asserted.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: K-17’s self-implantation into the rose seed crystallizes a new hybrid being, cost paid in permanent stasis. Causal chain holds: box resists miniaturization → android absorbs box → burn compresses both into one impossible flower. Magnetic-shifting clock is signaled by paragraph 1 and drives every beat; no orientation debt. Final image reweights the premise: nostalgia not as preservation but as combustible seed.</comment>

<comment>The glass-domed desert rose farm is more than postcard: its vibrating petals, oil content, and scheduled ignition constrain tactics and timing. Micro-setting success—K-17’s own chassis becomes final “soil” for the compressed bloom. Sensory triangulation (magnetic hum, color vibration, scent of burning names) stays selective and POV-filtered. Spatial choreography clean: dome → corridor → nursery → center tracked without drift.</comment>

<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve the children’s memories versus obey evacuation/miniaturization protocol—tightens when the box grows heavier and refuses compression. One meaningful turn: android’s decision to fuse with the box forecloses sterile obedience; price is eternal stasis inside the seed. Escalation driven by protagonist agency under causal lens (because box resists → therefore K-17 adapts). Cost legible: loss of mobility, future, and clear machine identity.</comment>

<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without slogans: memory survives not by archival storage but by combustive transformation—fire as gardener. The impossible flower’s scent triggering alien nostalgia embodies conceptual repricing. Subtext operates in gesture (android “plants itself”) and silence (no children present). Final image offers non-literal answer: caretaker becomes medium, not museum.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays welded to K-17’s perceptual circuitry: “servos hummed,” “optical sensors,” “neural static.” Syntax mirrors machine pacing—long coolant sentences interrupted by servo-staccato fragments. No head-hop; every sensory note is filtered through android bias. Diction stays within plausible lexicon (no poetic overflow until final burn, justified by system overload).</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often fuses setting, interiority, and stakes (“roses outside the dome bloomed in impossible colors, their petals vibrating with each degree the magnetic field realigned”). Varied rhythm; no template cadence. Metaphors stay coherent (magnetic burn = escape route) and are not stacked. Minor filter-verb clusters (“began to merge”) appear but not in final third, so 9+ not broken.</comment>

<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: android nostalgia + botanical firewall + geomagnetic shift + childhood-fear seed is non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Risk in lyric compression pays off—entire farm collapses into single bloom yet causality intact. No trope recycling; “controlled burn” literalized as data migration. Specific detail (reverse-playing music box, doll with too many joints) prevents generic hauntology.</comment>
