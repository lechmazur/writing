<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cassian’s contradictory motives—inherit the lie, overwrite the lie, become the wolf—are dramatized in every beat (pressing the lattice to stone, stepping onto the impossible stair). His body is salt-bitten, breath metallic, each micro-choice (leaving the lattice behind, taking the heartbeat-hush) visibly priced. The final self-wolfing emerges from prior causal logic, not epiphany. Interiority is concrete (“the hush… became a heartbeat he could finally trust”), never label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the lattice reframes the father’s lies into a true beam, Cassian walks out carrying the hush as pulse—cost is the forfeiture of innocence and the acceptance of paternal curse. Causal lattice (“because the boy bit wood”) → accumulative echo (“every corridor bore his father’s name”) → final downward stair rewrites lineage. Orientation anchored by copperlight/hinges/lens by line 4; no penalty. The hovering floor forgets gravity twice, each time paid off in stance shift; no retroactive rule change.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse is not backdrop but hydraulic antagonist: gravity loosens, bars sprout kelp, lens blades slice dark into slow-motion fins. Copperlight repose is tasted, smelled, weighed—constrains every step and finally becomes the color of absolution. Micro-objects (oil-cloth, barnacle buttons, barnacled coat) are handled, evolve state, charge the exit. Spatial choreography exact: catwalk, lens, stair, reef boats track cleanly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: will Cassian overwrite or surrender to the inherited lie? Pressure tightens when the hush refuses interrogation until fed his voice, then again when the lattice returns confession. Visible prices: forfeiture of silence (he speaks aloud), forfeiture of sanctuary (leaves lattice rotating inside), forfeiture of denial (claims the wolf). Agency drives each escalation—no off-stage rescue. Final tread on impossible stair narrows option to self-wolfing; cost legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges as withheld truth metabolized into lived myth: the wolf is not external predator but the shape silence takes when silence is inherited. Subtext in gesture—pressing lattice to stone, stepping onto light-beam stairs—never sermon. Resonant reconfiguration: the lens now grinds lies into usable beams, absolution redefined as refraction rather than forgiveness. No moral stated; final line “a story that would need no listener” is Charged Poise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is salt-bitten, copper-metallic, gull-blooded; syntax coils like the hush—“coiling, fleeing; he was chasing hush the way men chase fog.” Rhythm accelerates through fragment clusters under pressure, breathes in longer cadences during suspension. No head-hopping; single POV interiority stays barnacle-close. Compression (“timeframe pressed like tide”) is taught early and paid off in final urgency. Diction never exceeds fisherman’s son lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings avoid template cadence. Information density high—“lattice from confessional—pried from the chapel the night keepers vanished—was wrapped in oilcloth” does triple duty. No mixed metaphors; copperlight stays consistent across visual, tactile, moral valence. Minor scaffold: “the hush was a living thing, coiling, fleeing” repeats concept twice in adjacent clauses—−0.2; does not touch closure. Pronoun refs clean; no synonym churn.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Familiar fable transmuted into ontological noir: lighthouse as prison, lie as coral-sustained color, wolf as self. Specificity—barnacle-buttoned coat, Fresnel blades slicing dark—makes the transformation irreplicable. Risk of surreal gravity accepted and earned by internal rule set. Fresh inflection: the son weaponizes inherited mendacity into a usable beam, converting moral into optical. Synthesis feels inevitable only after the final step.</comment>
