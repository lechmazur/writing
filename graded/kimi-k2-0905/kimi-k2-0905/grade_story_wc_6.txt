<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory imperatives—honour the arsonist-father yet fight fire—are dramatized in every tactile micro-choice (mixing sand into dune soil, tying the coin, tapping her burn). Interiority stays embodied, never drifting into label-speak; the “private Morse” on her lava-rippled arm distills a life-time of training. The final refusal to keep bringing sand, and the promise of saplings, costs her the ritual she’s nursed since age seven; the cost is visible, earned. Voice remains singular, no occupational exposition dumps; firefighter competence is shown through poised gesture, not data.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the sand ritual is traded for living forest, crystallizing a before/after stance under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Causal links are tight: sand → graft → coin → promise; each step is irreversible, re-weighting memory into growth. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within first 80 words; no penalty. Cost is legible in the final salute—“neither proud nor ashamed”—which seals the loss of purity and the acceptance of hybrid soil.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lagoon, dunes, salt wind, kelp-drift clouds: every environmental note is filtered through Mara’s fire-trained attention—she notices burnable pitch, wind direction, cloud “like bruises.” The obsidian water and black sand literally fuse into the graft, making setting a co-agent in the ritual. Spatial choreography is clean: edge-scoop-trench-tie-salute; bodies never float. Micro-setting (coin on bark) constrains the final symbolic beat, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—turn inherited ash into living growth—tightens once: commitment to grafting the sand is irreversible; alternatives (bury, scatter, keep) are discarded on-page. Escalation is textural: each handful of sand increases the moral density until the coin ties the act to her heartbeat. No external antagonist needed; internal guilt/love supply coherent pressure. Cost is felt in the canteen pour that “disappears into the dark seam,” an image of irreversible absorption.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme—scar tissue as potential music—emerges solely through image and action; no thesis statements. The black sand literally becomes the bass-line of future forest; the coin is the tuning peg. Final non-literal answer: a salute to a tree wearing a foreign moon, reconciling arson and rescue without moralizing. Complexity is preserved: father remains condemned, daughter still loyal, tone stays ambivalent.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited adheres to Mara’s firefighter sensorium—smell of pine, taste of salt, feel of guilty grains. Syntax flexes with pressure: long vapor-like clauses for lagoon calm, curt “tapped it twice” for drill discipline. No head-hop; gull cry is external cue, not avian POV. Register stays within her vocational lexicon; “sprinkler heads in a burning hallway” is precise, not decorative.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences layer job credential, sensory data, and moral weight (“firefighter’s coat unzipped to the salt wind”). Figurative language is sparing, never consecutive; each metaphor is purposeful (clouds like kelp, skin like lava). Zero paraphrase loops; no filter-verb clusters. Rhythm breathes with the scene—long inhale for description, clipped exhalation for action. Proofing clean; no typos or ambiguous pronouns.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The arsonist-daughter/firefighter dyad is familiar mythic territory, yet the grafting ritual and foreign-coin heartbeat feel freshly particular. Risk is taken in the lyric, accumulative structure rather than twist; reader must assemble pattern from recurring sand, coin, burn. Synthesis feels inevitable only at the end—an earned surprise. Voice specificity (firefighter perceptual grammar) prevents generic transplant.</comment>
