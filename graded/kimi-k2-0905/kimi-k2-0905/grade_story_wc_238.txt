<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The exorcist’s guilt and need to fix her worst mistake anchor every beat; her body registers current, scent, silence as embodied cost. Interiority stays concrete—rosin on tongue, microtonal hum in wrist—without slipping into label-speak. Only flaw: the sister-ghost flickers in as pure symbol rather than a second will exerting unpredictable pressure, so relationship crucible reads slightly one-sided.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: she archives the empty bottle beside the score, a resonant reconfiguration that makes forgiveness an ongoing attunement, not a transaction. Causal chain holds—perfume withheld → spoken apology → ghost solidifies → scent released → engines start—each step narrows her options. Cost is visible: the bottle’s emptiness and the falling tree’s low E are irreversible. Induced current is taught early and pays off at the climax, no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sheet-music archive functions as micro-setting: metal shelf conducts current, manuscript paper drinks scent, fluorescent ballast hums her sister’s name—every surface constrains action. Selective sensory hierarchy—dust motes as arpeggios, ionized iron taste—mirrors musician’s ear, never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography clean: bottle placed on clef, pages rustle without wind, tractors idle at property line. Final image of out-of-season lilac recharges the archive’s bottled resonance, passing 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can she earn forgiveness—tightens when the drop refuses to fall until she speaks aloud, foreclosing the miracle shortcut. Agency drives every turn: she chooses speech over scent, then archives the empty bottle, accepting permanent echo instead of neat absolution. Escalation is lyrical but legible: silence → spoken confession → visible notation cyclone → fading ghost → chainsaw 4/4. Cost persists: orchard destroyed, perfume spent, apology irretrievably public.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from iterated musical metaphors—silence as dissonance, rest as dwelling place—without abstract exposition. The final image reweights “imperfect miracle” from gimmick to living resonance, refusing moral tag. Subtext operates in gesture: aligning bottle base with clef substitutes for embrace. Insight earned on-page: grief is bowing air until music believes you—she lives the metaphor, no tidy redemption.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice owns a perfomer’s synesthetic lexicon—slow arpeggios of dust, microtonal lament in wiring—sustained across compression and lyric elision. Diction stays inside musician’s idiom; no register drift even at peak. Perceptual signature distinct: she feels electricity as musical intervals, apology as rosin on tongue. Rhythm modulates with stress—short pizzicato whispers from ghost against long legato of her apology.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density: every sentence layers sensory, emotional, conceptual work without scaffold. Figurative language is patterned and paid off—cyclone of staves returns in final line as “echo.” One near-mix: “induced currents…singing a microtonal lament” momentarily personifies wiring, but within musician POV. No loops, no filter-verb stacks; clauses track causally under time pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: celebrity exorcist + sheet-music archive + perfume that resurrects wrong memories fuses into unforeseeable but inevitable logic. Risk of dense metaphor never compromises clarity; instead it intensifies the thematic equation between sound, scent, and forgiveness. Transformation test fails if swapped—only violinist sibling could live inside rests. Final reconfiguration feels both surprising and predestined, hallmark originality.</comment>
