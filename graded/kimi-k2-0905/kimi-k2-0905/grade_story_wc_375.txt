<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interiority is visceral—charcoal twitching in knuckles, taste of iron on tongue—while contradictory impulses (hide vs. complete, curse vs. gift) collide in-scene. The mother-daughter fusion is earned: the lock’s warm click and audible laugh pay the psychological cost of reopening trauma, making the final renunciation of sketching faces feel irreversible. Memory as both weapon and womb is lived, not labeled.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: 4-7-9 lock → forbidden hatch → mother’s canvas → crystal collaboration → lock snaps open at reversed 9-7-4, releasing the laugh that becomes harmony. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the portrait fuses two women into one winged geology, foreclosing the old monetized memory trade. Cost is audible—the lock’s spine-crack and released laughter—persistent constraint now is “blank sheets,” not portraits.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Crystal cave is not backdrop but active collaborator: every drawn line seeds mineral growth that literally petrifies memory. The broken lock’s warm click and numbered wheels turning themselves provide tactile prop constraint. “Iron and wet pennies” taste keeps the subterranean breath alive; spatially she moves from quartz wall → gypsum ledge → crystal wall, each surface demanding bodily contact.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—escape or embrace her mnemonic curse—tightens when the cave turns memory into geology, foreclosing passive hiding. Escalation is crystalline: each stroke narrows future options until blank sheets become the only remaining path. Price is paid on-page: nails crack, charcoal snaps, and the open lock irreversibly releases the mother’s laugh into public sky.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges via mineral metaphor: memory is sediment that can either entomb or become wings. Subtext operates in silence—the absent carousel crash and the unheard mother’s laugh until the lock opens. Final image of “7-4-9 rewritten as crystal growth” offers Conceptual Repricing: time itself is malleable strata, not calendar. No moralizing—just the sky suddenly knowing an underground color.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyric third-person hovers at skin-level, mirroring artist’s synesthetic sight: “pink and pale greens bleeding like dawn over a battlefield.” Syntax lengthens and fragments under pressure, matching charcoal strokes. Perceptual signature—every surface refracts faces—stays consistent; no head-hop. “Auroral sorrow” and “pickaxe kisses” show diction calibrated to cave-light and occupational scar.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sentences vary from breathless accumulation to crystalline fragments; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purpose-built: “pickaxe kisses” marries violence and intimacy, “mnemonic rescue mission” compresses vocation and filial duty. Information density high—one line fuses sensory taste, emotional state, and plot cue. Marginal −0.1 for occasional adjective bloom (“auroral sorrow”) yet it pays off in closure reprise.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Fusion of abandoned amusement-park noir with mineral cathedral feels inevitable, not grafted. Memory-as-geology trope is refreshed through literal crystal growth that imprisons pigment. Structural risk—lyric mosaic rather than scene—heightens pressure without obscuring causality. Final reversal of numbered dates into crystal lattice is a fresh inflection unseen in trunk submissions.</comment>
