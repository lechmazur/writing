<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The painter’s interior contradiction—yearning to gift the heartbeat yet fearing self-erasement—drives every micro-choice; the final renunciation costs her the compass that defined her, a price felt in the sphere’s absence. Embodied emotion arrives in “her own pulse bucked,” “warm against her palm,” grounding the abstract trade. Flaws (solitude-dependence, risk-aversion) actively complicate the climax; no safety-hedging. The heartbeat’s surrender is earned by every prior mirror test and memory forfeit, making the endurance credible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: gifting the heartbeat reweights the city’s mirrors from scar-showers to possibility-windows with undeniable social cost—she forfeits her currency. Lyrical mosaic (four short shards) taught its pattern by 25% and holds an Accumulative/Textural lens throughout; final bell-pigment shower crystallizes cadence shift. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3; no penalty. Cost is legible in “she set the heartbeat inside the frame,” leaving her without compass; earlier causal trades foretell this loss.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The prism parapet’s refractive property—splitting rain into spectrum—literally enables the closing vision of citizens receiving personal spectrums; the terrace’s cracked mirrors act as jury, forcing her choice. Rain-polished stone and vine-strangled marble are handled tactilely while she climbs. Sensory hierarchy obeys her painter eye: color, reflectivity, temperature. Spatial choreography tracks mirrors and sphere across moves. Weather is causal: rain both reveals and erases, feeding the mirrors’ appetite. Micro-setting qualifies: the heartbeat-sphere functions as portable “setting” that constrains tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—liberate mirrors from brutal truth into possibility—signals early and tightens when the third mirror demands the heartbeat’s forfeiture; this deepens the cost of her mission. Agency: she elects to gift the pulse, enduring permanent loss rather than eternal solitary painting. No coincidence; pressure is coherent under Accumulative/Textural lens: each mirror vision layers denser stakes until the crack-sealing payoff. Price is visible: she exits “without compass or currency,” bell pigment replacing the sphere’s warmth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the ethics of imaginative intervention versus factual austerity. Subtext lives in silence—no explicit thesis, only the lullaby’s code and the mirror’s reluctant bloom. Final image of children singing unaware reweights earlier “hush-a-bye” from private tool to public contagion, charging resonance. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity persists—will mirrors lie? Complexity honored: her gift is both triumph and self-exile.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric close-third stays strictly within her perceptual signature: “bruised violets and slow gold” is painterly chromatic bias. Rhythm modulates: long breathless cadences for ascent, clipped fragments at mirror confrontations. Patterned diction (rain-split light, heartbeat-flutter) taught early and paid off in bell-pigment shower. No head-hopping; unreliability never asserted. Syntax mirrors her grace: enjambed clauses flow like brushstrokes, then crack into diagonal fragments at climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: each sentence layers sensorium, world-rule, and emotional charge without redundancy. Figurative control: metaphors (living chandeliers, jury of mirrors) extend coherent visual field. Zero paraphrase loops; no scaffold. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves via image that recharges prism/rain motif. Micro-movements (“she hummed… louder, weaving new lines”) advance plot, not puppetry. Register stable within lyric fabulism; no thesaurus churn.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: mirror ethics + coded lullaby + tradable infant pulse creates a non-obvious moral economy that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk in lyric mosaic pays off by teaching pattern early and keeping closure legible. Tropes (magic mirror, rain-soaked tower) are inverted—mirrors learn kindness, rain stays suspended. Conceptual integrity: world rules (heartbeat as currency, song as code) pursued to final bell-pigment diffusion. Emotional specificity grounds speculative frame, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
