<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ellery’s grief is rendered through embodied, specific action—cradling the blower, hearing the impossible giggle—so the interior contradiction is live. The micro-choice to throttle the engine gentler is a visible, costly pivot that earns the closure. No stock therapeutic self-talk; the flaw (clinging to noise) compounds until the tunnel gifts him a laughter he cannot keep. The arc lands in Earned Stasis: he shoulders the machine and walks away, silence now stitched with after-laugh, cost felt in the frayed pull-cord pressed to glass.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the tunnel’s final tremor of mirth reconfigures the silence forever, concrete ribs humming with conceptual cost. Causal lens holds—because he restarts the blower, therefore the echo multiplies laughter he knows is impossible yet accepts. The empty hourglass at 3:07 a.m. anchors who-when-where inside 30 words; orientation is immediate. No lens ambiguity; every beat tightens the single stake: can absence be given shape?</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The tunnel is not backdrop; its acoustic properties enable the entire climax—sound lingers like a ghost, literalizing the haunting. Cracked pull-cord, concrete throat, off-key wind are tactile, lived-in, and returned in the final image. Spatial choreography is clean: machine upright, feet planted, laughter ricocheting wall to wall. Environment actively constrains tactics and charges the closing image, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore lost laughter—tightens once: the gentler throttle feeds the impossible giggle, foreclosing denial. Escalation is accumulative: each echo layers density until the suburb’s porch lights flick on, externalizing cost. No false antagonist; pressure is the tunnel’s own acoustic logic. Price is visible—he kneels, palms pressed to stone, accepting the laughter he cannot hold.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particular: a leaf-blower lullaby making absence audible. No moralizing; the final whispered “Keep it safe” to an hourglass is image, not thesis. The reweighting is subtle—silence is no longer vacant but glow-shot—inviting reflection without dictation. Subtext operates in gesture: cord wrapped like a pendulum that has finished counting heartbeats.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person lyric pulses with Ellery’s perceptual signature—sound as marble, dust in lungs, concrete ribs. Syntax mirrors grief: long breathy clauses collapse into fragmentary whispers at throttle-drop. No filter-verb clutter; “macerated itself against his ribs” is embodied, not explanatory. Pattern of compressed elision (“the house forgot how to laugh”) is taught early and paid off in the final exhalation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops, zero scaffold; every sentence advances. Rhythmic variation mirrors engine rev:堆积的从句在风道中加速，then cut to a single sob-sentence when the engine dies. Metaphors stay coherent—engine howl = sour orchestra, laughter = rubber ball of light—no mixed vehicles. High information density: “thumb brushing the cracked pull-cord handle that had started a thousand gusty crescendos” does world, backstory, and emotion in one stroke.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: grief processed through backyard power-tool acoustics in a freight tunnel. The leaf-blower-as-organ is specific, irreplaceable; swap to guitar or trumpet and the physics collapse. Risk—engine roar as lullaby—pays off tonally and thematically. Avoids sentimentality by letting the laugh remain echo, not resurrection.</comment>
