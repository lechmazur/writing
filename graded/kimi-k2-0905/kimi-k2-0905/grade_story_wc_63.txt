<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The winder’s guilt-laden vocation and the brother’s ghost-field create a crucible of contradictory duty: keep the clock and the sea devours, stop it and the village’s time-economy collapses. Interiority is concrete—“searing reverie of salt and machine oil,” arms burning while winding—never abstract. The final act of lashing the rake handle to the pendulum is a micro-choice that externalizes the internal split and costs him the tower’s original tempo; the slowed beat is the embodied price. Only the villagers’ off-stage fear keeps this from a 9+: we never see one villager’s face crack under the new cadence, so the social cost is inferred rather than witnessed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the pendulum’s lowered note re-weights every prior tick as a vow rather than a verdict, and the cost—public time slackens, the ridge may yet widen—is legible in the final image. Causal chain holds: because he carves the missing “r,” the bob must be counter-weighted, therefore the beat slows, therefore contracts thaw. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“inside the clock tower that straddled the ridge”) and the lens (Causal) is held without wobble. No teleporting props; the rake handle’s fishhook-tipped journey from apology to pendulum counterweight is traceable throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The tidal obsidian ridge is not backdrop but antagonist: its black glass teeth narrow each year, forcing the tower’s existence and the winder’s dilemma. Micro-setting—the brass pendulum, the escapement wheel dusted with wood pollen—constrains the final mechanical modification. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: a custodian notices machine oil, salt corrosion on iron bones, the pendulum’s changed note. Only the absence of a living second body on stage prevents a 9+: the village exists as shuttered windows, so spatial choreography is perfect but socially thin.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—land vs. measured guilt—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightens when the final letter makes absolution mutual, forcing the counterweight swap that slows public time. One meaningful turn: the pendulum’s slackened beat forecloses the village’s prior economic tempo; the price is audible and irreversible. No coincidence; escalation is driven solely by the protagonist’s decision under the Causal lens. Cost is visible—villagers “rubbing their ears,” fields glinting “wet” as future possibility—but because the ridge’s retreat is a someday-maybe, the price feels prospective rather than immediate, keeping this just under 9+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the mechanism itself: forgiveness is not a feeling but a systemic re-calibration that slows the entire social clock. The rake handle’s incremental letters embody the impossibility of private absolution without public consequence. Final image—pendulum ticking “for-give, for-give” beneath a sky that “suddenly belongs to no creditor”—reweights all prior debt-based time without moralizing. No thematic echo; the word “forgive” is completed, never declared.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person voice carries a maritime engineer’s precision—“brass pendulum,” “escapement wheel,” “mainspring”—yet tilts into salt-corroded lyricism: “obsidian teeth grinding bone.” Perceptual signature is consistent: the same mind that measures pendulum arc in inches also hears a lowered vowel as moral shift. Rhythm modulates from clipped dawn vigil to the lengthened cadence of the slowed clock, taught early and paid off in the final auditory image. No head-hopping, no register drift; every clause is oil-scented and tide-haunted.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentence variety is orchestral: long breathless coils of clause followed by hammer-short beats (“The pendulum hovers.”). Information density is high—each sentence performs at least two jobs (image + causality, memory + stake). Figurative control is near-flawless: “black glass hissing like hot iron” is fresh yet physically accurate; only one mixed vehicle (“orange grief” on iron bones) momentarily abstracts. Zero loops, zero scaffold; the final line’s monosyllabic tick-tock is earned, not forced.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The clock tower that measures guilt instead of hours is a fresh conceptual engine; turning a rake handle into the pendulum’s counterweight literalizes incremental absolution with mechanical inevitability. Risk is high—lyric compression inside a single scene, no dialogue, no named characters—yet coherence never frays. The synthesis of maritime erosion, fiscal time, and sibling restitution feels inevitable in hindsight. No derivative echo; the image of a village walking slower under a farmer’s contrition is singular.</comment>
