<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The protagonist’s ache is palpable, but her decisions are more impulse than dialectic; we watch memories flash but see no contradictory drives collide in real time. The final renunciation lands as lyrical assertion (“the map she had drawn was the home she missed”) rather than as a choice paid for on the page. Interiority is vivid yet curiously diagnostic (“chronologically homesick”)—a label that short-circuits embodied contradiction. Micro-choices are present (etching, kneeling, raising hands) but they don’t narrow or foreclose live options; the cost is aesthetic, not tactical.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a luminous Resonant Reconfiguration: the mirrored horizon folds into her eyelid, a Charged Poise that makes the cost conceptual yet undeniable. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than because/therefore; pattern is taught early (mirrored lake = backward score) and paid off in the final image. Orientation anchors (who-when-where) arrive late (~140 words) but the delay is purposeful disorientation that later serves closure, so waiver applies. No meaningful tightening inside the 30-minute window—time feels poetic, not tactical—hence barred from 8.8+ band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Glass spire, frozen lake, and nautilus shell are not backdrop but instrument: the spire becomes an organ pipe, the lake a soundboard, the shell a baton—environment literally constrains the symphony she conducts. Sensory hierarchy obeys her composer-perceiver bias: sound and refraction dominate, smell (ink/yeast) arrives as Proustian trigger. Spatial choreography is immaculate; we track her climb, etch, kneel, raise hands without drift. Micro-setting qualifies: the shell’s fractured edge is the stylus that scores glass and rewrites her temporal exile.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—compose the unheard symphony before exhaustion—arrives early but its cost is conceptual, not visceral; no resource (time, stamina, tool-life) visibly depletes. Escalation is textural: each etched memory thickens the score rather than narrows her options. The 30-minute clock is lyrically announced yet never compresses tactics; dawnlight, not dwindling minutes, drives tempo. Persistent constraint (the ache) shapes the final stance but the price is spiritual, not dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as inversion: home is not a place but a palimpsest you etch backward through time. The mirrored horizon literalizes memory-as-score; the symphony is the self refracted. No moral is stated; the final image (horizon folded into eyelid) reweights every prior fortune she wrote. Subtext hums in the silence after the fourth movement: the audience is every version of her, listening from the other side of the mirror—an earned conceptual irony.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is a sustained lyric tremolo—syntax stretches like reversed lullabies, diction stays within a poet-composer’s lexicon (“parabolic curves,” “sub-audible B-flat”). Perceptual signature is unmistakable: she hears chords between heartbeats and tastes iron in wind. Patterned elision (no dialogue, no names) is taught in the first paragraph and paid off in the choral silence of the ending. Rhythm accelerates with etched fragments, breathes at each “movement,” then suspends in the upturned hush—precise musical control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Line-level craft is near-flawless: zero paraphrase loops, no scaffold, metaphors stay physically coherent (lake = staff line, spire = tuning fork). Information density is orchestral—each sentence scores memory, object, and sonic effect simultaneously. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line embeds the horizon in her eyelid, recharging every mirrored image. Only micro-drift: “chronologically homesick” is abstract; the paragraph later redeems it via spiral-as-clock, keeping artifact clear of closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><<grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses fortune-cookie aphorism with avant-garde symphony—fresh synthesis, not gimmick. The nautilus-as-stylus and lake-as-backward-score are non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (no antagonist, no spoken word, no physical peril) heightens conceptual stakes without losing clarity. Specificity is microbiological: Devonian tides, frost feathers, marches-into-waltzes—details that could not survive transplantation to another tale.</comment>
