<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—glorifying a father she already half-doubts—plays out in tactile beats: the dented gnomon, the smudged log entry, the choice to beach the barge. Embodied emotion is vivid (“serene upheaval that always preceded revelation”), but the moment she reads the journals is summarized, not dramatized, softening the earned cost. The final renunciation (sundial left in the crate) is legible and weighted, yet we are told rather than shown her knees or lungs react. Still, micro-choices track cleanly up the escalation, and the moral ambiguity stays un-hedged.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: dropping the sundial into the crate crystallizes Mara’s new stance—she will dismantle monuments instead of polish them. Causal linkage holds throughout: forged log → forged memory → bunker discovery → journal confession → symbolic discard. One soft spot: the bunker’s exact location feels conveniently unearthed (no prior obstacle to finding it), but the coordinate scratched on the sundial was seeded early, so coincidence is minor. Cost is visible: the inherited identity is abandoned on-page, and the final image reweights the premise under a causal lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Twilight canal, rusted freighter, and reedy cut are rendered through Mara’s goal-filtered perception: “sluggish water,” “iron walls,” “mouth agape like a whale.” The pocket sundial doubles as micro-setting that constrains choice (shadow reveals coordinate). Spatial choreography stays clean across the single deck and hold; weather (fog, dawn burn-off) parallels internal shift without overt symbolism. One sensory imbalance: almost every cue is visual; a single slapped-water auditory return could have tightened the ellipse.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—exposing the lie that props her life—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens twice: forged weight column → scratched coordinate. Each escalation is protagonist-driven (translate, cross-check, demand beaching). The price is legible: filial myth pulverized on the listing deck, future path foreclosed to statue-polishing. A hair more external resistance (Riga hesitates, engine sputters) could have sharpened cost, but the internal squeeze suffices at this scale.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment> Theme—“the architecture of lies”—emerges from concrete artifacts (logbook, crate, dented brass) rather than commentary. The final image of canal as “scar trying to heal” offers Conceptual Repricing: history itself is wound, not backdrop. No character sermonizes the moral; even Mara’s closing vow is framed as private resolve. The refusal to balance sympathy (father stays damned) keeps complexity honest.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person POV stays snug to Mara’s perceptual bias: maritime jargon filtered through myth-hunter lexicon (“palimpsests of altered routes”). Rhythm modulates—long flooded sentences in fog, staccato verbs at dawn (“slipped,” “nosed,” “salvaged”)—mirroring pressure without syntactic gimmicks. No head-hop; Riga’s interior is never guessed. One near-slip: “serene upheaval” risks abstract editorial intrusion, but it recurs as earned motif, so forgiven.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “twilight barge canal exhaled its first cool breath” fuses atmosphere and agentless motion. Metaphors stay coherent (canal = scar, fog = gold ellipses) and serve the emotional math. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; each paragraph advances knowledge or image. A single overripe phrase—“architecture of lies scaffolded her…life”—is indulgent but occurs mid-story, not at closure, so artifact penalty stays minor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Father-as-war-hero debunking is familiar terrain, yet the antique sundial as both evidence and navigational tool gives the angle freshness. Post-war barge canal, obsolete logbooks, and morning-radio silence are specific cultural debris rarely combined. The synthesis feels inevitable only after the coordinate is read; beforehand the story wears risk of quiet lyricism. Not groundbreaking but distinctly stitched.</comment>
