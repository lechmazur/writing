<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara’s longing is visceral, but her interiority slips into paraphrase (“the rhythm of belonging she’d sought”) rather than contradiction under pressure. The pilgrim’s eyes register surprise yet never complicate his calm, so status tension stays flat. Closure choice—folding the star-map and turning skyward—feels inevitable yet abstract; the emotional cost is asserted, not embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: grandmother’s words → drone pursuit → chip → press → star-map → departure. Orientation is secured by ~100 words; no lens ambiguity. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the map’s frequency reconfigures “home” with conceptual cost legible in the final upward gaze. Minor slack: the pilgrim’s off-screen knowledge of Mara’s parents is a grace-note, not a breach.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Sandstone walls, broken astrolabe, hand-press iron—each surfaces twice and participates in the final print beat, earning micro-setting status. Dusk light is more than backdrop; it enables the chip’s star-shadows that trigger recognition. Spatial choreography is clean; drone, pilgrim, and column positions track without drift. Sensory economy favors visual, but the press’s groan supplies tactile ear-data at climax.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Single dominant stake—decode her frequency of belonging—signalled in paragraph four and tightened once when the press lever is pulled, foreclosing retreat. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral: the star-map rewrites “home” as off-planet, leaving her earth-bound relationships behind. Agency is present but gentle; the lever pull is consensual, not contested. Escalation is modest yet coherent under Causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of “belonging as extraterrestrial frequency” emerges through the chip’s alien constellations rather than exposition. The final image—Mara facing the sky—reweights the earlier sandstone observatory from relic to launch pad, achieving Conceptual Repricing without moralising. Subtext in pilgrim’s “perpetually surprised” eyes hints wonder as vocation, not quirk. No thematic echo lines mar the close.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person close stays locked to Mara; perceptual signature sharp in drone-pilot noticing (“visor,” “tablet,” mechanical bird”). Syntax flexes under wonder—long lyrical sentences mimic star-dazzle, then tighten for lever pull. One filter-verb cluster (“She watched him disappear…”) but offset by immediate bodily action. No head-hopping; pilgrim’s interior is guessed, not ventriloquised.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene tempo: expansive twilight sentences contract to metallic clang at print. Metaphors stay coherent—stars as “captured lightning”—without mixed vehicles. Occasional scaffold: “the dying light” appears twice in four sentences; minor paraphrase loop. No artifact touches the closure beat; final line is clean, image-driven.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Combines drone surveillance, letterpress mysticism, and alien star-chart into a fresh synthesis; trope of “missing parents” is retooled via cosmic frequency rather than abduction cliché. Risk is moderate—quiet lyric ending instead of launch spectacle—but coherence justifies choice. Specificity of brass matrix chip etched with non-terrestrial constellations supplies irreplaceable detail. Could edge higher if cost were more corporeal.</comment>
