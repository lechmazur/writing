<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The walker’s scar-backstory micro-beat (last time he “failed to preserve wisdom”) gives interior contradiction and a micro-choice to keep the echo peripheral. Yet he remains largely a solemn archetype—no status friction, no visible flaw that complicates the ritual; the consecration proceeds exactly as intended. The ending replaces the mask without testing that choice under fresh pressure, so the cost feels pre-paid rather than re-earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: repeated circling, haptic contact with the parapet, and layering of whispers build density until the “distortion in understanding” delivers the Conceptual Repricing. Orientation is anchored by ~120 words (moon-gaze porcelain, dunes, pavilion). Closure lands cleanly—the walker’s withdrawal charges the space with preserved silence—meeting the 9+ quick test, but the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt, holding it just below the top band.</comment>

<comment>The kinetic parapet is the star micro-setting: every footfall makes it grind and hum, anchoring the clearing’s boundary in physical causality. The pavilion’s architecture (leaning columns, sound-catching roof) is filtered through the walker’s sensorium and directly shapes how the clearing is found. The half-mask’s porcelain catching moonlight returns as the final image, recharging the earlier visual cue with newly earned silence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“preserve wisdom’s echo before it fades”—is signaled early. Escalation is textural: each pass around the perimeter tightens the whisperfield until the clearing materializes; the price is the walker’s self-exposure (mask off) and the perpetual burden of carrying silence to the mundane world. No reversal or loss of option occurs; the tension plateaus rather than spikes, keeping it in the solid 7-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme—truth survives only when guarded by deliberate, humble distance—emerges through the walker’s refusal to stare wisdom head-on. The final image of replaced mask crystallizes the idea that mediation (line-walking) is the cost of keeping insight alive. No explicit moralising; the echo is left vibrating under the dunes, inviting reader reflection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly lashed to the walker’s somatic register: “porcelain that reflected the moon’s indifferent gaze,” “stone grinding against stone synchronized with his heartbeat.” Syntax lengthens and compresses with ritual pace; diction (“conjured clearings,” “whisperfield calm”) invents a cultic register without tipping into purple. Zero head-hops; perceptual signature remains consistent and distinctive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Strong rhythmic control and varied sentence openings; information density high (“paradox of movement beneath stillness”). Occasional template cadence in the three-fold circling description and stacked adjectives (“murmuring pavilion,” “whisperfield calm”) slightly dull the peak beat; no loops or mixed metaphors that obscure causality, but the density flirtation keeps it shy of 9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The “preserve wisdom by not looking directly” premise offers fresh inversion of the classic seeker trope; the kinetic parapet as buried sound-temple is highly specific. Risky second-person abstract space (clearing as “distortion in understanding”) is earned by tactile build-up. While mystic-ritual tropes are familiar, their synthesis here feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
