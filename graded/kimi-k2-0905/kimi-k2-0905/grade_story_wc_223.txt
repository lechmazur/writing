<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory training as a fake-crier turned real archivist of tenderness is dramatized in embodied micro-moves (kneeling, knotting lace, heel-toe-heel). Her final refusal to flee with Kestrel but instead carry the board away crystallizes a hierarchy of values—memory over survival—whose cost is felt when the gallery seals behind them. Interiority stays concrete ("tasted like iron and lilac") and never resorts to therapy-speak. The one flaw: Kestrel’s shift from blank rifle to gentle muzzle-on-square relies more on symbolic staging than on prior seeds of his vulnerability; still, the moment lands because the blankness itself was pre-established.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the chessboard wrapped in Mara’s cloak becomes a portable archive whose gaps will be filled only by future living bodies—an undeniable conceptual cost. The accumulative/textural lens holds throughout: every walking sentence layers density until the gallery’s stone mouths echo back, re-weighting the stake from personal survival to civic memory. Causality remains intact; no teleporting props, no retroactive knowledge. Orientation is taught early ("the night the palace clocks stopped") and anchor waivers do not apply.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The whispering gallery is not a postcard; its acoustics literally guide choice—stone throats soften consonants, forcing Mara to keep walking sentences aloud. The missing-pawn chessboard functions as micro-setting that constrains the final decision: only hierarchies remain, so the archive must be the board itself. Light is used surgically ("lantern glow" vs "nomadic penumbra") rather than painted across every surface. Sensory hierarchy narrows to taste and sound under crisis, matching the POV’s危机-trained alertness.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve small gestures before the next king erases them—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightens when the gallery demands "Record us." The single meaningful deepening occurs when Kestrel kneels and asks for the maid’s name: the stake pivots from solitary archive to shared remembrance, costing Mara her invisibility. Agency remains hers; she chooses to walk the final overlapping sentence rather than escape. No coincidence resolves the tension; the dawn bird merely marks the deadline already internalized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without sermon: memory as insurgent act against erasure. The subtextual turn is that staged emotion (Mara’s old fake tears) becomes the training ground for authentic preservation; the lace noose on the white queen redefines "benevolently ruthless" as love that will hang before it lies. Final image reweights the premise: the board’s absent pawns are not lack but openness—only the living can complete the game. Resonance is particular, not abstract; no character utters a thesis sentence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-limited stays latched to Mara’s crisis-perceiver lens: sentences compress under threat ("stone mouths shaping vowels of air") and elongate during walking spells. Pattern of elision ("nomadic penumbra," "interim wolf") is taught by line 3 and paid off when the gallery repeats the phrase back. Syntax mirrors gait—heel-toe-pause-toe-heel fragments are legible as code. No head-hopping; Kestrel’s interiority is inferred only through Mara’s perception of his cracked voice, maintaining modesty.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often does three jobs—"She unbound the lace from her left boot, tied it around the white queen’s neck like a tiny noose, and set the piece on the farthest square" advances action, symbol, and stakes. Rhythm accelerates into the final overlapping footsteps, then releases with the quiet "did not look back." No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; figurative language is selective, never more than one image per high-pressure sentence. Copy clean: no tense drift, no pronoun ambiguity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The conceit—walking typography as insurgent archive—feels inevitable yet uncopied. Interregnum setting is familiar, but the chessboard missing only pawns re-codes hierarchy into portable absence, a fresh inflection. Risk of lyric ellipsis is embraced (stone mouths speak) yet closure remains legible. Transformation test passes: replace names and the walking-code/memory alliance collapses. No echo of famous scenes; the lace-noose queen is singular.</comment>
