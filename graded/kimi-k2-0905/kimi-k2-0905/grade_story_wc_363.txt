<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is rich, tactile, and consistently filtered through the spinner’s fingers, loom, and orchard memory; the choice to swallow the amber and surrender voice is a credible, embodied renunciation that costs her speech forever. Micro-choices—picking up the box, fitting pieces, crushing the bead—track a clear hierarchy of values: message over self. The only slight drag is that the “wistful” tag is more atmospheric than dramatized contradiction; still, stoic endurance is shown, not labeled, in the final silent weaving. Earned Stasis is fully achieved, and the muteness is an irreversible price that shapes the orchard’s rewound clock.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural lens is declared in the first sentence—“fingers remembered… while the shuttle clacked”—and held to the last silent pass of the shuttle; causality is lyrical, not linear, yet every image (thread, amber, puzzle, petal) accretes into the final Charged Poise. Orientation is immediate: who (loom spinner), where (forgotten orchard), when (tonight’s taut silence) within 50 words. Closure lands with undeniable conceptual cost: her name is gone, the orchard rewinds, and travelers hear laughter she can never utter—an Earned Stasis that reweights the entire tapestry of silence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The orchard is not backdrop but actuator: the cider-rot scent, moss-stitched branches, and bamboo-filtered dawn physically guide her discovery of the box and later catch the golden thread. Tools—wheel, shuttle, puzzle pieces—are handled with tactile specificity; the loom itself becomes portal-frame. Micro-setting (amber bead pressed to chest) charges the final image. Spatial choreography is pristine: foot strikes box, pieces spread on packed-earth, panel lifts, threads anchor to sky—no floating objects.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—carry a message across an impossible silence—is signaled in paragraph 3 and escalates as each puzzle piece narrows her options until only voice remains to trade. The tightening is textural: each fitted fragment dims the orchard further, a pattern break that reweights the cost of continuation. Agency is continuous: she fits, swallows, winds her own name into gold—no off-stage rescue. The final price—permanent muteness—is felt on-page when her lungs work “like bellows with no sound.”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the reciprocal metabolism of voice and silence: the orchard drinks her speech and grows younger, while she weaves unheard laughter into cider wind. No abstract thesis is stated; instead, the ant-wing memory inside the amber and the swallow-shaped hollow reprice communication itself—message can exist only when its sender is erased. Final image of golden sap beads awaiting the next sacrifice is a Conceptual Repricing that extends the bargain beyond her lifetime. Emotional aftereffect is concrete: reader left listening for a laughter that can never be spoken.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person intimate hovers at spinner’s shoulder, tactile and synesthetic: “thread… wanted to speak but had forgotten the shape of words.” Perceptual signature is consistent—rot smells, bamboo glows, puzzle edges prick—no head-hopping. Compression and elision (“seasons turned; the trees grew younger”) are taught early and pay off in the orchard’s reversed clock. Rhythm modulates: long breathless cadences for puzzle assembly, then short, almost breathless clauses at the swallowing—mirrors the choke of voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line-level craft is lyric-dense yet propulsive; no paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Metaphors are coherent within loom/orchard domain—no mixed vehicles. Minor slip: “stoically sparkling” appears twice in adjacent sentences, a bead of redundancy that briefly stalls the shuttle. Otherwise, every sentence advances image or pressure; information density is high, and the final petal scarred with runic seam lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fusion of jigsaw portal, loom cosmology, and voice-for-distance barter feels singular; trope roots (sacrificial messenger, enchanted object) are transformed through orchard-specific botanic logic and the spinner’s tactile craft. Risky choice to narrate muteness in lush lyric voice pays off: reader feels the absence of voice as palpable object. Synthesis is inevitable in hindsight—only a weaver could splice silence into yarn and trade breath for distance. Fresh inflection: orchard grows younger as price, converting biological time into messaging medium.</comment>
