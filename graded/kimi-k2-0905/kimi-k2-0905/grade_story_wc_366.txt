<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias’s reticence and ritualized micro-choices (adding the fourth stone, bottling the glass) embody a credible, long-creased interior contradiction—endurance as refusal to abandon. Embodied emotion is sharp: the “salt-ghost” he tastes, the green warmth traveling “to the bone.” The final row-back is Earned Stasis: he keeps the chain unbroken, pays with the ache of perpetual return. No therapy-speak, no label drift; every gesture is vocation-specific and costs him time/aloneness.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is Charged Poise: the bottled glass in his gloved palm reweights the whole eleven-year chain, making the tower’s darkness witnessed, not vanquished. Causal lens holds: because the lamp died, therefore he rows, therefore he answers with stone and bottle; no off-stage rescue. Anchor (who/where/when) settled within 40 words; no orientation debt. Cost is legible in the final line—heat against bone—without explanatory gloss.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Environment, body, and recurring objects (sea glass, stacked stones, iron ring, chalk sketch) constrain every move: the skiff’s ballast stone is literally stripped to craft the reply. Selective sensory hierarchy—wind through cracked panes, rust smear on robin-heart stone—mirrors Elias’s internal hush. Spatial choreography is immaculate; distances from cliff to catwalk to crate track across beats. The micro-setting of the lantern rail charges the final image when the glass leaves it.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keeping the chain unbroken—tightens when the lamp’s earlier-than-usual death signals possible keeper suicide. Escalation is situational: each stone added is a micro-renewal of vow under growing darkness. Agency is visible: he rows backward to keep tower in sight—cost paid in stamina and eternal return. Felt price is the “sharper ache” and the cold gust that smells of “wet iron and old hymns,” foreclosing the option of abandonment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from iterative mute ritual: memory as resistance to erasure. Subtext lives in stone syntax—no words, yet each cairn renegotiates solidarity. The bottle does not literalize safety; it crystallizes the impossibility of keeping it, a Conceptual Repricing. Final image invites counter-reading: is bottling witness an act of love or of self-imprisonment? Ambiguity lingers without moral tag.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is salt-cracked, tide-worn: “salt-ghost,” “luminescent ache,” “green warmth,” diction specific to a skipper who tastes storms. Rhythm modulates: long sentences for spiral climb, clipped fragments for stone clicks. No dialogue—therefore no voice drift—but interior diction stays within Elias’s plausible lexicon. Compression (“the tower breathe”) is taught early and paid off in final exhale.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops; each sentence adds new tactile or spatial datum. Figurative control: “lenses hung like frozen tears” is brief, accurate, internally consistent. No mixed metaphors or register drift. High information density—“three stacked stones, each smaller than the last, balanced so precariously they seemed to whisper”—packs scale, fragility, animism in one breath. Closure image (“green warmth travel through his glove to the bone”) is clean, uncluttered, resonant.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Familiar trope—lonely keeper and mute supplier—reframed through stones-as-Morse and bottling absence, a fresh inflection. Synthesis of sea-glass hue shift across visits turns souvenir into cumulative chronometer. Risk is quiet: no wreck, no ghost, only vow; coherence holds. Specificity of widow’s-cove granite and robin-heart scale anchors universals in irreplaceable objects.</comment>
