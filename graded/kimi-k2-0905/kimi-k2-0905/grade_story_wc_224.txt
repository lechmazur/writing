<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The seer’s renunciation of prophecy is embodied and charged—her cracked reflection falls as “silver rain,” a tactile cost. Interior contradiction is strong: she hungers for home yet fears chaining others. The micro-choice to crack her own mirrored skin rather than re-plant talents crystallizes values, but the townspeople stay abstract, blunting relational pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: because she buried talents—>bookstore traps them—>she must crack her own mirror to free them. The decisive change is on-stage: she speaks the unpronounceable word, the corridor straightens into her childhood road, mountain implodes; cost is the permanent loss of her scrying skin. One minor time-slip: “long ago” seeding is told more than shown, but it pays off in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The bookstore-mountain is not backdrop but actor: shelves slide, thunder hoarded between pages finally ruptures. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—she reads spines by crow-feel, not sight. Micro-setting wins: the storm-cloud-suede folio constrains her retrieval path; the lost language stone’s wheat-field smell re-creates home inside her body. Spatial choreography is seamless across nine spirals.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaim home without re-enslaving town—tightens when custodian demands she re-bury talents. Escalation is causal: each shelf-shift narrows her route; the quill of her own scales literalizes skin-for-stone trade-off. The visible price is her mercury-glass skin shattering—loss of future prophecy—paid on the page. One softening: custodian’s “reality by subtraction” remains abstract, never concretely alters terrain.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as communal not prophetic property. The final image—stone sinking to seed shared remembrance—reweights earlier guilt without moralizing. Motif of seeding (talents, stone, crow feather) accumulates new meaning: what was buried to hide can be planted to free. Subtext in custodian’s frost spectacles hints archives devour reality, but stays tantalizingly undeclared.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is irreducibly specific: “titles shift beneath like eels in a sack,” “smell of thunder that refused to break.” Perceptual signature sustains—POV filters every noun through mercury-glass bias. Rhythm modulates: long liquid sentences climb spirals; shortest shard “She cracked the reflection” delivers climax. Experimental compression (“storm-tasting”) is taught early and paid off when lightning finally breaks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density: one sentence can world-build, escalate, embody emotion—“Custodian lunged, but hidden thunder finally broke; lightning, long hoarded between pages, struck the shelves.” Metaphors are coherent: mercury-glass skin mirrors both prophecy and prison; no mixed vehicles. One paraphrase loop: “seed them anew / reburied her gifts” inside the same beat docks 0.2. Final line cadence resets, releasing tension cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms familiar “return for lost power” trope by making renunciation the victory condition. Bookstore that eats reality via re-shelving is a fresh antagonistic system. Risk-taking—unpronounceable word as both leave-taking and return—pays off conceptually and emotionally. Specificity: crow feather stolen from mother’s pyre could not be swapped with any totem; its whispering barbs are irreplicable.</comment>
