<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction is palpable: the embroiderer’s public performance of “senile” quaver versus the surgical precision of her mapping; her heartbeat sync choice is an embodied micro-decision that costs her calm. External behavior (humming murder-list lullaby) misaligns with internal calculus, satisfying the 9+ contradiction test. The final renunciation—returning to stitch new unnamed stars—pays the visible cost of perpetual vigilance, earned by the prior causality chain. No label-speak; every emotional beat is stitched, not stated.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the new-star embroidery reweights the entire night’s stakes, making survival feel unfinished rather than won. Causal lens holds throughout—every because/therefore linkage (scholars’ contempt → overheard intel → hidden layer ignition) tightens options until the pistol lowers. Cost is legible in the final image: she re-lights the candle, accepting eternal vigilance. No orientation debt; mirrors, thread, dome anchors are clear by line 40.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cobalt silk, mirrored alcove, and projector plate function as micro-setting that literally constrains the climax: the flame must ignite the hidden layer through the lens. Autumn wind and stained-glass rattle are filtered through the embroiderer’s textile bias—she hears glass as “thread fibres crackling.” Spatial choreography is flawless: corridor walk, council chamber, projector plate, dome ceiling—bodies track without drift. The setting evolves from observation dome to confession screen, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—republic survival—tightens once via the decisive hidden-layer ignition that converts map into live intel, foreclosing the coup path. Agency is hers: she chooses to read the “bedtime story,” forcing the confrontation. Cost is visible on-page: the pistol tremor and her acceptance of perpetual stitching show price. Under causal lens, escalation is singular but sufficient for 700-word scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the moral cost of listening: unheard stories become weapons, and wisdom must stay disguised to survive. The final image—unnamed stars—offers non-literal answer: knowledge remains unfinished and dangerous. Subtext lives in the reversed lullaby and the comet-vectors; no character sermonizes. Ambiguity lingers: republic saved yet permanently imperiled, embroidery now an endless duty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is textile-synesthetic: galaxies are “thread fibres,” wind is “rattle in stained-glass warp.” Syntax is lyrical but controlled, with purposeful compression (“cobalt observatory in autumn” becomes mantra). No head-hopping; single POV stays inside her sensory bias. Rhythm modulates—long sentences for spiral arms, staccato for bell toll—without template cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or causality. Information density is high: “playful comets that were, to any trained eye, precise vectors” does three jobs—character voice, foreshadowing, world rule. Metaphors stay coherent (mirror galaxies, cloth sky) without mixed vehicles. Final line cadence mirrors opening, creating ear-echo closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Fusion of textile craft and espionage is fresh; the embroidery-as-astronomy vector map feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risky structural choice—lyric accumulation rather than scene sequence—paid off via taught pattern and charged reprise. No close echoes of familiar coup plots; the lullaby-reversal weapon is specific to this voice. Conceptual integrity: commits fully to “adjacent possibilities” as both craft method and political lifeline.</comment>
