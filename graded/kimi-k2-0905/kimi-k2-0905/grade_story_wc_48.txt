<comment>Mara’s interiority is concrete—her counting heartbeats, tasting salt on lashes, feeling the pianist’s chord in her ribs. The contradictory pull between hoarding fragments and releasing them is dramatized in the moment she lifts the shell back to the mist. Micro-choice at climax—offering the shell—earns the internal shift with visible cost (Lira’s dissolve, heat under sternum). Flaw: “lucidly watchful” is asserted twice rather than shown through perceptual tics; still, the final stance is credibly earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each apparition layers density until the pattern breaks with the shell’s return. Closure is a Charged Poise—Mara’s empty pockets but “rustle of pages” inside—cost is felt (refused advance, dissolved characters). Causality intact: deleted sentences literally revive cut figures; no teleporting props. Orientation anchored by word 60 (“feral nexus where three tidal channels braid”), no penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Mist, salt, wet-paper taste braid into every beat; the spiral shell miniaturizes to lighthouse at end, charging final image. Environment guides choice—tide-wraiths wheel the pianist, fog funnels into shell—meets 9+ gate. Sensory triangulation (sound of unread proofs at dawn) stays POV-bound. No static cataloging; each detail does double duty (marginalia on lashes = unread novel).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—collect hopes before editor/landlord lock her out—signaled in paragraph 2. Escalation is textural: each collected fragment adds weight until the reversal—offering them back—reconfigures cost under Accumulative lens. Visible price: Lira’s dissolution, shell now “miniature lighthouse,” Mara’s empty pockets. No coincidence; pressure tightens through pattern of reclaimed deletions.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from action: unfinished hopes demand flesh; art is release, not hoard. Subtext in shell’s silence after transfer—absence becomes guide. No moralizing; final image of lighthouse reframes prior motif without statement. Resonant reconfiguration: “collecting hopes was… releasing them” arrives only after embodied sequence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature sustained: “mist tasted of salt and wet paper; it clung to her eyelashes like marginalia.” Syntax spirals like shell—long breathless clauses that tighten into “She typed: ‘The sea remembers…’” No head-hopping; single POV. Dialogue minimal, subtextual (“You left me mid-knock”). Internal lexicon owns metaphors (marginalia, tidal channels) without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence lengths swell/contract with tide. High density: “fog curled into quotation marks around her ankles” does three jobs. One paraphrase loop: “lucidly watchful” repeated; minor. No mixed metaphor; vehicles stay maritime/print. Clean grammar, tense stable. Final line cadence mirrors opening, completing arc.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Premise—abandoned novel-characters materialize for reclamation—is fresh, yet grounded in grief work. Risk of abstract nexus justified by sensory specificity and earned closure. Transformation test: story collapses without shell & cut-boy specifics. No derivative echo; avoids meta-writerly cliché by bodily cost.</comment>
