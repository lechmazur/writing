<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mira’s contradictory impulses—urge to purge foreign memories yet tenderness toward the chorus—play out in embodied drumming and wading choices. The final slowed lullaby-tempo is earned: every prior beat rehearsed the possibility of communal inhalation. Cost is visible: her chest clears only after she surrenders solo ownership of pulse. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into diagnostic speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each drumming sequence intensifies density of memory-jellyfish until the cadence shift at the lagoon reweights identity. Closure is Charged Poise—she claims a conductor’s stance whose cost is perpetual entanglement. Orientation is swift: resonant quartz bough locates reader by line 3. No causal breaks; even starlight “recognition” is pre-cued by altered electrolytes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sound wave garden and auric lagoon are not backdrop; their acoustic properties force her tactics—leaves cup into speakers, water parts only for altered blood. The mirrored surface that dissolves identity is the decisive tool charging the final image. Sensory economy is strict: every green speaker, seed-pod cymbal, and B-minor ripple either advances beat or reappears in closure glow.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can she recover sole ownership of her pulse?—tightens via drumming crescendi that literally loosen foreign veins. Escalation is density-driven: each new ghost note raises the cost of failure. Visible price: when last heartbeat exits, lagoon clears, leaving her smile framed by communal veil—loss of pure solitude is irreversible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of mutual habitation emerges from acoustic metaphor: every borrowed memory must be returned as harmony, not erasure. Final auroral veil is non-literal answer—shared dream becomes atmosphere, not moral. No abstract thesis stated; insight earned through tactile percussion and water. Complexity preserved: freedom now contains eternal chorus.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Lyric third-person hovers at Mira’s cochlea—diction (“tremolo of crickets,” “soap-bubble helmet”) is hers, not writerly garnish. Rhythmic propulsion imitates cardiac cadence; sentence length mirrors drum strikes. No head-hop; even underwater boy mimics her beat rather than granting interior access. Compression (“glissando of knuckles”) is taught early and paid off in slowed lull.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm alternates between staccato drum fragments and legato lagoon lines, sustaining momentum. Metaphors stay internally coherent—sound garden acoustics never contradict water-as-emulsion logic. No scaffold loops; each sentence adds new acoustic or bodily information. High density: “seedpods became hush-muted cymbals” does world, sensory, and metaphor work simultaneously.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Combines memory-graft SF with acoustic ecology in a synthesis that feels inevitable once begun. Risk of surreal overload is embraced yet controlled through strict drumming motif. Final communal inhale reconfigures familiar “finding oneself” arc into “losing oneself together” without cliché. Specificity of contrail spelling and upside-down tree planter anchors abstraction in memorable images.</comment>
