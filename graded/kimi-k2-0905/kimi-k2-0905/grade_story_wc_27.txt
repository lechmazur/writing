<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interiority is sensorially rich and tied to concrete action (bare soles tasting dust, sternum-hum). The “awkwardly confident” contradiction is shown only in the crane-balancing beat; earlier it is asserted. Motivation sharpens cleanly at the stone-pulse “Remember, Reclaim, Reignite,” propelling every subsequent choice. Earned cost is present—she leaves the planet without guarantee—but the decision’s emotional price is briefly summarized rather than embodied in a final beat.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of sound and light builds until the shuttle awakens. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—her departure reweights the rebellion’s lull as “gathered breath” and broadcasts the lullaby; cost is the planet left behind. Orientation is legible inside 120 words. Causality is lyric rather than tight: stone circle → hum → glasses → ignition sigal works as magical logic but is not foreshadowed as a rule; still, the pattern is taught and paid off.</comment>

<comment>Repair bay acts as textured crucible: cracked ferrocrete, ruptured fuel line, rusted sigil each enable her next move. The vintage opera glasses recur as micro-setting, constraining perception and finally focusing sunlight to spark ignition. Twin suns’ razor-margin light is tracked across every surface, tightening time. Spatial choreography is immaculate—crane jib, hatch, launch pad angles stay consistent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: reopen the sky for dreamers. Pressure tightens once when the stone’s hum offers a single path—climb, sing, ignite—foreclosing evasion. Cost is visible: she risks Militia fire by launching. Escalation is accumulative: song layers swallow wings, console lights, shuttle waking; each image raises the same stake rather than narrows options, but the final ignition is irreversible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: art and ancient memory can weaponize stagnation into launch velocity. Lullaby–stone–opera-glass triad reweights from nostalgia to ignition. Final image of song-trail instead of fire offers Conceptual Repricing of rebellion as non-violent awakening. No abstract moralizing; meaning is lodged in the shuttle’s singing ascent.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly glued to the stargazer’s perceptual register—sound before sight, soles before eyes. Syntax lengthens under awe, fragments under crane-balance stress. Diction (“paired coins,” “pepper-corns flung into blue soup”) is fresh yet consistent with her star-minded lens. No dialogue, so voice purity is unbroken.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Rhythm modulates with tension—long hypnotic sentences for hum-crescendo, staccato clauses for sparks. Metaphors are audacious yet coherent within the poetic register. One mixed image: “blue soup” momentarily clashes with cathedral tone but recovers. No scaffold loops; information density is high. All sentences advance image or action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: barefoot prophet, stone henge beneath tarmac, opera glasses as focusing lens. Rebellion lull re-imagined as gathered breath is non-obvious. Risk of lyrical overload is embraced and paid off by successful launch. Specificity of “warp lanes” and “warp sigil” grounds the fantastical in concrete tech residue. Transformation test fails—this could only happen here.</comment>
