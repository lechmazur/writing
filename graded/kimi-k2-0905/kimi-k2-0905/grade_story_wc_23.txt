<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The navigator’s contradictory desire to reclaim lost places while becoming the place others will navigate is dramatized through embodied micro-choices—soldering her hair, speaking names into bronze—each carrying visible cost. Interiority stays concrete, never diagnostic; “the censer foot rubbing into her thigh like a bruise shaped like home” fuses sensation and motive. Final surrender is credibly foreshadowed by the motif of weight fluctuation, so when seams loosen and mercury weeps the renunciation feels inevitable, not abstract.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the station’s idea lifts while she becomes the geography—cost is the crumbling censer foot and her dissolving stitched body. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of moon-phase weight, bronze dust, and backward-crawling dunes intensifies until the final image reweights the premise. One minor causality fuzz: how “memory” flows through hoses without diegetic setup is accepted under lyric pattern taught early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The signal station operates as micro-setting: dish azimuth, ruptured hoses, and oil-stained concrete constrain every action—she can’t leave because the hydraulics are dead. Moonlight’s millimeter tilt physically moves the dish, charging the final image. Bronze censer foot doubles as portable “home” terrain, its patina rubbing thigh-flesh anchoring body-as-place motif.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—reverse migration into lost geography—tightens when each call forces her to trade personal substrate (hair, voice, weight) for reclaimed town. Escalation is textured: moon waning → censer lighter → dunes reversing → her coat grows heavy, foreclosing retreat. Final price is her erasure as navigator, crystallized when bronze crumbles to dust she inhales.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from particulars: stitched body, weight-shifting bronze, and backward-crawling dunes render “geography of loss” without abstraction. Final image—she breathes green dust and becomes the country—offers resonant non-literal answer: solace is inhabiting the wound. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in starlit flowers that open only for future migrants.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is dense, rhythmic, and navigator-specific: compass hand, sextant eye, copper-wiring throat—perceptual signature never lapses into stock lyricism. Syntax swells then compresses under pressure, mirroring hydraulic death and moon-phase cadence. Non-standard grammar (“the idea of it—carrying her”) is pattern-taught and pays off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High figurative density risks purple overload, but each metaphor is purpose-driven: “moonlight…a fraction each night, the way sorrow shifts” reweights later dish tilt. No scaffold loops; sentences vary in length and opening. One mixed vehicle—“voice like rusted water”—reads intentionally, not slip.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Familiar grief-return trope is transformed through reverse migration physics: town un-submerges as dunes crawl backward. Bronze censer foot’s moon-phase weight fluctuation is fresh constraint not seen elsewhere. Risk—lyric dissolution of protagonist into geography—heightens meaning without gimmick, making the ending feel inevitable yet surprising.</comment>
