<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The gryphon’s loneliness-turned-cartography is embodied in every beat: the calcified crack, the refusal to let ghosts crowd her, the deliberate rotation of the sundial to engrave “Alone.” Interior contradiction is vivid (“brittle awakening” vs “resonant drum”), and the final choice costs her the chorus-of-ghosts comfort. The only drag is a touch of diagnostic self-labeling (“translate isolation into independence”) that momentarily abstracts the ache.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a crystalline Resonant Reconfiguration: the moment she aligns the gnomon to write “Alone,” she re-prices solitude from wound to tool. Causal linkage holds throughout—because she refuses the stone-circle symbiosis, she must invent solo cartography; therefore she etches her own shadow. Accumulatively, moonlight, tide-breath, and atomically reflective feathers thicken until the final image releases the cloud-page moon-letter. Cost is visible in the fissure that admits moonlight and in the disappointed fade of the ancient hum.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The tidal library is not backdrop but breathing antagonist: rising shelves dictate when she can move, cloud-pages offer writable territory only if she dares tear them. The brass sundial rotates under her talons, becoming stylus and clock, literally rewriting possibility. Sensory hierarchy is avian—wind feathered, salt tasted as archive, moonlight doubled in metallic plumage. One minor spatial drift: “between the horn of a crescent moon and the horizon’s ink” floats untethered to altitude, but the final shelf-landing re-anchors.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—singular survival vs self-erasure through ghost-merger—is signaled in line 3. Pressure tightens exactly once: the chorus offers communal eternity, she refuses, and the price is permanent solitude. No reversal is needed; the deepening is the widening crack that lets moonlight in, turning vulnerability into instrument. Cost is legible: she forfeits the hum’s companionship and embraces fatigue that forces her onto a cloud-shelf rather than the safe circle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: solitude is not a problem to solve but a medium to sculpt. The blank cloud-codex and torn moon-letter embody the idea that independence requires leaving writable evidence for future exiles. Subtext lives in gesture—rotating the sundial one deliberate notch is a quiet revolution. Final image reweights “Alone” from stigma to signature, achieving Conceptual Repricing without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person omniscient stays locked to gryphon sensorium: bronze feathers ring, wings fold like a scholar closing a book, talons gauge brass temperature. Syntax is airborne—long gliding clauses, sudden stoop into monosyllables (“Alone”). No head-hop; the library’s sentience is inferred through her skin. Compressed lyric elision (“atomically reflective”) is taught early and paid off in light-shard scattering.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Rhythm mirrors tide and wing-beat: cadence swells then subsides, paragraphs shorten as she climbs. Metaphors stay internally coherent—moonlight as ink, shadow as stylus—no mixed vehicles. One template run (“she… she… she…”) is brief enough to read as drumbeat rather than artifact. Information density is high: one sentence often layers world-rule, emotion, and motion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise fuses extinct guardian with sentient sky-library, then weaponizes quantum feather-reflection as writing technology. Risk is high—lyric world-building could collapse into whimsy—but specificity of salt-crystal indexes and moon-drawn page-turning anchors it. The refusal-of-ghosts twist upcycles familiar last-of-kind tragedy into self-authoring cartography. Without the gryphon’s atomically reflective trait, the final moon-letter is impossible; the innovation is inseparable from the emotional payload.</comment>
