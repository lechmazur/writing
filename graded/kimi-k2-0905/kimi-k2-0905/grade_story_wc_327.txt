<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The copper-veined storyteller’s interiority is vivid—her fear of silence over death drives every micro-choice. The calcification sequence embodies contradiction: life slows into fossil meter while language accelerates. Swallowing the diamond is a crystallized value hierarchy made flesh. Cost is literalized in petrification; the path is foreclosed with statuesque finality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each texture-sound layer densifies until the air feels pottery-rough. Closure is a Charged Poise—the statue palm releases a bird that never lands, reconfiguring listeners as new carriers. The persistent constraint is the diamond heart still beating inside stone, charging every future touch. Cost is the teller’s life paid to turn memory into migratory flock; the image lingers with undeniable conceptual weight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: the diamond’s cracked wing and bone-flute towers constrain every sonic tactic. The cupped-palm statue cheek becomes a tactile portal that future travelers must press, charging the final image. Weather and canyon acoustics evolve from wind-flutes to voice-choirs without exposition. Spatial choreography is flawless—echoes ricochet along exact spiral arteries, tightening the spiral of choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translate texture into sound before silence wins—tightens when each slowed heartbeat releases a clearer phoneme. The deepening is the deceleration itself, turning pulse into fossil meter that narrows options to one: accept petrification. Agency is renunciation; she endures the curse to keep the lexicon alive. Cost is visibly paid on the page: skin to ivory, veins to filament, breath to echo.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: continuity demands mortal conduit; memory needs a body to sacrifice. The heron wing inside the diamond reappears in the sky at dawn, reweighting the pattern as migratory grammar. Subtext whispers that every language is a cursed diamond someone must swallow. Final image—travelers carrying sand-dune consonants—offers no moral, only ongoing exchange.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is copper-veined: syntax glints like metal, rhythm pulses in filament cadences. Perceptual signature filters every noun through tactile texture—mud-slip, knapped-flint sorrow—never tourist catalog. Lyric compression teaches its pattern by line 3; closure repays with “sand-dune consonants.” No head-hopping; the spiral artery keeps us inside her skin until stone.</comment>

<comment>Read-aloud ear test passes: sentence lengths vary from moth-wing fragments to cathedral clauses. No loops or synonym churn; each metaphor is single-use yet cumulative—“copper-veined,” “filament throat”—building to the final projection. Information density high; one line fuses anatomy, light, and sound: “veins lit like a filament, projecting texture-sounds.” Only hairline slip: “pottery-rough air” approaches cliché, but saved by tactile immediacy.</comment>

<comment>Risk distinction earned: turning starling aerobatics into linguistic phonetics is non-obvious synthesis. The curse-as-translation-engine transforms trope into organic logic—silence is the true antagonist. Bone towers as flutes and future podcast hosts re-weights the dead-language trope into living infrastructure. Specificity of “heron-wing crack” and “mud-slip phoneme” makes the concept irreproducible elsewhere.</comment>
