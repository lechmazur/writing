<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Kael’s contradictory impulses—yearning for self-unity while weaponizing the tablet that spawns more selves—are dramatized in embodied beats (the temporal papercuts, the backward-running scream). The final smash is earned because every previous step widened the fracture between versions; the cost is the erasure of all but one unchosen moment. Minor: the “labyrinth of self” tag feels abstract once, but the image of seventeen arches each naming the same sin immediately re-embodies it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: by shattering the tablet Kael pays with every possible future self, leaving only the unspoken name—an undeniable existential cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout: each fragment of description (up-falling rain, neon algae, sideways rain) tightens the texture until the viaduct’s ordinary gravity feels like loss. The 3:19 A.M. Archive, the 7th/13th-minute cycle, and the procedural path-computation all pay off inside the final image of the single drop. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchors arrive by line 3 and the inverted night is taught as the first pattern.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The glowing viaduct, neon-algae bones, and gravity-reversed rain are not backdrop but tactical terrain: the upward rain cuts Kael’s coat into leaking yesterdays, the cobalt glow provides the only light by which to read the runes, and the final ordinary down-fall marks the price paid. The tablet itself becomes micro-setting when its crumbling edge slices Kael’s palm, forcing the decision to smash it. Spatial choreography is flawless across the seventeen shrinking arches. 9+ gate passed: the viaduct’s inverted gravity literally shapes the smash-or-don’t-smash choice at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—singular identity versus fracturing multiplicity—tightens with each procedural misstep that spawns another ghost-Kael. The meaningful turn arrives when the algorithm deliberately leads through the fracture instead of around it, forcing a trade-off: enter and be cut by frozen seconds, or stay and drown in ghost-echoes. Cost is visible on the page: yesterday leaks out of the papercuts and puddles at his feet, a literal loss of time. The smash is the only remaining agency; all other paths have walked themselves off the edge.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: identity is not found by collecting every possible self but by paying the price of erasure. The periodically eternal tablet’s final transformation—from all futures to fired-clay birds—reweights the premise: knowledge of every self is worthless once the minotaur of accumulated choice must be slain. The open doorway onto backward-ticking bedrooms offers resonant ambiguity: the boy may still become any Kael, but the reader feels the cost of that openness in the vanished viaduct light.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voltage-tight lyric third-person that owns impossible physics without exposition: “rainwater bead and fall upward” is stated as observed fact, not explained. Perceptual signature—clocks, peeling wallpaper, library-wind voice—filters every image through Kael’s inherited obsession with broken time. Rhythm accelerates into staccato fragments as arches shorten, then exhales into the single drop sentence, mirroring the collapse of possibility. No head-hopping; elder Kael’s whisper is heard as external sound, not interiority.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances or deepens. Figurative language is patterned and paid off: the inverted night dial returns in the ordinary drop that “touches the surface,” completing the metaphor circuit. Information density is high—e.g., “seventeen identical arches, each inscribed with a different name for the same sin” compresses theme, stake, and spatial cue in one line. No register drift; lexicon stays within the mythic register the piece teaches.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The splice of procedural-generation pathfinding with Theseus-minotaur myth feels inevitable yet unseen before; the 7th/13th-minute periodically eternal tablet is a fresh temporal rule that drives plot rather than ornaments it. Risk—smashing the McGuffin instead of mastering it—pays off by making the ultimate cost unknowable: every future self erased. Specificity anchors novelty: neon algae bred by inverted rain is not eco-flavor but the light source that lets Kael read his doom. Transformation test fails if swapped: only this gravity-defier could negotiate weight for an unspoken name.</comment>
