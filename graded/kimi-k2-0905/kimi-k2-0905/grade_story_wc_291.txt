<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Juniper’s face-blindness, methodical drive, and the micro-choice to cut her palm are tightly braided; the memory-revelation is earned via ribbon + blood, not declared. Interiority stays sensory: “hair drank the blood.” No diagnostic clichés. Cost is visible: plasma glues the ribbon to the page, foreclosing denial.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the portrait’s completion reweights the entire cold case and her self-blindness. Causal lens holds—each step because/therefore: ribbon → blood → memory → portrait → treaty handed to detective. Cost is legible: “blood-stiffened ribbon” and his tears. No orientation debt; quarry geography stays coherent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mist, shale, lamp-wick cough, and the ribbon-as-micro-setting constrain every move; the quarry’s “jagged throat” literally shapes the paper she works on. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—she’s tactile, not visual. Final image—portrait rolled, ribbon seam—recharges the mist-soaked page. No static catalog; weather affects wick, paper, and mood.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—awaken empathy to paint the erased—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when the ribbon drinks her blood, narrowing options to paint or remain blind. One meaningful deepening suffices; the portrait’s completion forecloses her former merciful amnesia. Cost is on-page: blood, tears, and the ribbon’s irreversible stiffening. Agency is hers alone.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from collision of opposites—memory/erasure, silk/hair, artist/face-blind—without sermon. Final image offers non-literal answer: a living portrait, not skull retrieval. Empathy is redefined as bearing witness rather than recognizing faces. No final-paragraph thesis; resonance is felt through detective’s tears and hallway aftermath.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lyric, compressed diction mirrors a methodical artist who thinks in texture, not faces: “lamp’s single eye,” “synthetic silk on one side, human hair woven on the other.” No head-hop; POV stays tightly interior. Sentence rhythm accelerates during blood-revelation, then quiets into dawn release. Register consistent; no academic drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density: “method required opposites to touch” carries plot, theme, and character rule in one line. Metaphors are precise—quarry “exhaled,” ribbon “serpentine curl”—and paid off. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or pressure. Final “red seam” line is propulsive, not decorative. Zero scaffold or template cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: face-blind portraitist + cold-case quarry + blood-activated ribbon yields a new empathy mechanics. The ribbon’s hair weave is a specific, non-obvious reveal that reconfigures all prior detail. Risk—using her own blood as paint—heightens stakes without gimmickry. Conceptual integrity holds; no late rule patches.</comment>
