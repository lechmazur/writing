<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lin’s interiority is concrete—her thumb on the leaf, the pulse-to-heat transfer—yet the “zen-minded” tag is never tested by contradiction; she glides from vision to act without visible internal drag. The clay hive choice is the single micro-choice that costs her nothing on the page, so the earned-stasis feels light. Still, her perceptual signature (kiln memory, soot maps) is specific and continuous, sustaining a magnetic, calm agency that just squeaks into the 9 corridor.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the unfired hive hardens without fire, reweighting the rule-set so memory itself becomes kiln. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of bee-wing thrum, wax ghosts, overlapping suns—culminating in a cadence shift where the oasis “exhales.” Cost is legible in the final image: Lin walks on, footprints erasing, carrying the lantern’s fractured light as a perpetual constraint. Causality is lyric rather than sequential, but pattern is taught early and paid off at the last beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The apricot tree’s cupped-leaf angle and the lantern-glass “continents that no longer existed” are irreplaceable micro-settings that constrain the final transfer of kindness. Spatial choreography is flawless: cracked hives → tree → clay hive → child’s jar, each object handled in tactile succession. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—honey-turned-ash taste, phototropic leaf warmth—never tourist catalog. Environment directly enables the closing covenant, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—why places resist change—arrives early and tightens through pattern intensification rather than causal reversals. The thrum’s deepening frequency acts as the cadence shift that reweights the stake: silence → vibration → single clear note. No visible price is extracted from Lin, but the conceptual cost is the oasis’s future vanishing again, foreclosed by the same mercy that revives it. Under Accumulative lens, this deepening is sufficient; the child’s arrival is complication, not resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the repeating image pair: unfired clay / unfired bees—memory as kiln, kindness as kiln. No character articulates the thesis; the final covenant is sealed by action (fruit dropped into jar) not exposition. Ambiguity is purposeful—timeline fractures remain plural yet resolve into one luminous strand—inviting counter-readings about cyclical loss. The emotional after-effect is sharp gentleness itself, tasted in the apricot, reweighting the reader’s own phototropic lean.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is lyric-omniscient yet filtered through Lin’s ceramic sensibility: “clay remembers,” “glazes in a slow kiln.” Syntax elongates then compresses to mimic kiln heat-cool cycles. Patterned elision (“fractured timelines flickered like torn silk”) is taught in the first third and paid off when lantern cracks overlap like glazes. No head-hopping; child’s POV is external, seen only through Lin’s projected light, preserving distance control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Metaphors are disciplined—no mixed vehicles, no register drift. Rhythm breathes with the thrum: long anaphoric clauses build heat, then single-note sentences cool. Information density is high—“smoke that had not yet flattened” does triple time-work, mood-work, and causality-flag. Only hairline slip: “phototropic to kindness” is abstract label amid otherwise embodied diction, keeping it shy of 9+ perfection.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>The synthesis—potter + beekeeping + unfired kiln + timeline fracture—feels inevitable yet unseen before. Risk is maximal: lyric non-linear structure, unfired clay hardening without fire, kindness as photosynthetic force. All risks serve the central theme; no gimmickry. The fresh inflection is the reversal of kiln logic: mercy, not heat, vitrifies memory. Transformation test fails—story collapses if ceramic rule is removed—confirming originality.</comment>
