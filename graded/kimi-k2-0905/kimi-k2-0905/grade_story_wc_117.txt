<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is lyrical but thin on contradictory impulse; her only micro-choice is to press the curl to steady the whistle, a beat that is embodied and stakes-bearing. The “softly adaptive” trait is asserted more than dramatized—no moment shows her adjusting tactics under failure. Yet the memory-anchored gesture and the felt cost of fading wonder keep her above stock; she earns a quiet endurance that forecloses retreat, satisfying Earned Stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each sensory layer thickens until the eclipse pattern breaks into visible magic. Orientation is swift (who/where/when by line 3) and causality is elastic by design—moon–sun braid functions as cadence shift, not plot twist. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: children’s fingertips spout color, a social cost that re-weights screen-dulled reality. The only slack is the off-stage diffusion of magic—no beat shows Elara’s melody failing—so the price is felt but not tautly dramatized in her body.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sage Ridge is rendered with chiaroscuro specificity—silver sage, warmed slab, ant-frozen trails—each detail filtering through Elara’s tuner-ear. The ridge itself breathes with her, a micro-setting that literally supplies the Listening Stone as instrument and conduit; removing it collapses the ritual. Eclipse mechanics are compressed yet accurate, and the children’s valley is sketched only where it refracts back up the slope. One hairline slip: “dreaming roots” stays poetic but never constrains tactics, so capped at 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—reignite wonder—tightens through sensory accretion, not reversal. The whistle’s near-falter under totality supplies the one visible cost (steady breath spent), but the escalation is atmospheric rather than tactical; options narrow only in the sense that magic becomes briefly visible. Because coincidence (eclipse) is the engine, agency is thin, yet the lens legitimizes situational pressure. Enough for high-band, but lacks a persistent constraint that would push 8.5+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the inverse of extraction: wonder is not given but leaked, a silk scarf left fluttering in the child’s perceptual periphery. The baby curl motif moves from personal anchor to communal antenna, re-pricing innocence as transferable energy. No moral is stated; the final laughter is an oblique answer to glazed-screen malaise. Ambiguity is purposeful—some children may shrug the pebble off—keeping the thought alive after the page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s synesthetic ear, diction tilted toward musical intervals and vegetal savor. Rhythm swells then exhales in sync with eclipse cadence, sentence length contracting at totality. No head-hop; valley children remain opaque mirrors, correctly so. Filter verbs are sparse and voice-motivated (“she felt the ridge inhale”) rather than explanatory, sustaining immediacy.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense yet aerated: “a question mark of newborn light” compresses three metaphor layers without choking clarity. One paraphrase loop—“the note was neither major nor minor, simply the interval between heartbeats”—repeats concept already implied, but it occurs mid-ascension, not at closure, so −0.3 only. Read-aloud ear is strong; commas breathe like rests in scored silence. No artifact touches the exit image, keeping 9 band in reach.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fusion of music therapy with eclipse ecology feels non-obvious and internally coherent; the whistle as non-tune linker reframes “adaptive” as ecological rather than humanist. Baby-curl relic evolves from clichéd keepsake to transducer of first-astonishment, a fresh inflection. Risk lies in the lyric accumulative mode itself—could have collapsed into tableau—but the pattern is taught early and closure pays off. Not quite a 9.0 because the children’s POV remains a distant chorus, reducing idiosyncratic vantage.</comment>
