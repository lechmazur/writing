<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is lyrically specific—“mask dangling like a penitent’s stone,” “constellation of welts along her ribs”—and her micro-choice to dissolve the manuscript rather than smuggle it is a credible, costly renunciation. The absence of any second on-page character keeps relationship pressure off the page, and the final disappearance is asserted rather than embodied, so the arc crests at strong, not exceptional.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural lens is declared early (“cartography of scars is never finished”) and held: each image—timer tick, print emerging, timetable dissolving—deepens the dominant stake of archival survival. Closure is a Charged Poise: the unfinished timer tick and empty petri dish reconfigure meaning with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation anchors who/where/when within 50 words; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory is more than postcard: the dome’s iron breathes, the cloud deck becomes a “darkroom developing horizons,” and the wet print on the windowsill is a micro-setting that constrains the final action. Weather actively steers metaphoric and literal choices; spatial choreography is clean from catwalk to darkroom. One hairline slip: “rain upward in reversed waterfalls” momentarily violates physics without signalling altered reality.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—her verses must escape erasure—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightens through each tactile step of dissolution; the final rarefaction into “clear liquid” is a visible price that forecloses earthly dissemination. Agency remains hers throughout; coincidence complicates (lightning overexposes one print) but does not resolve. Only one tightening beat meets the 600-word density, keeping it shy of 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete paradox of erasure-as-transmission: what is dissolved still orbits. The silent stanza, the star-shaped stain, and the timer frozen at 00:01 collectively reprime the question of archival persistence without moralizing. The scar-as-map image accrues three distinct inflections (ribs, sky, skin) and lands as a conceptual reweighting—an earned, non-literally stated answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is unmistakable: “clouds that boiled below the dome like a secret ocean,” “stormlight could reach it.” Syntax lengthens and compresses with emotional temperature; fragmentary elision (“a vigil in pause, furiously tranquil”) is pattern-taught in paragraph 6 and paid off in the final hush. Zero head-hopping; register stays within a poet’s lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Metaphor density is high but purposeful—each vehicle extends the photo-chemical lexicon (“silver halide and starlight,” “negative space between stars”). No synonym loops or template cadence; clauses are varied, propulsive. One near-mixed metaphor—“timer’s bell rang, thin and polite”—is minor enough to leave the 9-band in sight.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The fusion of darkroom chemistry with political erasure feels inevitable yet unexampled; the bus-timetable cipher and the lightning-overexposure accident are risk-taking devices that sharpen rather than clutter the concept. Specificity of the observatory’s mount iron breathing, the faint star-shaped stain, and the unfinished timer tick make the closure image unforgettable. No derivative premise drag; the synthesis is singular.</comment>
