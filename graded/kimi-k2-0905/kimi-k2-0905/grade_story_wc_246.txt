<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira’s contradictory drives—certitude vs. epistemic humility—are dramatized in every beat: she touches the viewport, uncaps the dry pen, rewrites her own error. The “confidently uncertain” trait is not labeled but performed: her hand steadies because doubt is operational. Micro-choices (naming filaments, easing curvature) visibly change her relational state with the cosmos and with her own past. The ending lands in Earned Stasis: she accepts perpetual rewriting as job description, feet warming in reconfigured gravity—cost felt, path foreclosed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each image (garden, seeds, filaments, static fertilizer) layers density until the cadence shift at “warmth rising through the soles of her boots” reweights stakes. Closure is a Charged Poise: Mira suspends in gravity-stutter, editing loop now infinite, comfort strange and paid for. Cause-and-effect is deliberately elliptical—effect-before-cause is the anomaly’s rule—but the pattern is taught early and honored throughout. Cost is unmistakable: station power dims, gravity slackens, tomorrow’s child now laughs with her rather than at her.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is compressed into micro-anchors—viewport, console, quantum scroll—yet each constrains action: viewport transmits anomaly tug, scroll rewrites live, pen etches absence. Gravitational anomaly is not backdrop but active antagonist that slackens gravity and steals power, forcing Mira’s float and final warm-soled landing. Spatial choreography is pristine: hand on viewport → pocket → console → float → boots feel warmth. Sensory hierarchy obeys crisis: recycled air, silver flare, bone-tug, pen vibration—never tourist catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can she thresh meaning without destroying herself—tightens when anomaly flares silver and pen reservoir of “contingency” empties further. One decisive deepening: she rewrites her own prior error, foreclosing the option to blame external static; consequence is station brownout and bodily float. Agency is renunciatory: she accepts responsibility for pre-threshed experience, edits curvature rather than erasing act. Cost is on-page: power borrowed, gravity altered, child’s laughter re-tethered from mockery to communion.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from iterative gardening metaphor: editing is pruning that lets the whole tree bear different fruit. No abstract statement—wisdom is earned through filament-naming, static-as-fertilizer, and the final lullaby apology. Subtext in the pen: empty reservoir yet glowing scratch = meaning flows through absence. Final image reweights premise: uncertainty is the truest coordinate, not a flaw to fix but a habitat to inhabit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is irreducibly Mira’s: meteoric iridium, “poetic glyphs,” “contingency as ink” — lexicon filtered through celestial interpreter training. Rhythm compresses under pressure—clause-stacking lines mimic gravitational shear, then breathe at “warmth rising through the soles of her boots.” Perceptual signature stable: she notices gravitational tug in bones, hears pulsar beats inside child-laughter, sees spider-silk filaments. No head-hop; free indirect style stays anchored to her emotional charge.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is near-flawless: information-dense lines (“effect arrived before cause, meaning experience itself arrived pre-threshed”) do triple duty (world rule + emotional state + stakes). Metaphors are coherent—garden, tree, filament, lullaby—no mixed vehicles. Rhythm modulates: long hypnotic sentences mirror anomaly drag, then short landing clause “She landed softly.” Minor scaffold: two “she felt” filters, but both serve gravitational embodiment. Closure sentence is clean, tactile, image-driven.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: celestial signal gardening + gravitational copy-editing + pen that writes with contingency instead of ink. Premise is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight: if spacetime can bend, so can narrative causality. Risk taken—lyric accumulation over causal sequence—pays off in final bodily warmth that rewrites prior cold vacuum. No pop-culture echoes; “unbending events through contingent filaments” feels singular to this story’s physics and heart.</comment>
