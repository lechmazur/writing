<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Jin’s obsession with “the color of sound” is concrete and embodied; every underwater beat filters perception through that synesthetic lens. The renunciation—sealing the safe and surfacing—costs him the archive yet completes his spectrum, a credible Earned Stasis. Interiority stays particular, never sliding into label-speak. The woman vanishes too quickly to exert crucible pressure, so relationship dynamics remain off-stage, capping the score.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Jin surfaces transformed, the pier lamps now burning in chromatic song—felt cost is the archive left behind. Causal chain holds: key → safe → cylinder → chromatic epiphany → renunciation. Orientation is anchored within 120 words; no lens ambiguity. One minor elasticity: the captain’s final sentence functions as retroactive instruction, but it is seeded by the woman’s whisper, keeping causality intact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Harbor, drowned deck, and plankton cloud are tactile and filtered through Jin’s synesthetic bias; every environmental detail refracts back to “color of sound.” The skeleton key against throat, the air-pocket breaths, and the tilting bookshelves constrain physical choices. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room syndrome. The sky-lantern reflections and underwater strobes integrate into the final image, charging the reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—map the invisible spectrum—tightens when the phonograph cylinder makes the spectrum visible yet demands abandonment of the archive. Agency is present: Jin chooses to seal the safe and rise, paying the price of permanent loss. Pressure escalates under causal lens: each underwater beat narrows air, light, and archival access. Cost is legible, but a second tightening beat would have pushed the score higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: human utterance is light seeking witness. The lily’s vermilion sigh, the plankton color-orgy, and the final polychrome lamps build the idea without abstract sermon. Subtext resides in gesture—sealing the safe is silent consent to let vows stay luminous in darkness. Final image reweights the premise: Jin becomes the living lamp that sings color home, a non-literal answer that resists moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Jin’s synesthetic perception; diction (“copper echo,” “velvet hush,” “star-smoke”) is consistent and character-bound. Rhythm modulates: longer cadences on surface, clipped fragments underwater. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens under pressure. The lyric register never drifts into POV-violating exposition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and stress; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Figurative language is dense yet purposeful—each metaphor serves the chromatic obsession. One mixed vehicle: “click that tasted of green” risks synesthetic overload, but it aligns with established synesthesia. No scaffolding or paraphrase loops; information density remains high throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The sunken-library-as-phonograph-archive is a fresh synthesis; the color-of-sound synesthesia reframes familiar maritime ghost-trove tropes. Risk: lyric compression could have collapsed into purple abstraction, yet specificity of key, lily, and plankton keeps it grounded. The final reversal—sound paints the listener—feels inevitable in hindsight. Minor point off for echo of “lanterns hiding behind truth” trope; still, the angle is non-obvious.</comment>
