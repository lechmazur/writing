<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The oracle’s interiority is richly embodied—“rootlet pierce her diaphragm,” “stone rose into her throat”—and her micro-choices (sketching leaves, kneeling to smudge) externalize the internal stake. Contradictory impulses (protect the valley vs. evacuate truth) coexist in scene, and the final renunciation costs her 4.7 g of sorrow, earned by prior causality. No relationship crucible is on-page, and the swallowed seed’s weight is accepted rather than battled, capping at 8.7.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the evacuated stone reweights the world—aurora dims, wind forgets—with undeniable conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of “heavier” pulses, leaf sketches warping, smudges erasing until the blank page receives the cooling planet. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“mountain weather station”), causality intact. One minor loop: “tasting of auroral light just before it breaks” echoes later “auroral sorrow,” but the reprise is purposeful, not scaffold.</comment>

<comment>The station’s tools—barograph hairline, anemometer cups clacking like rosary—constrain her tactics: she reads margins others discard. Body-as-setting functions when cold “occupies margins between organs,” guiding her final stance. The blanked illustration charging the final image satisfies the 9+ gate. Only the torn silhouette remains, making the setting irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“truth shaped like a seed” must be weighed before it sprouts—tightens when rootlet pierces diaphragm, forcing evacuation. Agency is renunciation: she smears every external leaf so the internal stone can surface, paying 4.7 g cost on-page. Escalation is density/cadence shift under Accumulative lens: each sketch warps heavier until the scale balances. No live antagonist, but pressure coherent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inverse of prophecy: truth gains mass when forgotten, innocence is temporary fever. Final image—blank silhouette in rain gauge—offers non-literal answer: erasure is the only forecast. No moral stated; “valley temporarily innocent” is recorded datum, not sermon. Ambiguity lingers: next storm will bury the stone, fever will return.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is oracle-specific: synesthetic tasting of chlorophyll sorrow, barograph’s “shy mercury,” radio static “murmuring names of the soon-to-die.” Rhythm modulates with pressure: long lyric sentences contract to “She opened her mouth; the stone rolled out, steaming.” No dialogue, so no convergence risk. Pattern of “heavier” taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “Wind rattled the anemometer cups; they clacked like rosary beads counting down to revelation.” No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. One mixed metaphor—“green ropes dragging violet scars”—reads as auroral synesthesia, not muddle. Final third clean, allowing 9+ proximity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise flips oracle trope: prophecy is not spoken but swallowed, weighed, and evacuated. Transformation test fails if seed/scale swapped—specificity of 4.7 g and blank laurel silhouette is inseparable. Risk taken: lyric accumulative structure with no external antagonist, yet closure legible. Fresh inflection: “truth evacuated” as meteorological entry.</comment>
