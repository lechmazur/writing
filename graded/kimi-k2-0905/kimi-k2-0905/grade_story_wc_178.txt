<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Naram-bel’s interior contradiction—faith in number vs. fear of empirical irony—drives every beat; the final vow of silence costs him bodily presence, foreclosing return. Micro-choices (trading barley, pressing tile to copper) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible price. The sister memory is the only emotional vent; still, it lands as lived, not label. No second character on page, so status bullets waived; single-POV depth sustains pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the astronomer’s self-erasure reweights the palace itself into a silent oracle—conceptual cost legible in “dust that refused to settle.” Causal lens holds: each schematic stroke tightens access to the sanctum; the tile’s final diagonal triggers the irreversible vow. Orientation anchored by word 80; no ambiguity. Persistent constraint—the chamber must stay secret—shapes the final image and tactics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cedar doors, cracked lapis lions, and the copper-sighing door are tactile, POV-filtered, and constrain movement. The hollow cube of air functions as micro-setting that literally voids choice once entered. Starlight through clerestory and hovering lattice of light charge the final image without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve old sky-knowledge from erasure—signaled in paragraph 1. Pressure tightens once: the lattice reveals the sanctum door, forcing the vow of silence; no option to retreat remains. Cost is the astronomer’s corporeal life; felt in “tears salted his lips.” Under causal lens, escalation is single but sufficient for 700-word scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—mathematical devotion as political resistance—emerges through action, not statement; the tile’s reappearance as prophecy reweights earlier marginal notes. Final image of unsettled dust offers a non-literal answer: knowledge survives as haunting question, not possession. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers. Thematic echo in “encrypted devotion” is dramatized, not asserted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person POV stays tight to Naram-bel’s perceptual signature—numbers lift, palace breathes equations—without head-hop. Syntax grows clipped under peak pressure (“Stone sighed; mechanisms older than language slid apart”). Diction remains within astronomer’s lexicon; no register drift. No dialogue; voice coherence judged on narrative texture alone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Figurative language is selective—dust like pale constellations—and never muddies causality. Information density high: one line often advances atmosphere and motive simultaneously. Zero paraphrase loops or synonym churn; no artifacts touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fusion of magic-square lore with interregnum politics feels inevitable yet fresh; no trope checklist. The palace-as-observatory bone-memory is a specific synthesis that would collapse if names or place were swapped. Risk in lyric escalation pays off: pure number unbars a holy door—empirical irony turned sacrament. Final image of unsettled dust reconfigures reader’s prior assumptions without gimmick.</comment>
