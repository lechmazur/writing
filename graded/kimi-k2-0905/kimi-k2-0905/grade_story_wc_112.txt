<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The mechanic’s interiority is textured—prosthetic lungs, twilight walks, the tactile pulse of the cobalt sphere—and her contradictory wish to undo the very bargain that keeps her alive complicates every beat. Micro-choices (centering the lever instead of yanking it, recording nothing) reveal a hierarchy where survival is traded for agency. The refusal to file a report is a credible, on-page renunciation that costs her certainty and keeps the chrysalis image alive. What keeps this from 8.8+ is that the younger-self hesitation is observed rather than re-lived; we’re told the ripple reaches her muscles but we don’t feel the tug in her body at that instant.</question>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: by leaving the lever centered she forecloses retroactive escape and accepts perpetual twilight, a felt cost registered in the “slightly offset” footstep. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than strictly because/therefore; the nexus–moth-bat interference pattern is the tightening that reweights choice. Orientation is secured early: station above violet cloud-sea, axial spine, aviary module. The only drag is the leap from “pattern recognition” to “sideways exit”; the holographic mechanics are asserted rather than demonstrated in a beat we can track.</question>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The magnetic nexus functions as micro-setting: it constrains every move—she must touch it, match its pulse, decide around it—and the final image of sphere-against-ghost charges the closing beat. Violet cloud-sea, half-light corridors, titanium aviary ribs are sensuously evoked yet filtered through her technician’s selective attention. Spatial choreography is clean: palm to sphere, lever recess, moth-bats lifting in slow motion. One minor slip: “icy warmth” is used twice in close succession; the reprise feels accidental rather than re-weighted.</question>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove sideways time vs. keep biological lungs—does tighten when the 3:5 interference pattern offers a live chance to rewrite her own consent. Escalation is accumulative: ghost corridors bloom, futures fan, cost becomes visible. Agency is present yet gentle; she steps back into twilight rather than forcing the fold, a credible technician’s caution. The price (perpetual mechanical breath) is felt, but because the alternate futures are glimpsed in telescopic summary rather than dramatized beats, the tightening lacks a visceral pinch point.</question>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the equation between mechanical survival and unfinished becoming; the station-as-chrysalis image is particular, not asserted. The final image—offset footstep—answers the thematic question without moralizing: sideways time is lived, not proven. Subtext in the moth-bat hum and the lattice of frost is evocative, though “subdued awakenings” drifts toward diagnostic label-speak. Insight is earned through sensory confrontation rather than exposition, giving the piece a haunting after-effect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric-technical, compressed yet breathable: “patient spider,” “mechanically warm heartbeat,” “icy warmth” create a repeating cadence that teaches the reader to tolerate oxymoron. Syntax modulates with pressure—short clauses during the tilt, longer liquid sentences while she watches futures unfurl. Perceptual signature is sharp: she notices magnetic flux before emotion, names alloys before colors. No dialogue means no voice convergence risk; internal lexicon stays within her plausible engineering diction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but never stalls: every sentence layers image, physiology, and concept (“glass pinions,” “holographic principles,” “paper fan” decades). Mixed-metaphor risk is carefully managed—vehicles stay within techno-organic register. One filter-verb cluster (“she felt,” “she realized,” “she understood”) arrives mid-climax; it slightly dulls immediacy but is compressed into three lines, not a stack. Final line cadence—cutting on “or” without completing the conditional—is a risky fragment that lands as Charged Poise, justifying its break.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sideways time as lived routine rather than physics proof is a fresh inflection; the choice to renounce data-logging in favor of nightly offset steps converts abstract concept into bodily ritual. Moth-bat 3:5 interference pattern repurposes xenobiology data as personal fate ratio, a synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk—elliptical closure on an unfinished conditional—pays off by keeping the chrysalis open. Minor deduction for near-echo of familiar “station-as-character” trope, but technician-specific details re-animate it.</comment>
