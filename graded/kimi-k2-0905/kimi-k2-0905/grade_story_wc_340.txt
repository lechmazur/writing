<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira’s contradictory impulses—servile compliance vs. insurgent curiosity—are dramatized in every micro-choice (polishing goggles, tracing cipher, trading thimble for ash). The goggles warm against her cheeks, a visceral emblem of embodied emotion that never drifts into label-speak. Her final refusal to ascend again is earned by the prior beat of planting the seed; the cost is visible in her staying below, roots and branches.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each floor adds density (cipher pages, coal ash, apricot seed) that reweights the central stake from “Why did he jump?” to “How do I smuggle joy outward?” Closure—Lira remains below, watering the future—lands as Charged Poise; the cost is the forfeiture of her old vertical identity. The orientation anchor (elevator, tenth floor) is clear by line 10; no penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The icebound spire is no postcard: frost-lensed heartbeat, broken glass dome, furnace lungs—each detail alters access or temperature and guides Lira’s choices. The brass elevator cage, brass table, and iron hothouse bars form a metallic triad that constrains movement and seeds the final image. Micro-setting triumph: the goggles’ left lens literally refracts the cipher that sets the plot in motion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—deliver or bury the captain’s joy—tightens at every floor: the cipher, the musical staff, the map, the seed. Each acquisition (ash, lantern, trowel) narrows options and carries visible price. The final renunciation of ascent is agency-driven; the cost is her exile from the vertical servant life. No coincidence resolves anything.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme—joy smuggled into sorrow’s fortress—emerges through the apricot tree blooming in defiance of winter, never sermonized. The laughing-mouth water stain repurposed as musical staff is the emblem that reweights grief into generative possibility. Final image of scattered light dancing like children crystallizes the Conceptual Repricing: delight now lives where only ice reigned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Lira’s perceptual signature: “inconvenient curiosity,” “affectionately detached,” “stored the sound like a bulb in her chest.” Syntax bends to her rising wonder—clause-length swells then fragments as elevator lamps flicker. No head-hop; diction never exceeds a parlour-maid’s plausible lexicon yet achieves lyric lift.</answer>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with the elevator’s motion: long ascent sentences compress into staccato discoveries (“UNFOLD—repeating like breath”). No loops or scaffold; every sentence carries dual weight (e.g., “snow…settled on the captain’s encrypted diary like a soft apology” advances both atmosphere and plot). Figurative language is patterned early (frost-lensed heartbeat) and paid off in the seed’s optimistic punctuation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fatal airship-captain wager re-imagined as vertical seed-smuggling fable; the apricot tree in a sub-basement hothouse is a bold, non-obvious image that feels inevitable after the map. The goggles-cipher-musical-staff chain is a fresh epistemological scavenger hunt never seen before. Risk—lyric accumulation instead of causal reversals—heightens coherence and produces a singular artistic stance.</comment>
