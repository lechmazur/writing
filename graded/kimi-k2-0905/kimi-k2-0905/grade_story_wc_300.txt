<comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her throat aches, the crown bites, she becomes porous—yielding a palpable before/after. Contradictory impulses (fear of living rooms vs hunger for connection) coexist in-scene and culminate in the crown-choice that roots her to stone. The confession “I inspect tombs because I am afraid...” crystallizes motive and flaw in one stroke, paying visible cost. Micro-choices (pressing pearl to wall, kneeling, speaking aloud) escalate under rising pressure, earning the final renunciation of her old vocation.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each mineral-lit confession layers density until the mirror reconfigures meaning. The crown-acceptance is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where options narrow to eternal witness; cost is the irreversible dissolution of her body into crystal. Orientation is anchored by word 78 (“descended alone...”) and the disorientation of the nautilus spiral is later paid off by the spiral of etched dates. No causality break; pearl’s flight and mirror opacity are legible magic-logic taught by prior calcite bloom.</comment>

<comment>Setting is not backdrop but antagonist: the cave breathes, bleeds, grows skin; calcite tears fracture her headlamp into “rainbows trapped in mid-sob.” Micro-setting—the pearl, chair, crown—directly constrain choice and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean: spiral narrows, chamber widens, mirror surface tracks her disappearance. Salt-iron air and mineral ear are selective, POV-filtered, and evolve as she grafts into them.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—dissolve walls between hearts—tightens when each confession filament stitches her to the dead, foreclosing escape. Pressure escalates by accumulation: every etched line calcifies into the cave’s skin, increasing claustrophobic intimacy until crown-placement crystallizes stance. Agency is renunciation/acceptance with on-page cost: she forfeits corporeal life for eternal witness. No coincidence; escalation is driven by her successive offerings to the stone.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from specific pattern: abandoned hopes → calcified light → returned song, culminating in the conceptual repricing that the earth’s forgotten grief can still reflect back a face. No moralizing; the final image of woman-with-crown-in-glass reweights the premise without exposition. Subtext in gesture (kneeling, crown bite) and silence (collective ache flows membrane-thin). Insight—loneliness is a geological layer—arises from concrete particulars, not assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric-accumulative with taught compression: “crystal caves forgotten by every map,” “frozen chords,” “mineral ear.” Perceptual signature—inspector who quantifies tombs yet yearns for unmeasurable connection—colors every image. Rhythm modulates: long breathless clauses descend, then fragment into chimes. No head-hop; unreliability (dream-Morse) is paid off by mother’s mirrored mouth. Diction stays within Mara’s plausible lexicon while reaching for mythic register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences do triple duty: “The cave accepted the words, repeating them back as a choir of faint chimes” advances action, deepens atmosphere, and sonic-cements POV. Zero paraphrase loops; each metaphor extends prior vehicle (throat-cave, shell-spiral, membrane-wall). High information density without padding—e.g., “abandoned hopes calcified into the cave’s growing skin” compresses geologic time and human loss. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with escalation; no artifact touches closure mirror.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: post-apocalypse inspector + geological intimacy + confessional geode converts standard bunker trope into mythic anatomy. Risk of lyrical overload is embraced and paid off by crown-root graft that literalizes “earth changing.” Transformation test fails if Mara is not a bunker inspector—her vocational gaze shapes how she reads the calcite inscriptions. Specificity of “cultivated pearl the size of a child’s tooth” grounds surreal frame. Final inversion—tombs inspected become womb she eternally tends—feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
