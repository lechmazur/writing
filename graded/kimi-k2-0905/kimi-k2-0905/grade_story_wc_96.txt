<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lark’s contradictory drives—self-erasure vs. word-creation—are dramatized in the physical molt and the decision to burn the husk; the final “Co-conspirator of light” identity is earned by prior micro-choices and shared risk with Marin. Interiority stays concrete (“new skin still trembles, half-formed”). Status shift from vagrant to lantern-bearer carries visible cost (ashes on library card). Voice convergence under stress is minimal; each character’s idiom remains distinct.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the spiral reading nest and paper cranes reconfigure the library’s fate and Lark’s identity under a shared, felt cost (ashes, blank card). Causal chain holds: molt → burn husk → rebuild shelves → dupe Rourke → grant secured. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 5 and never drift. One meaningful tightening—Rourke’s entrance—narrows options and is resolved through plausible institutional leverage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The rusted library’s iron dust, warped stacks, and potbellied stove constrain every tactical move (shelter, fire, hiding place). The spiral reading nest built from warped shelves becomes the final image, charging closure. Sensory selection stays filtered through Lark’s poet-eye (“pages scatter like startled doves”). Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions during shelf-dragging or stove-feeding.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“save the library from bulldozers”—is signaled early and tightened when Rourke appears. Protagonist agency drives each turn: burning past selves for legitimacy, rebuilding shelves as cover, leveraging audit optics. Cost is visible on-page: ashes on library card, blank name waiting. One micro-turn suffices at this length; no reliance on coincidence to resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: beauty as collaborative insurgency forged from discarded selves. Subtext lives in gesture—feeding folded verdicts into fire, inked breathing instructions on cranes—never sermonized. Final image of “paper wings” reweights earlier “blooming resistance” joke into earned social cost. No thematic echo sentence; complexity (entropy vs. renewal) lingers without tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyric compression is taught in the opening moon/iron dust couplet and sustained without opacity. Syntax mirrors molt-ache—“words arrive jagged”—then steadies as alliance solidifies. Dialogue carries subtext (“Then you’re tasting the bones, not the marrow”) and advances plot. No head-hopping; perceptual signature stays locked to Lark’s poet-sensorium.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rhythm modulates from long breathy sentences to clipped beats under Rourke’s threat. Figurative language is selective, never piled in high-pressure beats; mixed-metaphor guard is clean. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Information density remains high—each sentence advances character, image, or tactic—while retaining read-aloud musicality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Monthly personality molt as literal shedding into a coffee-tin archive is a fresh, non-obvious metaphor for rehabilitation and resistance. The spiral reading nest built from condemned shelves synthesizes beauty/anarchy without gimmickry. Risky choices—green flame, paper-crane intake forms—pay off narratively and thematically. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped; the concept is inseparable from this carceral desert library.</comment>
