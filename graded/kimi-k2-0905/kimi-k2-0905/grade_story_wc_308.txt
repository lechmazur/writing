<comment>Cael’s interiority is lyrically specific—he “lets the patterns in a flock of birds…teach him what maps could not”—and his final stillness is seeded by childhood memory of water ripples, earning the renunciation. The arrowhead merge is the only overt micro-choice on-page; earlier beats are observational, so the arc leans accumulative rather than decision-heavy. Contradictory impulses appear more in imagery than in immediate action, slightly thinning the “under pressure” demand. Still, the closure’s cost (he becomes the echo, anchored forever) is scaled to lyric length and feels inevitable.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each metaphoric layer (bone dust, bird vortex, arrowhead pulse) deepens density until the final cadence shift—Cael’s rooted feet—crystallizes the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise: “he had become the echo…” reconfigures meaning with undeniable cost, no off-stage sleight. Orientation is taught immediately—canyon lip, bone towers, dusk timing—so the waiver applies. One minor loop: “weathered resolve of his weathered face” is self-paraphrase, but it does not touch the closure beat.</comment>

<comment>Setting is not backdrop but instrument: the bone towers vibrate as tuning forks, forcing Cael’s song to modulate—this directly shapes tactics. The canyon’s echo throat narrows perceptual field to sound and bone, mirroring his inward spiral. Micro-setting (arrowhead against sternum) charges the final image. Centuries of dust act as temporal depth that constrains the present moment, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—find the wandering pulse by learning stillness—tightens once: the towers’ hum escalates from ambience to mortal resonance that fuses arrowhead to bone. Cost is felt: “his teeth ache,” “pulse…anchored in endless time.” Agency is renunciation rather than act; under Accumulative lens the deepening suffices. No visible external loss (tool, money) but the forfeiture of forward motion is irreversible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Theme emerges from refrains: echo, spiral, dust, heartbeat—each re-weighted in the final image where Cael *is* the echo. No thesis is stated; the conceptual repricing is the arrowhead becoming internal compass. Ambiguity lingers: is stillness freedom or cage? The reader is left to sound the canyon. Early “maps could not” line quietly sets the question; final “traveling by staying” answers through image, not moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Cael’s perceptual filter: “surfaces etched…whispered when the wind struck them just so”—aural, precise, non-generic. Syntax lengthens and compresses with breath of song, mirroring harmonic rise. No head-hop; diction remains within a mythic register the POV owns. Dialogue absent by design; voice coherence survives.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Rhythm is deliberate incantation; intentional repetition (“pulse left wandering,” “wandering pulse”) accumulates rather than loops—pattern taught and paid off. One visible scaffold: “weathered resolve of his weathered face” could compress to “weathered resolve,” but it is isolated. Metaphors stay consistent—bone as tuning fork, birds as living arrow—no mixed vehicles. Closure image is uncluttered, allowing the bone-dust song to ring.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: stone-skimming harmonics transposed onto bone towers turns a childhood game into cosmological instrument. Stillness-as-navigation is non-obvious reversal of quest trope. Risk—lyric overload—heightens stakes without breaking causality because the piece commits fully to accumulative texture. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable yet unforeseen, the hallmark of transformed trope.</comment>
