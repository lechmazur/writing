<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The philosopher’s renunciation of the gear is credibly foreshadowed by her incremental unravelings; the distributed-self idea gives her a sharp, speculative interiority. Micro-choices (pressing gear to ear, syncing breath with jaguar, final kiss) are concrete and character-specific. Flaw: the “to rediscover” refrain edges toward thesis-statement, blunting full 9-band entry.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the gear’s surrender reweights identity and charges the final copper-tree image with conceptual cost. Causal chain: each translocation scrapes a layer → gear as last flake → refusal to reclaim it → becomes next banyan; the lens holds. Orientation is taught immediately by the canopy awakening. No ambiguity or teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Mechanical rainforest is evoked through selective, pressure-driven detail: quartz roots underfoot, mercury brook reflecting splintered selves, binary banyan steam—each constrains movement or perception. Body-as-setting (pocketed gear warm as sparrow) charges the final renunciation. Spatial choreography survives the spiral-kapok ascent without drift. One minor weather cliché (“silver gear” moon) does not scar closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: retain cohesive self versus surrender to distributed wonder—signaled in line 3. Escalation: each translocation peels identity → gear shrinks → jaguar demands payment → surrender of last flake tightens options under causal lens. Price is visible: she forfeits autobiography and literally roots into data-loam. Slight abstraction of “probable miracles” keeps this just under 9.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from pattern, not assertion: gear-as-self → gear-as-offering → forest-as-philosopher-chorus. Final copper-tree whisper “To rediscover, first unravel” reweights earlier equations without moralizing. Subtext in jaguar’s gearbox swallowing the gear carries conceptual cost. One softening “You are not lost; you are distributed” is earned by prior images, not intrusive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Prose rhythm mimics tuning-fork hum: polymetric cadences (“banyan 3/4, teak 5/8, balsa 7/8”) taught early and paid off in children’s song. Diction stays within philosopher-poet lexicon; no corporate register drift. Perceptual signature is consistent: moon = silver gear, parrots = gear-toothed. No head-hop; compression in mercury-brook strophe is purposeful and legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Information-dense yet musical; most lines perform at least two jobs (e.g., “humid dawn” imprints both time and texture). Figurative runs are patterned, not cluttered; vehicles stay coherent (gear = sparrow = flake). One scaffold loop—“the sound of wind through different trees” repeated four times—dulls micro-momentum; still short of artifact penalty because it teaches chorus-effect. Final image avoids mixed metaphor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Fuses cyber-samsara with Orphic dismemberment in a way that feels inevitable, not gimmicky. Distributed-self trope is refreshed via gear calculus and polymetric forest engine. Risky second-person imperative at close (“Go ahead—close your eyes”) is earned by prior recursive invitations and heightens reader translocation. Specificity of “copper canopy” and “data-loam” anchors abstraction in sensory novelty.</comment>
