<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mirela’s contradictory impulses—guilt-driven hiding vs. song-preserving hope—are alive in every attic beat; the meteorite seeding andInkspot’s micro-sheet flights are micro-choices that cost her ease and safety. The earned vanishing beneath the floorboard lullaby stave pays off her arc with visible forfeiture. Interiority stays concrete: “tasting iron” embodies fear, dust-mote notation externalizes memory. No diagnostic label-speak; voice and action stay fused.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each night’s dust-mote ballet layers density until the attic becomes a score, culminating in Charged Poise—the constables find only the pulsing meteorite chip rectangle. Orientation is anchored by word 40; transitions are clean mosaic shards. Closure reweights the premise: the song’s survival is now airborne, undeniable, with Mirela’s erased body the cost. Persistent constraint: pigeon loft built from rejected libretti shapes every subsequent flight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Camphor-yellowed sonatas, rafter beam narrowness, and dust mica arpeggios are selective sensory strikes that guide balance choices. The skylight rectangle reappears in final image as the charged stave holder—environment directly shapes closure. Spatial choreography never drifts; bodies, books, and birds track cleanly. No surplus inventory; every attic scrap is a rest awaiting transcription.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—evade capture while rescuing erased music—tightens when constables close in; every dawn flight forfeits rest and increases exposure. One meaningful deepening: Mr. Blackwood’s recognition of his wife’s lost tune converts attic archiving from solitary penance to shared sanctuary, foreclosing surrender. Cost is visible: Mirela’s identity is literally back-dated to a meteorite, her civil self annihilated. Coincidence (owner’s memory) complicates rather than rescues.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges without assertion: cultural memory migrates or dies; songs survive only when carried by living vectors (birds, children). Final image of rope-jumping kids humming an unknowable lullaby reweights prior attic labor—beauty now belongs to the city, not the archivist. No moralizing; resonance is purely imagistic. Subtext in silence: the unsung name “Mirela Skylight” is the real epitaph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric accretes a perceptual signature: musical metaphors for dust, astronomical diction for feelings (“oil-drop eyes that reflected the attic’s blooming withering light”). Syntax flexes with rooftop memory leaps vs. attic stillness. No head-hop; Mr. Blackwood’s interior is inferred solely through Mirela’s perception. Compression is taught early—“dust motes rose and fell in slow arpeggios”—and paid off in final chord rectangle.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Varied sentence openings avoid algorithmic drum; high information density—“sun slicing in, then fading, like hope on a timer” does three jobs. Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated diction (“gum arabic”) is POV-justified by bookshop attic. Momentum breathes with attic nights montage without stalling.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: courier-pigeon smuggler turned lullaby archivist; meteorite as mnemonic seed; deportation tags as musical rests. Risky lyric mosaic sustains coherence under accumulative lens. Children’s rope-hum as epilogue transforms prior stakes—fresh yet inevitable. No derivative templates; Romanian specificity plus airborne notation feels singular.</comment>
