<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s contradictory impulses—archival duty vs. green-tinged mercy—are dramatized in the bow-tremble and ankle-roots; the final renunciation costs her the instrument and the empire’s summer, earned by prior telepathic coercion. Interiority is lush yet character-specific, avoiding label-speak. The “mulberry ache” embodies the stakes without abstraction. One hairline slip: the custodian’s ink-pupil trait is never leveraged again, a micro-drop in motive density.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the violin’s dissolution reweights the world’s climate and Lira’s identity; cost is legible in the puddle that “reflected neither palace nor emperor, only Lira’s tired eyes.” Accumulative lens holds: each lyrical fragment adds density until the frost-seed cadence ruptures the dome. Pattern taught early (velvet/bruised purple) and paid off. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3. One persistent constraint—the cereus roots—shapes the final tactic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The velvet observatory’s bruised dome, ice violin, and moonlit dais constrain every choice; the cereus literally roots Lira to the decision. Sensory hierarchy obeys her botanist-telepathy: scent of lilac, green gossip, frost-seeds. Spatial choreography is immaculate—no drift from dais to dome to puddle. Setting charges the final image: the collapsed violin becomes a mirror of starlight and regret.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—dream vs. empire—tightens when the coffee-stain prophecy shows her face superimposed on the palace. One meaningful deepening: the cereus command “propagate” shifts from abstract urge to frost-seed barrage, foreclosing summer. Cost is visible in out-of-season orchards. Agency drives every beat; no coincidence resolves. Slight reserve: escalation is lyric rather than causal, fitting accumulative lens but limiting top-band entry.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme—art as climatic retribution—emerges through the ice violin’s journey from imperial trophy to eco-lullaby. The perforated destiny motif evolves from forged signatures to frost-seared banners, reweighted by the final puddle that erases emperor and palace. No moralizing; the silence after the last note invites counter-readings. Emotional aftereffect: reader feels winter creep across their own skin.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person lyric POV remains stable, filtered through Lira’s plant-telepathic perception: “green gossip,” “mulberry ache,” “frost-seeds.” Syntax mirrors tension—long breathless clauses building to the cracked dome, then short fragments as ice collapses. No head-hopping; custodian stays external. Diction stays within botanist-archivist lexicon; no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is deliberate: cadence swells like the adagio, then fractures. Metaphors are coherent—velvet dome, bruised purple, frost-seeds—no mixed vehicles. Information density high; each sentence advances stakes or atmosphere. One micro-loop: “propagate” thrice in two lines, but pattern-teaches urgency. No scaffold, no filter stacks. Closure line is clean, crystalline.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Synthesis of climate-fantasy, provenance thriller, and botanical telepathy feels inevitable yet unseen. Ice violin as colonial relic turned eco-weapon transforms trope into moral reckoning. Risky lyric structure pays off in cracked dome and silent orchards. Specificity—coffee-stain cartography, cereus root tourniquet—anchors freshness. No derivative echo; the afterimage is singular.</comment>
