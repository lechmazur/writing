<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses—certifying structural safety while secretly entombing private griefs—are dramatized in every mortar scrape; the stoically sensitive trait costs her bodily heat and civic trust, earning the renunciation of ever sending the letters. Micro-choice hierarchy is vivid: ink before paper, confession before comfort, archive before air. The closure palm-press against “I am here to mourn” crystallizes Earned Stasis with visible heat transfer. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived; interiority remains concrete, never diagnostic.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each sealed fissure deepens the pattern of hollow-as-archive until the keystone void becomes Conceptual Repricing—absence itself is repurposed as reliquary. Orientation anchored by line 9; no debt. Closure beat is the palm-press: charge transfers from body to stone, cost is irreversible ink loss + permanent archival stance. Persistent constraint—the drawbridge stays up—shapes her exit without backward glance, satisfying 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Granite coping, rusted chandelier chains, and the inkwell itself act as micro-settings that constrain entry/exit and furnish hiding cavities. Lagoon’s skin mirrors moonlight in shifting tessellations, charging the final image where separation=foundation. Spatial choreography tracks ladder, nave, altar, void without drift. Porous stone ink-stain serves as environment-body-tool fusion that reweights the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Dominant stake: can the pavilion’s absences be converted into an archive before engineers decide its fate? Escalation occurs via each mortared note—every sealed crack narrows her future options (no retrieval, no confession to living lovers). Final tightening: the keystone void forces direct inscription, foreclosing anonymity. Cost is legible: ink depleted, body chilled, civic role compromised.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Theme—“absence is a habitable structure”—emerges from the iterative burial of unsent letters inside structural wounds; no explicit thesis stated. Subtext of civic betrayal (using survey credentials for private archive) complicates moral reading. Final image of future scholars coring the stone reconfigures meaning: private grief becomes public artifact. Resonance lingers without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Third-person lyric compresses without head-hopping; diction (“slick granite coping,” “bittersweet lozenge”) remains within Mara’s professional-sensory lexicon. Rhythm accelerates during mortar insertion, breathes during ink drop, mirroring pulse of clandestine act. Perceptual signature—sound of gull inside chest—distinctive and consistent. No dialogue, so voice evaluation confined to narrative texture, which is controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Only two paraphrase loops (“descended…descent”) and one register drift (“conceptual repricing”-level abstraction in “interlaced absence”) but neither touches closure. Metaphors stay coherent: lozenge, suture, eye, tessellations all serve archive/body fusion. High info density—“boots kissing wet marble” does triple sensory work. Final line cadence recharges “hushed blaze” without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</question><comment>Premise—using structural survey as covert grief-archive—is non-obvious synthesis of engineering + elegy. Risk of lyric overkill is avoided by tactile mortar mechanics. Transformation test fails if pavilion/inkwell removed. Specificity of “hydraulic lime” and “lake-grass smell” anchors freshness. Bold use of void as both threat and reliquary feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
