<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is relentlessly concrete—her palms “open as though waiting for sound to settle,” her lips pressed to the rosette—so her decision to offer her own voice as “sacrifice” is embodied, not declared. The contradiction between wanting to restore harmony and needing to erase herself to do it plays out in real time; the rosette’s diminishing reflection of her scale makes the cost audible. Her flaw—believing she must nullify herself to heal the city—drives the climactic renunciation and forecloses any future song from her, a loss the ending braids into the town’s new quiet. The only minor drag is the abstract phrase “expectantly resigned,” which momentarily coats her in thesis-speak until the gesture work reclaims specificity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story teaches its Accumulative/Textural lens immediately—books “loosen spines,” scents layer, syllables rise—so each addition of sensory density is causal under that rule-set. Orientation is secured by word 30 (“autumn,” “library,” “Mara”), and the closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the rosette’s planned disintegration reweights the entire premise, making silence a civic resource rather than mere absence. The single causal micro-turn—her scale stripped to pure interval—pivots stakes from “find the missing tone” to “become the absent tone,” a tightening that costs her voice forever. No teleporting props or retro-patches; every fragrance and moth-wing syllable is seeded and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The velvet library is not backdrop but instrument: drapes absorb footfalls, mahogany scars drink lamplight, moonlight through stained glass becomes the resonance chamber that最终决定 the rosette’s fate. Micro-setting migrates into the rosette itself—its wooden lattice functions as portable acoustic wall—so environment literally travels with her down the nave. Spatial choreography is immaculate; we track her slow aisle walk, the kneel, the ear-to-wood contact without a single lost prop. Because the rosette constrains the final action (its crumbles dictate silence’s dispersion), the setting charges the closure image under the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Dominant stake—can hatred be unlearned before first frost?—is signaled in the second sentence and tightens when the rosette’s rejection of vibrato forces her to subtract herself. That single deepening is sufficient for 700-word scope: options narrow from “find root tone” to “become root tone,” with visible price (her singing voice). The escalation is purely Accumulative: each scent, syllable, and diminished reflection layers density until the library’s exhale becomes civic inhalation. No coincidence; the city’s heartbeat slows because she pays the acoustic cost on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the acoustic mathematics of absence: harmony achieved not by adding voices but by carving silence into which others can breathe. The rosette’s dust-circle reprises the opening “empty circle,” reweighting silence from lack to foundation without a single preached line. Subtext operates in gesture—her palms open, books closing “like birds”—so the political question (how to live after riots) is answered somatically. Final image of children humming “the same quiet scale” offers resonant non-literal moral: enemy is a note that no longer fits the chord.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric remains locked to Mara’s perceptual signature—she hears frequencies anger forgets, smells saffron in banned lullabies—so every metaphor is filtered through her acoustic exile. Syntax lengthens and shortens like breath: long anaphoric clauses build choral density, then fragment when vibrato is stripped. No head-hopping; even the city’s heartbeat is heard through her ear pressed to wood. The diction stays within her musical lexicon (“minor third,” “pure interval”) without ever sounding like glossary.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Sentences do triple duty: “the empty circle immediately drank the lamplight” reveals setting, object stakes, and metaphor in twelve words. No scaffold; each paragraph cuts cleanly—remove any one and you lose scent, syllable, or sawdust. Figurative language is patterned and paid off: velvet inside-out returns as “velvet air grew heavier,” preventing metaphor sprawl. Rhythm modulates from legato opening clauses to staccato final fragments, propelling the acoustic diminuendo. Zero loops, zero register drift, zero simultaneity errors.</comment>

<question>8</question><question>9.4</grade><comment>The inversion of choral art—harmony via subtraction—feels inevitable yet non-obvious, transforming a familiar redemption arc into an acoustic negative. Specificity of the mulberry-wood rosette, saffron scent, and half-step scale anchors the concept so it could not transplant to another setting. Risk-taking structure (no antagonist, no dialogue, quiet ending) heightens rather than softens stakes because the text teaches its own accumulative logic. Final image of untouched dust-circle literalizes “traveled stillness” as civic relic, a fresh emblem for pacifist fable.</comment>
