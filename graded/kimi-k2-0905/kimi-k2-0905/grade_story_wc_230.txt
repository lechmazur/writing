<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Protagonist’s contradictory impulses—rationales war against raw empathy—play out in live, embodied beats (“I will occlude you” vs. kneeling to drink the luminous mud). Interiority stays concrete, avoids label-speak, and forces a costly micro-choice at the orchard floor that forecloses muting the communal echo. The final stance—carry rather than erase—pays off prior causality with visible cost: the glass eye fuses to his scar, tethering him. Only minor passivity in the mid-section while the storm “does” things keeps this from 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the drink reconfigures the premise—silence rejected, communal echo willingly borne—priced by the burning eye lodged in his socket. Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, cadence deepens via recurrent “occlude / carry” polarity until the final image inverts it. Orientation is clean (who, where, when anchored by rope-ladder descent within 60 words). The textbook-spore mechanics are taught early and paid off when the spoonful is scattered then re-ingested, satisfying causality without late-rule swaps.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The ravine orchard is not backdrop; dangling roots literally threaten nooses, storm-green sky echoes the eye’s iris, and the luminous film wraps ankles to force the decisive drink—environment physically coerces choice, satisfying 9+ gate. Sensory economy favors smell (truffle spores) and tactile rain over visual catalog. Spatial track stays clean: rope ladder → oldest tree → ridge exit, no impossible moves. Micro-setting of the antique eye as implanted lens charges the final image, reweighting prior motifs.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Dominant stake—quiet the communal heart-echo vs. bear it—signals early and tightens when the brew hisses with “every apology I had swallowed,” forcing a visible-cost choice. Agency sits with protagonist: he scrapes, mixes, loses, then voluntarily drinks the mud, renouncing silence. Escalation is single-crystal: the film climbs ankles → reveals every bruising memory → offers refusal or consent; no coincidence resolves. Cost is legible—eye burns socket, orchard stills, pulse becomes “unshared, yet unafraid”—but escalation is more atmospheric than tactical, just shy of 9.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from inversion of safety: muting others’ pain is unsafe; bearing it together is fertile. No explicit thesis; the truffle-orchard-tempest matrix supplies concrete particulars that generalize to collective grief. Subtext resides in gesture—kneeling to scoop luminous mud equals consent to communal witness. Final image of “distance between solitude and safety” reweights earlier “psychological safety” jargon into lived paradox, achieving CR with conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person voice carries a precise perceptual signature: truffle as “spongy flesh,” storms “tasted of other people’s regrets,” textbook “smelled of mildewed hope.” Syntax compresses under pressure—“film rose…like curious children”—then widens for ridge reflection, showing rhythmic control. No head-hopping; POV distance stable. Diction stays within plausible post-virus forager lexicon; no register drift. Experimental elision (floating eye, voice from storm) is pattern-taught by orchard surrealism and paid off by implant, keeping closure legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally: long sensorial sentences alternate with fragment commands (“Don’t.”). Figurative density is high but patterned—storm-green, noose-roots, luminous children—each reappears to charge closure, avoiding decorative overload. No paraphrase loops; every sentence advances image or choice. Minor simultaneity slip in “film crept…wrapped…revealing” stacked in one line costs −0.1, preventing 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: post-empathy virus, truffle spores as memory-silencers, and glass-eye relic congeal into one coherent metaphorics of shared grief. Risky lyric escalation—floating eye implant—pays off by crystallizing “bearing together” rather than erasing, achieving conceptual repricing without gimmickry. Specificity (storm-taste, mildewed textbook smell) detaches premise from generic dystopia. Transformation test fails if swapped: truffles + eye + orchard are inseparable from arc. No close literary echoes; concept commits fully.</comment>
