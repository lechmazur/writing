<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The knight’s interior contradiction—shame-armored yet yearning to atone—drives every micro-choice; the surrender of his body to star-wood is credibly foreshadowed by his choreography of self-erasure. The final wooden stance is an earned renunciation: he pays with eternal suspension and the loss of all futures he can no longer choose. The only slip is a shade of therapeutic self-label (“withdrawn”) that leaks through the otherwise embodied voice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the knight’s human shell walks away while the wooden guardian remains, a visible cost that reweights the premise—freedom is another’s puppetry. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each surreal image (upside-down sap, clockwork seeds) layers density until the final exchange crystallizes meaning. Causality is lyric rather than linear, but the pattern is taught early and never breaks. The cost is legible in the last heartbeat of the latch-click and the sealed greenhouse door.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The greenhouse is not backdrop but crucible: its gravity-reversed sap literally pulls the knight upward into his wooden transformation. Every sensory detail is filtered through his guilt—silver sap tastes of regret, apples dim like embers of shame—so the setting constrains and enables the final swap. Spatial choreography is flawless: we track his gauntlet on glass, the torn program impaled, the exact width of the miniature stage. The setting’s rules stay consistent: mercury sky pours inward yet never fills, sustaining the impossible pressure needed for the exchange.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—capture the shape of possibility—tightens when the knight realizes he must surrender agency itself. One meaningful deepening occurs: the discovery that the puppet will wear his doubts while he becomes the unchoosing hinge. The price is visceral: flesh becomes star-wood, veins become moon-thread, and every unchosen future coils inside his hollow chest. Escalation is accumulative: each surreal fruit and ticking seed adds weight until renunciation is the only remaining option.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: freedom is inseparable from abandonment, and possibility is a continuous fold that requires a sacrificial crease. The final wooden knight dangling in silence is the non-literal answer—no moral is stated, yet the image reconfigures every prior surreal detail into a single, haunting equation. Subtext lives in gesture: the act of unsnapping the clasp is both liberation and life-sentence. The jester-king’s laughter beyond mercury skies is the ironic counter-melody, confirming that release merely relocates the prison.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The voice is a sustained incantation: syntax elongates and contracts like breathing velvet, mirroring the knight’s hypnotic surrender. Perceptual signature is precise—he feels “gravitational tenderness” and hears silver sap “taste of regret and cinnamon,” a synesthesia that is character-bound, not ornamental. No head-hopping; the camera never leaves the knight’s sensorium. The elevated diction is earned by the fairy-tale register and never drifts into academic intrusion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: every sentence does two jobs—image plus emotional reweighting. Metaphors are coherent within the alchemical logic; no mixed vehicles violate the world’s physics. Rhythm modulates from long liquid clauses to staccato “step, pause, pirouette,” matching the choreography. Only a single paraphrase loop—“shivering bliss” repeated near opening and close—dulls the ear by a hair, preventing 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The soul-transfer via marionette swap is freshly angled: the knight does not gain power but becomes the static hinge of all unrealized futures. Risk—lyric Surrealist logic that could collapse into gimmick—is fully integrated: every upside-down apple and ticking seed is necessary to justify the final crease. Specificity is irreplaceable: star-wood, moon-thread, and mercury sky form a lexicon that would break if genericized. The concept feels inevitable in hindsight, yet nothing in the field resembles this exact constellation.</comment>
