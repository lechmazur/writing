<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The philosopher’s interior contradiction—mourning labor no poem will praise while insisting mending is conversation—remains embodied every beat; her spiral footwork externalizes it, and the final choice to store the whisk at her pulse shows earned renunciation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (moon paths, firefly blink, parapet heat) tightens the pattern until the whisk’s inscription reweights the premise; the final spiral of water droplets crystallizes Charged Poise with undeniable conceptual cost—she will keep walking what cannot be seen.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Harbor lanterns, cooling stones, and salt film after rain are filtered through her net-mender gaze; the parapet’s retained heat and moon-silvered puddles constrain her barefoot path and later echo in the whisk-carved spiral, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Pressure escalates by density and synchronized rhythm: fireflies entrain to her breath, oarsman shifts course to her whistle; the tightening is one accumulating cadence rather than causal reversals, but the felt cost—she surrenders the visible world to trust invisible pattern—is legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: invisible labor as constellation-maker; the closing image of nets storing firefly light reframes every prior knot as star-map; no moral is asserted, yet the reader re-sees all mending as quiet navigation.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is unwavering: “dark commas on the marble,” “timid stars,” syntax mimics tide-length rhythm; elisions like “she followed that rhythm” are taught early and paid off when she actually traces the unseen spiral; no filter verbs dilute immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm modulates from long tide-swell sentences to the staccato “droplets flew outward in a spiral”; zero paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors; each sentence does dual work—e.g., “stones still held the day’s heat beneath their chill” anchors time, body, and forthcoming spiral.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fusion of net-mender philosophy with lyric accumulative structure is non-obvious; firefly blink as Morse for hidden pattern feels inevitable only after the final droplet spiral; risk of quiet spiral climax paid by charged image.</comment>
