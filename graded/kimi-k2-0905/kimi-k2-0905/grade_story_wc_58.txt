<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority is lush and metaphor-drunk, but every beat remains anchored to the concrete weft-thread micro-gesture; the final self-recognition (“she’d been her own first client”) is earned because the mirrored image was seeded in the first paragraph and paid for with seven years of accumulated absence. Emotional contradiction glows in the same sentence—ink-stained fingers trembling while she “crafted their deaths”—so we feel both art and guilt fused. The notebook’s emptiness at the end is a visible, costly relic of change. Slight over-articulation of epiphany (“understanding that…”) keeps it just shy of 8+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the emptied notebook is an undeniable reweighting of her rule-set, and the garden paths literally spell the new grammar. The Accumulative/Textural lens is held throughout—every paragraph thickens the pattern of “explained absences” until the final cadence releases them as readable text. Orientation is taught by sentence one (“shadowed garden just after the last ship sailed”) and never falters. The single causality seam—the thread morphing into extracted presences—reads as poetic rule, not cheat, because the lyric contract is announced early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The garden is not backdrop but inscription technology: fallen leaves form words that she later reads as her own epitaph, so environment literally rewrites her options. Autumn light as “pale fingers” is visual, but the decisive sensor is tactile—the pulsing warmth of the weft against her palm—keeping detail selective and character-filtered. Spatial choreography is immaculate: kneeling beside the dried fountain, winding, pressing the final inch into soil; bodies and thread track cleanly. Micro-setting (thread-as-tool) constrains the final ritual and charges the last image, meeting 9+ gate but with a hairline excess of adjectives (“lonesome splendor”) that slightly blurs immediacy.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to release the accumulated absences she has authored—tightens once, inexorably: every wind of the thread shortens it and lengthens the visible freed images. The irreversible arithmetic (thread ↓ = presence ↑) is a single meaningful escalation under Accumulative lens, felt on the page as physical diminution in her hand. No external antagonist is needed; the conflict is the material cost of her own art. Price is visceral—joints aching, notebook empty—but the escalation is linear rather than layered, keeping it just below 8-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the counter-intuitive law that explaining absence is not a rehearsal of death but a manufacture of presence; this law is demonstrated rather than stated, culminating in the garden’s living text. Subtext resides in gesture—thread wound backward unravels forward lives. The final image avoids moralizing by remaining literal and material: a seed planted, not a lesson spoken. Ambiguity is meaningful—will the carpet regrow or simply commemorate?—yet the emotional after-effect is concrete: reader feels the weight of every obituary she will never again need to write.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is a sustained lyric-indirect register, syntactically layered but never self-plundering; each sentence lengthens like thread yet stays parseable. Perceptual signature is obsessive: every noun is immediately metaphored (“autumn light filtered…like pale fingers”) reflecting the narrator’s habit of translating life into descriptive prose. No head-hopping; the camera stays inside her skin, even when hallucinating clients in the air. Compression under pressure is masterful—final paragraph sheds modifiers, ends on plain “morning fully arrived,” proving rhythmic control can contract as well as expand.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Density is extreme—every line carries metaphor, back-story, and forward motion—yet paraphrase loops are virtually absent; each re-statement adds a new strand of meaning. Mixed-metaphor risk is high but controlled (“geography of healing,” “weave of absence”) because the metaphor family (textile + map + garden) shares root images of interlacing. One scaffold phrase—“the geography of healing”—recurs three times; since it is the conceptual stake, the repetition is thematic echo, not padding. Closure beat is uncluttered, allowing the final sentence to land clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</comment>
<comment>Premise—“obituarist for the living”—is instantly fresh and logically pursued to the limit: if you write endings for the still-alive, you eventually author your own presence. Synthesis of carpet-weaving, cartography, and elegy feels inevitable in hindsight, not grafted. Risk of preciousness is high, but the story commits without hedging, trusting the lyric engine. Only the fleeted ship-horn coda feels familiar; otherwise the fusion is singular.</comment>
