<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority is rich—braiding fog, reciting primes—yet the emotional arc is compressed into a single lyrical ascent; the “ambiguous loss” is stated more than dramatized in micro-choice, so the renunciation feels slightly pre-ordained rather than wrested under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the astrolabe-seedlings fusion reframes grief from unsolved absence to living limit. Causal chain is lyric but legible—glass eyes → spiral → astrolabe → seedlings—each step a micro-turn that tightens the stakes; the cost is the open-ended guardianship the narrator now carries, shown in the lighter satchel and departing footstep.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cavern orchard is immediate and tactile—calcite fruit chiming under boots—while the mosaic stepping-stone operates as micro-setting that literally opens the plot; the brass astrolabe’s dent “where grief had pressed” is the charged object that seeds the final image. Spatial tracking stays clean from orchard floor to forked trunk to stalactite target.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—solve the master’s vanishing—escalates through one deepening: the silence shifts from eerie to equation-deficient, forcing the glass-eye ritual. The tightening is coherent under accumulative lens: each drip, click, and tile movement increases density until the astrolabe pointer arms the narrator with a next-step limit, not an answer—cost is the eternal approach.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as “grief is not a remainder but a coefficient of motion.” The integral-sign heart that drips starlight re-prices the premise: emotion is integrable, not solvable. No moral is stated; the seedlings’ trembling leaves are the non-literal answer. Subtext lives in silence, spiral, and the master’s absent laughter—an ambiguity that invites rather than settles.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is mathematically lyrical—“arithmetic of delight,” “interval between drop and stone”—with perceptual signature of a conjurer who counts primes instead of crying. Syntax mirrors process: long clauses for nostalgia, staccato for drips. No POV slippage; diction stays within the narrator’s arcane lexicon. Rhythmic control peaks in the final cadence, aligning buried optimism with desert dawn.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Figurative density is high but patterned: every metaphor (crystal fruit, twin moons, tectonic tiles) is revisited and reweighted at closure. No mixed metaphors; vehicles stay geological/optical. Minor scaffold: “the way an equation balances…” could compress. Final third is artifact-free, propelling into the starlight pool image without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fusion of mathematical ritual with subterranean orchard is fresh; the “taxidermist’s glass eyes as twin moons” is a specific, non-portable image. Risk—letting climax hinge on symbolic drip rather than punch—pays off because pattern is taught early and closure re-weights it. Avoids sentimental “death is beautiful” tropes; instead offers iterative limit as comfort.</comment>
