<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid—her grief is never named, only refracted through the butterfly dust and the silent greenhouse. The moment she laughs “more exhale than emotion” crystallizes her arc: from frantic escape to still witness. Cost is legible—she leaves the wing fragment looking “like any other bit of trash,” renouncing her need for cosmic drama. Minor deduction: the “neutron star researcher” tag feels label-only until the synchrotron appears. </comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each layer of dust and data tightens the equation of scale = pulsar. Closure is a Charged Poise—overlay achieved, no applause, just rain softening to mist; the cost is the stripped need to outrun storms. Orientation is anchored by word 60. No causal break; every beat is because/therefore of molecular accretion. </comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Greenhouse as micro-setting constrains every move—humidity “like a guilty conscience,” pane giving way, cold water sluicing across gloves. The portable synchrotron “no larger than a lunchbox” functions as second setting, its glow the only light at climax. Weather and tool together charge the final image where Mara chooses to “watch the storm arrive, minute by minute.” One hairline slip: galvanized steel taste is dropped once and never re-weights. </comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove that local and cosmic change share a heartbeat—tightens once, at 03:17 convergence; options narrow to either accept quiet continuity or keep fleeing. Cost is conceptual: she forfeits the narrative of apocalypse. Agency is attention, not intervention; the decision to stand still forecloses her previous flight pattern. Slight reserve: storm #5 approaching is declared, not felt on her skin. </comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges solely through image: butterfly dust = pulsar layers = grief rings. No moral is spoken; the final invitation to “listen for the faint, kindled heartbeat of ongoing becoming” is an image, not a lesson. Subtext of scientific humility vs. human ego is carried in the refusal to publish with exclamation points. The echo of “strip needless drama” re-prices academic and personal narratives alike. </comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is neutron-star precise: “molecular accretion, layer upon layer” mirrors syntactic accretion. Register never drifts into academic waffle; even “PSR J1748-2446ad” is earned. Perceptual signature is color-obsessed—cobalt, galvanized, rust—filtering every object through photonic vocabulary. One micro-loop: “humidity still clung… clung” in adjacent clauses. </comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm breathes with discovery—long sentence for data unfurling, fragment for “03:17.” Information density high: a single sentence slots butterfly scale growth into astrophysics. No mixed metaphors; “decay is a courtesy” is exact. Minor scaffold: “She breathed… feeling kindled humility” is tell-ish, but immediately embodied by boots crunching glass. </comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Synthesis of neutron-star algorithm + butterfly wing dust is non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Risk: 800-word story that refuses physical action, climax is a data ping, yet stakes feel cosmic. Transformation test fails—this could only be Mara, only this greenhouse. Fresh inflection: catastrophe as boring film reel, drama as optional overlay. </comment>
