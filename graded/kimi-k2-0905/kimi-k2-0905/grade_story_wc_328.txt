<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid—her childhood nickname surfacing through static, the spiral bruise she can’t recall—but her contradictory impulses (scientist vs. willing sacrifice) are asserted rather than dramatized in scene; the final metamorphosis is accepted without visible micro-choice that costs her a human path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the city’s laughter and flint-dust benediction reweight “harmony untamed” from threat to communal love; the arrowhead’s fusion with the moth-creature is the visible cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of frostbitten confessions thickens until laughter flips the emotional valence. One shard only, no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The underground garden’s singing mandrakes and frost-rotating henbane flowers are tactile, proximity-based anchors that constrain Mara’s hand when roots embrace the flint; rooftop spiral frost and flint-dust benediction evolve directly from that micro-setting, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will Mara deliver the flint and surrender human form—tightens once: when roots clasp the arrowhead her option to retreat vanishes. Cost is legible: her human form “cracked open” and the city’s unknowing laughter. Agency is present—she climbs and fuses—but escalation is single-turn, not compounded.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: “harmony untamed” reframed from cosmic horror to communal punch line. Final image of spiral frost and unwitting civic laughter offers non-literal answer. No moralizing; the joke stays unresolved, inviting the reader to inhabit the ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, compressed, pattern-taught early (“crackled like a throat full of ice”) and held. Perceptual signature—scientist’s cataloguing eye bent into mythic register—remains coherent through antennae tasting starlight. No head-hop; distance stable; non-standard grammar (“metamorphose”) is voice-motivated and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density: each sentence layers metaphor, stakes, and sensory tilt. No paraphrase loops; metaphor chain (flint–bruise–spiral–frost) is patterned, not random. Rhythm breathes with escalation; final line “arrowhead heart ticking like a metronome” propels outward. Minor register lift (“gravitationally playful” twice) but does not dull closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Familiar cryptid-and-transformation premise is re-angled through static-phone confessions as cosmic stand-up rehearsal; flint arrowhead as punch-line delivery device is fresh synthesis. Risky lyric compression holds coherent closure. Specificity of spiral frost encoding grief-to-glitter keeps it from sliding into generic urban-fantasy template.</comment>
