<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mila’s fixation on cloaking narrative inside notation is vivid and embodied; her nightly micro-rituals (rosin-ink, copper filament weaving) show hierarchy of values. Interiority stays concrete—she “copies silence,” “trusts only green phosphor”—avoiding label-speak. Yet her decisive moment (pressing transmit) is under-motivated: no visible contradiction or flaw is tested, so the cost feels external rather than character-rooted. Earned stasis is present but wan—she smiles at whispering dust, a coda not a wound.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: dust-laden air reweights the Ministry’s rule-set, inspectors inhale banned stories, uniforms shed ash—cost is legible and social. Causal chain (broadcast → inspectors changed) is coherent, but the “why now” hinge (solstice calibration window) is told, not shown, softening the decisive change. Accumulative lens holds: density of rosin, mist, and copper builds toward the airborne chord. Orientation is swift; no seam penalties.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is micro-scaled to the alcove and radio dial; every sensory notch (iron-tasting mist, green glow on fingers) filters through Mila’s copyist priorities. Copper filament, rosin dust, and cracked seats concretely constrain her sabotage tactics, charging the final antenna-image. Spatial choreography stays clean—inspectors stagger through fog of sound—no floating rooms. World rules (banned narrative, pirate intervals) are learned by action, never dumped.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—smuggle stories back into bodies—signals early and tightens once: the final broadcast risks everything. Escalation is accretive rather than reversive; each night adds rosin-inked pages, copper wires, tightening material stakes. Cost is visible (inspectors inhale, uniforms ash), but protagonist’s personal price (safety, identity) is implied not dramatized—she never hesitates or loses. Agency is present yet friction-light; luck complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulates: dust, mist, rosin—story as physical residue that can re-enter lungs. No moralizing; the final image of ash-shedding uniforms reweights prior burnings as reversible contamination. Subtext coils inside musical lexicon (intervals = emotion), letting readers decode rebellion without exposition. Bitter irony: the Ministry’s own inspectors become first readers of banned texts—theme sticks because it is inhaled, not argued.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is lyric-cinematic, rhythm mimicking breath of radio static and bow-stroke cadence: “dust remembers the bow that awakened it.” Perceptual signature is exact—Mila notices blank measures, fermatas, stained-glass light refraction—never generic. Compression is taught early (“copied silence onto parchment”) and paid off at closure. No dialogue, so no convergence risk; interior diction remains within plausible copyist lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet breathable; sentences advance both image and causality (“She emptied her inkwell and filled it with powdered rosin…”). Figurative layering is high but patterned—rosin, dust, mist, embers—avoiding random metaphor churn. One mixed vehicle: “mist is clouded testimony” drifts toward abstraction, but does not touch closure. No scaffold loops; paragraph cuts are purposeful.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: smuggling narrative inside musical intervals + transmuting rosin into ink + airborne score is non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Premise avoids stock dystopia by focusing on acoustics and particulates rather than broad resistance tropes. Risk—lyric accretive structure—heightens atmosphere without obscuring causality. Specificity (green phosphor dial, copper filament antennae) anchors invention in tactile detail.</comment>
