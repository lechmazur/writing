<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vividly embodied—“lungs counting the cadence of brine and machinery,” “label burn cold against her thigh”—and her micro-choice to invert the poison’s purpose by planting memory-scraps is credibly driven by accumulated pressure. The contradiction between official erasure and sensory aliveness stays active in scene, not summary. Cost is felt when she feeds her death certificate to the tide, renouncing reclaimed identity to remain nameless. Flaws: the dying captain’s exposition is slightly diagnostic, and the barcode wrist detail drifts in then vanishes without altering tactics.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the poison label repurposed into a commemorative plaque reweights the port’s memory rule-set with undeniable social cost. Accumulative lens holds: each glued scrap thickens the counter-archive until the final image crystallizes new skin of memory. Causality is clean—Mara’s layering of voices directly garbles drone sensors, earning her safe dispersal. One hairline slip: the captain’s micro-recorder arrives late yet is accepted because it pays off immediately in the tagging campaign.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Container labyrinth is kinesthetic—“external stairs welded to a container tower,” “sodium lamps became moons”—and constrains movement through vertical climbs and echo corridors. Micro-setting objects (poison label, death certificate) function as portable environments that charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy obeys Mara’s stealth priorities: scent of chemical adhesive precedes visual detail. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from rusted canyon to sixth-tier hatch to wharf edge; no impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaiming erased existence—tightens when each glued fragment narrows Mara’s options: the more voices she releases, the more she must stay nameless to avoid capture. One meaningful deepening: the poison label shifts from passive relic to active template for counter-archive, foreclosing retreat to former identity. Cost is visible: relinquishing death certificate = surrendering legal rebirth. Escalation is accumulative, not causal, but legible under lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete inversion: poison meant to dissolve memory becomes ink that reprints it, resisting overt thesis. Final image—“Here remembered those the city tried to forget”—offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture: workers slow at phantom whistles, implying collective memory re-ignited. Ambiguity lingers: Mara remains nameless, proving memory can survive without official names, yet her own texture is now braille-under-skin—identity externalized into port steel.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly bound to Mara’s perceptual signature—“wet slap of waves against hulls” as her only name. Syntax mirrors stealth rhythm: long clauses when creeping, staccato when drones sweep. No head-hopping; captain’s dialogue is filtered through Mara’s interpretation. Diction stays within port worker lexicon; no academic register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>High information density: “paper said so—yet her heart hammered” packs contradiction + action. Figurative language is selective—containers “groaned like whales” once, pattern-taught early, paid off at closure. No synonym churn; “rusted walls,” “salt shadow,” “sodium light” all serve distinct sensory slots. One minor template cadence: “she…she…she” in descent paragraph, but it mimics ladder rhythm and does not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: bureaucratic erasure + container port + sound-archive creates a non-obvious memory-heist fable. Poison label repurposed as commemorative plaque feels inevitable in hindsight yet surprises on first read. Risk—lyric accumulative structure—heightens meaning without obscuring closure. No stock dystopia templates; specificity of stevedore whistles and barcode beeps grounds novelty.</comment>
