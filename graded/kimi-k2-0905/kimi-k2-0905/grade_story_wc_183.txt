<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The fused twin’s contradictory impulses (left-foot loves heights / right-foot craves depth) are dramatized in every stride; the final shared lung-breath is earned by the syllable-gathering quest. Interiority stays embodied—heartbeat at the porthole, sigh in the spine—without diagnostic labels. Cost is visible: the ship sinks, the name is too large for one throat, forcing perpetual co-identity. The only bar to 9+ is that the sister’s interiority is reported more than enacted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the emerald card dissolves into green fire that writes a two-voiced name across the sky, costing the ship and their separateness. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each shard-sentence and lily-syllable intensifies density until the fog becomes the book’s final page. Orientation is taught early (“salt-streaked porthole… drifting in a foggy bay”) and pays off when the bay turns into an open book. Persistent constraint: they must speak the name together or lose it—this shapes every forward move.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The carnival ship’s rotting plush, mildewed calliope chord, and mirror-maze panes are tactile and selective, filtering through the twin’s fused sensorium. The emerald card’s heat-spots and the sinking brass poles constrain choice—she stays to let water read the narrative threads. Spatial choreography is clean: porthole → roulette table → mirror-maze → tarot stall → carousel roof. Environment literally rewrites into pages and then into lilies, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover the lost shared name—is signaled in paragraph 5 and tightens when blank cards and heat-spots foreclose easy answers. Agency: gathering syllables, sewing them into coat lining, reciting under drowning risk. One meaningful deepening: the maze shows three mutually exclusive origin stories, forcing acceptance of chimera identity. Cost is legible—ship, solitude, and singular identity are surrendered.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges: identity is not singular but a co-authored text that must be spoken aloud to bloom. The garden of forgotten names is redefined as a tense, not a place—an elegant conceptual repricing. Subtext operates through mirrored glass, blank tarot, and lilies spelling pollen-letters. No moralizing; the final image of the emerald lily drifting north invites the next reader’s aberrant becoming.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lush yet precise, syntax stretching like calliope breath: “breathing for two, finally buoyant.” Perceptual signature is fused—soprano-alto coat, left/right stride argument—never head-hops. Patterned elision (“stories painted on glass that cracked into sentences”) is taught early and paid off when fog becomes pages. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for wonder, fragments for final lift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry triple duty—image, motion, metaphor—without purple overload. No loops or synonym churn; each lily, shard, and syllable is distinct. Mixed metaphors are functional (bay-as-book, comma-ship) because the textural lens licenses them. One hairline slip: “unkindled solace” is repeated verbatim; still, the phrase accrues new weight each time.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fused-twin name-recovery aboard a sinking carnival-maze is fresh, yet grounded in embodied cost. Mythic garden reimagined as grammatical tense avoids cliché. Risky lyric accumulation pays off when fog closes like a finished book. Transformation test fails if names or places swapped—specificity is irreplaceable.</comment>
