<comment>The priest’s interior contradiction—needing certainty to bait the demon yet starving it with doubt—remains abstract; “the need to be possessed” is asserted, not dramatized in body or micro-choice. His final self-immolation into the loop is credible and costly, but the emotional texture is filtered through lyric paraphrase rather than moment-by-moment beats that body the stakes. Still, the arc of renunciation is coherent and the sacrifice anchors closure.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the spinning phrase becomes a living cage, demon and priest fused in endless doubt; the cost is the priest’s erasure and the town’s perpetual listening. Causality is lyric-accumulative: each loop subtracts sound until absence itself is the snare; the logic holds under Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is taught early (“the sanctuary had been built on a fold…”) so the spatial grammar is legible. One minor drag: the phrase “before the possession completes” is repeated but never tightens the clock visibly; tension is atmospheric rather than logistical.</comment>

<comment>The sanctuary’s echo-physics is vividly particular: stone ribs flexing like whale bones, null-air pockets, ultraviolet silence that tints absence. These micro-setting details directly constrain tactics—sound subtraction becomes weaponized space—so the environment charges the final image. Spatial choreography remains clean across the single scene; no impossible positions or prop drift. The fold-in-space rule is consistent and learned through action, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—starve the demon by fragmenting certainty—escalates via density increase: each loop dissolves meaning into texture, tightening the抽象 noose. Agency is present in the priest’s decision to step into his own loop, but the price is more conceptual than visceral; the demon’s “hunger without name” is felt abstractly rather than as bodily cost. The reversal is singular yet decisive; under Accumulative lens the deepening suffices. Would reach 8.8+ if a concrete forfeiture (voice, flesh, time) were legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: faith survives by questioning its own pulse. The return of “decorates with silence” as living ornament reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture—the palette bleeds unseen light—rather than declaration. The final image of townsfolk listening to a statue ears can see crystallizes the thematic cost in one charged stroke.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric, compressed, patterned: “a rosary of clicks…walking away from itself into fog.” Syntax mirrors acoustic dissolution—fragments, enjambed clauses—yet remains legible. Perceptual signature is consistent: the priest notices sound, absence, color beyond sight. No head-hopping; distance stays tight to his sensorium until he becomes the anchor, a justified POV extinction.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; metaphors are purposeful (echo as rosary, ribs as whale bones). One coherence slip: “colorless color” is a paradox that works conceptually but edges toward purple if read literally; however, it is paid off at closure. No paraphrase loops or template cadences. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short fragments at climax, longer coils during exposition—earning its high band.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The fusion of loop-pedal theology with dimensional acoustics feels inevitable and fresh; no prior story has weaponized ambient silence to starve a demon of certainty. The risk—making absence the protagonist—heightens meaning without gimmickry. Specificity anchors the conceit: the palette traded for a sunrise, the jingle of stolen coins inside a stretched apology. Transformation is complete; swapping any detail would break the logic.</comment>
