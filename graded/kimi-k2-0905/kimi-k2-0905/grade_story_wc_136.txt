<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Alden’s interior contradiction—precision vs. painting—drives every beat; the punch-as-stylus reifies it. Emotions stay embodied (ultramarine on chest). The final renunciation is earned: each punched confession lights a carriage compartment, foreclosing silence. Only lapse: the “trembling certainty” refrain edges diagnostic.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain intact: punch → arrows → tunnel → fortress → canvas. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: sunrise-paint reweights every prior ticket. Cost is visible—“wet sigil on his chest.” Orientation clear by word 60; no lens drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Starlit vault, cedar mist, and punch-as-tool constrain every step; the final blank canvas flips the tunnel into observatory roof—setting reconfigures meaning. Micro-setting (punch, cracks, vaulted mist) doubles as pressure device. One minor over-label: “starlit vault” used three times without new angle.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—speak or stay lost—signalled in paragraph 3. Escalation: each punched confession lights a compartment, narrowing option to board or remain. Cost is lit车厢-by-车厢; final canvas seals the trade-off. Stakes stay personal; no inflation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—unspoken life vs. art—emerges from ticket-punch perforations; no moralizing. Final image (ultramarine line) answers the question wordlessly. Recurring mist/cedar reweights from secrecy to confession. Minor echo: “trembling certainty” twice almost articulates theme.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice—analytically artistic—survives lyric compression: “constellations spelled schedules no human tongue could pronounce.” No head-hop; punch’s pulse externalizes heart. Filter verbs minimal. One template cadence: “With every…”“With every…” in paragraph 4; forgivable under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>High density: “punch clacked once, notching the air” does three jobs. No mixed metaphors; cedar/mist holds. Rhythm breathes—long sentence then fragment. Only scaffold: “cracks in pavement forming arrows” repeated verbatim three times; tight space, still audible.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: bureaucratic route-mapper meets phantom punch that edits memory. Stakes inverted—art emerges from public-transit tool. Observatory roof callback feels inevitable. Risk (lyric ellipsis) heightens rather than obscures.</comment>
