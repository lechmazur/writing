<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority stays rooted in peat-sap scent and calloused fingers; the moment her lungs “feel sewn shut” is embodied, not labelled. The final gesture—palms to ground, exhaling a heron-cradling-reed glyph—earns her belonging turn through prior tag-tracking and mercury-net epiphany. One flaw: the “boldly sympathetic ache” is named, not dramatized, a hairline telegraph that keeps her just off 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each heron tag found adds density until the mercury lattice reconfigures kinship as forged, not inherited. Closure is a Charged Poise: the crater exhales, orchard lifts to major key, Lira’s glyph glows—cost is the irrevocable shift from solitary seeker to signpost. Causality intact: every step of tag-hunting tightens the web that finally cradles her. Minor scaffold: “pathways of crushed moonstone forked...” could drop “of,” but no artifact obscures the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Obsidian arbor’s warmth at altitude and mercury that stays wet for days are concrete, rule-setting details; the orchard’s tonal shift from dusk-minor to major key mirrors Lira’s internal re-keying. Micro-setting—the arbor surface etched with names—literally receives her breath-glyph, binding body, tool, and final image. Spatial track clean: lip → threshold → moonstone paths → crystal trunk wider than a house. No orientation drift; sensory hierarchy skews to touch and sound, apt for a sculptor.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—belonging—signals early; pressure tightens each time a heron tag is found, reweighting “webs of kinship” from inherited to forged. The mercury net revelation is the single meaningful deepening that forecloses solitude as a live option. Cost is conceptual but legible: she accepts perpetual visibility as a glowing glyph-guide for strangers. No secondary stake clutters the lane.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the migrating heron constellation rather than assertion: community is a procession you choose to join, not a birthplace. Subtext lives in the orchard’s key change—major after her exhalation—an acoustic answer unsaid but heard. Final image reweights prior reed-flat loneliness without moralizing. One tiny sermon larvae: “solitude ends the moment you decide to look side-to-side” could be cut; resonance already earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays inside Lira’s perceptual filter: she smells peat, notes reed-bending kinship logic, feels gravity gentle as the crater “inhales.” Syntax glimmers without purple drift: “luminescent ache,” “quicksilver that stayed wet for days” are voice-specific, not decoration. No dialogue to mis-step; internal monologue avoidsfilter verbs. Psychic distance compresses naturally at the mercury touch—sentences shorten, perception widens into lattice vision.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: “glyph would not come; her lungs felt sewn shut by doubt” layers physical, emotional, and symbolic blockage in one stroke. Rhythm alternates between long breathy sentences and clipped revelations, mirroring orchard chimes. Zero paraphrase loops; each descriptor (peat-sap, moonstone, starlight) returns with new functional weight. One near-muddle: “boldly sympathetic ache” is adhesive diction—both adjectives serve similar emotional color—but it occupies a single line and does not infect closure.</comment>

<comment>Fresh synthesis: street-art tag migration rewrites ancestral genealogy into participatory graffiti-kinship. Crystalline orchard plus reed-sculptor职业碰撞出glass-botanical acoustics, a collision not seen elsewhere. The heron-as-constellation device is specific, not symbolic decoration—it literally networks faces across bark. Risk—lyric escalator of wonder—pays off because the final tonal shift is legible under accumulative lens.</comment>
