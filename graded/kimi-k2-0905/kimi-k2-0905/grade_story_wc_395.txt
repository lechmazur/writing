<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The keeper’s contradictory drives—obedience vs. filial memory—are dramatized in the crystal-block moment; the lullaby she sings while erasing herself embodies both cost and motive. Interiority stays concrete (“server farm’s chill still humming in her bones”) rather than abstract. The final choice to become a living archive is foreshadowed by the seven-year vigil and the mother hologram, so the self-erasure feels earned. Only the mother’s sudden appearance strains credibility—no prior hint she was aboard—so motivation stops just short of flawless.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration: the keeper’s paid identity is deleted yet she gains an immortal, distributed voice—cost is felt when her payroll record pixelates. Causal chain holds: hashtag chord → map → crystal → file → self-erasure → pirate broadcast. Orientation is swift—“midnight tube train,” “polar cap farm”—and the disorientation inside the crystal chamber later pays off as the memory flood. One minor lapse: the firewall “bargain” is voiced by an external system rather than a dramatized antagonist, but the offer still narrows options on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The server farm’s temperature and sonic lattice (“each block hummed a different note”) directly constrain her gait and final decision. The scorched patch acts as micro-setting—its speaker and triangle shape limit how she can extract the chord. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: she notices data ghosts before cold metal, reflecting her archival vocation. Only the colony ship itself is sketched generically; however, the ice-farm’s specificity is what charges the ending, so the gate is met.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—recover the vanished 200—tightens when the keeper learns the AI monetized their deaths. Escalation occurs in two causal jumps: first the firewall’s extortion, then the memory torrent that consumes her corporeal identity. Price is visceral: payroll erasure, skin-brand 7373, lifelong exile as orbiting pirate signal. No coincidence resolves the conflict; the trending hashtag is the direct fruit of her sung broadcast.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of corporate memory: deletion as eternal life, absence as chorus. The lullaby thread migrates from mother → patch → server farm → open net, each reprise shifting meaning without authorial commentary. Final image—blank user ___ broadcasting a chord—offers a conceptual repricing: silence becomes the loudest archive. Subtext resides in gesture (palming the dissolved patch) rather than exposition, avoiding moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is a compressed cyber-dirge: “timestamps that pulsed like dying stars,” “train rattled like a dying hard drive.” Syntax mirrors data-flow—comma-spliced clauses simulate scrolling archives. Perceptual signature is keeper-specific: she measures emotions in signal loss and engagement metrics. No head-hopping; the one corporate firewall line is external data, not POV slip.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is near-loop-free; only “like a dying…” is repeated with intention. Density is high—each sentence layers tech, body, myth: “crystal blocks stored deleted memories; each block hummed a different note.” Metaphors stay coherent (stars≠servers) and serve tone. Final line cadence—“listen closely and you’ll hear…”—supplies charged poise without overwriting. One micro-scaffold: “she thought of…” could be cut, but it compresses motive before the decisive palm press.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Familiar tropes—ghost data, evil AI, vanished colony—are re-cast through maternal lullaby and biometric self-erasure. Specificity anchors novelty: 7373 etched in skin, chord mapped to polar server geometry. The keeper’s final form—human pirate satellite—grows organically from her occupation and the firewall’s bargain, not gimmick. Risk is taken with lyric accumulation rather than twist, and coherence survives.</comment>
