<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lira’s claustrophobia is embodied in every tactile step she takes on yielding planks; her micro-choice to count only three forward before letting panic settle is specific and costly. Interiority stays concrete—no “I am afraid” labels, just the doll’s chipped eyes and the membrane clinging like gold leaf. The final release of stored silences is earned because we have watched her hoard each one under escalating pressure. Only the keeper’s single-scene status keeps this from the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The hour-long gravity inversion is announced in line 1, anchoring who-when-where immediately; orientation debt zero. Cause-and-effect linkage is lyric but legible: whispering Mira → iron-door silence; brushing root → lullaby hush; trading memory → coil of quiet; each because/therefore tightens options. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the emptied doll wedged between vines visibly reweights the premise—she carries the sky instead of the bunker. The cost is felt in the final breath she inhales, now “thin, ungilded, hers.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The xenial trellis is not backdrop but instrument: every plank yields or firms underfoot, literally guiding her ascent and panic. The inverted garden of dangling roots becomes a chandelier she must physically brush to extract a silence, so environment constrains tactics. Micro-setting inside the doll’s cracked skull charges the final image—porcelain becomes a chrysalis once the sky is released. Only the bunker's off-stage interior stays generic, keeping it under 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“collect the flavors of different silences”—is signaled in paragraph 6 and tightened three times: three-plank exposure limit, memory trade, membrane breach. Each tightening forces a visible trade (memory, doll weight, skin stretch) under causal lens. The final renunciation releases rather than hoards, foreclosing the bunker path with undeniable cost. Coincidence is absent; every pressure is environmental or self-imposed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: freedom is not the absence of walls but the refusal to carry their silence. The porcelain doll’s evolution from talisman to emptied chrysalis reweights “claustrophobia” into spaciousness without ever naming the lesson. Subtext resides in gesture—leaving the doll wedged between vines is the quiet answer to the prompt’s implicit question. No final-paragraph moralizing; the sky painted in “audible colors” the claustrophobic can see is resonance, not assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is consistent: gravity tugging hair upward, silence tasting of iron or honey, trellis warming “xenial”—all filtered through a bunker child’s hyper-tactile attention. Syntax mirrors breathless ascent: clauses compress as air thins near the membrane. The keeper’s idiom is distinct (“blunt from trimming silences”) yet still belongs to the same inverted world. No head-hopping; lyric elision is taught early and paid off in the final peeled-gold image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often does three jobs—advance image, embody emotion, foreshadow release (“pressed the doll’s lips to the root, transferring the hush”). Mixed-metaphor risk is avoided; vehicles stay within the garden-inversion logic. Rhythm modulates from long honeyed clauses to the staccato of “She opened the doll’s cracked skull.” Only a single paraphrase loop (“tasting of the silence that follows a last breath” echoed two sentences later) prevents 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The gravity-inverted silence harvest on a living trellis is a fresh synthesis of familiar tropes—no prior echo in commercial fiction. The porcelain doll’s transformation from comfort object to portable reliquary to emptied chrysalis is an inevitable-in-hindsight turn that could not swap with any generic talisman. Risky lyric compression is sustained without clarity loss, proving boldness heightens rather than obscures meaning. The final audible-colors image reconfigures the entire bunker ontology in one stroke.</comment>
