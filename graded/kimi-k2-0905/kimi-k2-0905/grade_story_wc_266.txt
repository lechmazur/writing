<question>1</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Marta’s interiority (“courage unused still exists within”) is over-articulated; the hound’s shift from bound-by-leash to bound-by-choice is externalized early yet lacks micro-choices that dramatize her agency. Jun’s “gently persistent” trait enables one visible beat (pressing the stamp) but otherwise remains label-not-action. The ensemble resolution feels choral rather than individuated; no guide faces a tangible forfeiture, so closure lacks felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the hound’s self-choice reweights duty, echoed in the ticket-punch star. Under an Accumulative lens the constellation of lanterns–star–howl tightens toward this reprise, but the route to it is a single atmospheric curve rather than a because/therefore chain. The leashed-then-free causality is announced, not dramatized beat-by-beat, so cost is legible only in the final image, not in tactics along the way.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The veiled ridgeway is rendered through mist, dew, lantern pools and shifting footprints; these tactile specifics guide the search and mirror the hound’s disorientation. The shoreline lullaby tone infuses environment, anchoring cause in atmosphere rather than exposition. Micro-setting (ticket punch, stamp) constrains the final beat; spatial choreography stays clean despite one impossible “edge of a cliff that shouldn’t exist” that is deliberately dream-logic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Stakes (restore the crossing / hound’s inner courage) are signaled early but pressure escalates only atmospherically—familiar paths feel foreign, howl echoes—rather than narrowing options or forcing a trade-off. No guide risks loss; Jun’s stamp is gentle, not costly. The deepening is a cadence shift to twilight quiet, not a tactical fork, so the cost stays conceptual rather than felt on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme of self-chosen duty emerges through the leash-to-star transfer, avoiding overt thesis. Subtext lives in the shoreline lullaby tone and the hound’s whimpers rather than exposition. Final image of “calling souls home” reweights earlier lantern pools with quiet resonance; complexity is accepted (duty can be chosen, not imposed) without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The lyric third-person collective maintains a hushed, incantatory cadence consonant with “shoreline lullaby.” Filter verbs are minimal; metaphor (“paths that seemed to exist in multiple directions simultaneously”) is coherent with dream-logic. Free indirect slips stay inside the guides’ shared liminal perspective; diction remains within ferry-folk idiom.</question>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies, sentence openings diversify; however, several soft scaffold phrases (“as if the land itself had become lost,” “like breath on cold glass”) repeat concept without new pressure. Occasional modifier stacks (“mist-shrouded path,” “moonlight like tiny mirrors”) blur rather than sharpen. No artifact touches closure, but figurative density in middle beats slows propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The guardian-hound-as-ferry-employee is a fresh twist on psychopomp lore; linking ticket punches to soul-permits is specific rather than generic. Indirect-route travel as dream-topography feels inevitable to theme yet avoids tidy allegory. Risk is moderate—quiet lyric rather than bold formal experiment—so originality resides in tonal synthesis, not structural gambit.</comment>
