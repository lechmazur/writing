<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Caldera’s “rationally rebellious” stance is vividly embodied—refusing vaccines, tasting sewage, diving for ledgers—so her philosophy is never abstract. The femur-cog stylus is a haunting micro-choice that crystallizes her hierarchy of values. Interior contradiction is present but compressed into summary; we are told she “agonized” rather than watching the gear-turn of thought under rising pressure. Still, the final public pronouncement lands as earned renunciation with visible social cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each new layer of evidence (census parchment, opposing ledgers, corpse-sump) deepens the dominant stake—how to remember the plague—until the lead sheet forecloses denial. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“cracked sewer conduit”), well inside the 120-word window. Closure is a Charged Poise: the crowd’s hesitation reweights the city’s narrative future and Caldera’s own mind settles into a “stratum harder than denial.” The cost is legible in the moment of public scorn and the irreversible burial of her counter-clock.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The drowned marble domes, tide-scented sewers, and laminated corpses create a tactile, lived-in world that constantly guides Caldera’s choices—descent equals time. The brass cog’s evolution from pocket relic to bone-stylus constrains the final inscription and charges the closing image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: she notices rust gradients, ink-bleed on parchment, the abrasive calm of brushes overhead. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible geography even in vertical tunnel crawls.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—whether the city will fossilize denial—tightens as each artifact contradicts the last, culminating in the silent agreement of corpses. Protagonist agency drives every turn: she chooses to dive, map, scratch the sheet, and finally speak. The price is social exile and the irreversible exposure of her method to traders who may destroy her. Escalation is textural: density of evidence, not external antagonist, reweights the cost of truth.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as sediment, narrative as ballast. Subtext is carried in gesture—the cog pressed to her ear like a shell—and in the final image of sunrise painting “abrasive calm.” No character articulates a thesis; the lead sheet’s biting letters speak louder. The ending invites multiple readings—prophecy, threat, or promise—without sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is metallic, saline, and rhythmic—“marble domes jut from the tide like broken teeth.” Filter verbs are minimal; perception is filtered through Caldera’s scavenger-bias. Diction stays within her plausible lexicon—she names tools, strata, ledger inks, not academic jargon. The final public line modulates cadence, opening outward without voice-slip.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Metaphors are coherent—time as gear eating teeth—and do not crowd peak beats. One paraphrase loop: “abrasive calm” appears twice; the repetition is purposeful, echoing the city’s self-inflicted friction. Information density is high; every paragraph advances discovery or stakes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Freshest synthesis: plague memory as geological strata, counter-clock carved into bone. Risk—plague corpses as archive—pays off without sensationalism; the sump scene reconfigures the entire city’s mythology. The premise feels inevitable in hindsight yet non-obvious at entry. Transformation test fails: replace Caldera and the drowned city falls apart; specificity is irreplaceable.</comment>
