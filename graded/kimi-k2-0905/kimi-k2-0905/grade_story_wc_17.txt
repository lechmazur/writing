<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mira’s perceptual acuity and inherited dread are fused in every beat; the moment she swallows her great-grandmother’s name, motivation spikes from job to blood-curse. Interiority stays concrete—film negatives brushing her skin—never abstract. The final renunciation—becoming the corridor herself—pays off every micro-choice and is irreversible. Only a trace of over-tidy “legacy’s burden” refrain keeps it from 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The accumulative cadence of negatives/diary fragments tightens like a ratchet; each glimpse reweights the stake until the tunnel turns Mira into the building’s memory. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the corridor now breathes her scream, a cost felt in the rebuilt common room. No causality breaks; the ivy-shutter-developer metaphor is taught early and paid at the end. One of the few 600-word pieces where the final image re-codes every prior sentence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Ivy-veiled passage is not backdrop but aperture, constraining movement and focal depth; the dripping corridors literally narrow options. Sensory hierarchy stays cartographer-ear-centric, privileging echo over sight. Micro-setting—the fireplace diaries and humming film wires—supplies both tool and terrain. Environment charges the final image: the empty room that breathes because Mira’s body has become its lung.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will Mira escape the archive or become it—signals at the negative self-portrait and tightens when she recognizes the Vale name. Agency is continuous: every step down the tunnel is a choice to keep looking. Cost is visible: her body dematerializes into corridor. The escalation is textural (density of negatives) rather than causal, but under Accumulative lens that suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from inversion motif—negative to positive, future to past, architect to archive—never named aloud. The burden of witness is dramatized by Mira’s literal incorporation into the walls, refusing easy moralizing. Final image of staff hearing “footsteps that never arrived” reweights prior material with social cost: the university keeps consuming cartographers. Resonance lingers because particulars (ivy, halide, diary ash) are inseparable from the ethical question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is crystalline, lyrical yet precise—“silver flaking like old paint”—without purple drift. Perceptual signature is cartographer-acoustic: every noun carries hush or echo. Syntax compresses under pressure—“sound collapsed; her heartbeat became the echo”—without losing clarity. No head-hop; distance holds as Mira’s sensorium merges with stone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers job-tool-heritage. Figurative logic (camera-building) stays coherent; no mixed metaphors. Minor template cadence in “legacy’s burden” refrain costs −0.2, but it never touches the closure beat. Read-aloud rhythm mirrors heartbeat-to-echo transition, earning high band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Concept of a university-as-camera that develops its own memories via climate-flash is genuinely fresh. Inheritance-as-physical-absorption literalizes theme without gimmickry. Risk—turning protagonist into architecture—pays off emotionally and conceptually. Transformation test fails: story collapses without ivy-shutter mechanism, proving irreplaceability.</comment>
