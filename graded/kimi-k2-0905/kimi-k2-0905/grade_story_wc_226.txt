<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is vivid—“refusal echoed in her ribs”—and her micro-choice to climb the spire while clutching a mirror shard embodies the contradictory impulse to scatter blame yet seek absolution. The final whispered “I accept the cost” is earned by the cascade of self-cast echoes she endures; the feather’s arrival is the visible price. No second character present, so relationship crucible is N/A; headcount stays clean. Voice remains singular and stained with guilt throughout, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the cracked spire expels a feather that recolors her future art; cost is undeniable. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each echo layers density until the pattern breaks with the spire’s fracture. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“canyon of endless echoes”). No causal contradiction; the final image reweights every prior reflection under a new, shared rule-set.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The pale spire, bone towers, and mist form a micro-setting that literally channels sound into choice-forcing feedback; the mirror shard angles sunlight that carves the queen’s plea across living stone, charging the final crack. Three senses—touch (warm vertebrae), sight (seven ribbons), hearing (multiplied syllables)—are braided through action, never catalogued. Spatial choreography is clean: climb, balance, angle, crack. Setting evolution (spire split) is causally tied to Lira’s acceptance beat. Meets 9+ gate: the spire-as-tool constrains tactics and supplies the closing feather.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—scatter blame before priests arrive—signals at “one hour to make the spire sing.” Pressure tightens when the canyon starts repeating her own lines (“both palms bleed”), foreclosing the option to keep the queen’s plea private. Agency is renunciation: she stops reciting and accepts listening, which fractures the spire and releases the feather; cost is legible. Under Accumulative lens, density balloons until the pattern snaps; no coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of forgiveness as a prism: “no single color of blame could settle on her alone.” The feather and split spire non-literally answer the thematic question—truth shared is weight distributed. No final-paragraph moralizing; the last line is an image (“story learning to breathe”). Subtext lives in the mirror shard that once reflected the queen now projecting Lira’s own words back at her.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is consistent: canyon as accuser, spire as needle, regret as reverberation. Syntax tightens under pressure—“She spoke over the echo, voice innocently mischievous”—then fractures into choral repetition. No head-hopping; single POV holds. Compression (“Bone towers flanked the path ahead, their hollow sockets humming…”) is taught early and paid off when the sockets later spit her lines rear-ranged.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm drives escalation: long breathy sentences for climb, staccato fragments for echo ricochet. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors stay coherent—mirror as prism, spire as phononic bone. Information is dense: “seven pale ribbons that painted the opposite tower with ghost sentences” does visual, sonic, and thematic work in one stroke. Closure beat is uncluttered: “a single white feather that floated into her hand, weightless yet sufficient.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Premise—using canyon acoustics as confessional prism—is fresh; mentor-mocked poetry becomes the only tool sharp enough supplies ironic risk. Transformation test fails if queen/fire/forgiveness relocated, because the echo-mechanic is geologically bound. Specific detail: vertebrae-carved holds, flaking silver backing on mirror. Final reconfiguration (feather as weightless but sufficient currency) feels inevitable yet non-obvious. No stock tropes; lyric structure is risk that pays off in legible closure.</comment>
