<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mara’s claustrophobia is never named—only lived: the tunnel narrows to a throat, her knees bleed on glass, her breathing is timed to tide. Each technician she names costs gold lacquer and re-embodies them, so her motive (“stand by the unremembered”) is enacted, not declared. The moment she speaks “L. Sato,” the story pivots; the cost is the lacquer thinning, a visible, irrevocable price. Interior contradiction holds to the end: she fears enclosed space yet keeps crawling deeper, until the final ebb replaces fear with obligation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the gold lacquer settles into the codex while the cable’s “hungry” hum drops to ordinary surf, reweighting the entire quest from rescue to remembrance. Causality is retroflex but intact—naming the dead reverses the phase transition because the gold medium was always their residual agency. The lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure accrues via repeating “name→gold→body restored” until the final cadence shift releases the signal back to silence. Cost is legible in the last line: she carries “each syllable a copper strand,” a lived burden that can never be laid down.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The facility and tunnel are not backdrop but actuator: the corridor folds into living basalt, the cable vault becomes a heart Voss must keep beating. Spatial choreography is immaculate—every body is half-merged with hardware at believable angles, and the gold fleck’s phase state determines when walls soften or stiffen. Environment directly constrains tactics: claustrophobic throat-stone forces Mara to crawl, scraping skin, so the act of naming becomes physically arduous. Final image—the gold settling into the codex—makes the setting itself the archive, charging the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will the unremembered be returned?”—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens each time a name costs lacquer. One meaningful deepening suffices: when Mara realizes the signal “noticed” the crew, rescue becomes witness; failure means their second erasure. Agency is pure attention: every uttered name forecloses her own escape until the last flake is spent. Price is tangible—lacquer gone, claustrophobia endured, future obligation to speak the names forever—so the final silence feels earned, not convenient.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the gold’s double life: data conduit and memorial pigment, proving memory is a physical medium that must be carried in tissue. No character moralizes; insight is delivered by image—eyes wide in silent broadcast, auroral scars on basalt. The closing copper-strand heartbeat reframes the entire undersea cable network as a cemetery whose markers travel at the speed of regret. Ambiguity is preserved: the signal is neither malevolent nor benevolent, only hungry for witness, denying the reader ethical simplicity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric-technical, compressing spelunker jargon with submarine poetry: “throat of stone,” “crash of surf she could not see.” Perceptual signature is claustrophobic narrow-focus—light cones, glass scraping skin, the single flake winking—never touristic panorama. Syntax tightens under pressure: clauses shorten as tunnel narrows, then relax into longer ebb-tide rhythm on the deck. No head-hopping; even Voss’s whisper is filtered through Mara’s perception, maintaining strict interiority.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops, zero scaffold; every sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphor density is high but coherent—copper veins, auroral scars, crashing hush—all belong to the same electrical-oceanic lexicon. Opening line anchors voice and stakes in one breath; final line hands the reader the copper strand, no explanation. Rhythm modulates with physical space: clipped clauses for crawl, tidal cadence for release, proving syntactic control serves emotional pulse.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The fusion of claustrophobia + undersea cable + gold illuminant as memory medium is non-obvious yet feels inevitable. Trope of “haunted technology” is transformed through materials science: phase-shifting metal, fiber-optic ghosts, signal as predator. Specificity is unrepeatable—gold fleck lacquer that thins with each name, tidal cadence as narrative metronome. Risk of technical lyricism could have collapsed into ornament, but every image is yoked to bodily cost, yielding a fresh inflection on elegy.</comment>
