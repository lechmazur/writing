<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Alya’s stoic-wonder voice stays consistent; every weld-torch choice embodies her “functionally creative” trait. The pocketing of the warm sextant shard is a micro-cost that seals her arc. No contradictory interiority is shown, but the scarcity of external resistance keeps the arc emotionally safe.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/lyric lens: because/therefore links are soft, but each sensory layer (“brass birds... beating a cadence”) tightens the stakes of reclaimed wonder. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the birds’ new breeze physically lifts tickets and morally reframes abandonment as repair. The hologram line “Measure what returns” crystallizes the cost—hope now carries an ongoing maintenance burden.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The terminal’s rust-cathedral, glycol arteries, and brass-bird sculpture are not backdrop; their physical states dictate what Alya can reroute. Micro-setting—the sextant shard aligning with a pictograph—literally unlocks the pipe geometry. Final image: coins spin longer than physics allows; environment enchants the closure without breaking prior verisimilitude.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—reclaim wonder via fluid equations—tightens once when glycol hits dry pumps and again when birds beat air. Each escalation is Alya’s agency under the Accumulative lens; no coincidence rescues her. Cost is felt: she pockets the shard, accepting perpetual stewardship. A harder external obstacle would have pushed the score higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the recurring equation motif: hope = redirected flow × residual heat / time³. No character sermonizes; the hologram’s “flow is forgiving” is subtext spoken by a subroutine. Final birds-patrol image answers the thematic question—abandoned spaces can self-maintain wonder—without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Lush yet disciplined diction—“Martian vermillion,” “Möbius confession”—never drifts above Alya’s engineer precision. Rhythm accelerates with pump pressure, then exhales as wings beat. Lyric compression is pattern-taught early (“ghostly calliope chords”) and paid off in the coin-spin coda. No head-hop, no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Almost every sentence layers job—advance image + world logic + character stance. Minor scaffold: “equations the city elders said were unsolvable” could compress. No mixed metaphors or loops; even the zero-mass comet simile is physically apt for raffle tickets. Closure line “portable meridian pointing... inward” is clean, propulsive, earned.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sextant shard as hydraulic key is fresh; carnival-departure-ghost trope is inverted into maintenance-not-escape logic. The kinetic bird sculpture reborn by glycol is a specific, non-transferable image. Risk feels organic, not gimmick, because the mechanics are foreshadowed by pictographs and pump layout.</comment>
