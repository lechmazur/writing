<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren’s quietly stubborn curiosity—rooted in childhood and sharpened by six winters of cataloguing failure—drives every move from locking the furnace to descending the rope. Her dry aside “swallowed her editor’s instinct to annotate” encapsulates the wry, self-aware voice that stays consistent under pressure. Interiority is tactile (condensation as Braille, atlas page drinking light) rather than analytic, so we feel thought in her fingertips. The final quiet refusal to transmit coordinates is a believable renunciation born of everything we’ve seen her notice and touch.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: beats accrete sensory pattern (spiral condensation, atlas blank page, river words in light) until meaning reweights at the liminal shaft. Causality is present but subordinated to charged repetition; each image returns with greater charge, culminating in the conceptual repricing of the glowing thread-map under the ice. Closure lands on-page: Maren’s illuminated page dissolves into living water, transferring its ink to the world—an undeniable visible cost. The pattern is taught early (spiral droplets) and paid off at the very last line, satisfying the Accumulative test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Frozen lake, rusted outpost, limestone throat, and the atlas itself as portable setting all constrain movement and supply tools (tripod rope, glowing micro-organisms). Micro-setting rules: condensation droplets guide descent; phrasebook Quechua literally opens the shaft, turning language into topography. No extra geographic exposition is offered; every detail is filtered through Maren’s professional cartographer eye and winter-numbed skin. The final image of spiral frost left on the refrozen lake surface is both environmental and symbolic payoff, charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—find whether rivers share a common origin—emerges via childhood question and Registry radio ping. Escalation is textural: each sensory pattern (condensation spiral, glowing river words) deepens the same obsession until the single underground estuary offers an answer that must either be reported or released. The tightening is the irreversible dissolve of her map-page: once the ink enters the living water, her data is literally unrecoverable—felt price on the page. Agency stays hers: she clips in, speaks “mayu,” and chooses to let the page go.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme grows from the conflation of language, water, and origin: every tongue names the same river-source, suggesting geography is polyglot memory. Maren’s decision to sacrifice professional credit for a mythic transfer (ink → microbes → oceans) reweights “origin” from cartographic ownership to planetary circulation. No overt thesis is stated; the final map titled “Origin: classified” is an ironic label that invites readers to feel the cost of buried knowledge. Quiet resonance lingers—Helsinki cartographer will sense anomaly, Quechua child will dream—without moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited hugs Maren’s perceptual filters: brittle atlas pages, frost-torn falcon wing, condensation as “breath-born droplets sliding toward a common center.” Syntax tightens under stress—“She clipped herself… swallowed… descended”—mirroring the rope’s drop. No head-hops; even the falcon’s post-mortem hover is perceived as wind-puppetry from her vantage. Diction stays winter-cold and precise: “liquefied instantly,” “blue-black darkness,” matching her cartographer lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm alternates between long sensorial sweeps and abrupt, breath-held fragments that mimic cold shock. Metaphors are spare and coherent—“lake stretched like a shattered mirror,” “walls ribbed like throat cartilage”—no mixed vehicles. Information density is high: one sentence can advance plot, reveal backstory winter count, and seed spiral motif (“dog-eared corner… between maps… the only thing her predecessor left”). Zero paraphrase loops; each clause adds new angle or texture. Clarity never sacrifices lyric urgency.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The underwater estuary where living microorganisms spell river-words in motion is a fresh, earned fusion of sci-fi bioluminescence with linguistic topology. Convergence as non-place but moment is handled conceptually without losing narrative drive. Risky lyric accumulative structure pays off via spiral motif that reappears as frost sigil at the end, making pattern feel inevitable. Rather than default explorer-versus-authority trope, the conflict becomes epistemic gift versus data suppression, a subtler ethical tilt.</question>
