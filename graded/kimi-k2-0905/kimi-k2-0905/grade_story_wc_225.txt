<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marek’s guilt-driven exile and his need to “winnow” regret into usable remorse are palpable; the micro-choice to right the fallen king crystallizes his arc. Interiority stays concrete—knuckles blanch, breath moves—avoiding label-speak. The single flaw: the duke’s daughter is off-stage, so the relationship crucible is rhetorical rather than tested in scene; this keeps the score just shy of 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the village exhales as Marek sets the king upright—cost is the decade of frozen guilt now thawed. Causal chain holds: tapestry decode → labyrinth walk → king righted → time restarts. The platinum fountain mirror-reveal is seeded early; no teleporting props. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; the final image reweights the entire pattern.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The time-frozen village is more than backdrop—its arrested cobbles, suspended loaves, and perpetual storm constrain Marek’s every step until he acts. The fountain’s eroded chessboard and the fraying tapestry are micro-settings that directly enable the decoding beat. Sensory hierarchy obeys Marek’s tutor eye: notation before wind, stormlight before touch. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes are legible from line 1: guilt vs. self-forgiveness. The single tightening is the moment Marek sees the suicidal king-sequence embroidered—this reframes his penance from puzzle to witness. Cost is conceptual but undeniable: accepting the “loss as instructive” rather than erasable. No external antagonist is needed; the conflict is internal and lands with visible village-unfreezing consequence.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges without sermon: forgiveness is not amnesia but re-patterning the board. The suicidal king and the “board is wider than the mistake” murmur reweight each other. No final-paragraph thesis; the breeze carrying threads skyward is the non-literal answer. Ambiguity is productive—reader must decide if meeting the daughter is possible—yet emotional aftereffect is concrete.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person voice is saturated with Marek’s chess-tutor perceptual signature: every object is a diagram or notation. Syntax is controlled—compression during storm-light study, elongation during labyrinth walk—without algorithmic pattern. Diction stays within a tutor’s lexicon; no register drift. The single line of “fierce repose” is reused twice, but the reprise is intentional, not template cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, motive, or board state. Metaphors (felt-like hush, stormlight corridors) are coherent and non-contradictory. Information density is high—e.g., “algebraic chess coordinates mixed with village names” does double descriptive and plot work. One near-purple phrase—“winnowing that separated useful remorse from paralyzing shame”—is earned by context and rhythm.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The frozen-time village + chess-notation tapestry is a fresh synthesis; neither trope feels recycled. Risk—suicidal king as emblem of acceptance—pays off by reframing loss as pedagogy. Specificity (platinum fountain, half-eroded squares) prevents abstraction. While the “guilt-ridden tutor” archetype is familiar, the embroidery decoding and labyrinth mirror transform it into a singular vision.</comment>
