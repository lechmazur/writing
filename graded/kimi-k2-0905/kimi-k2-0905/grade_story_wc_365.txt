<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The sensory map maker’s interiority is rich and embodied—her fingers itch, her soles record temperature, her gut swallows the data cube. Contradictory impulses (yearning to map vs. dread of complicity) are alive in scene, but the final resolve to redirect every future commission is asserted more than dramatized; we witness the insight, not the micro-choice that seals it. The lover’s absence is felt weight, yet the self-betrayal angle is revealed so late that the emotional cost is more inferred than tasted. Still, her perceptual signature is consistent and character-specific, earning a strong if not flawless score.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: a Conceptual Repricing that reweights her maps from places to consequences, with felt cost (“the copper wire of her veins”). Causal lens holds: shard-flare → loom → locker → cube → resolve. Mosaic pattern is taught by 25% (shard first sings at ~150 words) and transitions remain legible; orientation anchors who/where/when inside 120 words. No lens ambiguity or teleporting props; only a slight over-reliance on lyric summary in the final paragraph keeps it from the 9-band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Setting is micro-to-macro: cracked deck, vacuum bay, volcanic ash—each parallel bay is evoked through sensory hierarchy (scent of grease/ozone/lilac rain). The repair bay itself is handled tactily—kneeling, pressing glass to deck, bracing in zero-g—and the final image of “broken ribs settling into the shape of a question” charges closure. Spatial choreography is flawless; no white-room syndrome. Only the briefest moment of static star-catalog description prevents a 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—unearthing the buried truth of her lover’s fate and her own complicity—tightens when the locker yields the data cube and self-authored note. Escalation is accumulative/lyric: each bay adds density of guilt until the loom collapses to one thread. Cost is legible—she swallows the cube, veins mapped with copper wire—but the tightening is more imagistic than tactical; no live option is foreclosed on the page, only reconfigured. Still, pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens and the final stance crystallizes with undeniable weight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: mapping as both art and weaponized complicity. Subtext operates in objects—green shard as tuning fork against void, copper wire as veins of recorded guilt. Final image reweights “truth is the mass you still carry” without moralizing. A hairline slip: the phrase “cyclically spontaneous” is repeated verbatim, slightly thinning the resonant patina, but ambiguity remains rich and non-trivial.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric, compressed, patterned: “cyclically spontaneous” becomes incantatory; syntax mirrors loom—“strands tighten around her ankles.” Perceptual signature is bias-driven—she tastes dust, feels bulkheads bend without motion. No head-hopping; POV distance stable. Minor over-crank in final paragraph (“engines roar anew, cyclically spontaneous”) slightly over-pressurizes the diction, keeping it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is varied; sentences braid and tighten like the loom itself. Figurative density is high but purposeful—each metaphor (shard as cicada, bay as loom, ribs as question) returns to charge closure. No mixed metaphors or paraphrase loops; only a single synonym flutter (“shard pulses / shard flares”) prevents 8.8. Copy-clean except one comma splice that serves lyrical cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: sensory cartographer + parallel loom + weaponized starlight cover-up. The shard-as-tuning-fork and copper-vein mapping are specific inventions that would break if swapped. Risky lyric mosaic structure pays off with coherent closure. No close echoes of famous scenes; the final ribs-as-question image is new yet inevitable. Conceptual integrity full; no retreat into safe generality.</comment>
