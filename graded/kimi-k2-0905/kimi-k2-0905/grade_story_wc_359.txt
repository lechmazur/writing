<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elian’s interiority is sensorially embodied (violet footfalls, cider harmony) and his micro-choice to swallow the sheet crystallizes the arc with visible cost; the absence of any second character keeps relationship/status bullets dormant, but the contradiction between Council utility and personal wonder is dramatized, not declared. The final renunciation is earned because the aurora walk strips him first—no tidy calibration. Minor slip: “wonder needed certification” edges toward diagnostic label-speak, but it is quickly grounded in the Council threat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure (Conceptual Repricing) lands when Elian ingests the sheet and the aurora bursts back to sky—an undeniable reweighting of civic values. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each color layer strips a protective scale until the final image crystallizes. Orientation is anchored by sensory cues within 120 words; no teleporting props. The persistent constraint—bells silent until truth—shapes tactics and charges the final hush-to-song inversion.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ice cavern, body, and bronze bells function as micro-setting: the piano-shaped slab physically blocks passage and must be breathed/played open. Spatial choreography is tracked cleanly across the three chambers; temperature drop is felt through breath-crystal chords. Aurora layers evolve from ceiling trap to internal purge, constraining the final choice. Final image—clear walls, sky reclaimed—recharges every earlier color note.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (certify wonder vs. Council ban) is signaled early and tightens when acoustic amber demands a value test; the aurora walk is the meaningful deepening that forecloses retreat. Cost is legible: heart visibly orbits outside chest, mentor’s name is exhaled, childhood fear tasted and discarded. No coincidence; resolution arises from swallowed sheet. One tightening suffices for 700-word scale.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of hush into song without moralizing; final image reweights “impractical” wonder as civic infrastructure. Recurrent color/music motifs accumulate pressure rather than decorate. Subtext in the sculptor’s unseen chisel shift—from warning to invitation—offers a quiet thematic pivot. No final-paragraph thesis statement; resonance is imagistic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person lyric remains tightly focalized through Elian’s synesthetic perception; no head-hop. Diction (“oscillating repose,” “fossilized sunrise”) stays within his aesthetic lexicon. Rhythm accelerates with color-stripping beats, then exhales into the silent explosion. Pattern-taught elision (bells wait, then ring once) is legible and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density: each sentence advances image, stake, or sensory pivot. Figurative language is patterned (color = sound) and never muddled; no mixed metaphors. No loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. Minor overwriter alert: “wonder needed certification” is the only abstract throat-clearing, but it is rescued by concrete Council threat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Synesthesia-as-infrastructure is a fresh angle on the “artist vs. utilitarian state” trope; aurora-walk as emotional exfoliation is non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Risky compression (swallowing a score) pays off by literalizing internalized music. Specific detail (frozen eelgrass strings) prevents abstraction. Conceptual integrity holds: the city’s ledgers remain off-page but their weight is felt.</comment>
