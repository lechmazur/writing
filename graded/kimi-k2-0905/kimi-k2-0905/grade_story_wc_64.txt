<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mercy’s interiority is concrete—her ribs flutter, her fingers tremble—yet the “blithe” trait is declared, not dramatized; she never contradicts it under pressure. The final descent is earned because every prior beat of tending and decoding has foreclosed her old identity as mere gardener. Still, the coin’s warmth is the only external test of motive; a second, costlier temptation would have sharpened the arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the living world is literally sealed above her, an undeniable cost. The spiral coin, sovereign case, and tapestry drawer chain causally; no prop teleports. Orientation is taught early—velveteen gloom, marble lamb, cobalt silo—so the later vertical moves track cleanly. The only slack is the off-stage “war refugees” reveal; because the cipher is already solved, the cellar feels retrofitted rather than fought for.</comment>

<comment>The missile-turned-greenhouse silo constrains every later move—seedlings in winter, ladder rungs, the tapestry’s curved wall all impinge on body and choice. Starlight drips through glass onto seed packets, recharging the final image with literal horticultural hope. Spatial choreography is flawless: wheelbarrow, lamb, iron rungs, locked hatch—each object’s state is remembered. Only the root cellar itself is under-described once she climbs down, momentarily white-rooming the payoff space.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“discover the shape of intentions”—tightens when the border cipher forecloses surface life: she must descend or betray the dead’s wager. The spiral’s closure is the single meaningful turn, trading open sky for sealed earth. Cost is legible in the metallic kiss of the locking hatch; no reset rescinds it. Still, external antagonistic pressure is abstract (the dead “wager memory”), so the stakes feel conceptual rather than viscerally urgent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without sermon: the living organize hours, the dead organize memory; gardening becomes covert archiving. The tapestry, seeds, and spiral reweight from ornament to obligation, letting resonance accrue rather than declare. Final image—seed packets labeled “hope, defiance, return”—answers the thematic question non-literally. One softening: the phrase “tenderly organized heart” flirts with thematic echo, though it is saved by preceding embodied labor.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays inside Mercy’s idiom—“uncharted echoes flutter through her ribs”—syntax mirrors her horticultural precision. Velveteen, cobalt, sovereign, loam: diction is lush yet never exceeds a gardener’s lexicon. Rhythm accelerates with the spade beats, then compresses into the lock’s “metallic kiss,” a cadence shift that serves the climax. No head-hopping; every perception is strictly character-bound.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening, propelling the night’s descent. Figurative density is high—“starlight drips,” “metallic kiss”—yet each vehicle is physically grounded and paid off at closure. No filter-verb stacks, no synonym churn; “tenderly organized” appears once and is earned by tactile tool arrangement. Minor scaffold: “the dead wager memory” is repeated almost verbatim from border text; the echo is purposeful but still noticeable.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusing WWII refugee hideouts with a cosmic-spiral cipher via cemetery gardening feels fresh and specific to this voice. The sovereign case is not steampunk prop but a seed vault for civil resistance, transforming antique into activist heirloom. Risk—lyric obscurity—never clouds causality because each image (ivy, tapestry, lantern) later constraints action. The concept could travel, yet the sensory palette of velvet gloom and cobalt glass is irreproducibly local.</comment>
