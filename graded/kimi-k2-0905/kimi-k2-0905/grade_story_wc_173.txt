<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lys’s interior contradiction—contract-bound chastity vs. awakened desire for collective liberation—is dramatized through bodily choice (barefoot bleeding prints) and renunciation (staying as first non-echo). The mercury-tears-into-stars image externalizes cost, but the “redirected desire” turn is stated more than embodied; a single tactile beat of withheld touch would have sealed the arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Lys steps into the mirror-void, surrendering stolen memories, and the city’s dream-chains become visible—undeniable conceptual cost. Causal lens holds: each untangled knot literally melts snow and rewrites citizens’ dreams. One micro-drag: “between sigh and smile” time-marker is lyrical but blurs elapsed time inside the sanctuary; because the final image re-orients, orientation waiver applies.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prism sanctuary’s faceted quartz and mercury-weeping statues constrain movement and supply the literal mechanism for memory-unweaving; the courtyard’s thawing tiles force Lys’s barefoot bleeding. Micro-setting—the velvet pouch as portable cage—shapes her furtive kneeling. Sensory economy favors tactile cold and metallic taste, omitting visual overload; the night-blooming cereus reprise at closure reweights setting into living symbol.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—break the lullaby or forever obey—tightens with each knot: snow retreat reveals predecessors’ stone corpses, making failure visible. Agency is continuous: every echo-thread she plucks physically alters the city’s dreamscape. Cost is legible in mercury tears and her own blood prints, though the final collective awakening briefly dilutes personal price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of stolen vs. chosen voice emerges through echo-transaction: memories returned become lanterns, turning theft into shared light. Subtext resides in silence—Lys declines the weaver’s escape-cloak, wordlessly choosinglocal responsibility. Final image of statues refilled with citizen light reweights conformity as hollow container, avoiding moral statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is crystalline and synesthetic—“veins of silver running through alabaster that mapped the human heart in anatomical verse”—consistent with Lys’s trained attention to bodies. Rhythm modulates: long breathless sentences under pressure, then short declaratives after core opens. No dialogue, so voice remains pure lyric; diction stays within her sensual lexicon without academic drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density: one sentence often fuses metaphor, action, and world rule—“snow melted into spring water that reflected starlight like shattered mirrors.” No loops or scaffold; figurative layer is dense yet patterned, taught early (“statues wearing frost like lace veils”) and paid off in cereus bloom. One near-muddle: “arterial red” as color of alarming serenity momentarily clashes with lavender, but the clash is intentional, not clarity break.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fusion of courtesan-spy and memory-weaver is fresh; the “harvest of echoes” as crystalline threads that hum under moonlight particularizes the magic system. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off: collapsing prism into chiming sand feels inevitable because quartz facets were seeded early. City-scale awakening could feel convenient, but the mercury tear-stars keep the cost embodied and specific.</comment>
