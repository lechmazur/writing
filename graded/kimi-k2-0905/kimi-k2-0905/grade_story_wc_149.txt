<comment>The ghost bride’s contradictory impulses—vengeance and tenderness—are dramatized in the bead-transfer beats; the boy’s inherited guilt turns on embodied micro-choices (offering wrist, accepting apricot). Interiority stays concrete, no label-speak. Final forgiveness is earned because the bead’s three-century weight is felt in every pulse. Cost is visible: orchard withers, veil falls, she disperses—path foreclosed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Causal lens holds: bead heartbeat → nightly visitations → fruit currency → debt extraction. Orientation anchored by line 3 inside greenhouse; no drift. Closure is Decisive Change with conceptual cost: boy keeps seed, seasons return, debt cycle broken. Persistent constraint—aluminum coat that burns her—shapes late tactics and images.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Greenhouse’s steam-fed, rune-etched trees and mirror-bright apricot constrain every move; setting is tool and price. Micro-setting (bead lodged in heart wall) literally directs action. Spatial choreography clean: drift, hover, hand-to-fruit, roof dissolves. Sensory hierarchy ghost-POV: cold iron air remembered, silver skins pulse—selective, urgent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—ancestral debt—signaled in line 5; tightens when bead implants and dreams bloom. One meaningful escalation: seventh-night apricot pick severs guilt-thread; option foreclosed, orchard dies. Cost legible on-page: boy lifted to toes, light poured, trees wither. Agency shared: boy offers wrist, ghost guides hand—both pay.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from image pattern: debt as vine, fruit as currency, seed as gift. Final reconfiguration—debt becomes stranger’s gift—reweights entire orchard economy without moralizing. Subtext in gesture: offering wrist rejected, apricot accepted shows forgiveness beats blood. Ambiguity lingers: seed’s ordinary seasons may still carry ghost echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Lyric-ghost POV sustained: “voice like broken bells,” perceptual signature of temperatureless memory. Compression taught early (“veil trailing like smoke”) and paid off at veil-fall. No head-hop; boy’s interior accessed only through dream intrusion and physical lift—ghost-filtered. Rhythm modulates: long breathless sentences build to short crystalline release.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High density: copper pipes exhale steam / feeding pomegranate trees that bore fruit of molten silver—one line, three jobs. No loops or scaffold; metaphor vehicles stay coherent (smoke, vine, bell). Peak beat clarity preserved: “Light poured from his mouth, from the fruit, from her absent eyes” —triple source, single rope image. Minor over-figuration in early orchard description does not dull closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fusion of alchemy-orchard and ghost-debt is fresh; silver-gold fruit as reparations currency feels inevitable yet new. Risk in non-linear, lyric haunting paid off by taught pattern and charged closure. Transformation test fails if names changed: rune-etched pomegranates and aluminum coat are irreplaceable. Specificity anchors myth to tactile economy.</comment>
