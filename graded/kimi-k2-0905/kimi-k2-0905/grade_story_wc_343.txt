<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lira’s curiosity is embodied in dust-breath and knee-scrapes; the spiral translation is a micro-choice that costs her isolation and earns communal light. Contradictory impulses—yearning for discovery vs fear of erasure—coexist in the same beat. The final shared horizon is earned by her voiced tale, not authorial gift. One hairline slip: “knees shook” is a stock tell amid otherwise vivid embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the ship’s lamps blaze anew, crew maps fold into one horizon, Lira’s solitude refracts into shared current—cost is her mother’s fragment consumed in public voice. Causal chain: hopscotch syllables → phrasebook recital → light-feed ignition → starling double-helix → collective destination. Lens holds as Causal throughout; no teleporting props or convenient amnesia. Orientation anchored by word 60; pattern taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Airship ribs, moon-grated cargo deck, and chalk-dust spirals are tactile constraints that shape where Lira can kneel, copy, speak. Brass, copper, flour-fine dust recur with evolving stakes, charging the final ignition. Starling murmuration externalizes her interior map and mirrors the spiral she translates—specific rather than decorative. One minor slip: “cloud-sea” leans poetic-generic, but is saved by later mechanical specificity of hydrogen cells.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—ship’s forgetting vs Lira’s need to name—tightens when lamps dim and engineers confess the light-feed starves for stories. Single meaningful turn: she risks voicing private relic in public galley, foreclosing her covert ownership; cost is exposure. Pressure escalates because/therefore: dim → discovery → translation → shared blaze. No coincidence resolves; starlings complicate then mirror, not save.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme—language as navigational latitude—emerges from chalk spirals, dead dialects, and shared horizon rather than thesis statements. Subtext of isolation-to-belonging is carried in lamp-glow and folded maps, never declared. Final image of “currents of shared light” reweights earlier solitude without moralizing. One tiny echo risk: “light remembers its way home” flirts with platitude, but is earned by seventeen-tongue recital.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays inside Lira’s perceptual filter—starlings as uncharted currents, dust as half-erased syllables. Syntax lengthens under wonder, shortens under urgency (“She sprinted”). No head-hopping; Captain Rooth’s interior is guessed, not ventriloquized. Distinct diction: “stranded luminance,” “polyglot’s phrasebook dog-ear”—precise, never purple.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; rhythm breathes with scene. Metaphors are coherent—lamps as faltering heart, chalk as syllables—no mixed vehicles. Information-dense: one line can worldbuild, embody emotion, advance plot (“Fuel’s fine... but the light-feed runs on stories”). One minor scaffold: “like an old librarian clearing his throat” is vivid but slightly ornamental; could trim two words.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fusion of dead-language cartography and living starling murmuration feels fresh, not stitched. Hopscotch board as hidden star-chart reclaims child’s game into cosmic navigation. Premise commits fully: if stories fail, ship dies—no safety retreat. Risky compression of mythic and mechanical pays off; no close echoes of famous airship tales.</comment>
