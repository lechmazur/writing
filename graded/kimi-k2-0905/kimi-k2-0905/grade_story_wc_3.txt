<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mira’s kindly methodical nature is dramatized in every beat: adjusting spectacles before stepping onto a humming void, mapping Morse-like clangs to cuneiform, kneeling to plant the seed with iron filings that stick “like frost.” The contradiction between scholarly composure and grief-raw need is embodied, not labeled; her laughter at the equation “love over time is velocity” is an earned, visible cost that forecloses the path of pure observer and makes her the bridge. Interiority stays character-specific—no therapy-speak—and the final endurance (stepping onto the new plank) crystallizes her hierarchy of values: archive over safety, love over absence. One hairline slip: “haunted ambitions” is named by the narrator, not Mira, but the phrase is immediately re-translated into lived pattern, so the flaw never touches closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the mirrored sky becomes an hourglass neck and the new plank extends only after Mira inscribes the equation “love/time = home” on a magnetic leaf—an on-page act that reweights the entire physics of transition. Causal lattice holds throughout: because she translates the arbor’s clangs, the seed heats; therefore she hums the lullaby; therefore filings spell “return” and the silver filament climbs her wrist, each beat narrowing options until the only exit is forward onto the plank she creates. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“magnetic arbor…amber with the last light”) and the mirrored sky payoff waives any disorientation penalty. Persistent constraint: every departure demands an arrival somewhere else, a rule that charges the final image and prevents soft reset.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The magnetic arbor is not backdrop but tool: its iron leaves click translatable Morse, its rails supply the planting joint, its tilt reveals the mirrored sky that forces Mira to become the neck of the hourglass. Micro-setting (seed, stylus, wax tablet) constrains tactics—she can only plant where rails cross, can only write on the leaf within reach. Sensory hierarchy obeys her translator’s bias: sound (clang, lullaby) and tactile frost-like filings trump visual spectacle. Spatial choreography is flawless; the arbor’s sway is tracked across every beat and the new plank appears exactly where the obsidian bloom falls, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reestablish the severed archive of meaning—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when the seed refuses to sprout until a grammatically correct sentence is spoken aloud. The meaningful turn occurs at the midpoint: the filings’ micro-glyphs force her to voice “return/reside/release,” converting scholarly observation into embodied grammar that costs her observer distance. Price is visible—bloodless runes etched on skin, the arbor’s tilt, the obsidian bloom consumed to create the plank she must walk. Under causal lens, each escalation is driven by her translating acts; no coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme—“the departed become the grammar of the living”—emerges solely through images: cuneiform letters floating like plankton inside the transparent seed, the silver filament writing “door/breath/balance” on her skin, the equation “love divided by time” that equals velocity and therefore home. No explicit moral is stated; the final plank extending toward unnamed horizons is the non-literal answer. Subtext operates in silence: the lullaby measures wind shear the way lullabies measure fear, compressing maternal absence into phonemes she can step through. Complexity is preserved—haunted ambitions are neither condemned nor redeemed, only re-translated into traversable bridge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric-scientific, echoing a cuneiform translator’s precision: “wedge-shaped sign for sky,” “3-millennium-old tablets,” “phoneme she had translated.” Syntax mirrors the act of carving—compact, paratactic, with clause-chinks that feel incised. Rhythm accelerates under pressure: the moment the silver filament climbs, sentences shorten to kernel clauses, then lengthen again as the bloom folds into obsidian. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains Mira’s throughout—she hears almost-morse, sees analogues, counts intervals. Register never drifts into corporate or therapeutic diction; even “physics of transition” is immediately grounded in her stylus etching an equation on a leaf.</comment>

<comment>Read-aloud ear is excellent: varying sentence lengths, no template cadence, and a strategic breath before the final plank. Information density is high—one sentence often does three jobs (e.g., “She knelt, pressed the seed into a joint where two magnetic rails crossed, and covered it with iron filings that stuck like frost” advances action, setting, and simile). Figurative language is sparse and precise; no mixed metaphors. Minor scaffold: “like a slowed heart” and “like frost” are conventional similes, but they occur early before pressure peaks and do not dull the closure image. No loops, no synonym churn, no filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<comment>Fresh synthesis: cuneiform philology + magnetic arbor horticulture + grief physics creates a world where grammar is literally planted and grown. The “knowledge fruit seed” trope is transformed into a philological graft—sprouts only when fed a translated sentence, blooms into an eye whose pupil is the archive. Risk: the mirrored-sky hourglass could read as gimmick, but it is causally seeded by the symmetry rule announced mid-story, so it feels inevitable. Emotional specificity—mother vanished while calibrating wind shear—prevents abstract allegory; the final equation “love over time is velocity” is a private code only this narrator could discover.</comment>
