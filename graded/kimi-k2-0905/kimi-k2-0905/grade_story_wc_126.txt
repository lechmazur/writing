<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority—her acoustical parsing of drips as minor sevenths, her refusal to finish phrases—gives a sharp, embodied through-line. The bowl-as-resonator beat crystallizes her heritage and present aim in one micro-choice. No contradictory impulses collide in-scene, so the internal-conflict bullet is only partially met, and the cost is more conceptual than visceral, keeping her just shy of 8.8+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each unfinished note thickens the pattern until the final Charged Poise reweights silence as invitation. Orientation is swift (“ash-slick mud”, “half-submerged schooners”) and the disorientation of a flooded greenhouse is taught early, paid off in the closing image of music that will not close. Closure arrives with unmistakable conceptual cost: the seedling’s green question against copper light reconfigures the family rule (“no bonfire, no crowd”). Persistent constraint—the bowl’s cracked bottom—literally shapes the resonator that enables the final sound.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The greenhouse–shipwreck microcosm is tactile, olfactory, sonic; condensation pings off broken panes and ship bells answer as percussion. Every descriptive swipe either limits movement (ash-slick footing) or gifts material (frayed rigging wire becomes bridge). The seedling unfurling against copper dawn is the charged final image that reweights all prior ruin. Only the durian/orchid name-drops feel slightly tourist-catalogue, not choice-shaping, preventing 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“beauty in the unfinished”—is clear from the first withheld harmonic. Escalation is accretive: each truncated phrase tightens the chronic hush until the hush itself becomes unbearable invitation. The persistent constraint (bowl crack, soil in a mendicant vessel) visibly shapes the tactic of wire-bridge creation. Cost is conceptual (abandoning the bowl, leaving the music forever open) rather than felt bodily, capping just below 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through recursive acts of refusal: composer, grandmother, violinist all resist closure; story ends by celebrating that refusal. No explicit thesis is stated; the final image (“green as a new question”) repurposes ash and copper into possibility. Subtext lives in gesture—bow lifted, bowl left humming—rather than explanation. The concept stays complex: silence is neither defeat nor transcendence but ongoing invitation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays pinned to Mara’s acoustical synesthesia: every sound is pitch, interval, timbre. Syntax lengthens and contracts like breath during bow strokes; fragments (“unfinished, the way…”) mirror musical suspension. No dialogue, so voice purity is high. Diction never drifts above Mara’s plausible lexicon; “minor seventh” is professional jargon she would own.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet breatheable: “soot-streaked but intact” does three jobs in four words. Metaphors stay physical—masts “leaning like tired listeners”—never mixing vehicles. Occasional elevated flourish (“chronic hush of something forever unsaid”) borders purple but is earned by repetition that reframes the hush as instrument. No loops or paraphrase detected; rhythm modulates with bow pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The submerged orchard greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks is a singular synthesis; nothing in recent literary inventory equals it. Turning a beggar’s bowl into a resonator literalizes “what feeds you must survive the fire” without preaching. Risk—entire plot hangs on uncompleted phrases—pays off because pattern is taught in first paragraph and crystallizes in final image. Specificity of charred mango pits, durian roots, and copper sky anchors the surreal frame in tactile reality.</comment>
