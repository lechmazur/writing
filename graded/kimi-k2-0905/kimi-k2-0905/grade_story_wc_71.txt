<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s vocation is dramatized through concrete micro-choices—pressing the orris shard, collecting un-missed fragments, kneeling to the compass—each exposing her hierarchy of values under pressure. Interiority remains sensorial (“violet scent grounding her”) rather than diagnostic, and her final refusal to take the needle shows credible renunciation with cost. The only minor drag is the late label “keeper of the almost-unseen,” a touch explanatory, but it lands outside the closure beat and does not undercut the earned stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the compass stills, houses sigh, streetlights blink off—an undeniable before/after charged with conceptual cost (some absences, once named, need no filling). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout: each fragment, scent puff, and wallpaper curl thickens the pattern until the cadence itself tightens. Causality remains internal yet legible—because she assembles the grammar of displacement, the world re-balances—so the ending feels earned, not explained.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The bay, the sodium dawn, the net-drying shack, and the salt-cedar crawlspace are all tactile, POV-filtered, and return to constrain motion (the spiral floorboards literally guide her downward). Orris scent functions as micro-setting, charging every beat and the final flare. No orientation debt; anchors arrive by line 3 and geography remains stable. Environment and recurring object jointly charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—restore the houses’ heartbeat—tightens through density, not combat: each new fragment collected thickens the risk that “unacknowledged cavities widen into living absences.” The midpoint compass discovery delivers the required intensification; agency remains hers (she kneels, crushes, releases). Cost is atmospheric yet legible—she pockets only empty tissue, accepting perpetual vigilance—qualifying as felt price under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges entirely through particulars: houses speak via creaks, scent, and absent lamps; “sanctify the hush” is never moralized, only enacted. The final image of dark streetlights that “seemed to nod” reweights the whole premise—homeostasis requires witness, not repair—achieving Conceptual Repricing without a sermon. Complexity lingers: some absences stay empty, some peace is borrowed, reader left listening.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Elara’s perceptual signature—every noun choice (“sodium glow thinning against the dawn like memory against bone”) is filtered through her synesthetic gift. Rhythm modulates: longer hypnotic sentences for drift, abrupt fragments when compass spins. No head-hopping, no filter-verb clutter. Compression (“she began collecting fragments…”) is taught early and paid off at the violet flare, satisfying experimental tolerance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each image advances atmosphere or stakes. One minor paraphrase loop—“houses remember louder than the people” echoed by “she understood that displaced objects…leave cavities”—but the rephrasing adds conceptual depth, not filler. Mixed metaphors are controlled (“salt and cedar blood” reads as sensory synesthesia). No artifacts intrude on closure; final paragraph breathes cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The conceit—“architectural homeostasis via displaced bric-a-brac”—feels freshly non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Orris root as both scent and sacrament, compass missing its needle yet spinning, streetlights dreaming in Morse: these are not quirky ornaments but integrated engines of meaning. Risk—lyric accumulation instead of plot reversals—heightens coherence and pays off in the hushed blaze image. Specificity throughout prevents template drift.</comment>
