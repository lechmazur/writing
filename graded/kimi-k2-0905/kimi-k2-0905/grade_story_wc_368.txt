<comment>Hoshiko’s interiority is textured—dye-master perception, pulse-borne memories, porous self-concept—but her choices are observational rather than decisive. The climactic “new purpose” is asserted, not dramatized; no visible cost or irrevocable renunciation charges the turn. Still, the quiet-explosive heart creates a credible, embodied contradiction that sustains interest.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Closure lands with Conceptual Repricing: the collector’s theory is re-weighted into Hoshiko’s stance of self-erasure as teaching method, felt cost in “ready to disappear.” Drive lens = Accumulative/Textural; pattern of iridescent images thickens until meaning tilts at the final fold. Causality holds; no orientation debt.</comment>

<comment>Floating tea-house, silk tethers, valley-mist, and morpho-scale light are economically interleaved with action; environment literally lifts and lowers the scene. Micro-setting (wing, tea vapour) constrains the brush-stroke discovery and charges the final map-image. Slight over-reliance on visual shimmer keeps it from top band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—how stories choose vessels—tightens through accumulative pattern rather than causal reversal. Single meaningful deepening: wing dissolution into painted map forecloses collector’s ownership and opens porous pedagogy. Cost is conceptual, visible in final fold; could use one earlier tactical forfeiture for 8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: stories live through disappearance of teller, dye-like absorption not possession. Subtext resides in vapor dragons and downward trees—images that re-weight at closure without sermon. Resists tidy moral; resonance lingers in “light through stained glass” silence. One near-label line (“why some people magnetize stories”) barely audible.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate maintains stable distance; perceptual signature is color-saturated, silk-and-pigment minded. Rhythm modulates: long breathy sentences for mist, clipped fragments for pulse beats. No head-hop, no filter-verb clutter. Lyric compression is pattern-taught early and paid off in final dissolve image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>High information density: each sentence layers dye lore, memory fragment, sensory trace. Occasional metaphor stacks (“quietly explosive sparks beneath ribs,” “valley-mist wonder thickening around her”) flirt with purple but stay legible and thematically apt. Zero loops or paraphrase. Final third clean—9+ globally still allowed.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses donor-heart memory transfer with story-magnetism theory; fresh yet emotionally grounded. Specificity of dye craft and butterfly-scale cartography transforms abstract concept into tactile ritual. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off at closure. Minor echo of “stories are living things” trope, but re-cast through pigment metaphors.</comment>
