<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s insomnia, painter’s eye, and compulsive outreach to erased languages are vivid, embodied, and drive every micro-choice; the moment she cedes agency to the brush her interiority stays coherent and the final exhaustion is earned. Secondary pressure from Jules lands as credible witness rather than relational crucible, so the highest 9+ band remains just out of reach.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each indigo glyph thickens air until greenhouse becomes a municipal lung; closure is a Charged Poise—the moon sets, bristles dim, and the cost is the now-unavoidable dispersal of lost words into strangers, a social price felt in the hush that follows sirens. Orientation is anchored by line 3, transitions are legible, no prop or image resets.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Rooftop greenhouse, smog below, moon above are filtered through Mira’s sleeved painter’s gaze; every sensory pick—saffron quiet, turmeric dust, orchids opening off-season—constrains her next stroke and charges the final exhalation into the city. The mirror, brush, and indigo saucer operate as micro-setting that literally steers the mural’s creation, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—deliver lost kindness-voices before dawn—tightens as each glyph consumes her stamina and the moon’s angle; the orchids blooming out-of-season visualize escalating biological cost. One meaningful deepening suffices: the mural’s purpose flips from private canvas to public lung, foreclosing retreat. Cost is legible but modest; the price is mostly prospective (future exhaustion of the neighborhood’s empathy) rather than immediate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of erased kindness re-seeding the city emerges solely through image and gesture—marigolds on wipers, coins passed on buses—never moralized. The final “remember me kindly” glyph reweights every prior stroke as social inhalation rather than personal art, delivering resonant ambiguity without sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Mira’s perceptual bandwidth: syntax lengthens under moon-drunk rhythm, contracts when brush moves “without her.” No head-hopping; Jules’s interiority is inferred only through Mira’s sight of his pupils, preserving distance. Diction—“pollen,” “abolished tongue,” “saffron quiet”—is painter-specific and patterned from first paragraph to last line.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in cadence to mirror breath and brush-stroke tempo; no scaffold loops or mixed metaphors. Information density is high—one sentence can layer scent, history, and tactile motion. The final “green prints on the pavement” condenses motif and consequence into one image, fulfilling read-aloud ear test.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fusing insomnia, moon-lit calligraphy, and municipal empathy dispersion is a fresh synthesis; the inversion of mural-from-wall to mural-from-air feels inevitable only after the greenhouse lung epiphany. Risk—lyric escalation without physical antagonist—pays off via accumulative breath-image that would collapse if any element were swapped.</comment>
