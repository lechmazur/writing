<comment>The interiority is searingly concrete—each plant mapped to a bodily hollow, resin pressed into scars—so grief is felt as corporeal geography. Micro-choices (snapping sea-lavender, pressing photo to bark) externalize the survivor’s guilt without therapy-speak; the final covenant to “live as the trees live” is earned because every somatic anchor has been dramatized. The only flaw is a hairline slide toward poetic label (“quietly talented”) used twice; it slightly abstracts what the body has already made brutally specific.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the ripped-away photo and resin-sealed after-image crystallize the before/after without tidy uplift. Causality is lyric-accumulative—each scent-anchored freeze deepens the survivor’s stance—so the final relinquishment feels inevitable. Cost is undeniable: the photograph’s destruction is the price of trading memory-for-resin, and the reader feels the exact moment optimism is re-priced. No orientation debt; spatial anchors (cliff path, railing, pine trunk) remain legible throughout.</comment>

<comment>Dragon’s-blood pine resin that seals the photo is the micro-setting that literally bonds memory to living tissue, constraining the final choice to remain on the cliff. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven: salt-eucalyp-tears layered in three-second anchors mirror the narrowing of breath under grief. Weather and tide are not backdrop but countdown—the wind “tearing paper” cues the moment the photo is surrendered. One minor over-lyric—“ancient patience” skirts cliché—else everything is tactile.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake is the impossibility of anchoring optimism without severing memory; each freeze-beats tightens the vise between them. Escalation is textural: the photograph degrades from intact image to white creases to airborne shard, mapping the survivor’s rising willingness to relinquish. The third freeze (resin smear) is the visible price—options narrow to either seal the memory or lose it entirely. Coincidence is absent; pressure is purely the protagonist’s invention and endurance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the inverse of the prompt’s binary: optimism is not the opposite of realism but its residue when memory is metabolized into organism. Subtext lives in gesture—photo transferred to bark = survivor grafting grief onto a living host that will outlast her. The pearl image migrates from Nadia’s laughter to resin-encased stillness, re-weighting “stillness” from stasis to survival. No moralizing; the final covenant is image-only, leaving an ache that lingers past the page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>First-person texture is unmistakable: botanical Latinate diction (“Arbutus unedo”) sits inside colloquial grief-slang (“clerical error I keep trying to correct”), creating a hybrid scientist-mourner idiom. Rhythm controlled under pressure: three-word anaphora (“three scents, three seconds, three somatic anchors”) mirrors the freeze-tactic without drum-beat monotony. No filter-verb glut; perception is direct: “wind combs the cliff.” Compression taught early (“crumpled photograph like a ticket”) stays legible to the end. Voice never flirts with editorial omniscience.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Sentence openings vary from participial to noun-driven to fragment (“Tomorrow the resin will set…”) without algorithmic pattern. Metaphors are bone-clean: drone as “distant heron,” blast as “red chrysanthemum”—each single, coherent vehicle. No scaffold loops; every clause advances either sensory anchor or interior shift. Final line ends on monosyllabic cadence—“arithmetic of continuation”—that lands like a pulse restart, ear-tested and echo-free.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The somatic-botanical grief-map feels fresh; no prior story marries eucalyptus-scar to ribcage. Risk is lyric stillness over dramatic turn, yet it pays off because the resin-seal literalizes memory into organism. One derivative echo—“grief is not a landmine but a coastline” revisits the familiar grief-as-geography trope, slightly lowering inevitability. Still, the specific fusion of drone-strike survivor with arboretum stewardship is non-obvious and memorable.</comment>
