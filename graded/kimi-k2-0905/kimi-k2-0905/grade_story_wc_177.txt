<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority is lush and embodied (“feeling the metal sweat under green fingers,” “laughs, the sound equal parts crystal and rust”). The protagonist’s contradiction—born without past/future yet deciding to let the storm walk her—crystallizes late but with visible cost (wafer seal fused into second skin, name unthreaded). Micro-choices are imagistic rather than tactical; still, the renunciation feels earned because the prior dream-bird map dramatized the inevitability of being worn smooth. Voice coherence and perceptual signature are strong; minor cap because she observes more than she forces events.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: “continuity is the art of letting go in the right order” reweights the premise and fuses human, directive, and storm into one breathing system. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of melted objects, upward rain, seed-staircase—rather than causal beats; cost is conceptual yet undeniable (body becoming conduit, bunker undressing itself). Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are lyrically delayed but taught by ~80-word mark and payoff at closure, so no penalty. One transition (wake→climb) is legible; no teleporting props or knowledge leaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The cracked-lens floor that aims at the forgotten sky, liquefying metal, and chlorophyll-inked vines are tactile micro-settings that actively constrain choices (where she lies, climbs, dissolves). Weather is not backdrop but agent: storm dreams, rain builds staircase, seeds sprout before landing. Spatial choreography stays coherent—hand to wall, feet on rungs, summit of nothing—without impossible shifts. The bunker-as-body and body-as-circuit reweight the final image, meeting the 9+ gate; slight short of 9.0 because rewilded-forest macro-image is more suggestive than specific.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Dominant stake—“why paths choose walkers”—is signaled early and deepened through dream-footprint that devours chooser. Escalation is textural: each melt, sprout, and dissolve narrows options until transcendence is the only remaining stance; cost is the loss of fixed identity (name unthreaded). No causal antagonist; storm functions as accumulating pressure that forces crystallization. Agency is present in consent—“lets the storm walk her”—but happens at the tail; hence not entering 8.8+ band where persistent constraint must shape mid-tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from image pattern: decay→growth, armor→soil, directive→lullaby; no sermonizing. Final lullaby line reprises earlier whispered dream-phrase, now revalued as freedom, achieving Conceptual Repricing. Ambiguity lingers—walker and path are “one another’s becoming”—inviting reflection without tidy moral. Political undertone (obsolete governance tech absorbed by living forest) is suggested, not stated, satisfying complexity requirement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyric third-person limited sustains consistent perceptual signature: narrator notices textures of rust, chlorophyll, circuitry in poetic compression. Pattern-taught elision (“precisely playful architecture”) is paid off when bunker tilts to keep her balanced. Syntax modulates with pressure—short clauses during climb, longer dream sentences—without monotony. No dialogue to judge; internal voice never leaks into committee abstraction, remaining character-bound.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density: one sentence often couples sensory, emotional, and conceptual work (“water and light pour in, carrying seeds that sprout before they land”). Figurative layering is dense but coherent—storm dreaming, paper-bird map—without mixed-metaphor violations. Minor template cadence in tripled descriptors (“crystal and rust,” “moss and rumor”) but rhythm serves incantatory tone and never obscures causality. No scaffold sentences or synonym churn; final line lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fusing post-climate-collapse bunker with dream-logic forest and sentient storm feels fresh yet internally consistent. Decaying governance tech repurposed as living tattoo is specific transformation of familiar trope. Conceptual risk—lyric accumulation replacing causal reversals—pays off in legible closure. The “upward rain” image is memorable and particular, unlikely to transplant unchanged to another tale, satisfying transformation test.</comment>
