<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s survivor-guilt and compulsion to “translate” are embodied through tactile micro-choices (striking forks, calibrating colors) that visibly cost her body heat and scanner battery. The final renunciation—leaving the frozen symphony behind—earns its sting because every prior fork-strike has literalized her grief. Interiority stays specific and sensorial; no label-speak intrudes at peak beats. The only bar to 9+ is that the emotional arc is almost too seamless—her flaws illuminate but never truly complicate the closing gesture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: silence is redefined as thermal music, paying off the “unfinished” premise with the scanner’s dead battery as felt cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each fork-strike thickens the heat-map until the dome weeps, a cadence shift that reweights the stake. Causality is clean—no teleporting props, every tool introduced is used or exhausted. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are present by line 3 and never break.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The conservatory’s frost, glass dust, and residual thermal ghosts constrain movement and supply the literal canvas for Mara’s notation. Body-as-setting counts: numb palms, fogged breath, and knee-bruises from striking forks limit how long she can play. Spatial choreography is immaculate—bench → stage → dome tracked without drift. The tuning-fork case evolves from flotation device to painter’s box, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove the world still speaks—tightens when each silent fork-strike forecloses the option of ever hearing sound again yet reveals new color-auras. Escalation is Accumulative: density of thermal instruments increases until the dome melts, a visible price. Scanner battery expiry is the irreversible cost that crystallizes her stance. No coincidence resolves; the melting is earned by cumulative heat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: translation is survival, art is measurement, silence is merely another frequency. The double image of frost as both seal and score sheet reconfigures meaning in the final paragraph. Subtext in the child’s treble-clef breath silently affirms Mara’s thesis. No moralizing line intrudes; resonance is purely imagistic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Mara’s perceptual filter—she notices glass dust, not architecture trivia. Syntax lengthens during the crescendo of forks, then shortens as battery dies, mirroring musical phrasing. No head-hopping or register drift; scientific terms (watertight, calibrating) remain within her professional lexicon. Distinct rhythmic control supports pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, emotion, or causation. Metaphors (brass rivers, string nebulae) extend the musical physics without contradiction. Read-aloud rhythm accelerates through the fork-scale run, then snaps into the single-sentence closure. No filter-verb clusters or purple overload; diction stays precise and concrete.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The heat-map notation system is a genuine conceptual leap: temperature replaces pitch, hue replaces timbre, turning a conservatory into a silent symphony. Risk—using a scientific gadget as poetic engine—pays off because the scanner’s battery failure provides concrete cost. The premise synthesizes maritime disaster, acoustic sci-fi, and lyric elegy into an inevitable whole. Freshness survives the transformation test: swap any detail and the entire fabric unravels.</comment>
