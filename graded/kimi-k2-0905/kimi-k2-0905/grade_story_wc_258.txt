<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied—ink-stained soles picking up foil flecks is a perfect micro-choice. The inherited-mystery drive gives her a credible, non-therapeutic lens on her own obsession. No second character on the page, so relationship crucible is N/A; her sole contradiction—needing to know yet sealing the map—lands as Earned Stasis with visible cost (the tin, the footprints, empty pockets). The only bar to 9+ is that the final renunciation is more gestural than viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the grid reveals infinite regression of exits, foreclosing the fantasy of a single escape. Causal chain holds—each card assignment and tape-snap tightens the lattice until the sigil repeats. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“rain-beaded skylight loft”). One minor causality bump: “she realized the map was complete” is slightly declarative; still, the persistent constraint (footprints as data, tin as seal) keeps the lens intact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The loft, skylight, and measuring tape function as micro-setting that literally constrains every tactical move—grid lines dictate where she steps. Rain droplets become barometric data, streetlights project upside-down tickers; environment is inseparable from method. No spatial drift; body, cards, tape, and footprints track cleanly. Tool-as-setting easily passes the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“map cultural patterns before the last witnesses forget”—is signaled early and tightens through each vector assignment. One meaningful deepening: the fractal sigil of leveraged debt appears at the intersection, foreclosing the hope of external rescue. Cost is legible: she seals the map and walks away broke, footprints literally spent as data. Pressure is accumulative/textural; a second reversal isn’t needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the recursive image of leveraged hope; no explicit thesis is stated. The final image of footprints-as-currency reweights the entire premise without moralizing. Ambiguity is productive: the map is both escape route and trap. One tiny echo of “pattern” in the last paragraph keeps it from 9+ purity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly fused to the cartomancer’s perceptual signature—midnight ink, bite-scarred tape, coin-like rain. Syntax lengthens and compresses with the grid-work rhythm; no head-hopping. Register never drifts into academic meta-talk; even “Cartesian quadrants” is justified by her art-installation past. A single filter verb cluster (“she realized”) is the only bar to 9+.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and concept without scaffold. Metaphors stay coherent—tarot as circuit diagram, footprints as data points. One paraphrase loop (“multiply paths” repeated twice in closing paragraph) nicks perfection. Otherwise zero loops, no mixed vehicles, strong verbs throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Synthesis of tarot, crypto-collapse, and Cartesian mapping feels inevitable and fresh; no template echo. Risk—turning a spread into a floor-sized circuit—pays off by making the final fractal sigil visually undeniable. Transformation test fails if you swap names; the ink, tape, and footprints are irreplaceable. Minor novelty bump for the upside-down streetlight camera obscura.</comment>
