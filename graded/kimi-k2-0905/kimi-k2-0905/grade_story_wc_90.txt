<comment>Halcyon’s interiority is lyrically dense yet character-specific; her contradictory impulse—to hoard ghosts yet refuse their despair—drives every beat. The gravitational mood/hull linkage makes her happiness a physical lever, turning emotion into ship mechanics without therapy-speak. Micro-choices (knotting hair-filament, releasing the sail) externalize pacifist creed under rising cost. Final renunciation to stay in the archive lands as earned stasis: she pays with eternal solitude, foreclosing return.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/textural lens: each photograph stitched adds emotional mass until the sail becomes a counterweight to genocide. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—she crosses into the mercy-dimension, ship-root blooming—cost is the irreversible vacuum-seal behind her. Pattern taught early (gravity = emotion), paid off when joy literally lifts the hull through the bruise. No causality breaks; every surreal mechanic is anchored to Halcyon’s tactile acts.</comment>

<comment>Recycled hull as micro-setting constrains choice: only salvaged jade, hair-filament, and ghost-photos can be used. Spatial choreography clean—deck plates, engine shrine, hatch vacuum—bodies track believably. Sensory hierarchy skews visual–tactile, justified by a pacifist who touches rather than weaponizes. Final blooming vines re-use the hull’s metal as soil, re-charging the opening image of stitched scars.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: can one pacifist outweigh ten billion deaths with joy? Pressure tightens as each photo adds mass; the sail must counterbalance genocide or vacuum will swallow her. One meaningful deepening: the bruise corridor forces her to fuse personal sorrow with Kwan Yin’s tear—no retreat. Cost is legible: she forfeits the living world to tend never-born moments.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from reversal: extinction archive becomes genesis garden. Shadow work is enacted, not labeled—grief is materialized, stitched, sailed. Final image reframes human legacy from bomb to lantern without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: is mercy dimension a heaven or a museum? Complexity preserved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains liturgical cadence that modulates with emotional gravity—short clauses when hatch threatens, elongated ribbons during sail release. Perceptual signature: Halcyon notices textures (jade warmth, filament bite) over geography. No head-hopping; hologram mothers remain external chorus. Register stays within pacifist-nun lexicon—“gravitationally lighter,” “non-violence stronger than steel”—without creeping into academic diction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry triple duty: image + emotion + physics rule. No loops; each metaphor extends the maritime-gravity conceit. Rhythm breathes—paragraph lengths mirror sail unfurling. Only hairline slip: “bloomed with vines of light” edges toward purple, but bloom is literalized by ship-seed grammar established earlier.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Pacifist astrophysics—mood as thrust—is fresh synthesis. Photograph sail as emotional counterweight to genocide feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk of full lyric surrealism paid off by coherent closure under accumulative lens. Transformation test: swap jade tear or recycled hull and entire emotional calculus collapses.</comment>
