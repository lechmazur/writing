<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Milo’s color-blindness is dramatized through embodied searching for “impossible plumage,” and his later violent chromatic overload is a credible perceptual rupture. The interior contradiction—yearning for color yet recoiling from its violence—drives every micro-choice. Rosa’s “innocently cunning” trait is shown, not labeled, when she palms the marble eye and tucks the reed behind her ear; the trade costs her the reed’s song and costs Milo his monochrome safety. Earned stasis lands when he renounces painting for arranging, the marble eye returned, its starlight dimmed yet lesson permanent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens: each shard adds density until the final spiral reweights the premise. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—“we are most alive where we are broken”—with conceptual cost legible in the deliberate smashing and planting of broken song. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“glassblower's courtyard tiles”), pattern taught early and paid off in the final colored-rain image. No causal gaps; every rearrangement is a because/therefore response under the barter custom.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The courtyard functions as micro-setting: discarded plants, salt circles, and kiln heat constrain every arrangement and exchange. Heat-warped reed and starlit marble are handled on the page, their changing states altering later tactics. Final image of morning glories growing through the reed’s hollow center literally charges the setting with the story’s thesis. Spatial choreography is clean—bodies, shards, and ash tracked across the spiral—no floating props.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—find beauty without color—tightens when the marble eye forces Milo to confront chromatic violence. One meaningful deepening: the smash/arrange spiral narrows options from representation to relic-ritual. Cost is visible in burnt hands, returned eye, and renounced painting. Escalation is textural: each dawn rearrangement increases density until the spiral crystallizes stance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: ash, salt, reed, marble—never abstract lecture. Final image of colored rain reweights the premise without moralizing. “We trade our wounds not to heal them but to teach them new languages” is earned through the barter ritual, not tacked-on thesis. Ambiguity lingers: the travelers’ future interpretations remain open, resisting tidy closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is consistent: Milo’s synesthetic metaphors (“hues screaming against each other”) stay within his painterly lexicon. Rosa’s voice is rough-breathed, furnace-scarred; her silence behind the welding mask carries subtext. No head-hopping; focalization remains anchored to Milo’s sensorium until the final we-stance. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for chromatic overload, staccato shards for deliberate smashing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>High information density: “warpta silver curl that sang when the wind passed through it” does triple sensory job. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors are coherent—glass dust as colored rain—without mixed-logic violations. Final-line cadence reprises “broken things sing louder” with ear-tested echo, no scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: color-blindness + phoenix ash + bartered failures + plant semaphores = non-obvious allegory. Risky smash/arrange ritual is executed without gimmickry; the spiral garden feels inevitable. Reed-as-plant-pot-instrument is a specific invention that would break if swapped. Emotional specificity trumps surface novelty: the violence of seeing is a human insight, not clever twist.</comment>
