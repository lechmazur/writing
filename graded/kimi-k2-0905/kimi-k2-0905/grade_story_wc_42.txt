<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is sensorily embodied (“luminous ache through cracked glass,” “blurred brass moth”); her micro-choice to aim the Hasselblad inward crystallizes her renunciation with felt cost. The contradiction between fixing machines and accepting their collapse stays active in-scene, not abstract. Flaw: “escape velocity became a lullaby” drifts toward poetic label-speak; still, the final smile shows earned stasis. No orientation or causality break, so no cap.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each image (leaf, spinning hand, folding observatory) layers density until the shutter click restructures time itself. Closure—station collapses into the single exposed frame—pays off the camera-as-darkroom metaphor with undeniable conceptual cost. Causality is lyric, not linear, but the pattern is taught early and lands cleanly. Cost is visible: “the photograph now contained every future the station would never reach.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The Hasselblad, lunar dust lubricant, and viewport leaf act as micro-settings that constrain choice: only inward-facing lens can capture the implosion. Spatial choreography stays clean: corridor curve, airlock cycle, shuttle mirrors track consistently. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—Mira notices glass cracks, not star charts. Setting charges the final image: observatory folds into its own photograph, making environment the stakes. No orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—choose to fix the station or freeze its death in silver—tightens when the clock hand accelerates and the floor thrums. Escalation is textural: each spectrograph peel adds density until the inward shutter click forecloses repair. Visible price: Mira forfeits 30 years of orbit for a single static frame. Agency is renunciation, not confrontation, fitting lyric lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of camera logic: to develop starlight you must first expose your own leaving. The leaf motif reweights from impossible anomaly to the sound that guides her countdown, charging closure. No moralizing; final smile is image, not thesis. Ephemeral is harnessed only by being let go—conceptual repricing with felt cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is perceptually signature: “luminous ache,” “brass blur counting possibilities” compress tech and yearning into coinage. Rhythm accelerates with sentence fragments under seismic thrumming, then exhales into long glide of shuttle lift. No head-hopping; POV stays inside Mira’s gloved thumb on lens. Diction stays within her repairer lexicon—dust lubricant, film bay, shutter guillotine—no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Density is high: one sentence often does three jobs (“the leaf touched the viewport glass, impossibly gentle, and dissolved into a sound”). No synonym loops or template cadence; each metaphor is physically coherent. Minor overwriting in “escape velocity became a lullaby” but it lands inside lyric pattern taught early. Final line varies rhythm, releases ache into quiet whir—ear test passes.</comment>

<comment>Premise—lunar observatory as darkroom developing its own demise—is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risk of collapsed linear time pays off without gimmickry; metaphor engine stays internally consistent. Specific detail (lunar dust for lubricant) prevents abstraction. Fresh synthesis of photography, orbital decay, and memory lets trope feel newly invented.</comment>
