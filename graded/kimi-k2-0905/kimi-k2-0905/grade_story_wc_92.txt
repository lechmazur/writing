<comment>Garnet’s interior contradiction—obedience versus invention—animates every beat; the graphite quill is handled twice with escalating risk, showing value hierarchy under pressure. However, the moment she “lets the mask fall” is reported, not dramatized, so the cost is felt only at narrative remove, not in embodied choice.</comment>

<comment>Causal chain holds: blackout → conspirators → graphite breach → aether seed → chain-room echo → drifting barges. The blackout’s reversal into beacon supplies a clean Decisive Change with visible social cost (fort “unlocked in every sense”). Minor causal fuzz: relay timing between sundial shadow and actual slackening is asserted, not shown.</comment>

<comment>Iron postern, murdered torch bracket, copper-coil heart—each object is tactile and stakes-bearing; the fort’s anatomy guides lock-picking routes and valve access. Twilight blackout narrows perception to silhouettes and hush, mirroring conspirators’ secrecy while providing cover. Final image of “gates yawning toward a horizon no longer rented” reweights the entire luminous fort as liberated political space.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“silent revolution before dawn”—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when Voss nearly catches the seed of light. The meaningful turn is Garnet’s false-report micro-choice that actually arms Luce downstream; cost is legible (her heartbeat, expelled mask). Escalation is single-cycle but sufficient for 700-word scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of reclaimed light versus ministry ink emerges through shifting valence of sparks: from rebel talisman to caged star to collective beacon. Final line “we write tomorrow with light” reprises ink/light duality without moralizing, achieving Conceptual Repricing. Subtext in Luce’s raised quill-holder-as-candle silently claims authorship of the new hour.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person tight stays welded to Garnet’s sensorium—cool iron on cheek, cradle of sparks inside ribs. Lexicon is steampunk-precise yet metaphorically lush (“sky-barges drift like startled swans”). No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent—she gauges threat by sound and temperature, narrates gears as lover’s exhale.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from compressed s-accusatives to elongated semicolon chains, tracking breathless hush. No template cadences; “murdered torch bracket” and “bruised violet” are fresh. One mixed metaphor—“voices were thin kites snagging on surprise”—momentarily muddles acoustic with aerodynamic image, but does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Victorian-steampunk revolution tales are common, yet the blackout-as-ink-eraser angle feels freshly inverted. Cradle-of-sparks metaphor evolves from personal talisman to civic ignition, making the familiar new. Specificity of threaded quill-holder-spanner and coded sundial angles pushes concept beyond trope collage.</comment>
