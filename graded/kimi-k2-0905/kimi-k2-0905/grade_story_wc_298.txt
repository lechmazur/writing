<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Lira’s “fiercely gentle” trait is embodied in her tactile apology to bones and her risky barter; the narrator’s surrender of the humming memory is motivated by wartime guilt and the explicit threat of widening soul-holes. Interior contradiction is present—he trades his only untouched memory yet immediately regrets the cost he sees Lira pay. However, the narrator’s pre-war self is sketched only through that one hum; we lack texture of how that loss alters his daily perception beyond “cool silence.” The earned cost is visible, but character depth is squeezed by word count, capping emotional granularity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the sprout’s hum reweights meaning and shows the orchard keeps an unbalanced ledger—conceptual cost is legible. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of traded memories and glowing fruit tightens stakes without causal reversals, acceptable under that lens. Orientation is clear within 120 words; catacomb orchard, two characters, night corridor are anchored. One causal bobble: “roots tightening like wires ready to trammel ankles” reads as threat, yet never activates; still, the image feeds atmosphere more than plot, so no break.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is continuously handled—skull-cradled trunk, gatekeeper’s skull, sprouting tarot—each object constrains or enables the final barter. Sensory triage fits POV: damp earth, candle smoke, root wires mirror the narrator’s internal tension. Spatial choreography is clean; we track gate, hollow, corridor exits. Micro-setting (apple-seed-in-skull) functions as both tool and altar, directly charging the closure image; meets 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—erase trench faces—signaled early; pressure tightens when Lira demands the hum instead of sunrise memory, a mid-story deepening that raises personal cost. Protagonist agency is present in the surrender, but escalation is single-step; after the trade, tension plateaus into lyric exit rather than further reversals. Cost is felt—Lira’s collapse and the hum’s echo—yet orchard’s ledger remains abstract, blunting visceral price. Under Accumulative lens, one intensification suffices; still, a second constraining turn could sharpen 8+ entry.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges as “patches need gaps for light,” shown when the sprout emits the lost hum; no explicit sermon. The burned tarot and orchard return charged, reweighting earlier imagery. Complexity is honored: the orchard’s barter market is amoral, neither condemned nor romanticized. Final insight is earned through concrete sacrifice rather than abstraction, but the brevity keeps resonance just shy of 8+.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable; perceptual signature filters world through guilt-tinged synesthesia—coins through cloth, candles inside apples. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for awe, fragments under duress (“She sagged.”). Lyric compression is taught early (“Every scar is a door”) and paid off in final star-sprout. Occasional elevated diction (“incandescent,” “conceptual repricing”) nudges beyond soldier’s lexicon, but the poetic frame licenses it; voice remains coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and musical, rarely looping; only tiny scaffold—“bones that jutted between the apple roots” repeats root/bone pairing. Metaphors stay coherent: candles drowned in wax, snow covering footprints. One simultaneous participle hiccup: “I carried her past skulls wearing root crowns” misattributes skulls as wearers. High information load—each sentence layers sensory, emotional, symbolic—yet clarity holds; momentum breathes at gate exit. Artifact level blocks 9+ but not 8+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fusion of tarot, catacomb, and memory market feels fresh; revolutionary dumping ground history particularizes the orchard. Bartering destinies trope is refigured through tactile ritual—pressing card to bark, tearing along burn line—rather than abstract spell. Risky lyric structure holds under Accumulative lens and pays off in star-sprout image. Slight proximity to “souls as coins” trope is offset by specific sensory ledger; still, not wholly unprecedented, holding below 9.</comment>
