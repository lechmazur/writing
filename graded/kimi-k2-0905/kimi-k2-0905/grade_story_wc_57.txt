<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Ari’s interiority is richly embodied (“infinitely patient through forty winters”) and her micro-choice to crack the fulgurite seed on the dock plank is legible cost. The harbormaster is thin; he exists only as a bureaucratic foil, so relationship-as-crucible is absent. Because the decisive action is solitary, the arc still earns a credible renunciation, but secondary-character pressure is negligible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the green shoot through snow reweights heritage as living, not museum property. Causality holds: each knot decoded leads directly to the planting beat. The harbormaster’s lunge is coincidence, but it complicates rather than resolves, so lens integrity is intact. Cost is visible in the cracked bead and the outlaw departure—felt stakes scale to length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The golden dock, salt-creak planks, and fulgurite marline are tactile constraints that determine how Ari can plant; environment literally supports the shoot. Fog and whale-bone creaks narrow perception to hush and touch, mirroring secrecy. Micro-setting—the rope’s glass beads—functions as portable harbor moons, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; skiff exit is tracked.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save the storm-corn choreography—tightens when the last tide-scribe dies, visible by word 150. One meaningful escalation: the crown-in-reverse knot’s frost date reframes planting urgency. Agency drives the turn: Ari cracks the bead and plants outlaw seed; harbormaster threat complicates but does not save her. Cost is the confiscation risk and the irreversible destruction of the artifact seed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of heritage-as-living-seed emerges through the planting act, never sermonized. Subtext operates in gesture: warming the knot with breath signals reverence louder than exposition. Final shoot reconfigures meaning without moral tag. Ambiguity remains—harbor will decide shoot’s fate—inviting reflection beyond page.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is oceanic-philosophical, salted with kelp eyes and harbor moons; perceptual signature is distinct. Syntax flexes with pressure: long accumulative clauses build patience, then crack into single-word seed plant. No head-hop; distance stays tight inside Ari. Dialogue sparse but apt—“Heritage is a seed, not a glass case”—carries subtext without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose achieves lyric density without purple drift: “tiny sparks skated across its surface” does double sensory job. Rhythm modulates—sibilant hush matches fog, then hard crack of bead. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or causality. Metaphors stay internally consistent (whale-bone creak, harbor moons) and do not collide.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fulgurite-fused marline encoding seed-calendar is fresh synthesis of sailor lore and lightning glass. Secret weavers as tide-scribes particularizes maritime culture; not derivative trope. Risk taken in lyric accumulative structure pays off when shoot recharges every motif. Transformation test fails if relocated inland—specificity anchors originality.</comment>
