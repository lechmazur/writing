<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mireya’s interiority is fierce and specific—“throat full of salt,” “years rearrange inside me”—and every shell-scrawl she trades is a micro-choice that costs her a future she names. The contradiction between professional archivist and filial complicity is embodied in the cradle-drop and the oilskin wrap, not abstractly confessed. The closing decision to broadcast rather than bury is earned by the prior cascade of irreversible bodily inscriptions. Only the mother’s betrayal feels slightly under-dramatized on-page, a hairline nick that keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The lagoon’s rule-set is taught within the first 120 words and every subsequent image obeys it; the causal chain is “trade tomorrow → memory surfaces → body archives,” tightening until the final public reading makes the cost civic. Orientation is swift: who (Mireya), where (two cables above the erg), when (pre-sandstorm salvage) all land before word 100. The closure is a textbook Charged Poise: options crystallize—silence or broadcast—and the chosen path carries undeniable civic and bodily price. No lens ambiguity; the Accumulative/Textural drive holds from the first black-mirror wink to the burnt-ink sunset.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon is not mere backdrop; its glass-grain shackles and ink-petal pages physically constrain movement and archive the stakes. Zeppelin altitude and dune-sheet sigh are economical yet specific, anchoring the erg as both tomb and pulpit. Beach debris—urchin spines, kelp spiral—functions as micro-setting that encodes memory, directly shaping the parley mechanics. Missing the 9-band because the floating library itself is only glimpsed, never allowed to exert spatial pressure on the final act.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth vs. filial safety—is signaled the instant the lagoon spells her nickname. Escalation is accumulative: each shell-grammar configuration reweights the cost, trading away named future dates until the final page surfaces and forecloses silence. The visible price is literalized as ink poisoning risk and the civic spectacle she ignites. Under Accumulative lens, one deepening is sufficient; here every new page raises the public stakes, culminating in the loudhailer kerosene-drop.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of archive-as-burial into archive-as-kindling: the same ink that once condemned printers now rains down as unerasable speech. Subtext lives in the silence between diary fragment and broadcast—what mothers burn vs. what daughters shout. The final image of sunset pages the color of “burnt ink” reweights the earlier domestic arson into collective ignition. Avoids 9.0 only because the peace-accord cannons feel like a slightly convenient civic backdrop rather than a seeded irony.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is oceanic and forensic at once—“liquid night under day,” “grammar of shells and drift-bone”—with rhythmic control that accelerates under pressure. Compression is taught early (“retrocognitively trapped”) and paid off in the final “searing reverie.” No head-hopping; single POV stays locked to Mireya’s perceptual signature. A few cadenced triplets (“the love letters… that proved the Reformation was also a seduction”) flirt with template pattern but remain character-true.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Every sentence carries dual cargo: “sand closed over my ankles like shackles” both embodies and foreshadows. Zero paraphrase loops; information is dense yet breatheable. Metaphors stay physically coherent—ink petals, glass-grain—never mixing domains. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge the same combustible ink motif with flawless sonic snap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The retrocognitive lagoon as public-key cryptography for social memory is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis; no template plot carries this exact metaphoric tech. Tropes—lost diary, airborne archive, maternal betrayal—are re-forged through shell-grammar and bodily inscription so they feel inevitable. Risk of baroque overload is embraced and conquered: the speculative rule is taught immediately, then exploited for civic stakes. Final broadcast transforms personal shame into collective ignition, a reconfiguration that could not survive replacement with generic elements.</comment>
