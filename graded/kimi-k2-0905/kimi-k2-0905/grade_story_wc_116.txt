<comment>The keeper’s interiority is lyrically concrete—“regenerative silence pool beneath the stone like breath held too long” embodies her creed. The single contradiction—once trying to save a chronicle, watching it bleed into saplings—drives her lifetime renunciation; the cost is felt when she steps onto the mirror-water and becomes the next fold. No secondary character appears, so relationship/status bullets are N/A. The final renunciation is earned; memory flattening into library roots visibly costs her identity.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of folding/unfolding creases tightens through each reprise until the keeper herself is folded into the swan. Orientation is immediate—“obsidian refuge along the river”—and the swan’s final crack supplies decisive change with conceptual cost: she becomes silence. No causality breaks; ellipsis between swan-guides is justified by taught pattern. Closure is Charged Poise: the mirror-water bears weight without ripple, reweighting the premise that witness must become medium.</comment>

<comment>The library is not backdrop but agent: shelves fold into cranes, catalog drawers sigh, parchment regenerates into blankness. Micro-setting objects—origami swan, obsidian-scaled book—force the final choice. Sensory hierarchy obeys keeper’s vocation: ink scent, moss-laced parchment, candlelight shafts that never reach floor. Spatial choreography is crisp; the circular reading pit and mirror-water constrain the exact step that costs her corporeal form.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: witness without intervention. Escalation is textural—each swan-unfolding deepens the cost of witness until the only remaining intervention is to become the silence itself. One visible tightening: the war chronicle that bled saplings proves library refuses memory; thereafter she renounces saving. Final price is her erasure; tension shifts from “what will she save?” to “will she become the saved?”—a conceptual trade-off legible under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from iterative folds: preservation erases; witness consumes the witness. Subtext lives in gesture—swan cracking along river-damp creases silently repeats the keeper’s own future fracture. No moral stated; final image of next keeper cupping silence in palms reweights prior folds as inevitable cycle. Resonance is particular, not abstract: the black feather left behind is the price of every chronicle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person omniscient remains stable; perceptual signature is keeper’s ink-stained fingers, crease-reader’s precision. Diction is archaic-lyric—“catacombs of lost knowledge,” “moon-berries”—yet internally consistent. Rhythm swells then hushes to match her flattening: long anaphoric “across the drift” mirrors seasons passing; final clause fragments as she flattens. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets N/A. No head-hopping; library’s agency is externalized through her perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences layer ink, stone, breath, silence. Figurative language is patterned—folds, cracks, pools—paid off at closure. No mixed metaphors; “library breathed” extends prior vegetative imagery. Two minor template cadences—“across the drift of untold seasons” repeated—read as liturgical echo, justified by theme. No loops or scaffold obscure causality; mirror-water image is sharp.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Folding witness into paper swan is fresh synthesis of archival and origami tropes. Regenerative silence as living archive reverses usual “library preserves” axiom. Risk: lyric accumulation could feel repetitive, yet closure retroactively justifies iterations. Specificity of “disappearing juice of moon-berries” prevents generic fantasy glaze. Transformation test fails if keeper is swapped—her ink-stained crease-reading is irreplaceable.</comment>
