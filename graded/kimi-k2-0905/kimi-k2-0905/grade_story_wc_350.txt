<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mireya’s empathetic decisiveness is concrete and embodied in the sequence with the elevator and the languages she braids; her internal contradiction is quietly present (bridging vs. exhaustion). Her micro-choice to promise “restitution” to the elevator and the physical act of re-hanging the pine-cone weight visibly foreclose paths and carry cost (4:43 a.m. fatigue, metallic dust on apron). The only drawback is that the choral gift is asserted more than heard—no actual sung notes mid-scene—so the “harmonious” trait edges toward label. Still, the final palm-to-wall moment gives a believable Earned Stasis that re-balances tower, town and self.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal linkage is intact: broken weight → silent elevator → linguistic repair → restored song. The thirteen-chime “secret hour” sets who/where/when inside 40 words, so orientation debt is waived. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the wooden elevator-cuckoo spillage re-weights the entire night’s labor and makes the social cost (farmers never alone again) legible. The only reason this doesn’t crack 9.0 is mild causal softening: the elevator’s instant agreeability after one speech feels slightly convenient—no counter-pressure or partial failure beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The tower interior is tactile and specific—brass rings, language drawers, copper artery—each item later constrains action (she must pick, carry, speak). The fallen pine-cone weight functions as micro-setting that alters choreography on the catwalk. Spatial tracking is flawless: descent, maintenance alcove, speaking-tube, balcony, river pulse. Sensory hierarchy obeys crisis: metal taste, cedar vibration, dew prisms. Final image of “roadway of resonance” is earned because the setting’s acoustic anatomy was seeded early and charges the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restore the harvest signal—surfaces by line 4 and tightens with the literal ticking tower clock. One meaningful escalation: elevator demands “build me a bridge,” forcing Mireya to convert linguistic capital into social covenant; cost is her exhaustion and the town’s future vulnerability if she fails. Agency remains hers throughout; no coincidence resolves. Could edge higher if the elevator’s refusal risk had lasted longer, but for 700 words the single rise-and-release is proportionate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Theme of “bridges vs. silos” emerges solely through braided grammar and the final seed-spill image—no explicit sermon. The wheat tasting of “metronomes and lullabies” re-prices everyday bread with mechanical-musical memory, a clean CR. Ambiguity lingers: has she truly dissolved isolation or only postponed it? That un-answered edge keeps the score shy of 9.0 but secures strong resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Mireya’s perceptions without head-hop. Diction—“brass syllables,” “gritty vernacular part piston, part prairie wind”—is idiosyncratic yet readable. Rhythm swells and contracts with stair climbs and hush, mirroring choral dynamics. No dialogue to test differentiation, but internal voice coherence is exemplary; only minor filter verbs (“she understood”) keep it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentences perform double duty (information + image), vary in length, and avoid loops. Metaphors are mixed but deliberately cross-domain (“a bridge is a song you can walk across”) to serve the fusion theme, so no coherence break. Opening and closing lines are propulsive. One paraphrase loop inside “between iron and wood” / “between mechanical and human breath” costs −0.2; otherwise density is high and artifact-free.</comment>

<question>8</question><question>9.1</question>
<comment>The notion of a linguistic librarian who literally “braids” languages into social infrastructure is fresh and specific; no trope catalog matches it. The talking grain elevator subverts pastoral nostalgia yet roots its voice in prairie wind + piston grit, transforming locale into character. Final image of wheat kernels reflecting Morse gratitude is unforeseeable yet inevitable in hindsight. Risk—the thirteen chime, language drawers, singing automaton—heightens stakes without clutter. Slight sentimental tilt at “no farmer would stand alone” is the only familiar note, else it would breach 9.5.</comment>
