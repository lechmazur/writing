<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Kael’s interiority—anchored in the tactile memory of the brass pull and his winter moon-charting—shows contradictions (duty vs. guilt) that tighten on the parapet. His micro-choice to hand Seris the gloves, then the pull, crystallizes a hierarchy of values (restoration > victory). The moment he hums the lullaby, borrowing a tune from a smuggled letter, embodies embodied, cost-carrying empathy. Closure: he descends palms-empty, weight transmuted under ribs—earned renunciation with felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: every beat (“because” the moon is waxing crescent, “therefore” wind & mist erase cannon-line-of-sight) tightens options. Orientation taught by line 3 (who=negotiator, where=Greyreach parapet, when=hostage-exchange dawn). Decisive Change: parchment dissolves, rope cast, Kael remains—cost is the physical absence of the pull + the audible absence of splash. Conceptual cost: two coastlines now aim “no longer at each other’s memories”—reweighted reality legible in final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Parapet-as-micro-setting constrains every move: stone bites skin, wind carries clang, mist swallows rope & cannons. Dock-rope’s tarred fray and the brass leviathan’s tail-curl recur, evolving from cell relic to wisdom key. Weather (bruised dawn, thunder prowling) mirrors internal ebb of grievance. Spatial choreography remains lucid throughout: west/east exits, Kael’s descent center—environment shapes tactical possibility.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—trade hostage without letting either crown claim victory—signaled in para 1. Escalation: guards name fears, spears lower, parchment invalidated by weather; each step narrows chance for symbolic victory. Protagonist agency: Kael orchestrates every tightening via moon-timing, rope ritual, lullaby. Cost is diplomatic vacuum—no signed treaty yet cannons stay silent—felt in mist-thickened silence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete ritual (knot-casting, drawer pull) rather than thesis: forgiveness = space widened by absence. Final line’s forge-image reweights earlier “recycled mistakes” phrase without moralizing. Subtextual silence after lullaby replaces spoken treaty—invites reader to listen for what cannons do not say. No echo of prompt language; wisdom is dramatized, not asserted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm mimics tidal pull—long swells contract to staccato knots under pressure. Diction stays maritime & metallic (“salt”, “leviathan”, “tarred”, “spears”) consistent with negotiator POV. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens from panoramic mist to calloused palm on brass. Final cadence slows to match dawn’s cautious break—prose as breath.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density: “moon remembers tide” does triple duty—voice, world-rule, foreshadowing. Metaphors organic (thunder as prowling engines) without stacked overload. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or choice. Minor filter verbs (“felt”) occur early but vanish during climax, preserving immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: hostage-exchange as lunar ritual, diplomacy by dock-rope & antique hardware. Transformation test—swap names/places and emotional arc collapses because moon-phase specificity is baked into tension. Risk of lyrical abstraction paid off by concrete cost (missing splash, dissolved ink). Not a retread; stakes feel re-invented rather than re-skinned.</comment>
