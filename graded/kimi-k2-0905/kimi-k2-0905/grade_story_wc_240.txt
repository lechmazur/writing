<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya’s grief-driven precision and spatial gift are shown through tactile choices—mapping spores, chaining laser dots, synchronizing heartbeats—so the final merge feels earned. Interiority stays concrete (“quiet wildfire racing her pulse”) and avoids label-speak. The twin-Luc beat crystallizes her hierarchy of values: truth matters less than release. Cost is felt when the survivor’s eyes remain “unreadable,” keeping ambiguity alive.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each laser click tightens the fold topology, leading irrevocably to the spiral nexus. Closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost—the single Luc who touches her shoulder “stranger’s caution intact” proves grief has been scalpeled away yet identity scarred. No teleporting props; the pointer’s breadcrumb logic is tracked beat-to-beat. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) surface by line 5 and never drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The sapphire-lit caps, ionized air, and spore choreography constrain movement and camouflage the Luc-superposition, so environment actively shapes tactics. Laser dot vanish/reappear mechanics teach the fold rule through action, not exposition. Spatial grounding stays coherent across shelves, ladders, spiral nexus. Final dawn air “leaking down” recharges the mushroom glow, mirroring internal relinquishment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—retrieve or release her brother—tightens when headset shows identical quantum signatures, collapsing “original vs copy” into irreversible choice. Each fold forecloses retreat; the spiral merge is the last live option. Cost is dramatized: one man exits, composite and unreadable. Pressure escalates under causal logic, not coincidence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of letting go emerges through spatial perforation rather than thesis: topology offers mourners an exit route from regret. Final image—“light dispersing through relinquished grief”—reweights every prior breadcrumb dot without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture: the trembling Luc’s spore halo signals unfinished mourning; the calm one embodies acceptance. Ambiguity (which heartbeat survived?) keeps the question alive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person stays tight to Maya’s spatial perception; diction (“nested topographies,” “stipe”) fits her professional lens. Rhythm accelerates with staccato clicks and heartbeats under peak stress, then exhales into longer cadence at dawn. No head-hopping; Dr Voss’s dialogue is utilitarian, distinct from Maya’s interior lyricism. Filter verbs appear only when voice-motivated (“she perceived the cavern’s hidden vector”).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty: “spores swarmed his outline like fireflies copying a shape they admired” paints both Luc and farm ethic. No synonym loops; each metaphor extends the bioluminescent field. Scaffolding excised; no paraphrase restatements. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line releases into bird-song light, satisfying read-aloud ear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Folding topology as grief-counseling tech feels novel yet inevitable; premise commits fully without late rule patches. Gait-signature biometrics and quantum indistinguishability transform familiar “clone” trope into personal ethical crucible. Laser pointer—mundane conference swag—becomes ontological scalpel, an irreproducible detail. Risky merge ending lands because earlier dots earned the spiral vector.</comment>
