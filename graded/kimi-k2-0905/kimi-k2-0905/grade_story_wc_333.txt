<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses are vivid—the locksmith both nurtures and muzzles the idea; the final renunciation (“I am no longer the locksmith…”) is earned by the DNA-passport beat and the swallowed-ink transformation. Micro-choices (winding the ribbon, slicing the mirror-air) reveal value hierarchy under pressure. The scar-as-tuning-string keeps visible cost alive. Only minor emotional label creep (“improbable longing” repeated) prevents 9—still, interiority stays embodied and specific.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the scar hums, stars rename, and the name is surrendered—cost is the erased future selves. Causal chain holds: Vega’s warmth → ribbon → DNA key → mirror shatter → ink flood → constellation renaming. Orientation is taught by lyric pattern early (“shadowed nexus under starlight”), paid off when the corridor erases years. No lens ambiguity; accumulative-textural design coheres.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ivy-shaped keys, frost-slick marble, ear-shaped keyhole, ribbon-stiffening DNA—all micro-setting details constrain the next tactical move. Mirror of night air functions as both prop and portal, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean: seven gates, third-from-left, spiral corridor tracking intact. Environment literally folds space; no static postcard description.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—free the caged idea—signaled in line 1 and tightens when each swallowed word costs a future self. One meaningful deepening: mirror-shatter rewrites her possible futures, price paid on-page (“shards would fly forward into futures she would never remember”). No coincidence; escalation is driven by her successive surrender of DNA, name, and memory under Vega’s warming hint.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: freedom = chosen noise, not silence. Subtext lives in gesture—pressing black hair to an ear-shaped lock confesses without language. Final constellations rename Vega into “Keybearer,” reweighting prior motifs without moralizing. Improbable longing stays ambiguous yet charged; no platitudes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains perceptual signature: “tremor of improbable longing,” “pecking at bone.” Syntax lengthens then fractures during mirror-slice, mirroring ink flood. No head-hopping; POV distance stable. Compression (“three seasons,” “seven years”) is pattern-taught and paid off in corridor erasure. Diction stays within locksmith’s mythic lexicon; no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rhythmic control: clauses swell then collapse into cub-leapt torrent. Metaphors are coherent—ivy keys, ear keyhole, mirror of night—no mixed vehicles. One paraphrase loop: “improbable longing” echoed thrice; not in closure beat, so −0.2. No filler stacks, no scaffold. High density: each sentence advances image or causality. Final line plants star-lanterns, propulsive cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: locksmith as cosmic poet, DNA-as-key, mirror-as-muzzle, star-whisper-as-temperature. Risky second-person mirror shatter paid off by constellation renaming. Conceptual integrity: every rule (Vega hint, ribbon DNA, name-forfeit) is established early and followed through. Emotional specificity cub’s eyes = her own longing transforms generic “facing fear” into singular myth.</comment>
