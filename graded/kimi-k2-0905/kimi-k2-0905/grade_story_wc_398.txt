<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Marco’s interior contradiction—clinging to a 19-year-old scorch while inventing a cross-varietal graft—gains flesh through tactile beats: thumb on char, leaf-crush releasing “bruised herbs,” the decision to sleep with cinder under his pillow. The endurance (Earned Stasis) costs him the safety of accepted varietal borders and carries credible viticultural risk, satisfying the 9+ test even though Elena never appears onstage.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the “bus engine idling” inside his chest rewrites the station’s vacancy into departure, paying the social cost of reopening a family-splitting liaison. Causal chain holds—letter-find → parallel-drawing → graft decision—without soft resets; the burned fragment’s flutter acts as micro-turn that authorizes the final note.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Amber pavilion filters every late beat, its saffron light literally recoloring Marco’s hands to the letter’s char, forcing him to read the past through vineyard skin. Autumn’s coppered rows supply both sensory hinge and agricultural constraint: leaf scent equals “bruised herbs,” a volatile warning that incompatible grafts can fail—thus the setting shapes tactics rather than décor.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can a labelled mismatch be re-tasted as viable?—tightens once: the parallel lecture to absent Elena escalates internal pressure, then crystallizes in the tempranillo-to-chardonnay graft whose failure rate is legible viticultural cost. No coin-flip resolution; the risk is foreshadowed by “slow fermentation” and will be paid next season.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from oenological metaphor rather than exposition: graft union as love union, smoke-to-honey flavor as recklessness wed to restraint. Final image—“stars…swell with impending fruit”—reweights the earlier “impossible” verdict without moralizing, letting reader taste the conceptual repricing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Marco’s viticultural idiom; perceptual signature notices trellis wires, sugar-tannin arguments, rootstock names. Rhythm swells and narrows with emotional heat—“slow ferment of choices” condenses philosophy into cellar time without leaving his lexis. No head-hop, no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence can split a metaphor, advance plot, and anchor season (“Autumn had coppered the vines”). Mixed-metaphor risk—“red taillights…last coal”—reads as character-perceived, not authorial strain. Occasional elevated diction (“intersubjective understanding”) is justified by Marco’s nightly self-address to an absent academic listener.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Vineyard-graft love story is familiar, but the inversion—declaring the historical mismatch invalid and risking an unheard-of tempranillo-chardonnay join—flips trope into fresh viticultural stakes. Specificity of agro-climactic risk plus burnt-letter relic prevents any swap-out test failure.</comment>
