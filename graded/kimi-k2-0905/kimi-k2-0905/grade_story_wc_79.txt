<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses—duty to map vs. terror of what mapping may cost—pulse in every beat; the cracked note is a micro-choice that visibly forecloses safety and earns the final vision of her mother. Interiority is sensory, ink-stained, coral-collared, never diagnostic. The whistle’s fall and the city’s subsonic turn carry the cost on the page. Quiet endurance becomes a charged stance rather than a tidy epiphany.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The causal chain is airtight: tremor→pattern match→cracked note→watchers tilt→city turns→crack reveals mother; each because/therefore linkage tightens options while the gate motive is repriced in the final image. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the gate kept citizens in, not danger out—an undeniable social cost that reframes every prior silence. The 120-word orientation test is waived; early disorientation (“the gate that had rusted shut three seasons ago”) pays off as the thematic pivot. Persistent constraint: once the turtles veer north, retreat carries its own abyss.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The spiral-shell atlas constrains every mapping decision; its grooves literally echo the watchers’ slit faces, charging the final image. Body-as-setting—warm nape, coral collar, spine Morse—grounds stakes inside sensory immediacy. Environmental choices (salt-crusted abyss, heat-shivered mirages) guide turtle navigation and crystallize dread. No exposition dumps; world rules emerge through reed-whistle tests and tremor readings.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will the city wander blind into the Crack?—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens when Grand Akmon shudders. The cracked note is the single decisive escalation that forces the watchers to tilt, foreclosing the option to ignore them; price is instant communal panic and the personal loss of innocence about the gate. Cost is visible: whistle clatters, turtles turn, cartographer accepts responsibility for steering toward the crack where family waits. Under causal lens, one meaningful tightening is sufficient and delivered.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: mapping is a filial act that can un-map the world you were born to protect. The spiral-shell/atlas/groove motif reweights from tool to prison-key, repriced when the watchers’ slit faces mirror it. Final image—city carrying “sunwashed dread” toward reunion—offers resonant ambiguity: progress or doom? No moralizing; the emotional aftereffect is the held breath of a populace now aware their home was the cage.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is saturated with cartographic synesthesia: notes taste of iron, silence feels like held breath, dread is sunwashed. Syntax lengthens and compresses with turtle cadence; fragmentary compression under stress (“cracked it in half”) is intentional. No head-hopping; single POV remains strictly interior. Register never drifts from the ink-stained, reed-whistle lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rhythm mirrors turtle gait—long sentences sweep, then sudden tremor-short beats. Every clause carries double duty: “sunwashed dread thickened” fuses tone + stakes + temperature. Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by recharging “sunwashed dread” with new, terrible chart. High density without purple overload.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: nomadic turtle metropolis × acoustic cartography × archive-taxidermy watchers. The watchers’ slit-groove mirror of the atlas is an inevitable-once-seen detail that transforms prior material. Risk—turning the whole city toward silence—heightens stakes without gimmickry. Premise commits fully; no retreat into allegorical safety.</comment>
