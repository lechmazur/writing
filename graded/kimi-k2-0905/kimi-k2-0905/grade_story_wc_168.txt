<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses—survivor’s guilt vs. need to speak—are alive in every beat; the ash-on-tongue micro-choice crystallizes the hierarchy of values. The spiral ink on wrist carries visible, scaled cost that forecloses anonymity. Interiority is concrete—“tasting childhood campfires”—never diagnostic. Earned stasis lands because silence was a live option now paid for with public exposure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the open box and spiral ink reconfigure meaning with undeniable social cost—tomorrow’s survivors’ group will read his skin. Causal chain holds: ash → taste → ink → signal, each because/therefore tightening options. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) is taught by line 3 and paid off when moonlight projects the fracture pattern onto his cheek. No lens ambiguity; accumulative density peaks at the granite altar image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The moonlit ridge, porcelain fracture, and burned skin form a micro-setting triad that directly shapes the final image—moonlight projecting the crack onto his scar. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: a firefighter notices resin scent, granite dish, ash texture. Spatial choreography is clean: kneel → open box → tongue → draw spiral → leave. Weather (wind by dawn) is forecast as causal agent for scattering ash, not ornament.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translate pain or stay mute—is signaled early; the tight/widening spiral physically enacts the deepening. Visible price: ash swallowed, burn ridges salt-washed, anonymity forfeited. One meaningful tightening: the box warms, fracture becomes projector, foreclosing private grief. Agency remains causal under lens; no coincidence resolves anything.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</score><comment>Theme emerges from the spiral image: grief translated into public language without moral tag. Subtext operates in silence—leaving the box open is a speech act. Final image reweights earlier burn as readable text, not wound. Resists platitude: innocence is acknowledged as irredeemably spent.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly focalized through Elias; diction—“fire-scarred chest,” “mute ember”—is firefighter-particular. Rhythm accelerates at ash ingestion, then lengthens into spiral drawing, mirroring breath. No head-hopping; celestial bodies remain external observers. Compression taught early (“silver scar,” “cracked porcelain box”) pays off in projection image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops; no mixed metaphors. High density—“moonlight slipping through its fracture like a thin blade of mercy” does three jobs: light, violence, mercy. Sentence variety supports breath: long anaphoric line on “tasting” followed by staccato questions. Opening and final lines anchor voice and re-charge motif. Proofing clean; no scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Bargained innocence via ash ingestion is a fresh angle on survivor-guilt trope. Spiral drawn with ash-ink reconfigures familiar grief-into-art premise into readable skin-text. Risk—tasting human ash—earned by prior firefighter competence and campfire memory. Slight proximity to “carrying ashes” trope keeps it from 9+ band.</comment>
