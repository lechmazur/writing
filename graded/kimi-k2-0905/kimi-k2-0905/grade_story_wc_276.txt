<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara’s cool-headedness is shown through embodied calm—bare feet, withheld pulse, silence as tool—rather than label. The rail-spike choice is a credible micro-act that crystallizes her values and costs her the safety of distance, earning the “Stay” echo. Internal contradiction is present but compressed; we see the second heart beat yet no crack in composure, so the cost is felt more conceptually than viscerally. Still, the stance shift is legible and character-specific, satisfying the 9− band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the spike-driven fissure reweights divinity from catch to conversation, with “Stay” as the charged cost. Causality holds—silence method → spike act → echo transformed—under an Accumulative lens. Orientation is anchored by word 40 (“sound wave garden”), waiving penalty. The persistent constraint (warm spike, new tongue) shapes the final image, meeting the 9+ quick test, but a hairline slip: the goddess’s threat-to-silence pivot is slightly under-motivated, keeping it sub-9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The garden, spike, and constellations are not backdrop but tactical instruments: sonic vines recoil, spike splits sound bed, stars drain into fissure. Every descriptor is filtered through Mara’s perceptual bias—sound melts at knees, iron remembers marriage of force and stillness—so setting constrains her moves and charges the final image. Sensory economy is severe (no tourist catalog), yet lavender reeds, indigo longing, and warm iron create vivid specificity. Meets 9+ gate: environment directly shapes tactics and final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can divinity be reeled in—tightens once: from hunt to conversation. Agency is Mara’s spike strike; it forecloses brute capture and forces the echo to bargain. Cost is conceptual but legible: she trades her silence reservoir for a new language, spike now warm with starfire. Under Accumulative lens the cadence shift (garden exhales major chord) reweights stakes; still, the price is more emblematic than visceral, capping below 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the inverse of captivity: divinity is not prey but dialogue partner. Subtext lives in gesture—spike as tongue, silence as net—never sermonized. The final image (“answered question that refuses to stop asking”) offers resonant, non-moral repricing. One hairline slip: “feral lullaby” is named in last line, slightly echoing prompt-language, but it is earned by prior sonic motifs.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is lyric-omniscient yet tethered to Mara’s perceptual signature: every metaphor is sonic or coastal. Syntax compresses—“sound melts before it reached her knees”—without syntactic monotony. Patterned elision (no dialogue, no interior tags) is taught early and paid off at closure. Distinctive diction (“feral lullabies,” “transliterating emotions”) feels irreplaceable; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence layers image and concept—“constellations lumber earthward like sleepwalkers tangled in their own glittering nets.” No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; figurative logic stays coherent. Rhythm modulates from long breathless clauses to the clipped “Stay.” Minor overwriting in star-goddess paragraph (−0.2) keeps it sub-9, but no artifact touches closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—sound garden where footsteps bloom into chords—feels inevitable yet wholly fresh. Trope of star-as-goddess is inverted: she is off-balance, drawn into a human-split earth. Synthesis of rail spike, silence-hunting, and sonic ecology is specific to this text; swap any piece and the story collapses. Risky lyric compression heightens rather than obscures meaning, earning the upper-band +0.3 risk bonus.</comment>
