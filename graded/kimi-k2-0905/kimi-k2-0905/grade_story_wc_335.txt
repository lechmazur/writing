<comment>Lira’s interiority is concrete and particular (walking backwards, shard-coat glints), but the mentor’s erased name arrives too late to shape her prior choices, so the renunciation feels half-earned. The child’s instant grasp of the ritual is charming yet thin; no contradictory impulse complicates their fusion. Still, Lira’s micro-choices (seven backward circuits, spit in dust) visibly cost her the last escape hatch, satisfying Earned Stasis.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the circle-mended teacup image reweights the exile rule and carries undeniable conceptual cost. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of mirrored light, tea-leaf geometry, swing-creak—held to the end. Orientation is taught early (warped doorway, captive 3 pm) and pays off when that slice slips free. Minor waiver: the mentor’s erased name appears only at the final beat, so the cost is felt more by reader retrofit than by on-page causality.</comment>

<comment>The library is not backdrop but actuator: shelves breathe, a swing’s ghost creaks, the captive afternoon physically melts across the floor—each constraining Lira’s tactics. Micro-setting (teacup, bronze plaque, shard-coat) doubles as tool and mirror, charging the final image. Spatial choreography stays clean even in reverse motion. Only the mentor’s teacup-on-sill lacks tactile update after years of dust, a hairline slip.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—reversible exile versus memory—signals in paragraph 3 and tightens when the leaves predict shelving herself as text. One meaningful deepening: the child’s arrival forces Lira to seal the loops for two, narrowing her exit to zero. Cost is legible: she forfeits return-by-forgetting and becomes living annotation. Agency is accumulative (pattern-building) rather than causal reversal, perfectly valid under the lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of archive: memory is the book, librarian is the text. No moral is stated; the final annotation “Resilience is walking backwards…” is an image, not thesis. Subtext lives in silence—the mentor teaches by absence, Lira mentors by circling without words. The circle-mended leaf image reweights exile from punishment to inheritance, achieving complexity without tidy payoff.</comment>

<comment>Voice is lyric, compressed, pattern-taught early (“shard-mirror archivist,” “three o’clock sliced out”) and paid off in the honey-slide of freed light. Perceptual signature is consistent: Lira notices cracks, geometry, dust, never generic “books.” Reverse motion demands syntactic inversion that never loses clarity. Non-standard grammar is purposeful (“annotating cracks in reality the way others catalogued books”) and legible throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>High-density lines (“spat into the dust—combative tenderness toward her own fate”) advance three jobs at once. No loops or scaffold; figurative layering is controlled, never more than one image per beat in peak pressure. Rhythm modulates: long cadence for backward walk, staccato for “triangles… circle… refusal.” Minor mixed metaphor alert—“blade smiles when it chooses not to cut”—but it is brief and character-true, not closure-touching.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The reversible exile premise is freshly interiorized: memory versus return framed as librarian-as-text. Risky reverse choreography throughout could have broken causality yet remains spatially coherent. Tea-leaf divination in a collapsed clock-library is non-obvious synthesis, made inevitable by shard-mirror optics. The final annotation reconfigures the whole concept without retreat; no derivative safety hedging.</comment>
