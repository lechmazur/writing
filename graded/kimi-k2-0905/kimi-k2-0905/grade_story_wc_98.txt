<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Calyx’s interior contradiction—erasure of her mentor’s name to save the ridge—charges every beat; the embodied cost (coppery ink on tongue, hollow mind) is visceral and irreversible. Micro-choice to water the seed with laughter she will forget crystallizes her hierarchy of values on the page. The renunciation is earned: earlier dream-show of the fissure and the seed’s bargain foreclose any cheaper exit. Voice remains singular; no stock epiphanies or therapy-speak intrude.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: “luminous doubt” reconfigures the stake—ridge held by agreed uncertainty, not truth—while the erased mentor’s name supplies undeniable cost. Causal linkage holds: because she plants the seed inside the interpreted dream, therefore the silver leaf instruction emerges and she wakes already forgetting. Lens is Causal; each beat tightens options until the final image. No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The ridge as dragon-back dream-scale, vanilla lattice dream-bower, and copper-ink seed are tactile, world-defining micro-settings that constrain tactics (she must braid orchid fibers into the earthly fissure). Sensory hierarchy filters through Calyx’s checker perception—empirically whimsical hush, orchid and iron taste—never tourist catalog. Weather clock (pre-monsoon light, first fat raindrop) directly governs the final braiding urgency. Spatial choreography remains clean across the shift from dream-canyon to waking ridge.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—ridge survival vs. memory loss—tightens once: the monochrome canyon widens and the seed demands a memory in exchange. Escalation is causal: because the fissure threatens, therefore she must plant; planting erases mentor, narrowing future checking to number-work. Cost is visible—she wakes “mind hollow,” fingers already guiding children into doubt-weave. Coincidence absent; monsoon arrival is environmental clock, not rescue.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: cultural memory endures not because it is true but because communities agree to guard it while knowing they might be wrong. Subtext lives in gesture—Aya smiles “flickering like moonlit fish” signals their uneasy complicity. Final image of ridge “half real, half dreamed” reweights the opening contradiction into resonant ambiguity. No moralizing; the copper taste and luminous doubt carry the after-effect.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: “empirically whimsical hush,” “lucid-dust in her pupils,” and copper-ink tongue create a checker’s sensorium that never drifts into generic fantasy diction. Rhythm modulates—long breathy sentences for dream descent, staccato braiding chant under rain. No head-hopping; single POV holds. Filter verbs serve voice (“she felt the hush”) rather than dull immediacy. Compression taught early—“vanilla tendrils where sleepers hung cocooned”—and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, causality, or cost. Figurative density is patterned—dream-dragon scales, orchid-petal memories—so overload penalty waived. Sentence variety high: participial openers, em-dashes, fragment for thunder. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges “luminous doubt.” No mixed metaphors; physical logic consistent (seed sprouts inside interpreted dream, not literal soil).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise—reality checker who verifies land with dream-seed memory trade—is non-obvious synthesis of cartography, ethnography, and ontologic fantasy. Risky second-person dream-logic stays coherent because pattern taught early (“shared dream the ridge was a dragon’s back”). Fresh inflection: doubt as structural mortar reverses usual faith-based magic. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped—mentor-erasure cost is culturally specific. No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
