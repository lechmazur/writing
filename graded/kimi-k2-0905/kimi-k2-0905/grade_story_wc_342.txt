<comment>The artist’s prosopagnosia is not just named but operational: it dictates what she paints (negative space, not faces) and why the guild trusts her. The interior contradiction—she can render perfect likenesses yet cannot recognize them—drives every micro-choice from pigment mixing to the final braille of stars. Cost is legible: she walks out carrying only brushes, having traded her last sanctuary for an invisible sky she will never see whole. The only bar to 9-band is a slight over-articulation of insight (“her limitation is not failure but filter”) that momentarily abstracts the embodied struggle.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the painted absence becomes her self-portrait and the library’s enduring soul, cost paid in the demolition that begins as she exits. Causality holds: coin notches → measurement system → sky painted → coin returned doubled with meaning. The Orientation Test is waived: deliberate disorientation (who, where, when) is taught in the first 120 words and pays off when the tree-library’s identity is revealed mid-text. One hairline slip: the phrase “she understands now” is a touch declarative just before the climax, but it does not break the lens.</comment>

<comment>The hollow tree-library is not backdrop but active constraint: its curved inner wall dictates canvas shape, living wood drinks paint, root vibrations time her brushstrokes. The coin’s copper coldness, candle’s dance across wet ultramarine, and the knothole’s dying sun fragment all filter through her haptic, face-blind perception. Environment literally guides choice: the wall’s curvature forces the fractal sky pattern; the demolition countdown compresses pigment mixing into urgent gesture. Final image—the painted sky glowing in the last flicker—recharges every prior sensory seed.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—preserve what she cannot see by painting it—tightens once: the siren’s three wails convert stillness into final stroke. Agency is continuous: each coin-press transfers measurement onto wall, each brushstroke spends precious seconds. Cost is visible: she forfeits the only place that ever accepted her difference, exits with nothing but brushes. Escalation is situational but coherent; no reversal is needed, only the irreversible narrowing of time that forces the last white absence onto the wall.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the paradox of recognition through negation: identity survives when stripped of faces. The sky-shaped absence she paints is both self-portrait and communal archive, reweighting the premise without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture—pressing coin to wall is both measurement and farewell kiss. Final image reconfigures meaning: the library dies, yet the invisible sky remains legible to any future finger that reads the braille of stars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate stays locked to her haptic, face-blind sensorium; no filter verbs intrude. Syntax lengthens during fractal painting, then fractures into staccato beats as sirens sound, mirroring pulse. Diction remains within her perceptual lexicon—“whisper of cadmium,” “sky-shaped absence”—never drifting into curator-speak. The only bar to 9+ is one clause (“fractally precise strokes, each eyelash rendered in mathematical succession”) that edges toward technical display rather than felt process.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry triple duty: sensory data, emotional calculus, forward motion. No loops or synonym churn; each metaphor extends the sky-coin-memory nexus without contradiction. Rhythm accelerates across paragraph breaks, mirroring countdown. One mixed vehicle—“philosophy and astronomy mixing like slow-motion snow”—is justified by the surreal leaf-fall of books, not a clarity break.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses four high-risk elements—face-blind artist, living library, demolition countdown, coin-as-star-map—into an inevitable whole. The negative-space self-portrait reframes disability as archival superpower, transforming a familiar trope of “seeing differently” into tangible cultural preservation. Every detail is irreplaceable: swap the tree for any building and the coin for any key and the entire logic collapses. Risk-taking is coherent, not gimmicky; closure would fail without each exact element.</comment>
