<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The poet’s renunciation of “finishing the chord” is earned through seven years of failed completion; the micro-choice to press the torn feather into sand and speak the first line shows embodied cost. Interiority stays concrete—“words tasted of salt and iron”—and the final Earned Stasis (letting the tide erase the sentence) forecloses the path of completion with visible forfeiture. The chipped-tooth smile and sleeve-strip tuning add tactile flaws that complicate the bond without tidy symmetry. No label-speak; contradiction between longing for wholeness and commitment to fracture drives every beat.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the spiral dissolves yet the chord hums on, reconfiguring the poet’s options with undeniable conceptual cost—“incomplete is the only doorway.” Accumulative lens holds: each fragment (feather, zither buzz, kite tail) layers density until the pattern break (walking the spiral outward) releases the sustained note. Orientation anchored by word 30 (“ankle-deep in the cobalt lagoon”). No causality breaks; the snapped kite string returns as braided sunrise, paying off the taught pattern.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The cobalt lagoon, rain-wet sand, and frayed kite tail constrain movement and supply materials for the spiral ritual; the drake feather’s torn vane literally catches light only at fractures, charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy mirrors POV—poet notices color at edges, salt taste, hush of sky—never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is clean: ankle-deep → tideline → spiral → tide’s edge; woman sits opposite, coat fades over dunes. Environment evolves: storm-pull loosened horizon, tide dissolves spiral, kite re-lifts—each shift reweights stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“discover beauty in the incomplete”—is signaled in paragraph 5 and tightens when the poet chooses to let the chord hover rather than resolve. The zither’s broken third string buzz creates a micro-turn that forces joint tending; twisting sleeve-strip to tune it shows visible price. Escalation is accumulative: each shard adds tonal tension until the shared music and spoken lines crystallize the suspended moment. Cost is legible: the poem is “not finished but sufficient,” a doorway left ajar that forecloses completion.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the accretion of broken things that refuse synthesis; no explicit thesis stated. The torn feather, chipped tooth, and snapped kite string reweight “incomplete” from lack to access—final sand sentence erased by tide becomes the thematic repricing without moralizing. Subtext in the woman’s lunar smile and the poet’s salt-iron taste invites multiple readings: collaboration as love, art as wound. Resonance lingers in the humming shells—image, not assertion, carries the aftereffect.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Lyric compression is taught early—“burnished hush of morning”—and sustained: syntax lengthens during spiral drawing, shortens at gull cry. Perceptual signature is poet-specific: horizon as seam, syllables as tiny mirrors, door left ajar. No head-hopping; woman’s interior accessed only through laugh and chipped smile. Rhythm modulates with pressure: low voice to sand, torn strip tuning, final erased sentence—each cadence matches emotional crest.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is patterned and paid off—“torn net that still holds fish” returns as literal net of almosts carried home. No mixed metaphors; vehicles stay coherent (spiral, doorway, chord). Information density high: “clam shell gnawed into crescent moon” does characterization, setting, and metaphor in five words. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: shoreline litter as musical notation, incompleteness as compositional method. Risk of lyric abstraction is countered by tactile handling—feather pressed, string twisted, sentence erased. Transformation test fails if names change; the cobalt lagoon and torn vane are irreplaceable. No close echoes; the “door left ajar” image feels inevitable yet unborrowed. Could push further into cultural specificity, but within 800 words the concept is fully committed.</comment>
