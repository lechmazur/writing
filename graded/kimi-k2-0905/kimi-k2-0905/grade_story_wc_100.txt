<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>The undertaker’s interior contradiction—his fear of the coast vs. the shard’s “unpaid debt” tug—is dramatized in one micro-choice: he descends the ladder. Stubbornness is shown, not labeled, and the final acceptance of tenure carries a visible cost: his own name in the ledger. The lens-hotter-when-facing-northeast trick gives a tactile, character-specific beat.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the undertaker’s self-burial in the drowned library is irreversible and legible (“written in his careful mortuary hand”). Causal chain holds: shard → catalog → paper-boat fire → lens seal → tenure. Mosaic shards (pier, boulevard, desk) are taught by 25 % and transition cleanly under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Cost is felt in the final hush that “burns backward into the hearts of the living.”</comment>

<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The broken lens and coral desk function as micro-setting: they physically constrain action—he must fit the shard, fold boats, accept the tentacle. Barnacled marble boulevards and salt corridors are sensuous, specific, and mirrored in the “interval between heartbeats” internal state. Spatial choreography is clean: ladder descent, northeast aisle, brass octopus tether. Weather is the water itself, pressing every beat.</comment>

<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—give rest an address—tightens when overdue souls accumulate like fines; the paper-boat fire is the one visible trade-off that narrows options (he burns memory to fuel light). Escalation is accumulative: each shelved book sighing shut = one returned soul, reweighting the collection’s mass. No reversal, but the lens’s demand for a keeper crystallizes stance. Cost is legible in the warming water and the final inland parlor left to dust.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme—rest as a cataloged destination—emerges through the salt corridors and the undertaker’s own entry in the ledger; no overt thesis is stated. Subtext in the cold fire that “feeds on memory instead of oxygen” reweights grief into light. Final image of backward-burning beacon offers Conceptual Repricing: the living receive calm at the price of one man’s eternal vigil. Ambiguity is purposeful: is he librarian or cadaver?</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is a hushed, mortuary cadence—“eyes of the many dead he had dressed for viewing”—that modulates to phosphorescent lyricism under water. Perceptual signature is unmistakably embalmer: he notices fogged glass, swollen spines, silt that “had once been reading tables.” No dialogue, so no convergence risk. Compression like “chased stillness” is taught early and paid off in the final column of hush.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from short pulse (“the metal accepted it with a maternal click”) to clause-stacked lyricism without algorithmic pattern. Mixed metaphors are strategic: “library sank, still aching for checkout” marries bureaucratic and nautical registers, justified by world logic. No loops or synonym churn; “occupying impossible spaces” recurs with reweighted meaning rather than padding. Closing line lands with rhythmic finality.</comment>

<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The drowned library as after-life circulation system is a fresh synthesis of maritime gothic and bibliophilic afterlife; it commits fully without wink. Risk is high—underwater conflagration, octopus card catalog—but coherence never breaks. Specificity (“boulevards of barnacled marble”) prevents abstraction; removal would collapse the story’s logic. Transformation test: inland undertaker vs. lighthouse keeper of the dead is irreversible.</comment>
