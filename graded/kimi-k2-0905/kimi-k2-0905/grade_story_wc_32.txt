<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid—“stoically sensitive beneath soot-blackened goggles” shows embodied contradiction—but micro-choices are narrated rather than dramatized in the critical beat (offering goggles). The final renunciation is credible and forecloses sight, yet the emotional cost is asserted more than felt on-page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: creature scatters lens-dust, sealing nexus and pricing sight. Causal chain holds—blood → frost → ash → vivify—but the “contradiction” pivot (ash meets frost) is asserted, not shown, so cost is legible yet slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Micro-setting—the ember nexus as crucible—constrains every alchemical move and charges the final sealing. Sensory hierarchy obeys crisis: heat, ozone, myrrh, frost. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions. Environment literally feeds the vivified engine, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Single dominant stake—break destiny of seventh children—tightens when vivification produces a creature that warns the next cage may be stranger. Price is high: sight forfeited, cathedral collapses. Escalation is accumulative/textural: frost→steam→creature→blindness, each layer reweighting stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of creative destruction emerges through image, not statement: cathedral becomes garden of unmade bells. Final reconfiguration—“nothing whole stays holy and nothing broken stays still”—is implicit in the scattering of ground lenses. Avoids sermonizing; resonance is imagistic and earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is dense, alchemical, rhythmically controlled—“penny-drops rhythm against ruined ribs.” Perceptual signature filters every detail through soot, goggles, frost. No head-hopping; distance stays tight. Non-standard syntax (“stoically sensitive”) is pattern-taught and paid off in final blind smile.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density; each sentence layers metaphor, action, consequence. Occasional metaphor stacking—“frozen bloom arrested mid-burst”—but vehicles stay coherent under lyric pressure. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Final image of copper-drop star is crisp and propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: alchemist vivifies relic into shepherd-lattice that critiques its own gospel. Risk-taking—lyric density, paradoxical trait “stoically sensitive”—heightens stakes without obscuring closure. Premise avoids template; transformation is specific to valley, seventh-child curse, goggles-for-insight trade.</comment>
