<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses—survivor’s guilt vs. last-shot redemption—play out in embodied micro-choices (kneeling despite the knee, crushing the pillbox). The final renunciation is fully earned: he forecloses any new identity and accepts visible erasure. Cost is scaled to length and felt on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: transmission sent, pillbox destroyed, future open but path closed. Causal chain (pillbox → coordinates → transmitter → burst) holds without gaps; each step narrows options. Persistent constraint—scarred face, dead keypad, crushed pillbox—shapes tactics through the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Bluff, mist, salt-mold station, and snowdrop function as micro-settings that constrain movement and charge the final image. Wind-turbine trickle and frostbitten briars actively gate access. Environmental details evolve with action; no white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—expose the director before he is erased—tightens once: confession recorded → pillbox crushed → signal airborne, foreclosing retreat. Cost is legible in the sparking console and ground-up silver dust. Agency drives every beat; coincidence complicates but does not resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of “gardening possible futures” emerges through Sera’s line and the snowdrop receiver; no authorial sermon. Image of crushed portrait ground into snow reprices the spy’s myth-making machinery. Complexity retained: no moral balance-sheet, only irreversible act.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains tight psychic distance; perceptual signature—“silver hush,” “tilted-spring air,” “face half molten”—is consistent and pressure-responsive. Syntax lengthens for fatigue, shortens for transmit beat. No POV leakage or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density: “pillbox clicked against the stolen keycard—both too small to carry the weight of nations, yet they did” does triple duty. Rhythm modulates naturally; no template cadence or paraphrase loops. Figurative layer is selective and paid off (“moon a thin blade,” “dying star flinging its atoms”).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Burn-notice trope is inverted through micro-code in breath-activated pillbox and snow-scratched coordinates—specific, non-obvious mechanics. Spy-as-gardener metaphor and crushed-portrait closure reweight genre conventions. Risk in lyric accumulative structure pays off in resonant final image.</comment>
