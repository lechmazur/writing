<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s exile-choice is dramatized through tactile ritual (copper nail, kelp-stench) and a single micro-choice—asking Voss the bravery question—that flips her from passive decoder to active accuser. The “nervously confident” trait is embodied, not labeled, in trembling hands that clutch the nail while she steers the dirigible. Interior contradiction is alive: she both clings to ancestry and weaponizes it against the Ministry. The final choice to stay reverses exile on her own terms, a credible renunciation with visible cost ( etched coordinates on glass ) that forecloses return to the capital’s perfume.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the sky itself becomes a library, refracting Edda’s map—an undeniable conceptual cost that reweights the Ministry’s secrecy. Causal chain holds: decoded stanza → micro-map → restricted test-zone dive → appeal granted, each step narrowing options. The “Latitude of forgiveness” line lands as the inciting micro-turn; the final etched glass wall is the crystallized image. Persistent constraint: the copper nail (coffin origin) stays pressed to palm, shaping every tactical touch.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The mildewed aluminum station, spongey plankwalk, and newborn wind-shears are not backdrop but gear-shift: the kites’ fight forces the dirigible launch window. Micro-setting dominance: the copper nail’s verdigris migrates from pendant to thumbprint to etched stylus, coloring every tactile surface. Weather is causal—barometers scream, sky glows “old pennies”—and directly enables the nine-mile wreck locate. Spatial choreography clean: gondola floor, holotable, glass walls track without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—ancestral erasure vs. state amnesia—tightens when the decoded stanza proves Edda’s route lies inside the station’s own forbidden test zone, forcing Mara to risk Voss’s radio threat. One meaningful escalation: the question “What bravery is so inconvenient…?” flips Voss from antagonist to accomplice, narrowing Mara’s moral position to co-ownership of the secret. Cost is visible: the copper nail brands her palm, the dirigible fuel is spent, the Ministry appeal could still fail. Agency drives every beat; coincidence complicates (wreck inside restricted zone) but does not save.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through refracted light: maps are memory, weather is archive. No explicit thesis; the final image—experimental beams carving Edda’s coordinates across rain—reconfigures “spongey dread” into purposeful direction. Subtext in the nail’s migration: burial tool → decoder → stylus, arguing remembrance is a reversible burial we perform on the powerful. Question “What truth do you need the wind to remember?” is now airborne in the jet stream itself—an earned conceptual repricing without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person intimate clings to Mara’s perceptual filter: “stank of kelp and might still be classified” is a librarian’s catalogic reflex. Syntax thickens under pressure—“gravitational pull of legacy”—then fractures into semaphore shards, mirroring code-breaking fatigue. No head-hop; Voss’s brother-loss enters only through Mara’s inference in dialogue. Rhythm modulates: lullaby cadence vs. anemometer vibration, each sentence a barometric reading of her tremor.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density: one sentence can deliver exile-act, mildew palette, and Ministry denial. No scaffold loops; each metaphor is physically consistent—copper patina = sky color = bureaucratic decay. Sensory verbs are strong: “drumming,” “pulsed,” “imprinted,” avoiding filter-stack. Minor register spike—“conceptual repricing” in closing line—reads as Mara’s archival precision, not authorial intrusion, and is justified by earlier catalogic voice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The Reversible Exile Act as narrative engine is fresh: law becomes plot hinge rather than backdrop. Salt-cipher stanzas invert coastlines so only a believer can read them right-side up—an ingenious micro-device that fuses theme and plot. Copper nail recycled from coffin to decoder to stylus avoids gimmick by constraining every tactile choice. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off: the sky-library closing image feels inevitable yet unwritten before this piece.</comment>
