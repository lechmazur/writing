<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Leo’s interior contradiction—professional daredevil who flinches at his own shadow—remains vivid and embodied throughout; every beat of the flashlight tremor or knee-knock is a stunt cue. The shell whisper re-weights his self-concept with a felt cost: tomorrow he will leak the trembling take and risk career erasure. Micro-choices (rotating the child’s cast, aiming the projector at the perforated roof) crystallize a hierarchy that puts truth above safety. The only drag is one late “vulnerability isn’t armor; it’s the power source” line that edges toward thesis-speak, slightly blunting the prior embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal linkage holds: because the heirs plan to retire his bruised-body brand, therefore he hunts the shell; because the shell offers the trembling-take instruction, therefore he screens the raw reel for the guards. One meaningful tightening—projector beam through the roof holes—simultaneously narrows escape options and re-weights meaning. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the unfiltered reel re-prices vulnerability from liability to asset with undeniable social cost. Orientation is secure inside 120 words; lens (Causal) remains unambiguous to the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The rusted library’s iron-shelf vertebrae and perforated skylight actively guide choices—row numbering points to the drainage alcove; the roof holes become literal apertures for the climactic projection. Micro-setting (the child’s cast as palimpsest) functions as map and mirror, constraining decryption tactics. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: Leo notices rain-smudged autographs and dry-ballpoint indentations because stunt-work survival once depended on such details. Only minor slip: “studio backlot” appears once without earlier geographic cue, a hairline orientation jolt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove that the trembling take has value—faces concrete test when guards arrive; screening the reel forfeits stealth and risks confiscation. Escalation is singular but sufficient: the projector choice forecloses retreat, turning exposure into the only path. Cost is visibly felt: security’s disgust and his own tears blur the rust into galaxies, proving price on the page. No off-stage coincidence; the shell’s instruction and the guards’ timing both stem from prior trespass.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Theme emerges without slogans: the stunt industry’s lie of heroic invulnerability is undercut by a half-shell that valorizes the shake. The final image—stars spilling like unpaid extras while raw fear plays overhead—reconfigures vulnerability from shame to shared humanity. Subtext lives in gesture: the winged-lion sticker pressed onto a trembling hand re-prides a birth-sign once tainted by tyrant lineage. Only the closing aphorism drags the score a notch below perfect integration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>First-person voice carries a stunt-double’s technical lens: “counting heartbeats like stunt beats,” “camera-smoke,” “feed reel.” Rhythm tightens under pressure—fragments (“Three nights ago a DNA test slid…”) mimic splice cuts. Perceptual signature is selective and biased: he spots rain-smudged autographs and ballpoint channels because deciphering wreckage once saved a shoot. No head-hop; compression (“dawn bruised the horizon”) is taught early and paid off in the final walk toward backlot lights.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density: one sentence often stitches metaphor, backstory, and forward pressure—“the revelation should have felt like freedom, but it tasted of rust and camera-smoke.” No paraphrase loops; metaphors stay coherent (rusted library = old prop ship). Filter-verb use is minimal and voice-motivated. Final third avoids overwriting: “stars spilled through the holes like unpaid extras” is precise, not purple. One homophone risk—“reel” for “real” is intentional pun and passes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Familiar tropes—switched-at-birth heir, magical prop—are retooled through stunt-industry specifics and the trembling-take concept, yielding fresh angle. Risk-taking (projecting raw fear onto a collapsing ceiling) heightens stakes without gimmickry. The shell’s whisper retroactively justifies every prior tremor, making the synthesis feel inevitable. Slight proximity to “hero needs artifact to prove worth” template keeps it from the top band.</comment>
