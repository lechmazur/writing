<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Arin’s interiority is lyric rather than concrete; his contradictory impulses (keep vs share color) are announced, not dramatized in scene. The final renunciation is earned by causal chain, but emotional cost is rendered in elevated collective diction rather than embodied beat. Grandmother memory and taste-of-seed are vivid, yet压力下 self-diagnosis (“he understood then”) drifts toward label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the sapling roots half in dream reconfigure the world-rule, cost is the loom’s destruction and Arin’s perpetual exile. Causal linkage holds: because he captures → must release; Accumulative/Textural pattern of color-droplet motif tightens meaning. Orientation anchors within 120 w; drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; no ambiguity at end. Cost is legible in “suddenly older yet lighter.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Waterfall-mist and willow-loom function as micro-setting that constrains every tactical choice; bridge-crossing space is cleanly choreographed. Sensory hierarchy is biased to Arin’s orchard-trained eye, filtering hues as professional inventory. Verdant parapet supplies both physical footing and metaphoric stage for color-loom; final sapling roots in air, recharging setting into dream. Environment directly enables the graft-onto-air stunt that embodies theme.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—preserve wonder—tightens when loom buckles, forcing share-not-hoard choice with visible loom-collapse cost. Escalation is Accumulative: each dawn’s weaving heightens color density until release explosion; no causal reversals, but pattern-break suffices. Protagonist agency drives final turn; luck complicates but does not resolve. Price (older yet lighter, loom lost) is on-page and alters later options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of wonder as public commons emerges solely through image-action; no moral stated. Color-sharing reprises early seed-memory, reweighting meaning without abstract assertion. Final sapling “leaves chiming like quiet bells” offers resonant non-literal answer. Ambiguity is present—exile as cost or gift—yet coherent.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyric omniscient voice sustains radiant hush diction with rhythmic control; perceptual signature is color-saturated and orchard-specific. Sentence variation avoids monotony; elevated register remains purposeful to mythic tone. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk averted. Patterned elision (“he sang the old lullabies”) taught early and paid off at color-capture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Figurative density is high but patterned and justified by mythic mode; mixed metaphors are avoided. Information density strong—each line advances image or stake. One template-cadence run (“Each dawn he pruned…”) is brief and thematic, not obscuring closure. No loops or scaffold in final third; read-aloud rhythm breathes with escalation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Color-as-weave and orchard-pruner grafting wonder into air feels fresh synthesis of folkloric botany. Risk of lyric myth is embraced without hedging; premise followed to conceptual end. Specificity of obsidian shears, equinox dew, and silver-veined seed prevents generic fantasy drift. Final sapling rooted in dream is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
