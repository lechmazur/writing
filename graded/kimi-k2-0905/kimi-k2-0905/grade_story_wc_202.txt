<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrator’s contradictory impulse—clutching the fragment yet surrendering it to child-self—crystallizes in one embodied beat (“I unfasten the cord…offer the adult-worn fragment”). Interiority stays concrete, tied to tide-hum and lullaby, not labels. The renunciation costs the adult identity built around ferrying ghosts, shown by the heavier absence; only the brief “translator no longer” skirts diagnostic speak, keeping this just outside 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the lens-less future is irrevocable (“absence weighs more”) and the new rooftop lighthouse beam confirms the reweighted world. Causal linkage holds—painting heartbeat date → memory trigger → fragment return → market re-appearance—each because/therefore step narrows options until the protagonist exits the loop. Orientation is taught by the swaying catwalk image at word 30, waiving any penalty; lens stays causal throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The fragment itself functions as micro-setting: its warmth guides hand and decision on the catwalk, then its loss re-orients the final rooftop beam. Market ropes, salt wind, and painter’s copper-tint air are filtered through the POV’s sensory priorities, never catalogued. Spatial track stays clean—stall, cliff, catwalk, rooftop—with bodies and distances accounted for in each move.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“honor overlooked histories”—tightens when the painter’s dated heartbeat proves the fragment was always owed back. One decisive reversal: instead of collecting memory, the protagonist surrenders it, foreclosing the translator path. Cost is legible in the “heavier absence” and the scaffolded rooftop lighthouse that must now operate without inherited glass.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through the looped image of giving light away to keep it; no moral is stated. The final sentence “We keep the light by letting it go” reweights every prior possession—fragment, lullaby, painter’s heartbeat—into a resonant conceptual repricing. Ambiguity lingers: the new beam is makeshift, the market a rumor, yet the cost is undeniable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>First-person voice carries a distinct perceptual signature: tide-gnawed ruins, beam-song, copper-salt air. Syntax lengthens during reflective beats, then fractures into parataxis at the threshold crossing, mirroring vertigo. No head-hopping; diction stays within the lighthouse-keeper’s child lexicon without drifting into catalogue prose.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and rhythm; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is selective—“market swayed like a lantern”—and never clogs the high-pressure crossing. One mixed metaphor (“anchor set in reverse”) is minor enough to keep this just shy of 9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The rooftop alchemist market ferrying bottled regret and starlight feels inevitable yet unseen before; the time-loop via painted brushstroke heartbeat is a fresh causal mechanism. Risk—the entire climax occurs inside pigment—pays off because the fragment’s physical transfer anchors the surreal rule. Specificity of lighthouse-keeper lineage and tide ruins prevents generic fantasy pastiche.</comment>
