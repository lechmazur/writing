<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Liora’s interiority is concrete (“methodically playful,” rabbit-skin-glue life), embodied frustration (“ground tilt”), and a final micro-choice that renounces certainty at visible cost. Nested copies dramatize contradictory impulses in-scene; no label-speak. Motivation stays anchored to craft identity; the refusal of closure is earned. Missing secondary pressure keeps her just shy of 8.5+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sound folds and color inversions tighten stakes through cadence shift rather than causal chain. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by line 5; pattern of folding taught early and paid off in final “breathing book” image. Closure is a Charged Poise: “I will never be certain…” reweights premise with conceptual cost; shimmer climb makes price visible. No lens ambiguity; one transition inside dream-fold is legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sound-wave garden is not backdrop but tool: basalt slabs, xylophone corridors constrain tactics—spoon must strike stone to invert color. Micro-setting (silver ribbon, nickel rim) functions as manipulable prop that charges final image. Spatial choreography clean across folds; no impossible moves. Environment never described for tourism; every detail either guides choice or mirrors inversion theme.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—curiosity vs certainty—signaled in nickel’s whisper and crystallized in final renunciation. Escalation is accretive: each fold drains color into possibility, tightening the cost of knowing. Protagonist’s agency drives every turn (she taps inverted note, chooses unmapped path). Price is legible: color ghosts, dissolved nickel, softening edges of self.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges only through images: coloring-book ghosts, open-edge flakes, lullaby of endless verbs. No thesis statements; final line offers resonant non-moral. Ambiguity is purposeful—reader must decide if restoration is eternal deferral—yet anchored in concrete particulars. Wisdom (“exchange is never done”) is earned via sensory ordeal, not assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Liora’s perceptual filter; no head-hop. Syntax mirrors sonic motif—echoing clauses, inverted wave sentences—without monotony. Diction (“tesserae,” “bindle”) stays within restorer/traveler lexicon. Compression in fold-sequence is taught early and remains legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Rhythm accelerates with fold-sequence; sentence variety supports breath. Figurative language is sparse and patterned—firefly pigment, silver ribbon—no mixed metaphors. Zero scaffold loops; no filter-verb stacks. Information density high: single sentences deliver setting, tool, emotional tilt.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses sound-garden + compressed city + coin-of-attention; synthesis feels inevitable. Nested restorers as city dreaming its curators is non-obvious yet grounded in craft metaphor. Risk—lyric folding, visible sound—heightens meaning without clarity loss. Transformation test fails if Liora becomes generic artist; specificity of glue, tesserae, spoon keeps it fresh.</comment>
