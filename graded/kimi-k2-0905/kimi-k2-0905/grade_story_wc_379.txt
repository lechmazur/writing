<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira’s curator-drive is concrete from the first paragraph and steers every micro-choice—unlocking the gate, arranging finds, recruiting storytellers. The final refusal to open the box, letting the heartbeat fade into dawn, is a credible renunciation that costs her the “solution” the town expects. Interiority stays specific: dust between ribs, kettle steam, borescope’s metal eye. No secondary character exerts live pressure, so relationship bullets are N/A; headcount stays coherent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens = Accumulative/Textural; pattern taught early (mosaic of voices). Closure = Charged Poise: the courtyard becomes “one vast ear,” options re-weighted without exposition. Cost is felt in the slowed locket-beat merging with sparrows—Mira forfeits certainty. Orientation anchored by word 42; no causal break; escalation = density of rumor & object until breath-held hush.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rose-gold tiles, brass compasses, tin soldier, clicking locket—objects act as micro-setting that channel Mira’s attention and ultimately the communal listening stance. Spatial choreography is clean: gate, fountain, mailbox, cushion track across dusk-to-dawn without drift. Weather (desert cold, peach sunrise) affects body and decision to stay. No occupational systems required; sensory selection filters through curator’s valuation hierarchy.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</question><comment>Dominant stake: prove listening heals. Pressure escalates by rumor density and audible pulse; final stance crystallizes when Mira renounces opening the box—path foreclosed, cost legible. No coincidences resolve; agency = endurance + communal silence. One meaningful tightening suffices; no external antagonist needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from accumulation: discarded things & discarded grief re-valued through collective witness. No explicit thesis; final image of empty cushion labeled “For whatever returns” reweights premise without moral. Subtext lives in silence, heartbeat, offered keys/letters/tooth. Ambiguity—did locket stop or merge?—lingers productively.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>Third-person close stays pinned to Mira with perceptual signature: “dust between her ribs,” “rusted jaw” of mailbox. No dialogue; prose rhythm modulates from long breathless clauses (rumor storm) to clipped final lines (quiet dawn). No filter-verb stacks; diction remains within curator’s lexicon. Voice distinct and consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density: each sentence advances image, stake, or atmosphere. Metaphors are controlled (heartbeat slower than clocks) and paid off. Minor template cadence in “she…she…she” triplet at dawn but serves breath-mimicry. No loops, scaffold, or mixed vehicles. Final line propels without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Freshens the “mysterious box” trope by making the goal witness, not opening. Object-return motif given curator-specific spin. Risk: communal silence as climax—stakes could feel small, but text commits and lands Charged Poise. Could swap names/places yet curator lens and listening thesis feel particular; sufficient transformation.</comment>
