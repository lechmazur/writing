<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The luminous glass artist is a singular, fully embodied presence whose contradictory impulses—hunger for justice versus hunger for quiet—are alive in every beat; her micro-choices (crushing the ledger, trading the obsidian, gathering her beads) visibly foreclose the smugglers’ path and her old identity. Interiority is sensory, not diagnostic: “charcoal… blistering her lips,” “glass fragments ignited into floating sparks.” The final renunciation (opening a studio for dawn vigils rather than profit) carries clear, scaled cost under the Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens is taught by the frost-pattern motif and holds: each shard/image layers until the final “blank gather of molten light” reweights the premise. Closure is a crystallized Charged Poise—she steps off the bus into unmapped possibility—whose cost is the erased ledger and the obsidian fare already paid. No causal breaks; geography and object states track cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Frost, schist warmth, glass beads, and canyon walls actively constrain tactics: frost reveals timing, beads mark a reversible trail, obsidian pays passage. Sensory economy is POV-filtered (“air so cold it rang,” “kiln’s last exhale”) and never stalls momentum. The final image of desert flats and blank bus sign mirrors her internal blank slate, charging the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Single dominant stake—find purpose in the pause, not revenge—tightens when she refuses to follow the ledger’s depot forward and instead turns back, forfeiting the smugglers’ route. That renunciation narrows her options to the blank bus and unmapped town, paying visible opportunity cost. Drift of beads and dissolving charcoal supply escalating tactile losses that reweight the stake.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the iterative frost-and-glass imagery: transparency earned through fracture, not secrecy. The scorched testament’s final scattering is a Conceptual Repricing that revalues silence over evidence. No moralizing; resonance is felt in the “blank gather of molten light” that invites readers to imagine an ethics of witness rather than exposure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric, compressed, and pattern-taught: participle openers, hyphenated compounds, and sonic repetition (“drifting resonance,” “blank gather”) serve the glass-blower’s perceptual ear. Syntax breathes with scene tempo—short clauses under stars, longer sinuous sentences at dawn. No head-hop; interior access stays strictly within her sensory frame.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is near-flawless: high information density, zero paraphrase loops, metaphors internally coherent (glass/molten light ↔ kiln re-heating). Rhythm modulates from staccato night beats to expansive dawn release. No filter-verb stacks or register drift; every adjective earns its place.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fusion of glass-artist fugitive with frost-forensics feels fresh; the smugglers’ split told through kicked dust and healing frost is a specific inversion of usual noir clues. Risk in lyric accumulative structure pays off by making the final blank bus a resonant reconfiguration rather than a plot twist. Could edge higher if the smugglers’ glass-window racket were even more concretely sketched, but originality is already strong.</comment>
