<comment>Mira’s familiarity with the labyrinth is credible through sensory memory and the reveal that her hand-drawn maps are incomplete, but interiority stays surface-level—no contradictory impulse is dramatized under pressure. Her decision to trust the stranger and lead her in is declared, not wrestled-with; we see no micro-choice where cost is weighed. The moment she “understands” the acoustic purpose reads as an external verdict rather than an internal fracture. Voice remains competent but generic; the occupational lens never shapes syntax or priority.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the labyrinth’s true acoustic nature reweights Mira’s seven-year labor, felt cost legible in “her maps had been incomplete.” Causality is situational—storm coincidence opens the door rather than protagonist volition forcing it—but the lens is coherent. Orientation is clean by ¶3; no drive ambiguity at end. Escalation is modest: one harmonic deepening rather than because/therefore chain, adequate for sub-800-word accumulative design.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Steel deck, rusted walls, and auroral light are filtered through Mira’s auditory expertise; corrugated surfaces serve as tuning chambers, not backdrop. Spatial choreography is impeccable—footsteps, distances, and resonant vectors track without drift. The storm’s violet ribbons and GPS failure marry weather to plot utility. Container “star pattern” functions as micro-setting that literally shapes the climax, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—prove the whisper network—arrives late (mid-story) and is carried by the guest, not Mira, muting protagonist pressure. Escalation is atmospheric (storm intensifies) more than tactical; Mira’s agency is facilitative, not decisive. The sealed door opens via inherited key + inherited chant—no live trade-off or risk. Cost is conceptual (her maps incomplete) rather than visceral; tension plateau stays moderate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges cleanly: knowledge carried quietly outlasts digital noise. It’s surfaced through acoustic coins, wartime nails, and the final harmonic rather than a stated thesis. Subtext of inherited female labor is present but underexploited. Ending image—her maps were incomplete—reweights premise with satisfying humility.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Narrative diction stays within Mira’s vocational ear—“mechanical rhythms,” “corrugated corridors,” “metal canyon”—creating a perceptual signature. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for mapping vigilance, clipped fragments when key turns. No head-hopping; interior access remains steady. Occasional elevated phrasing (“crystallized final moment”) drifts above hard-hat lexis but remains isolated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, high-density, with almost zero scaffold; each sentence advances map, sound, or aurora. Metaphors are spare and mechanical, fitting port ethos. One paraphrase loop (“whisper network…whispered softly”) is minor. Opening and closing images (hand-drawn folds / harmonic chamber) echo without intrusive symmetry.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Acoustic-container labyrinth as clandestine comms device feels fresh, avoids steampunk cliché. Linking geomagnetic storm to audible key resonance is inventive yet credible. Gendered inheritance line (grandmother→granddaughter) offers social texture rarely paired with maritime spy-tech. Concept and image are inseparable—swapping elements would collapse the whole.</comment>
