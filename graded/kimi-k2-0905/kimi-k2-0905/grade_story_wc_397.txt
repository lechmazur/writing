<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—arriving to watch death, choosing to listen—drives every beat. The heirloom transfer to the boy crystallizes her earned renunciation; the frostbitten thumb on the chip is embodied cost. Secondary pressure (boy, elders) stays coherent, but their voices converge toward hers in the final choral moment, a hairline flattening. Grip-loosening trait is shown, not told, and directly enables the closing image.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the parasol tip planted in ice reweights “patience” from delay to usable hinge, felt cost legible in the relinquishment. Causal chain is clean—because she volunteers, she meets boy; because she taps the chime, he steps back—each therefore narrows options. Mosaic shard transitions (marina → gangway → dawn) are taught by repeated sonic motif (horn → chime → ice hymn), lens holds. Orientation anchors inside first 120 words; no teleports or prop drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina is not backdrop but constraint: moving floes groan under weight, dictate slip-risk, and supply the ice-crack socket that finally holds the parasol. Cold is filtered through Mara’s selective attention—she notices sound before spectacle, matching her “fold in patience.” Tool/setting convergence: the ivory tip doubles as compass needle and tuning fork, charging the final image. Micro-settings (canvas tent, gangway plates) track cleanly; no white-room syndrome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“learn the sound of approaching endings”—tightens when Mara refuses to record, then again when she offers tea, each choice narrowing her original tourist stance. Pressure escalates accumulatively: each elder’s small memory layers sonic density until the air itself folds. Visible price: she forfeits the heirloom and her observer immunity. Coincidence (boy knows parasol history) complicates rather than resolves, feeding the choral solace.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from sonic motif chain: spectacle → listening → shared lullaby; no moral is stated, only hummed. The parasol’s re-purposing from shield to tuning fork reweights “ending” as continuance—Conceptual Repricing with undeniable social cost (she stays, ship hesitates). Subtext in gestures: the two taps replace language, elders’ weather reports replace last words. Final image is open yet legible—ice hymn as endless sigh—inviting counter-readings without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Mara notices sound texture first, filters visuals through metaphor (“folded air like linen”). Syntax glides from long frost-laden clauses to fragment breaths under pressure. No head-hopping; boy’s interior accessed only through Mara’s auditory guesswork. Dialogue minimal, indirect—“spoke only in gusts”—voice remains consistent, lyric compression taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Rhythm mimics ice shift: long sentences glide, then crack into fragments at turns (“He turned, eyes wide”). Metaphors stay within sensorial reach—no mixed vehicles. Information density high: one sentence often does three jobs (anchors cold, reveals motive, advances action). Scaffold screen clean: no synonym loops, no filler stacks. A single over-ornate line—“chime thinner than moonlight”—survives because it pays off sensory specificity at climax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: euthanasia tourism + sonic grief relief + parasol-as-tuning-fork transforms both death-trip trope and lace heirloom. Risk in lyric accumulative structure is justified—closure legible under Accumulative/Textural lens. Specific inflection: the mercy ship learns hesitation, reconfiguring its own narrative rule. Transformation test fails if parasol becomes umbrella anywhere else—detail is irreplaceable. bold yet coherent.</comment>
