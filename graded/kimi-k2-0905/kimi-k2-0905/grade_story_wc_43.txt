<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses—clinically serene yet privately haunted—are embodied in the way she presses the vinyl shard to Calderon’s pulse then to her own sternum; the micro-choice hierarchy is legible and the final renunciation (carry both pieces forward) carries unmistakable cost. Interiority stays concrete, avoids label-speak, and the “decisively kind” trait actively shapes her tactile decisions under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the jagged vinyl halves never seal, crystallizing the thematic cost that reunify ≠ repair. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—each hymned mundane sound layers density until the monitor flattens; the final image reweights all prior motifs with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The glass-floor corridor, IV clicks, and warm-vinyl scent function as micro-setting that actively constrains Mara’s sonic choices and charges the final lightning-bolt image. Selective sensory hierarchy mirrors emotional narrowing under hospice pressure; no white-room syndrome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“a flawless goodbye”—tightens when Mara shifts from hymning room sounds to hymning scent itself, foreclosing the option to keep her father shard untouched; Calderon’s flatline makes the cost visceral. One meaningful deepening suffices under Accumulative lens; coincidence absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: continuity of fracture—vinyl, breath, family—becomes resonant through concrete recurrence and the final lightning-bolt image; no moralizing. The reconfiguration of “reunify” as carry-both-pieces offers plausible counter-readings and lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Mara’s perceptual signature—kalimba weight against sternum, plastic-rain scent—without head-hopping. Rhythmic control heightens under pressure: clauses shorten as monitor peaks soften, then final sentence elongates into quiet ocean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high information density—each sentence advances atmosphere, sound, or emotional charge. Figurative language is patterned early (“city lights like scattered embers”) and paid off in final lightning-bolt image; no mixed metaphors under closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: hospice music therapist who literally “hymns the mundane” to midwife death; broken vinyl as stethoscope of memory. Risk-taking (glass-floor ward, scent of hope transposed into sound) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; transformation survives proximity test.</comment>
