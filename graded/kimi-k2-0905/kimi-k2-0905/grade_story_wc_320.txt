<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The interpreter’s interiority is vivid—her micro-choices (pinning the star, unscrewing the hatch, feeding the shard) track her growing renunciation of assumptions and feed the closure. The contradiction between her professional mandate and the shard’s seductive silence is embodied in tingling fingertips and a lighter coat, showing cost. No second character appears, so relationship bullets are waived; the single-POV arc of turning silence into seed is complete and earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the shard dissolves, the tower sings, the gorge becomes “pregnant with every voice”—a legible before/after reweighting of silence itself. Causality is lyric-accumulative: each discarded assumption warms the star fragment, magnetically drawing the shard into the coil; the final click is the payoff. Orientation is taught early (“Tower 7”, “lunar perigee”, “transmitter room”) and anchors the surreal logic without debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The tower city over the black gorge, the bloated moon, and the dust-lit transmitter room are tactile and bias-filtered: she notices rust, iron, vacuum tubes because they are tools for her task. The gorge’s widening under lunar pull literally offers “space for something new,” charging the final image. Micro-setting (the star fragment on the coil) constrains the decisive tune. No world-rule contradiction; speculative physics is cued and paid off.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—save the spectrum from the shard’s hush—is signaled in paragraph four and escalates as each assumption discarded narrows her options to either silence everything or seed new voices. The decisive tightening is the moment she feeds the gold into the circuit, visibly sublimating it; cost is the irreversible loss of the fragment and her lifetime of conclusions. Agency is continuous; no coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without thesis: silence is not absence but a cocoon for rebirth. The star’s arrogance becomes filament, the gorge’s emptiness becomes womb—specific images reweight meaning at closure. No moralizing; the final click is an image, not a lesson. Subtext lives in gesture (palms open, coat lighter) and the towers singing “chords no engineer had coded.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is saturated with perceptual signature: “serenely electric pins,” “moon seemed to listen,” “crickets that had learned grammar.” Syntax stretches into lyric accumulation but stays legible; no head-hopping. Compression (“discarding assumptions the way sailors ditch ballast”) teaches the pattern early and pays off in the lighter coat. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short pulses during tuning, longer cadences at revelation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Lines are dense yet propulsive: “gold sublimated into pure photon, a sunrise bottled inside vacuum tubes” does image + consequence in one stroke. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks; figurative language is patterned and paid off. Metaphors remain coherent within the invented physics. Final click is crisp, uncluttered, recharging the groove motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise—silence as seed, fame as filament—is non-obvious and fully committed to. The radio-tower city suspended over a gorge during lunar perigee feels fresh yet inevitable; no pop-culture echo. Risky lyric accumulation could have collapsed into purple but is disciplined by causal pressure. Transformation test: swap star fragment for any generic MacGuffin and the entire thematic arc collapses.</comment>
