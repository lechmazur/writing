<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara’s “compassionate recluse” contradiction is shown through embodied micro-choices: kneeling to flatten the invitation against the floor rather than fleeing, letting the paper drink her pulse. The interiority is concrete and specific—her nerves “taste” borrower emotions, she “pours presence into paper”—with no diagnostic shorthand. The final vanishing is earned: her empathy mutates from burden to diffuse guardian, a renunciation that forecloses her bodily future and is visibly costed on the page. Flaw: the massacre backstory is asserted, not dramatized, so the guilt-driving flaw feels reported rather than lived in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the blank invitation absorbs Elara, reweighting the rule that absence is the deadliest gift. The cost is legible in the instant the paper turns face-down empty, Vale bows to the hush, and the library perpetuates itself—felt, not explained. Causality under the Accumulative/Textural lens holds: every beat layers sensory density until tranquility literally swells, then collapses into her disappearance. One hairline slip: “months ago” massacre is off-stage ellipsis; because it never seeds present tactics, the past leak feels outline-like, not causal, preventing a 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The secret society library is not backdrop; its “enlarged tranquility” is a tactile force that narrows choice—chains on grimoires, ember-red chandeliers that purge intruders, the mirrored desk that literally doubles Elara’s paradox. Micro-setting objects—invitation, marble lectern, lantern gold—are handled on the page and change state (invitation blanks, desk reflects absence). Spatial choreography is clean: Elara slides between rows, kneels, paper drinks her pulse; Vale’s lantern washes the aisle without spatial jump. The final image recharges the setting itself as guardian, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—own the fatal mistake or die—tightens when the midnight purge starts and Elara kneels instead of running, narrowing options to surrender or annihilation. Agency drives the escalation: she weaponizes her own absence, letting the invitation metabolize her pulse until she vanishes; the library’s tranquility swells because she feeds it her body. Cost is visible—the paper blanks, Vale bows to empty air—so the stake is paid on the page. The massacre remains abstract, muting the moral weight of “three drops of innocent blood,” preventing higher band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the paradox cluster rather than assertion: absence as presence, mistake as gift, empathy as self-erasure. The invitation’s blanking is a non-literal answer that reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture—Vale’s bow to emptiness is acceptance of the guardian he cannot see. The circular ending (next recluse finds a fresh invitation) resists tidy morals, offering lingering ambiguity about perpetual sacrifice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric remains tightly focalized through Elara’s empathic sensorium; no head-hop. Perceptual signature is specific—“keenly empathetic nerves tasting arrogance, sorrow, reckless hope”—and diction stays within her plausible lexicon. Rhythm swells with the tranquility metaphor, then fractures into short clauses under lantern gold, mirroring her dissolving pulse. Vale’s single whispered line carries subtext, accepting the paradox without explanatory dialogue.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory or emotional information without paraphrase loops. Metaphors are coherent—tranquility “folds noise into spines,” invitation “rustles like trapped moth”—and physically consistent. No filter-verb stacks; body and environment integrate through action. One mixed image—“heartbeat of the secret library” applied to marble—teeters on personification overload but is saved by immediate tactile follow-through, keeping the beat above artifact penalty.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The library-as-parasitic-tranquility, absorption-by-paper, and metro-map hiding-in-plain-sight synthesize fresh angles on secret-society tropes. The empathic recluse who solves guilt by becoming the library’s diffuse conscience is a non-obvious arc that feels inevitable after the invitation’s blanking. Risk-taking—protagonist dissolves into pure hush—heightens stakes without losing clarity. One hairline slip: massacre backstory is familiar trigger; the innovation is in the vanishing remedy, not the precipitating sin.</comment>
