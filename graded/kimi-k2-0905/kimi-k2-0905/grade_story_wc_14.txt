<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Aurelia’s interiority—her need to “collect textures of different times” and her fear of “exhaust[ing] the world’s longing”—is concrete and embodied; the lamp’s vibration traveling “through her wrist bones” shows embodied emotion under pressure. The final renunciation—launching the forgery as ash that fertilizes real trees—pays the prior causality with visible cost: her notepad is “lighter by one forgery, heart heavier by one truth.” The only flaw is a touch of diagnostic self-awareness mid-epiphany (“she understood the silence was not absence but fullness”), a hairline slip that keeps this just outside the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each sensory texture she records refracts back into living seed, tightening the pattern until the final ash-snow reweights meaning. Closure is a crystallized Charged Poise: the lamp dims to “ember,” the bonsai grow full-sized, and the town’s silence is now “seeded” with futures she must keep inventing—cost felt without exposition. Orientation is taught by line 3 (“the town went silent”) and anchors hold; no causal breaks. One hairline slip: “the labyrinth was reading her inventories” drifts toward personification convenience, but the image immediately pays off in sap and wire, so the lens stays intact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The bonsai labyrinth is not backdrop but instrument: copper wire “snaps” under expanding trunks, volcanic stone cracks under root pressure—environment literally reshapes the final image. The fluorescent lamp’s porcelain base and C-sharp hum constrain her tactile choices (she kneels, touches, folds the glider) and charge the closing ember. Micro-setting inside her shop’s “blank sheets” repeats the seed conceit, looping exterior transformation back to interior craft. Specificity is irreplicable; remove the lamp or the wire-trees and the closure collapses.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—her compulsion to externalize invented pasts—tightens when the labyrinth begins to “grow real what had been only ink,” foreclosing the option to stop forging. The price is dramatized: she loses a sheet and must bear the heavier truth that “history is a bonsai, pruned by desire.” Escalation is textural: density increases until copper snaps and dawn brightens like paper to flame. Cost is visible—the ash snow fertilizes real decades—meeting the 8+ threshold, though the beat is singular rather than multiply braided.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: history as cultivar—pruned, wired, and lit by human longing—arrives through the final image of ash snow seeding future silences. No character articulates the thesis; the closing smile is “incandescent restraint,” letting the reader reweight prior forgeries as necessary fictions. The bonsai-lamp convergence reprises every sensory texture she ever sold, turning commerce into ecology without moralizing. Complexity lingers: the town’s need for soft pasts is both tender and parasitic, unresolved yet fully felt.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is saturated with stationer’s perceptual signature: paper held to candle, calligrapher’s-stroke glass, wax that smells of “cedar and smoke.” Syntax lengthens and compresses like breath—long cadences for climb, staccato for wire-snap—without drumbeat monotony. No head-hopping; third-person stays pinned to Aurelia’s body and tools. The diction never exceeds her craft lexicon, and the hum-to-C-sharp motif is patterned early, paid off in the final chord.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Density is extreme—almost every sentence layers metaphor, sensory data, and plot advance—yet maintains clarity because each image is rooted in a tactile prop (notepad, lamp, wire). No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; “luminescence,” “static,” “velvet” recur only when meaning has shifted. One mixed-metaphor risk: “light restrained by fog, sound restrained by absence” could read abstract, but the next clause grounds it in bark texture. The final ash-snow image lands clean, propelling the thematic reprice without figurative muddle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The fusion of bonsai pruning, fluorescent hum, and forged ration cards is idiosyncratic and inevitable—no other story could host this exact synthesis. The conceptual leap that counterfeit decades can be biosynthesized into living timber feels fresh yet foreshadowed by the monks who “soldered” trees with copper. Risk is taken: lyric accumulation over causal reversals, but the pattern is taught early and closure remains legible. The insight that collective nostalgia must be cultivated like dwarfed trees reframes a familiar theme through unforgettable particulars.</comment>
