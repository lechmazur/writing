<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias’s hoarding of voices is a vivid, embodied obsession; every crawl-axis motion is freighted with micro-choices (where to slide the next reel, which knothole to breathe through). The contradictory pull—secrecy vs. the need to be heard—peaks when he pushes his own tape under the floor so the girl can “see” him; the cost (permanent exposure, eviction from ghost-status) is felt in the hush before the lights return. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak; even “stories are lanterns” is delivered as a recorded artifact, not authorial sermon. The only flaw: the girl’s interiority is ventriloquised through Elias’s perception, so the relationship crucible is one-sided, capping the top band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the grid surges but the library holds its breath, re-weighting Elias’s invisible labor into a shared, audible future. Causality is causal-lite yet intact: because he cached → because outage → therefore voices rise → therefore girl joins → therefore he is seen; each step narrows his anonymity to zero. The Orientation Test is passed by line 6 (who=under-floor man, where=library crawl-space, when=dawn outage). No lens ambiguity; pattern is accumulative but the ending reconfigures under a single, undeniable social cost—he can never be a ghost again. Persistent constraint: once the girl knows, his solitude is permanently foreclosed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Library is rendered as a vertical stack of micro-terrains: copper pipes that once carried steam now carry breath, biography aisles that double as acoustic funnels. The ferromagnetic flake itself becomes a tactile setting shard—its oxide “dried-blood” surface lets us feel the room’s humidity and history in one touch. Spatial choreography is flawless; every reel’s journey (pipe chase → knothole → floor gap) is trackable in 3-D. Light is used as topography: sapphire emergency glow = ceiling plane; candle = table plane; darkness = crawl-space plane, all intersecting at the moment of visibility. The environment literally channels sound upward, forcing the final choice to surface.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will the cached voices reach a living listener—tightens once: outage → silence → voices can be risked. Escalation is accumulative rather than causal-chain; each new reel pushed through a gap adds decibel-pressure until the girl’s attention crystallizes. No reversible setback, but the final tightening (his own voice exposed) carries visible price: loss of invisibility. Cost is legible in the girl’s palm on the floorboards—social recognition that ends his exile. Agency is minimal but sufficient for 700 words; still, one more intermediate obstacle (a failing flashlight, a collapsing joist) could have pushed this into the 9-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the literal underground of memory: cultural transmission is a physical, vulnerable act—oxide flakes, copper dust, human breath. The final image (girl reading aloud while grid surges) reweights every prior cache as collaborative, not salvage. Subtext operates in gesture: the girl’s silent lip-movement before any voice rises shows she already carries the library inside her; Elias’s tapes merely give her body permission to speak. No moralizing—just the charged ambiguity that remembrance needs both hoarder and heir, and the cost is the hoarder’s disappearance into the heard.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited hugs Elias’s perceptual curve: his synesthetic slide from “lavender water” to “sapphire hush” is idiosyncratic, not authorial pretty. Rhythm mimics crawl-motion: long sentences for elbow-slides, fragments for reel-drops. No head-hopping; girl’s interiority is inferred through floor-gap observation, keeping focalization pure. Diction stays within a self-taught librarian’s lexicon—“ferromagnetic,” “duende,” “conduit”—never drifts into MFA purple. Voice tension peaks when his younger recorded voice utters the lantern line: past-Elias becomes an external antagonist to present-Elias, a split achieved without POV rupture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentence variety is virtuosic: participial openers for stealth (“Moving through...”), noun-phrase telescopes for memory (“A lullaby, a recipe, a bar-mitzvah stumble”), abrupt declaratives for exposure (“She sees me”). No scaffold loops; each reel mention adds new sensory angle rather than synonym churn. Metaphor density is high but patterned—lanterns, moths, constellations—so the final “constellation of voices” feels earned, not last-minute ornament. Minor overworld filter-verb cluster in “he felt the fragments stirring” could have been cut to heighten immediacy, but it lands outside the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Premise flips the post-apocalyptic hoarder trope: instead of canned beans, it’s canned voices; instead of bunker, it’s bibliography. The library-as-instrument conceit (floorboards = speaker grille, pipes = amplifier) is fresh, non-obvious, and inseparable from climax. Risk is taken—quiet, lyric, no villain—and coherence holds. Micro-detail like “Lorca, 1936—last reading” roots the fantastical frame in verifiable history, preventing allegorical drift. Not quite 9+ because the girl’s recognition beat edges toward sentimental wish-fulfillment; a hair more ambiguity on whether she truly “sees” him could have pushed higher.</comment>
