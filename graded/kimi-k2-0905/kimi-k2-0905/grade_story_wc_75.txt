<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aurelia’s shift from cataloguer to co-maker is dramatized through her fingers learning dough, not declared; the Chen grandmother’s pushback supplies external pressure that forces the change. Interiority stays concrete—opera glass weight, flour like frost—without diagnostic labels. One beat of micro-choice (she sets down the lens and picks up dough) crystallizes the cost: she forfeits her detached stance. The earned renunciation is legible and scaled to the length; only the beekeeper’s absence feels slightly convenient rather than compelled.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the opera glass clears, reweighting the premise that culture is preserved behind glass. Accumulative lens dominates—each bread loaf, woven bee, and sung song thickens the texture until meaning flip. The final image of “H for home” carries undeniable conceptual cost: her professional identity is subsumed into the living archive. No causal contradictions; the early mosaic shards knit cleanly under the waterfall lullaby.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Environment rules are learned through action: ice bridges melt, dough rises, waterfall roar modulates attention. The grotto’s limestone alcoves and stalagmites draped in tapestries are not toured but navigated—bodies tuck, bread bakes, voices echo. The opera glass functions as micro-setting that constrains her gaze until it clears; the waterfall’s indifference charges the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless; no impossible positions or floating rooms.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rescue vs. witness—tightens when the Chen women hijack the education center, foreclosing Aurelia’s observer option. The thaw complicates but does not resolve; the reversal is internal, signaled by the glass clearing. Agency is continuous: she photographs, distributes, then kneads. Cost is visible: her curator identity dissolves into floury fingernails.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of rescue: the saved become saviors of the saver. Subtext lives in gestures—an imperfect “M” loaf, reed bee trembling—never sermonized. The final image of “H for home” offers resonant non-literal answer without moral tag. Complexity is preserved: displacement is irreversible, yet culture mutates rather than dies.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person voice stays close to Aurelia’s perceptual filter—emerald tint, careful script, rosewater dread—without head-hop. Syntax lengthens when she catalogs, shortens when she kneads, mirroring attention shift. Dialogue is minimal but distinct: grandmother’s “museum lady” jab carries oral punch against Aurelia’s elevated diction. No filter-verb stacks; compression is taught early (“donated by families who carried nothing else”) and paid off in final portable archives.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with pressure—catalogue sentences cascade, dough moments contract. No mixed metaphors; “flour whitening her dark hair like premature frost” is precise. Information density high: one sentence labels, embodies, and foreshadows. Zero loops or scaffold; even repeated “waterfall” serves as sonic metronome rather than filler.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The displacement-to-bakery inversion feels fresh because specificity is non-negotiable: limestone alcoves, rosewater dread, emerald lens. Opera glass as archiving tool turned truth-revealer is a tangible innovation. Risk of lyrical mosaic pays off: fragments teach pattern by 25% and cohere in sung bread. Could tip higher if beekeeper’s absence carried a sting of consequence rather than thematic convenience.</comment>
