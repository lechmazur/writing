<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mira’s “watchful dreamer” nature is asserted early and re-anchors the final beat, but interior contradiction is only asserted, not dramatized in-scene; the buried-USB choice is causally thin. Earned cost exists in the final image yet feels conceptual, not personally staked. Micro-choices under pressure are present (record, bury, leave) yet register as ritual rather than irreversible fork. Voice stays coherent, but emotional embodiment is more lyrically declared than body-felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the ant-shadow over fresh earth reweights the viral confession into a private seeding, cost legible in the surrender of public voice to underground silence. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of thaw-drip cadence and lichen growth carries escalation; no causal reversals required. Orientation clear by line 4; one soft spatial hand-off (Mira → Elias) is legible. The USB burial is a decisive physical act yet stakes remain atmospheric, slightly thinning the cost ledger. No plot amnesia; image-driven design holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Moss-covered server rack as micro-setting constrains the final burial and mirrors internal reclamation; every sensory note is filtered through Mira’s hush-biased attention. Sound of dripping icicles evolves from ambience to cadence signature, guiding tempo and final signature. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating bodies. World rules stay consistent (no power, no data flow) and learned through touch. Details are economical and POV-colored; no generic cyber-ruin tourism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: seize narrative back from viral exposure by planting an unsharable sequel. Tightening occurs once—Elias offers the tablet, shifting her from fugitive to co-planter; cost is the surrender of control over the next text. Agency is present yet gentle (record, bury, walk away); pressure is situational/atmospheric rather than option-narrowing. No credible resource loss besides the symbolic USB; thus escalation feels lyrical more than tactical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of reclamation-through-burial emerges organically from drip-pattern and ant-in-amber motifs; no overt thesis statement. Final image reweights “going viral” as only the first root; silence and patience become the counter-archive. Subtext of shared wound culture between Mira and Elias operates in gesture, not dialogue. Resists moralizing; ambiguity lingers about whether the seed will ever sprout.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person hovers at consistent psychic distance; diction stays within Mira’s poetic register without academic drift. Patterned repetition (“honeyed hush,” “drip of thawing icicles”) is taught early and paid off in cadence, not artifact. No head-hopping; Elias remains opaque, preserving POV modesty. Rhythm modulates: longer coils for contemplation, clipped fragments at record-button beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Read-aloud ear test passes; sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths create visual swell. Information density high—single sentences fuse sensory, metaphoric, and forward push. One mixed-metaphor risk (“jeans-torn knees of urban explorers”) but resolved quickly. No synonym churn, no scaffold loops. Clean grammar; only minor tense choice (“rested” vs “lays”) at closure but cadence overrides quibble.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fusion of tech-ruin and moss-garden feels fresh; viral-confession aftermath seeded underground is non-obvious. Amber pendant + ant trope is familiar but redeployed as micro-lantern and shadow-caster. Risk-taking in quasi-mythic cadence mostly succeeds; occasional poetic redundancy (“honeyed hush” twice) is the hairline slip. Specificity of lichen-flowered circuits keeps concept anchored.</comment>
