<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Riven’s interior contradiction—obedient courier vs. clandestine promise-healer—drives every beat; the “respectfully rebellious” stance is shown through micro-choices (storm-drop, key-feed) rather than labels. Embodied emotion is vivid (“letters pressed against his ribs”). Final renunciation—trading storm for letters—pays prior causality and carries felt cost. Missing top-band only because mother remains off-page, slightly muting relationship-as-crucible pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: storm-for-letters swap reweights the entire contraband rule-set; rain short-circuits drones, letters fly, border rifles lower—undeniable social cost on the page. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of absent mail → tokens → key → letters—held without leak. Causality: storm-drop causes console speech; tokens cause key; key causes mailbox; each step forecloses options. No orientation debt; spatial anchors (arcade corner, tunnel, fence) taught by ~50 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>“Cobalt arcade at twilight” operates as micro-setting that constrains: neon glare hides him, broken console supplies circuitry, ozone smells guide path. Thunderstorm bottle is object-as-setting whose evolving state (full → empty → regrowing) dictates next move. Concrete specificity: “coin-return slot of the adjacent soda machine that had never worked” gives tactile history. Final rain re-images entire border—setting actively reconfigures stakes, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>Dominant stake—recover devoured letters—signaled in second sentence. Escalation is Accumulative: each found object (tokens, key, mailbox) tightens deliverability until storm-trade finalizes it. Cost is visible: Riven forfeits his weather weapon, stands exposed in tunnel light, shoulders “now-light bottle”—empty, useless if guards return. One meaningful deepening when console speaks in mother’s voice; no reversal, but sufficient for 600-word frame.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</question><comment>Theme emerges from concrete postal imagery: absent letters → clandestine delivery → rain as liberated postage. Subtext in gestures: feeding coins into non-working soda machine enacts “respectfully rebellious” philosophy. Final image—dry envelopes on every doorstep—offers non-literal answer: reunion is possible only inside the hush between sending and receiving. No sermon; complexity intact: border guards still exist, truce is “temporary.”</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly pinned to Riven’s perceptual filter: “neon veins flickering like dying stars” is his professional gaze; “letters pressed against his ribs” is courier embodiment. Rhythmic control: long breathless sentences for tunnel trek, then short clause “He walked back” cadence mirrors exhaustion. No head-hopping; drone’s hum remains external. Filter verbs minimal, used only when courier habit dictates (“he recognized”).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>High information density: single sentence anchors arcade, time, patch, and drone. Metaphors stay coherent (storm, neon stars, hornet) without crowding. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or tactic. Occasional elevated diction (“clandestine promises”) fits poetic mode taught early. No artifact touches closure beat; final line heartbeat metaphor lands clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Fresh synthesis: postal noir + climate contraband + arcade necromancy. Thunderstorm-in-bottle as emotive contraband is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. “Respectfully rebellious” politicizes every micro-gesture without slogans. Risk of lyric density paid off at closure when rain rewrites border logic. Could not swap setting or object without collapsing entire conceit.</comment>
