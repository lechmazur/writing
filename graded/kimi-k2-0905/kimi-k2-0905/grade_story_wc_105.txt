<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—collecting absences while denying her own complicity—drives every beat; the final press of ear to iron crystallizes her hierarchy of values with visible cost. The brother remains off-stage, so relationship-as-crucible tests are waived; her micro-choices under keeper pressure suffice. One hairline slip: “chosen doubt over belief” is articulated rather than embodied just before the forge beat, keeping her just shy of 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the obsidian shard reweights the premise—future aids must reveal hush, not amplify sound—with undeniable social cost. Accumulative lens holds: pattern of sensory translations (heat→cello, crack→russet, fragrance→pale-gold forgiveness) tightens once when her own complicity is etched, foreclosing the old goal. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) taught by word 60 (“rusted keels…drowned valley”), waiver applies.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The forge’s lavender coals and the lifeboat-hulls-as-planters constrain Mara’s tactical choice—she must press flesh to iron to complete the imprint—charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: sound-color synesthesia filters every descriptor, no tourist catalog. Micro-setting (obsidian flake cooling at her feet) literalizes the cost and is handled on the page.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“capture the sound of trust breaking”—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightens once when the waveform captured includes her own complicity, foreclosing the innocence she arrived with. Cost is legible: the orchard drinks the fresher wound, petals chime regret. Escalation is accumulative: each sensory translation adds density until the final russet hemorrhage; no causal reversals are required under this lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete pattern: absence is a shaped cavity, forgiveness is a sound-color translated, not declared. Final image of trees holding “wound and blossom in the same breath” reweights prior material without moralizing. One minor echo: “space that must be heard to be bridged” flirts with thesis-statement, but immediate sensory follow-through preserves resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric remains tightly focalized through Mara’s synesthetic ear; perceptual signature is consistent—iron tastes, coals breathe cello, fragrance sounds pale-gold. Rhythm modulates with pressure: longer clauses in greenhouse calm, staccato fragments at forge contact. No dialogue contamination; keeper’s single line carries subtextual command.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry triple duty—image, sensory translation, thematic tilt—without scaffold: “metal sang, and her device etched the waveform onto a flake of obsidian cooling at her feet.” One near-loop: “cells divide” is repeated at opening and near-end; because it frames biological inevitability the repetition reads purposeful rather than artifact. No mixed metaphors under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Synthesis of synesthetic sound-capture with drowned shipwreck orchard is non-obvious and inseparable from plot logic; removal collapses the imprint mechanism. The “collecting absences” conceit reframes silence as positive artifact, fresh angle on memory stories. Risk—lyric accumulative structure—heightens meaning without obscuring closure; payoff justifies gamble.</comment>
