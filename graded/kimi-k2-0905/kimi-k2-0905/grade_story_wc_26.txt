<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is concrete—her mother’s stone, the warming pulse, the decision to swallow the planet—yet the “shadow unbound” is asserted more than dramatized, so the contradictory-impulses test is only half-passed. The final renunciation is earned and costly, but the moment of internal fracture (the shadow slipping out) is summarized rather than felt in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira locks her heartbeat inside the vault, trading her visible life for the unshareable hope-stone—a conceptual cost that reweights the world rule-set. The causal chain (stone warms → footage comparison → shadow exits → swallowing the planet) holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens; every beat accumulates luminous regret until the final blank sky. Orientation is taught by ~90 words; pattern holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The glass balcony, orchid-walls exhaling perfume, and the stone-as-planet micro-setting constrain every choice; the library’s archived-dream pollen literally forces Mira’s final stance. Spatial choreography is clean across the single continuous scene. Weather is absent, but the “rain that will never fall again” is evoked as lost possibility—an economical, POV-filtered detail that charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve unshareable hope—signals in sentence four and tightens when the stone’s starlight proves hope can be alienated. One meaningful deepening: the footage comparison reveals the stone’s metamorphosis, foreclosing the option to keep hope externally. Cost is legible: Mira pays with her own vanishing. Shadow-as-second-heart adds texture but does not escalate further; still, agency drives every turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: commodified dreams versus unshareable memory. The stone’s shimmer and the blank sky reprice “hope” from public good to private extinction. Final image—library heavier by one unalgorithmic story—offers conceptual cost that lingers. No moralizing; resonance arises from the stone’s orbit inside her absent chest.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: “orchid-walls exhaled their evening perfume,” “violet that bled across the sky.” Compression is taught early (“sharp-eyed dusk noticer”) and paid off in the blank reel. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens from panoramic watch to intra-chest planet. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses when stone warms, lengthening as planet spins.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is near-flawless: high density, zero loops, no scaffold. One mixed metaphor—“folding hope and regret together like wings”—is permissible at the emotional crest. Sentence variety and paragraph cuts serve momentum. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge the motif. Register stays within Mira’s scholar-poet lexicon.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise—shareable dreams versus unshareable dusk—is fresh, extrapolated to a mother-daughter stone planet orbiting inside a vanished chest. Risk of blank-sky ending is embraced and pays off. No template echoes; the library-above-clouds and heartbeat-in-drawer feel inevitable to this story only. Transformation test passed: swap any detail and the emotional engine collapses.</comment>
