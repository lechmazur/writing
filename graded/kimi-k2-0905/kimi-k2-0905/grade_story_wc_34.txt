<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lyra’s contradictory impulse—preserve vs. release—drives every beat; the bolt-plate empties, the echo dissolves, and the cost (her voice now communal property) is legible. Interiority stays embodied in ozone-taste and copper hum. The only slip: “tasting metal” edges diagnostic-speak, blunting full embodiment at the hinge moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the graffiti glyph “open mouth curved into a listening ear” reweights the premise—needs are no longer hoarded but broadcast. Causality holds: because she relinquishes the petals, the moths rise and the city receives the code. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern (petal→pigment→moth→broadcast) taught by 25 % and deepens to anthem hue. Cost is unmistakable: the bolt plate is empty, the echo gone, her solitude surrendered.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The courtyard’s marble warmth under knees, copper plate singing in thunder, and mist that leans closer act as micro-setting that constrains her kneeling release. Ozone-rose air and bioluminescent moths tether every sensory note to the stakes. Spatial choreography stays clean as she descends cloud-ladders materializing under footfall. Environment is not backdrop; it is the resonating body that turns pigment into broadcast.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—articulate unspoken needs before thunder erases them—tightens when the echo accuses “You’re encoding us away,” forcing the choice to relinquish rather than hoard. One meaningful deepening: petals lifted from shield to sky reweight the stake from private preservation to communal transmission. Cost is visible in the empty bolt plate and dissolved echo. Pressure accumulates under Accumulative lens; no causal reversal needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges: shared vulnerability is the only antidote to isolation. Subtext lives in the glyph-ear that listens instead of sings. No moralizing—final image of child reading “I am lonely too” lets resonance arrive through concrete reception. Ambiguity remains: the city may still ignore the code, but the broadcast itself is the irrevocable act.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet controlled; syntactic parallelism (“petals…petals…petals”) teaches pattern early and pays off in fireworks of release. Diction stays within a balladeer’s lexicon—chord, static, lute, sonar—without strain. Perceptual signature is atmospheric and sonic, mirroring her craft. No head-hop; focalization remains tightly interior to Lyra.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from long breathy coils to fragment sparks (“Thunder finally arrived”). Figurative density is high but patterned—every metaphor is electrical or musical, sustaining coherence. No loops or scaffold; each image advances stake or sensation. Occasional elevated diction (“bruised chromas”) is justified by artist-PoV.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses storm-graffiti with emotional Morse code—fresh synthesis. Risk: lyric overload could collapse into purple, but disciplined motif keeps it airborne. Transformation test fails if petals→broadcast removed; entire arc collapses. Specificity of copper bolt plate, lightning-slag stylus, and binary-moth wings renders trope new.</comment>
