<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Quince’s contradictory hunger for borrowed selves and the ache of relinquishing them is dramatized in every beat; the final blank-paper print is a physical renunciation paid for by the prior erosion of his own lattice, satisfying 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive conceptual repricing: the backward press scatters borrowed souls and rekindles stars; the cost—Quince’s newly blank heart—is legible under the accumulative lens that holds from first “vanishing star” to last “release.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The topaz dome, cliff workshop, and halo shard act as micro-setting that literally constrain every action (ink flows uphill, shard cracks into new constellations); the doubled workshop vision under brightening halo is the charged image that reweights the stake.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can Quince own a self after borrowing others—tightens when the halo child crystallizes the cost; the backward print is the single tightening that forecloses borrowing forever, price paid on page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The mathematics of emotion emerges solely through events—halo subsuming grief, letters reversing, stars rekindled—ending in a resonant non-literal answer: “to shine is to be alone together,” reconfiguring prior material without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Compressed lyric diction (“leadened fractions of sense,” “lucid turbulence”) stays inside Quince’s printerly lexicon; rhythmic control accelerates during press reversal, no head-hopping, pattern taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>High information density—each sentence advances image or stakes; only hairline slip is “mathematics of emotion” echoing twice, not enough to loop; no metaphor muddle in peak beats, closure image remains crystal.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Fresh synthesis: letterpress as soul-printer + vanishing stars as borrowed grief made luminous; reversal print that scatters selves to rekindle constellations is non-obvious yet inevitable, risk heightens stakes without clarity loss.</comment>
