<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The guardian’s muteness-origin flashback lands late yet still tilts her present stance; the mirrored star-helix choice is embodied and irreversible. Interior contradiction is present but compressed into lyric cadence rather than dramatized beat-by-beat. The coat-as-wing, ankle-kiss of wet plank, and tear-taste are vivid, specific, and fused to motive. No second on-page character means status/relationship bullets are waived; the solitary crucible holds.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the darkness “learns” to cradle starlight, reconfiguring the canal’s meaning with undeniable conceptual cost—the child’s transformed into protected constellation. Causality is accumulative/textural: each shutter placement thickens pattern density until the mirror-fold re-weights darkness itself. Orientation is taught lyrically—cobalt dock, dental mirror, guardian’s silhouette—disorientation waived because the final image relies on that hush. Persistent constraint: her voicelessness and the drifting shutter lattice that must not snag, both shape tactics and image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The dock-planks, dental mirror, and shutter slats act as micro-setting that literally constrain every tactical move; removing any would break the weave. Weather-soaked wood kissing ankles, canal black as harbor fog, and star-reflection physics are filtered through the guardian’s selective, professional attention. Spatial choreography is pristine: planks, frame, fishing lines, mirror angles all track cleanly. The cobalt dock after rain is not backdrop but crucible—its wet gleam enables the light-fracture mechanics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—teach darkness its own worth—signals early and tightens through each shutter angle adjustment; the meaningful deepening is the mirror-fold that forces darkness to carry rather than consume light. Agency is attentional and renunciatory: she cedes her scream’s echo and offers starlight away, paying with permanent solitude. Cost is legible: the drifting apart of shutters equals relinquished control, and the canal’s new under-glow will outlive her. No coincidence; all pressure accrues from her calibrated placements.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: value resides in what seems negation—darkness re-recognized as caretaker. The child’s transfiguration into protected star-cluster reprises the drowned footsteps cargo, re-weighting loss into cosmic guardianship without moralizing. Subtext operates in glimmers, hushes, the taste of tear on lip. Final image of bargemen lowering voices gives concrete social after-effect, proving the conceptual repricing has propagated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person hovers at sensorial distance, mirroring the guardian’s silent exteriority; diction stays within her plausible lexicon (“minnows,” “cypress,” “translucent fishing lines”). Syntax elongates then fractures to mimic spiral weave—no head-hop, no filter-verb bloat. Compression like “spiralingly calm” is patterned early and paid off at closure. Voice is singular, oceanic, unreadable to bargemen—exactly the point.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with tide-level cadence; sentence length varies to let light ‘drip’ or ‘sketch helix.’ Figurative density is high yet coherent—vehicles nest rather than collide. One paraphrase loop detected (“darkness…darkness”) but it serves incantatory payoff, not sloth. No mixed metaphors in peak beat where mirror folds starlight onto water.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Fusing canal-noir with star-weaving mysticism feels non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. The dental mirror as stylus of cosmic pedagogy is a fresh inflection; darkness as pupil rather predator up-ends gothic trope. Risk of wordless lyric paid off via tangible closure image. Specificity of cypress shutters, harbor fog, cobalt plank keeps concept anchored, not quirky.</comment>
