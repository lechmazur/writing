<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s insomnia is embodied in raw eyes and paint-stained choices; the grandmother’s brooch becomes a tactile obsession that warms under pressure. Contradictory impulses—yearning for meaning while mocking her own failure—stay active in scene, not summary. The final renunciation of insomnia as gift is earned through causal interaction with the tidal ruins and the old woman’s recognition. Micro-choice hierarchy is legible: paint what the water revealed → accept vial → sleep, each step priced with forfeiture of old certainties.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the vial of pre-war water and the transformed insomnia reweight the entire quest. Causality holds under Accumulative lens—spiral shells, brooch warmth, and fresco bleeds tighten pattern until the final image crystallizes options. Cost is unmistakable: Mara trades her vigilance for a dream-filled sleep, forfeiting the monk-like watch that defined her. Lens stays coherent; no orientation debt; one shard, one transition, one deepening.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Basalt causeway, half-drowned monastery, and salt-stained frescoes are filtered through sleepless painter’s eye—color values shift with tide and exhaustion. Rain trails function as tactile pathfinding device, guiding feet and decision alike. Brooch acts as micro-setting: amber depths constrain attention and later warm against skin to cue buried spirals. Spatial choreography survives the tidal flux; no impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—thresh meaning from artistic failure—tightens when the only currency left is insomnia itself. Mid-scene deepening occurs at shell spirals: recognition that pattern exists beyond individual failure reweights the quest from personal to post-human scale. Cost is visible: Mara must relinquish her sleepless perch to gain the water that never knew war. Escalation is accumulative, not causal, but pressure coheres under lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from water’s memory versus human forgetting; no overt thesis stated. Painted monastery as breathing hybrid of earth/sea offers non-literal answer to “what survives war?” Subtext sits in the shard of pottery whose fishermen now float on vanished oceans—image carries implication without sermon. Final vial reweights meaning: purity is not escape but recognition of contamination.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person psychic distance stays tight to Mara’s raw perceptions; no head-hop. Syntax lengthens with fatigue, then fractures during feverish painting—rhythm mirrors sleeplessness. Diction stays within painter’s lexicon: pigments, fresco, basalt, amber. Rain trails and spiral shells recur as perceptual signature rather than token symbols. No dialogue contamination; old woman’s diction is driftwood-gnarled, distinct from Mara’s interior palette.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm with sentence-length modulation; no template cadence. Figurative density peaks during fresco description yet stays anchored to physical logic. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. Minor register lift in “unearthed convergence” is earned by context and paid off at closure. No scaffold or filler; pronoun tracking clean across tidal movement.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Post-apocalyptic memory-exchange market reframed through insomniac painter and tidal monastery yields fresh synthesis. Spiral shells as prehistoric text, brooch as geothermal sensor, and rain trails as cartography collapse genre tropes into lyric artifact. Risk of poetic overload is held in check by concrete cost—sleep itself—so experimentation heightens rather than obscures. Transformation test passed: story fails if Mara is a poet or island is desert.</comment>
