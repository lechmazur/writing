<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Maela’s interiority is concrete—her chisel rings, her fingers test wood, her pulse syncs with the lantern’s spin. The spiral burn in the heartwood and her choice to drown the GPS embody earned renunciation with visible cost. No contradiction in motive; every micro-choice (wedging the slide, carving with the grain) reveals her hierarchy of values. The only bar to 9+ is that the storm’s agency slightly overshadows her final proactive beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative-textural lens holds: each salt-stitch of shadow thickens the ledger until the miniature archway crystallizes as Charged Poise. The dissolve of the glass slide into the sculpture is the Decisive Change with conceptual cost—she forfeits technological certainty for timewoven memory. Causality is lyric but coherent: lantern → shadow → carving → fleet kneels → she rows out unguided. No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) arrive within 50 words and pay off at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The basalt archway is not backdrop but ledger—every groove signs a debt that constrains Maela’s choice to gift the carving back to the tide. Micro-setting objects—driftwood fissure, lantern slide, chisel—dictate tactical moves: slide wedged to catch lightning, wood carved “with its memory.” Sensory hierarchy is sculptor-biased: scent of shipwreck and pine pitch guide grain decisions over visual catalog. Final image of glowing miniature arch recharges both stone and wood, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether memory or escape will govern her art—tightens when the spiral projects living debtors; each cut forecloses the safety of generic sculpture. Cost is legible: she sacrifices GPS certainty and the lantern itself, leaving her palms an “unmarked map.” Escalation is textural deepening rather than causal reversal, fitting the accumulative lens. Storm complicates but does not resolve; the final quiet is earned by her carving agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the ledger of rescue: every act of safe passage accrues interest until the sculptor pays with her own certainty. Subtext resides in gesture—shadow fleet kneeling, gulls scattering—never sermonized. The turbine-hum shifts from menace to hush, repricing technology as expendable. Final image refuses tidy moral; ambiguity lingers in “just horizon, just wood.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is carver-specific: verbs of joinery—wedged, scaffold, grain smelled of pitch—remain consistent under storm pressure. Rhythm accelerates with lightning-stitch, breathes during “hush so complete the rocks leaned in.” No head-hopping; single POV holds. Filter verbs are voice-motivated (“she understood then” cues epiphany without leakage). Lyric compression taught early (“turbine-hum reverie”) and paid off in fading oarlocks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or choice. Metaphors are physically coherent: “basalt throat,” “gears of salt and starlight.” Density high—one line can do scent, history, and moral weight. Register stays within sculptor’s lexicon; no thesaurus drift. Closure line “just horizon, just wood, just the next breath of wind” is spare yet charged, re-pruning prior ornament without artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise—carving debt out of storm-lit shadows—feels fresh against familiar “artist at sea” template. Timewoven ledger is non-obvious synthesis of maritime history and personal art. Risk: lyric accumulative structure could have drowned in abstraction, yet specificity of salt-gray wood and GPS-drowning keeps it grounded. Minor deduction for echo of “storm answers first” trope; still, the miniature glowing arch re-configures the trope into earned artifact.</comment>
