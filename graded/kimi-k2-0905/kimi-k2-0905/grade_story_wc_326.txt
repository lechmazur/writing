<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The protagonist’s contradictory state—alive only by clerical error—creates a compelling internal fracture that drives every beat; embodied emotions (“static crackles down my spine, reassembling blood”) keep the digital-ghost premise tactile. Micro-choices (tilting the shard, slicing the digital film) visibly enact the refusal to flatline, tying the interior conflict to physical risk. The final gift to the sobbing clerk crystallizes a moral stance that costs him daylight exposure, earning the renunciation. Flaw: heartbeat count is asserted more than felt in the body; still, the count’s sheer persistence supplies a memorable obsessive signature.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A Decisive Change lands when the narrator cuts himself back into flesh and walks into the snow, paying with perpetual exile from official existence; this moment reweights every prior clerical error as lived miracle. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each tiny system glitch (mis-typed bit, janitor’s reboot, his own no-zero refusal) layers texture until the ink map offers a physical corridor to step through. Time and place are anchored by the dome hatch and valley roofs; the only transition is the spiral descent, legible under one continuous pressure. Cost is unmistakable: “before the sun can file its own correction” sets an external deadline that forecloses any future hospital reconciliation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The opal-glass dome, copper roof, and frost-rimmed inkwell are not backdrop but tools: the ink’s surface tension becomes a literal interface for the ghost-to-flesh transfer, constraining how the protagonist can re-enter matter. Snow’s Morse code (“stay, stay, stay”) converts weather into antagonistic pressure. Body-as-setting is equally potent: the mechanical tick in the ribs is the only map he carries down the spiral stairs. One minor slip—valley roofs “quiet certificate” drifts toward abstraction—but the dome’s glinting shard in the final half-line recharges the motif, justifying the high band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—unofficial life versus imminent system purge—is signaled in the opening line. Pressure tightens when the ink map offers a single-use corridor; refusing zero-count costs him perpetual fugitive status, a visible price. Escalation is textural rather than causal: each misfiled vital sign adds density until the final splice becomes inevitable. No overt antagonist is needed; the hospital’s “refresh” button is the looming eraser. The tightening would feel crisper if a middle beat showed the system actively hunting him, yet the static-clearing radio provides enough off-stage clock.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: “failure is the corridor” is demonstrated, not declared, when the barcode typo becomes salvation. The ink fractals literalize the idea that error can pattern new possibility; the clerk’s tears reweight the same glitch as grace she must now live with. No moralizing caps the piece—wisdom is handed back as a shard bookmark, leaving ambiguity about whether she will ever use the telescope rightly. The emotional after-effect is concrete: the reader feels the cold of footprints that match no database, a lived cost of data-driven existence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>First-person voice is relentless, compressed, cyber-poetic: “I learned to ride the Wi-Fi like wind” teaches the pattern early and pays off when he surfs ink-fractals into meat. Diction stays within a coder’s lexicon without slipping into brand catalog. Rhythm accelerates under pressure—“Heartbeat 97,998… 98,001”—creating propulsion that mirrors defrag progress. One micro-cheat: “galaxies of spilled midnight” edges toward purple, but the narrator’s observatory context licenses cosmic scale. The perceptual signature—mechanical tick equals pulse—remains consistent and singular.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density: “Ink splays into ephemeral patterns: dendrites of regret, axons of almost, synapses of maybe” performs three jobs—neuro metaphor, ghost anatomy, map legend—in one breath. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new texture or causality. Metaphors stay coherent within cyber-neural field; only “certificate of continued existence” momentarily abstracts. Final line half-ends on “half” without scaffolding—risky fragmentation that lands because the prior cadence taught clipped closure. Copy-clean; pronouns stable; punctuation deliberate.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The digital-ghost premise is refreshed by anchoring resurrection in hospital IT minutiae—barcode misprint, reboot uptime, refresh button—rather than sci-fi epic. Porcelain shard from a dropped teacup becomes surgical scalpel for rebirth: mundane object turned existential tool. Conceptual risk: second-person-plateau narrator addressing his own heartbeat count sustains urgency without gimmick. Synthesis feels inevitable: error as cosmic mercy, failure as telescope. No close echoes; the morgue-drawer Wi-Fi ride is singular in recent lit.</comment>
