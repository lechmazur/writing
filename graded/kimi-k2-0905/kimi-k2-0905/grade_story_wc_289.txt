<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The ghostwriter’s interiority is lyrically specific—her hesitation chimes the pontoon, her laugh startles doves—but her contradictory impulses (to keep vs. release secrets) are summarized more than dramatized. The moment she presses palms to warm marble is embodied, yet the prior “years of forging hearts” is abstract back-story. The final recognition of her own heartbeat lands as earned because the causal thread of color-sentences circles her skin. Still, we never see her actually refuse or choose a concrete next act, only a lyrical exit, so the cost is felt but not fully incised.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the twig galaxy dissolves, the red thread beats, and she walks forward “lighter by the exact weight of one thrush’s nest.” Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each image (lotus petal, color-thread, paper airplane) layers density until the final image reweights the premise: telling is the connective tissue. The orientation anchor (who/where/when) is taught by the second sentence and paid off when the pond tilts its mirror. Cost is legible in the hush of color across still water that answers “We know.”</comment>

<comment>The lotus temple is not backdrop but actor: petals flex, marble warms, the oculus projects a vein-searching thread that literally snares her twig. Micro-setting inside her coat pocket—twig helix cradling “someone else’s future”—constrains her choice to surrender it. Weather (post-cloud-burst) licenses the prismatic light that becomes the story’s language. Spatial choreography is vivid yet weightless: floating pontoon, circling doves, paper airplanes threading the oculus. Final image of moonlit water answering back makes the environment speak, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—“will she release the secrets she ghost-wrote into the world?”—tightens when the temple’s thread lifts her twig and frays into floating sentences. The reversal is micro but decisive: from hoarding to surrendering the words. Agency is lyrical rather than literal—she kneels, palms warm marble, but the temple does the weaving—yet the cost (her nest crumbles, she walks lighter) is visible. Under Accumulative lens, the deepening occurs through color-density, not causal turns, and the final beat narrows her future to barefoot, thunder, thread.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without abstraction: the act of telling, not love itself, is the red thread. Subtext is woven into gesture—setting the twig where the thread “dissolves” exteriorizes her hidden archive. The ending’s door-graffiti reprise (“come barefoot, come thunder, come thread”) crystallizes the thematic wager: vulnerability is the price of re-entry. No moralizing—just the hush of color across water answering “We know”—delivers resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is perceptually signature: rain “flings back coloured light,” sentences float “like silk scarves,” the temple “inhales her hesitation.” Lyric elision is taught early (“a thought too delicate to speak aloud”) and paid off when doves become paper airplanes. Syntax modulates from long breathless cadences to the final staccato heartbeat “I am here.” No head-hopping; the camera stays inside her skin. Register remains within the ghostwriter’s poetic lexicon; even graffiti reads as her own hand.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally: cumulative anaphora (“come barefoot, come thunder, come thread”) builds to a drummer’s crescendo without template monotony. Metaphors are coherent—lotus petals as moon-white stone, thread as vein—each re-appears to charge closure. No scaffold loops; every image does double duty (chiming footfall = hesitation made sound). Minor purple moments (“prismatic quiet”) are pattern-taught and payoff-linked, so forgiven. Opening and final lines pass the read-aloud ear test.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—ghostwriter of anonymous love letters forced to publish her own silence—feels fresh, yet the lotus-temple-as-loom turns it mythic. Risk: lyric accumulation could have drifted into vague luminism, but specificity of the twig spiral, the oculus projection, and graffiti re-root it. Transformation test fails if swapped to generic poet; the occupational detail of forging letters is inseparable from the color-sentences that circle her skin. Final reprise of thrush rebuilding nest externalizes the cycle without moral, achieving conceptual integrity.</comment>
