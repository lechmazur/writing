<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marisol’s contrarian turn from state mouthpiece to truth-gravedigger is crisply signaled; her tactile micro-choices (humming the sign-off tone, threading the diamond on root-fiber) enact the shift with cost. Interiority stays sensorial—copper-shame, vacuum hush—rather than diagnostic. The final renunciation (hanging the stone) is earned because her hands already sting with its playback. Only the “amnesia everyone else scavenged” line drifts toward label-speak, blunting the edge a hair.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the diamond becomes a public conscience, hung to rot the orchard’s lie-fruit. Causal chain holds—shredded confetti → hexagon bark → resonance open → broadcast of lies—with the stillpoint widening as visible cost. Orientation anchors by line 3; no debt. The playback sequence is the tightening beat that forecloses her return to silence. Cost is legible in the browning apples and the Geiger’s scream reborn.</question>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>“Paradise” gate half-melted, hexagonal scars mapping onto confetti tessellation, and the glass-root spiral are welded to choice: they teach her how to open the earth. The Geiger’s silence inside the stillpoint functions as micro-setting that forces tactics (hum the tone). Sensory hierarchy skews tactile & auditory—exactly what a lone walker would track under dust hiss. Environment directly constrains the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</question>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—excavate her own complicity—arrives with the first apple and tightens when her own voice plays back. Escalation is a single deepening: the diamond’s curse shifts from external rumor to internal inventory. Agency is continuous (kneel, hum, hang). Cost is conceptual yet visceral: the orchard rots faster than radiation, proving truth lethal. No reversal, but the cadence shift suffices under Accumulative lens.</question>

<comment>Theme—truth as corrosive sacrament—emerges through the orchard’s inverse Eden: knowledge kills immortality. Subtext operates in silence: the Geiger’s hush is the loudest confession. The final image (brown apples) reweights the Coalition’s glossy lies without moralizing. No thematic echo lines; image does the talking.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is irradiated, compressed, synesthetic: “radioactive dust hissed,” “apples refused to fall.” Syntax mirrors Marisol’s cataloguing mind—paratactic fragments when sorting confetti, then longer coils during playback. Diction stays within her scavenger lexicon; no academic register drift. Perceptual signature is sharp-observer specific: she notices temperature drop, lattice scars, sign-off pitch.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Density is high—each sentence carries sensory payload and causal leg: “hexagonal scars…taught the bark to crystallize” does two jobs. Metaphors stay coherent (angry cicada, vacuum hush) and do not crowd peak beats. One paraphrase loop: “comfortable lies had grown teeth, and she meant to pull them” → “shovel cut her own hands” is acceptable thematic echo. Rhythm breathes: long sentence for orchard sigh, staccato for playback. No filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fusion of post-Chernobyl orchard, archive-confetti cartography, and conscience-diamond is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risk: turning a Geiger counter into a moral metronome—paid off when it falls silent then screams again. The hexagon lattice threading paper → bark → root glass is a fresh inflection that could not survive synonym swap. Conceptual integrity never blinks; speculative biology stays consistent.</comment>
