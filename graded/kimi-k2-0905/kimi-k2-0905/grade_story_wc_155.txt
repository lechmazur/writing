<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Luma’s interior contradiction—grief-emptied yet light-full—drives every micro-choice; the fresco shard’s warmth against her ribs externalizes the conflict, and the final renunciation (pocket empty) costs her present sorrow, foreclosing nostalgia as refuge.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each glaze-layer thickens the fog-screen until the living wall grafts memory onto masonry; the decisive reconfiguration lands when the fragment dissolves into the laughing mural—conceptual cost: joy is now public, vulnerable to weather and witnesses.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fog-as-setting is no backdrop but a hydraulic press of withheld color; the cider-house wall’s “fermented stars” scent constrains her choice of surface, and the wall’s final glow is inseparable from the district’s ruined geography—environment literally hosts the closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaim lost joy—tightens when the Lattice demands a living wall; price is each sigh of sorrow traded for pigment, and the option to keep memory private is foreclosed once the mural becomes public dawn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: joy is not retrieved but developed like exposed film; the final non-literal answer—seven-year-old laughter looping inside ruin—reweights the premise that grief nullifies color, proving instead that color waits inside grief to be risked outward.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is painterly synesthesia—sunbeams as brushstrokes, syllables as “color planets”—maintained under pressure; no head-hopping; diction stays within artist’s lexicon; final sentence’s “vermilion cheek smiling from the mist” is a rhythmic echo of pass-phrase, proving voice control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Syntactic variety mirrors glaze layers—long aqueous sentences alternate with fragment beats; no loops; “pewter quilt,” “prismatic laughter,” “fermented stars” are precise, never mixed; high density—each sentence layers light, memory, or cost; closure line is clean, propelling outward.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Conceptual leap—memory as developable film inside fog-emulsion—feels inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking (light-mural graft) heightens stakes without gimmick; orchard-ruin + fresco + cinema chemistry synthesis is non-obvious yet grounded; transformation test fails if relocated, confirming freshness.</comment>
