<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The narrator’s guilt and need to speak the apology are embodied through the moths/letters and the act of kneeling to offer the shard; the moment of handing it over crystallizes change. The brother remains off-stage, so relationship-as-crucible beats are skipped, yet the interior contradiction—“cruelty could feel like freedom”—is credibly maintained. Micro-choice hierarchy is legible: clutch unsent pain → accept shard → speak → release. Cost is felt in the healed lip and empty pockets. Missing on-page interaction with the brother keeps this just under the 8.8 gate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the spoken apology seeds the future and reweights the window message. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each image (shard, moths, condensation) accretes until the final drop reconfigures meaning. Orientation is taught lyrically by line 4 and repaid at exit, satisfying the waiver. One tightening at the ceiba fork suffices. Cost is visible in the healed cut and empty pockets; no lens contradiction. Sits just outside 9.0 because the brother’s future stance remains prospective rather than confirmed on-page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mangrove roots, salt breath, and moonlit water form a tactile maze that actively closes behind the walker, guiding direction. The gargoyle shard micro-setting serves as both mirror and key, constraining the final choice; its limestone tongue and later pulse act as embodied tools. Sensory hierarchy favors tidal taste and silver light, filtered through the narrator’s tidal-pool obsession. Spatial choreography is clean: fork → window → corridor → return. Environment mirrors internal thaw without overt symbolism. Meets 9- gate by charging the final image with the warm pulsing rainspout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—utter the withheld apology—is signaled in paragraph 2 and escalates when the corridor offers one chance to seed the past. The shard’s transformation and the moths’ release constitute a single meaningful deepening that narrows options from silence to speech. Agency is renunciation plus speech; cost is the forever-loss of the letters and the visible cut healed. Pressure stays accumulative: spirits hush, roots breathe, corridor folds. No external antagonist needed. Sufficient for length, but the prospective payoff (brother “possibly smiling”) softens the felt price a hair.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of return versus irrevocability emerges through iterated images of windows, condensation, and moths carrying syllables; no explicit thesis is stated. Subtext operates in the unvoiced question in the brother’s eyes and the shard’s shift from limestone to breath. Final image of warm rainspout reweights earlier roof-tears as future nurture. Ambiguity lingers: will the brother wait? Complexity is embraced—cruelty once felt like freedom. No moralizing, only seeded consequence. Earned resonance lands via the moths’ lunar flight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>First-person voice sustains a tide-pool lexicon—“barnacle,” “salt and song,” “knotted throats”—without purple drift. Syntax lengthens during wonder, shortens at “I’m sorry,” mirroring breath. No dialogue, so indirection tests are waived. psychic distance stays tight; knowledge remains character-bound. Experimental compression (“breath shaking like a fledgling”) is taught early and repaid. No head-hop. Perceptual signature is consistent and musical, warranting the high band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence detected. Figurative density is high but patterned—moon, salt, breath—teaching the reader by line 6 and paying off in the final drop. No mixed metaphors: mirror-to-breath-to-nothing follows coherent liquefaction. Information density strong: “twenty-seven paper lungs collapsed around verbs too sharp to inhale” performs three jobs. Minor scaffold: “healed in moonlight” repeats three times; however, it functions as refrain, not loop, and powers closure, so only a light tap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Familiar apology quest is re-angled through the mangrove-spirit labyrinth and the gargoyle shard as time-key; synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric accumulation could have collapsed into vagueness, yet specificity (“ceiling of childhood whenever storms remembered our names”) keeps it fresh. Emotional specificity trumps gimmick: the crime remains unnamed, forcing reader projection. Final re-pricing of rainspout from ruin to pulse is non-obvious and earned. Bold structural choice—one continuous dream-corridor—heightens meaning without obscuring clarity.</comment>
