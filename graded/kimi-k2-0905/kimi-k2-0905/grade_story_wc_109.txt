<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The oracle’s interiority is sensorially rich—bare toes gripping salt-slick stone, pulse syncing with a dying star—yet her obsession with “cartographing oblivion” stays abstract, never concretely clashes with another desire. Micro-choices (writing faster as the star dims, accepting mineral patience) embody the mild obsession, but the final self-immolation into map lacks a prior beat that forecloses any alternative path; cost is atmospheric, not character-bound. Still, the voice is singular and the flaw drives every beat; the absence of a second character or status crucible is scope-appropriate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a lyric Resonant Reconfiguration: the oracle steps into her own outline, becoming the first coordinate of an endless night—an earned stasis that forecloses living witness. Causality is Accumulative/Textural: each silenced contour literalized in the booklet thickens the hush until darkness is a liquid weight she can enter; the cost is the fort’s dissolution and her own vanishing, felt on the final page. Orientation anchors (who-where-when) are taught by line 4 and serve the final erasure; no lens ambiguity. One scaffold loop—”suggestion becoming rumor”—dulls the penultimate beat, but closure image remains intact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is a micro-instrument: the fort’s stones groan under absent banners, the flaking booklet sheds gold continents, the last star’s tear stains skin with extinct-sun temperature—each detail constrains the next mark she can make. Spatial choreography is flawless: parapet → crenels → stairwell echo → door recursion. Weather never arrives, caught in amber, which becomes the world-rule; this taught pattern pays off when the fort liquefies into rumor. Sensory hierarchy skews tactile and mineral, mirroring her fossilization lesson. Environment directly supplies the ink (ambered hush) and the paper (blankness beneath scripture), charging the final threshold image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake: finish the map before the last star dies—signaled in line 3. Escalation is density-driven: each symbol (angled bracket, spiral, borderless smudge) consumes available light, tightening the hush until footsteps return delayed and doors recurse. The visible price is the booklet’s growing weight and the fort’s transmutation into suggestion; these constrain her final motion—she can only step into the outline she drew. Agency is accumulative rather than causal-reversal, fitting the lens; one meaningful tightening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the reciprocal cartography of absence: every silence she imprisons on paper re-forms the world outside—pebbles resume breathing, shore re-charts itself. No moral is stated; the final image of absence orbiting a still point reweights earlier pebble-collecting childhood memory into universal process. Subtext operates through hush-metals and fossilized patience; insight is earned, not declared. Complexity is honored: the map both preserves and annihilates, and the oracle’s smile accepts irreversible self-erasure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is a sustained mineral lyric: syntax fossilizes into lapidary clauses (“ Latitude of last lullaby, longitude of unopened farewell”) yet stays within an oracle’s plausible lexicon. Perceptual signature is obsessive-taxonomic—every phenomenon is reduced to a contour or coordinate, teaching the reader the pattern by 25 % mark. Rhythm modulates from long breathless sentences to single stroke fragments as star dims, mirroring cardiac deceleration. No dialogue, no head-hop; POV distance remains deep internal with controlled inference. Compression and elision (“storm-tossed ridge fort dissolved, stone becoming suggestion”) are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is high-density jewelry: one sentence often maps symbol, sensory body, and causal consequence (“she dipped the quill into it, trading motion for stillness one last time”). Mixed-metaphor risk is high yet coherent within amber/fossil/mineral logic. One paraphrase loop subtracts −0.2; no artifacts touch closure beat. Read-aloud rhythm accelerates into monosyllabic final stroke then halts, earning the hush. Copy is clean; no scaffold beyond noted loop.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Premise fuses star-extinction countdown with cartography of silence—fresh synthesis rather than stock apocalypse. The trope of “last oracle” is retooled into recursive self-map, making her both author and first coordinate. Risky second-person echo-footsteps and door-recursion pay off by reifying delayed causality inside amber. Specificity of gold-flake continents drifting apart could not swap into any other tale. Conceptual integrity commits to dissolution without safety-hedge; bold lyric structure heightens meaning without gimmickry.</comment>
