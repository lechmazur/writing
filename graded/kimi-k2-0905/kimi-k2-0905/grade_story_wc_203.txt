<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid and profession-specific; her micro-choices under ghost-pressure reveal a believable split between mechanical competence and existential vertigo. The final refusal to lift the barrel is credibly foreshadowed by the looping image of herself already inside the elevator, so the renunciation carries visible cost. Interior contradiction is shown, not told, and the blown-fuse child ghost acts as an externalization of her own stalled circuits. Minor dip: the “weightless burden” coat metaphor is repeated without fresh twist, slightly flattening the embodied emotion at closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through recursive images (barrel, crack, ticket) rather than causal chains. Closure is a Charged Poise—Mara’s stepping into dawn while holding the warm stub reconfigures the loop without dismantling it, and the cost is the perpetual tension of “keep ascending, cracks and all.” Pattern is taught early (fluorescent buzz = time pulse) and the final flicker’s return pays it off. One micro-turn (ceiling crack reveals her own future) tightens stakes; no orientation debt; no prop teleporting.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The ticket office is rendered through tactile micro-settings—warped linoleum, sagging tile, dustless circle under the barrel—each of which constrains Mara’s body positions and choices. Sensory hierarchy follows her technician gaze: dust patterns read as “Braille,” screws groan like “tired trapeze rigging.” Spatial choreography stays clean as she climbs the desk, pushes tile, accepts the stub. The “crack in time” functions as micro-setting that charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—break or repeat the time-loop—is signaled by the ghost child’s finger-pointing at the ceiling. Escalation is textural: each recursive image (ticket snow, her own silhouette in the elevator) thickens the air until the choice to leave the barrel becomes a stance crystallization rather than a new plot event. Cost is conceptual: she accepts perpetual ascent with cracks, forfeiting the fantasy of perfect repair. No causal reversals, but the tightening of shimmer-ghost ladder suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the impossibility of perfect mending in a vertical life. Recurring “ADMIT ONE TO THE SKY” tickets reprice the premise—every ascent is provisional, every ticket already punched. No moralizing; the final image of dawn lifting the big top as a “white flag stitched with light” offers resonant ambiguity: surrender or enlistment in ongoing climb. Subtext in ghost silence communicates the question better than exposition ever could.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is sharp: elevator cables as “vertical streets,” dust as “Braille,” ghosts as “frost patterns.” Syntax mirrors technician mind—precise nouns, mechanical metaphors, no filter-verb bloat. Rhythm accelerates during tile-push and crack-reveal, then exhales in the final sentence. No head-hopping; POV distance remains tight third-person. Compression (“blown fuses” for eyes) is taught early and paid off in child ghost’s stare.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is mostly impeccable; information density high—“snowfall of ticket stubs dated 1987, each stamped ADMIT ONE TO THE SKY, their edges curled like dead magicians’ ribbons” does three jobs in one breath. One mixed metaphor cluster: “coiled heart intact, ticking so softly only the dead could hear” bundles mechanical and cardiac images without contradiction but edges toward purple. No loops or scaffold; pronoun tracking clean; final sentence cadence earns its sweep.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fusing elevator repair, ghost-seeing, and recursive circus tickets into a single lyrical compression feels inevitable yet fresh. The time-loop is not gimmick—it externalizes the protagonist’s occupational dread of endless maintenance. Risk: letting the climax be a refusal rather than a fix, yet coherence holds. Specificity of “ADMIT ONE TO THE SKY” stubs anchors universality of vertical striving.</comment>
