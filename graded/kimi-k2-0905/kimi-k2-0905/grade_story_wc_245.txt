<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is sensorially rich and embodied; the blind mapmaker’s perception through taste, tremor, and ring-feedback is specific and continuous. Contradictory impulses—yearning for coherence vs terror of self-mapping—are present but stated more than dramatized in-scene, preventing 9+. The final renunciation (carrying the map under skin, never printing) is credibly foreshadowed and carries cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test, but the micro-turn is slightly under-played.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory deposit tightens the emotional stake until the clearing’s hush delivers the resonant reconfiguration. Closure—“quiet blaze inside him kept perfect, fearless time”—is on-page, felt, and irreversible. Orientation is taught early through sonic anchors; no causality break. Cost is legible in the ring’s weight-loss and the sealed clearing. Minor knob: spiral tightening could be one beat sharper to enter 9+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Body, tool (ring), and micro-setting (clearing) constrain every move; ring’s changing weight tracks escalation and charges the final image. Ultrasonic forest rules remain consistent, discovered through action. Sensory hierarchy follows blind POV—sound, touch, taste—never visual cheat. Detail is selective, never touristic; “moss hush between cricket pulses” is economical and urgent. Meets 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—self-mapping versus self-erasure—signaled in paragraph three. Escalation is textural: ring absorbs extinct birds’ consonants, cane dowses toward silence, options narrow to inward or void. Protagonist agency present in every step and final renunciation. Cost visible (ring bloat, sealed clearing) yet slightly abstract; could be sharper to breach 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete sensory particulars: mapping as sightless inscription, emotion as terrain. Final image reframes earlier “quiet blaze” from external glow to internal chronometer—Conceptual Repricing with undeniable cost. No moralizing; resonance built through repeated cartography/self-skin fusion. Ambiguity lingers: will carried map guide or burden? Invites re-read without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyric third-person saturates every clause: syntax elongates then contracts mimicking spiral walk; diction stays within poetic yet blind-professional lexicon. Perceptual signature is relentless—sound-as-taste, wrist-Braille—never lapses into generic narrator. Patterned repetition (“musical notes… notes pressing”) is taught early and paid off in new melody he composes by walking. No head-hop; psychic distance clean. Risk elevates coherence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High figurative density is justified by accumulative design; metaphors stay coherent within sonic/cartographic logic. No mixed vehicles; “grammar of sorrow and wonder braided” is abstract but earned by prior sensory braiding. Rhythm accelerates into spiral, exhales at stillpoint—sentence variety supports. Minor filter-verb cluster (“he knew… he understood”) at climax dulls immediacy; keeps score sub-9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—blind mapmaker who tastes ultrasonic leaves to draft his own grief—feels inevitable yet wholly fresh. Synthesis of cartography, synesthesia, and emotional topology hasn’t appeared in mainstream venues. Risk of lyric overload is embraced and paid off; final internal star-chart carried under skin transforms sailor trope into interior navigation. Elemental specificity (ring drinking alphabet, constellations paused) resists generic transplant.</comment>
