<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The narrator’s interiority is concrete and character-specific (“I had agreed to teach her… knowing the bargain was one of those agreed-upon lies…”), and the micro-choice to accept the seal and interrogate the gargoyle is embodied. Yet the tutor’s transparency and vanishing are declared rather than felt, so the emotional cost of inheriting her role is asserted, not dramatized. The “patiently nimble” trait is shown in parables about cornices, but the narrator’s final shift to “new linguist” is more conceptual than a visible, costly renunciation. Still, the voice stays singular and the hierarchy of values—loneliness traded for custodianship—remains legible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the seal’s owl blinks and the narrator becomes the next keeper, a before/after legible in the single word “stay” reappearing on the steam. Causality is accumulative/lyric rather than tight because/therefore, but the pattern of “agreed-upon lies” is taught early and paid off when the narrator knocks on Mrs. Chen’s door to begin the next cycle. The weight of untold stories is felt, yet the tutor’s dissipation is lightly motivated—need “changes,” a rule announced, not dramatized. Still, the ending reconfigures meaning with undeniable conceptual cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The rooftop garden, wrought-iron railing, potted rosemary, and limestone gargoyle are vividly selective and filtered through the narrator’s architectural gaze. The meteor shower is both visual and auditory (“dactyls of fire”), anchoring time and forcing the final listening stance. Spatial choreography is clean: seal passed, brass pressed to stone, fire escape descended. The seal-as-tool charges the closure image (owl blinking), meeting the 9+ gate, while the jasmine-sugar scent reprises memory without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—loneliness bartered for architectural fluency—tightens when the tutor reveals the second lie and dissolves, forcing the narrator to assume custodianship. Escalation is accumulative: each Tuesday tea, each meteor spark, deepens the pattern rather than narrows causal options. The price is conceptual rather than tactical: the narrator inherits the seal and the building’s untold stories, a visible cost in the final image. Agency is receptive—listening until limestone speaks—yet the stance crystallization (“Welcome, new linguist”) forecloses retreat, satisfying the lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through the recursive metaphor of language-as-structure: conjugations = cornices, declensions = cracked brick, until “the future perfect of load-bearing walls” makes grammar and mortality inseparable. Subtext resides in gesture—the seal’s waxy imprint “stay” that later reappears in steam—rather than exposition. The ending offers no moral, only the charged poise of perpetual borrowing and return, reweighting solitude as stewardship. The refusal to explain the tutor’s ontology keeps ambiguity meaningful rather than evasive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The first-person voice carries a distinct architectural cadence—“grammar of cracked brick,” “euphemism of retrofit”—that remains consistent under pressure. Syntax modulates from long lyrical clauses to the staccato of meteors spelling Latin, mirroring the rising shower. No dialogue, so voice contamination is absent; the internal diction stays within the narrator’s plausible lexicon. The final “I will shelter, you will settle, we will crumble together” condenses the theme into a rhythmic, character-specific gnome without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet legible: “meteor shower intensified, sparks translating themselves against the dark” layers image and metaphor without mixed vehicles. Near-loops (“agreed upon lies” repeated) are purposeful, pattern-taught, and paid off in the final knock for sugar. Information is doubled: the thermos labeled “sugar” also holds tea, a lie that later flips into the next cycle. Only minor scaffold: “I understood then that…” could be trimmed, but it occurs mid-story and does not dull the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The fusion of Latin declensions with architectural decay is a fresh synthesis; the dead language tutor as summoned need is a non-obvious twist on ghost-trope. The “borrowing sugar” ritual evolving into custodianship of urban memory feels inevitable yet un-predicted. Risk—lyric accumulation rather than causal plot—pays off when the final image reconfigures the entire pattern. Closest echo is Toni Morrison’s haunted houses, but the specificity of roof-garden grammar and meteor-Latin makes the vision singular.</comment>
