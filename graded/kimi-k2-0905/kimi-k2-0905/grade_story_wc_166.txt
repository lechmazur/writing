<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lysira’s contradictory impulses—court complicity vs. self-erasure—are dramatized in every pirouette; the final renunciation (“Skin ends, verse orbits”) is earned by the moonstone’s visible exhaustion. Interiority stays embodied, never abstract, and the cost of exile is felt in the ankle-biting dawn. Minor slip: “obsidian grace” is repeated as label, not lived sensation, in two beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each spiral of dance adds density until the stanza bruises her collarbones, a Resonant Reconfiguration with undeniable cost—the moonstone’s last grain gone, exile made irreversible. Orientation is taught by line 3; no causality breaks. Closure beat lands on the final period that reweights the premise: she is now the contraband memory.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Body-as-setting functions as micro-arena: warm moss, dry fountain rim, and moonstone dust orbiting wrists constrain every pivot and supply the inkless ink. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no impossible positions. The garden’s hush is filtered through dancer’s proprioception, not tourist gaze. One hairline slip: “obsidian grace” is named twice without fresh sensory anchor.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—remain erased vs. re-inscribe banned memory—tightens when each spiral subtracts her physical self to add forbidden verse. Escalation is accumulative: moonstone dims grain by grain, foreclosing retreat. Visible price (final grain burned) charges the closure image. One micro-turn suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the body: censorship can delete archives but not muscle memory of tides. Final image—“stars rearranging into a dancer mid-leap”—reweights exile as authorship without moralizing. Subtext of state vs. somatic archive is carried in silver lines that absorb, not reflect, starlight. No thematic echo or tidy maxim intrudes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly focalized through Lysira’s proprioceptive filter; no head-hop. Syntax pirouettes with enjambed clauses that mimic undertow, then snaps short at the final period. Diction stays within dancer’s sensory lexicon—“minnows” of dust, “hollow of her throat”—never academic. Patterned elision (“gaps”) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from liquid long coils to fragmentary gasps, accelerating with the dance; no template cadence. Figurative layering is dense but each metaphor (dust as syllables, tide as grammar) advances the central conceit without contradiction. One mixed vehicle: “teeth of absence” beside “obsidian grace” is allowed because both serve the body-as-texture rule. Zero loops or scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of banned choreography + lunar grammar + body-as-manuscript feels inevitable yet unseen before. Risk of word-dancing without plot is transmuted into stakes by the burning last grain. Tropes (exile, forbidden art) are re-embodied through proprioceptive ink, not allegory. Final reconfiguration—she becomes the contraband cosmos—could not survive name-swaps.</comment>
