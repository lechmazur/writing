<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The custodian’s interior contradiction—retrocognition as curse yet compass—drives every micro-choice; the moment she pries the fused shard from child-bone, her pulse counts “every mistake” and the cost calcifies into forward-cast resolve, earning the climactic renunciation of isolation. Embodied emotion is vivid (“fracture edges warm as if remembering light”), never label-speak. Only the mother’s off-page death keeps this from 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the rose lamp ignites and she becomes “the new prism,” refracting past voices into future promise; the conceptual cost—she now burns instead of the lamp—lands on the final line. Accumulative lens holds: each shard-gathering beat deepens silence until the hush shard reweights the stake from personal quest to communal beacon. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The glass humming pavilion’s single-note moan constrains her pacing and mirrors her fractured interior; the fused shard calcified between child palms dictates the tactile extraction that mutes the desert. Micro-setting (body-tool-object) charges the final image when she stands “arms open” inside the lantern room, prism rejoined. Weather and tide argue, guiding star-path navigation—setting actively shapes tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“prove coincidences have meaning”—tightens when the missing hush shard forces her to confront the child’s fate; retrieving it costs the desert’s absolute silence, a felt price that forecloses retreat. One meaningful deepening: silence escalates from personal curse to world-holding breath, reweighting the stake under Accumulative lens. Agency drives every turn; coincidence complicates but her hand pries the shard free.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges refractively: light scattered through fracture reassembles into continuity across generations. The rose glow is no moral but a conceptual repricing—patterns exist because someone pays the cost to keep them. Final backward-speaking voices crystallize the theme without exposition. No final-paragraph thesis; resonance is earned through the child’s bones and her self-immolation as prism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is crystalline, sorrow-tinged, yet controlled: “thistle-blown hope” modulates from mourning moan to rose ignition without register drift. Perceptual signature—retrocognitive synesthesia—colors every noun (“skylight that had once sung with dawn”). Compression taught early (“tide and star argued”) pays off in final star-aligned fracture. No head-hopping; lyric elision stays legible under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from wound-cord clauses to fragment sparks; rhythm accelerates up spiral stairs, then hushes in desert mute. Figurative density is high but patterned—light, fracture, refraction—never muddled; mixed metaphors absent. One scaffold trace: “rose glow” appears twice in closing paragraph; minor loop does not dull the final image. Line-level propulsion flawless.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Post-collapse lighthouse powered by retrocognitive prism shards is fresh, yet grounded in tactile grief and calcified bone. The child’s skeleton fused to the shard of hush transforms familiar quest into fossilized silence, a risk that heightens stakes without gimmickry. Final self-prism substitution refracts prior material into inevitable yet unforeseen closure. Synthesis feels singular, not checklist.</comment>
