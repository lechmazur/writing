<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The astrologer’s interiority is vivid—her decision to exhale into the moon-pipe is embodied, irreversible, and costly. The feather’s warmth in her pocket and the final pinions sprouting show a credible, earned transformation. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the 9+ gate is missed by a hair.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the paper bird ignites as final burnt feather, reweighting belonging as reciprocal not possessive. Causality holds—each chalk star correlates to an external ruin, the shared exhale is mirrored, and the city’s inhale is returned. Cost is legible in the pinion inheritance and the torn page she can never recover.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The drowned corridors, moon-pipes, and bioluminescent copepods constrain every beat; the catwalk half-eaten by salt forces her climb, the valve she cracks vents her breath. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—she notices nebulae-murals because stargazers seek sky-echoes. The pinion coat and paper bird charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—learn the rhythm of belonging before sunrise—tightens when the automatic ascent clock starts. The shared exhale is the decisive, irreversible act that forecloses remaining alone. Cost is visible: she loses the atlas page and gains ghost-feathers she must someday honor. Escalation is situational but coherent; coincidence (hologram still powered) complicates, never resolves.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the rite: belonging is reciprocal recognition, not capture. The burnt feather’s shift from telemetry to ceremony reprices “captivate” as mutual exhale. No moralizing—final image of paper bird igniting leaves reader to feel the cost. Ambiguity lingers: will surface world listen?</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is dense, lyrical, yet controlled—syntax lengthens in calmer beats, fragments under pressure (“Light pooled like luminous respite”). Diction stays within astrologer’s cosmos-lexicon; “shadowseam,” “moon-pipe,” “orrery” feel native. No head-hopping; hologram echo speaks in pulses, not full dialogue, preserving distance. Minor template cadence in tripled descriptors (“horribly beautiful orrery”) keeps it from 9+.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings seldom repeat. Information density high—one sentence often layers sensory, symbolic, and causal work (“she felt the city inhale through her own lungs; rusted girders groaned”). Metaphors stay coherent within aquatic/celestial field. One scaffold paraphrase (“the drowned kept their own time…made her instruments stutter”) could compress; else clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fusion of astrology, seabed ruins, and avian telemetry feels fresh; inverted rainfall of silver bubbles is unforgettable. Ritual use of breath as currency subverts expected salvage narrative. Ghost-as-hologram avoids cliché by remaining partial, feather-clad, instructional. Risky lyric accumulation pays off in final paper-bird ignition—image could collapse but lands precisely.</comment>
