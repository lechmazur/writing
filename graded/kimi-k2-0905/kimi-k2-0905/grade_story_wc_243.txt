<comment>The archivist’s interior contradiction—archive vs. relinquish the locket—drives every micro-choice; the final graft costs her the talisman and redefines her role from collector to sower. Embodied pulse-warm silver, salt-stung knees, creaking joints ground motive in body. Renunciation is earned: the tube-sealing beat forecloses retrieval and charges the daughter’s piano waltz with absence. Flaw: “haunted euphoria” is named twice rather than shown through bodily contradiction.</comment>

<comment>Closure (Earned Stasis) lands cleanly: she plants the tube and steps into irrevocable loss; the locket’s absence is felt cost. Accumulative lens holds—each sensory layer (salt, ink, sunflower, laughter) tightens the stake until the final graft reweights memory from private keepsake to public covenant. Orientation anchored by word 60; no drift. Minor causality gap: security guard’s deferral feels convenient, not consequential.</comment>

<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Blooming jetty, tide-hissed planks, patina-green tube, and locket-as-mirror function as micro-setting that constrains every action: she kneels on rotted wood, ink bleeds into salt, copper determines burial size. Negative space of the un-drawn boy charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy obeys archivist priorities—barnacle over skyline. Environment forces speed when headlights flare; no static postcards.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—save small moments from erasure—tightens when engines growl; option set narrows to “sketch faster or lose forever.” The final steep act (sealing locket inside tube) pays the price: she forfeits private memory to public future, foreclosing retrieval. Pressure is accumulative: each added sensory layer (sunflower, laughter, ink bloom) increases density without external antagonist. Cost is visible in empty cuff.</comment>

<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges via negative space: what is not drawn/kept becomes the surviving artifact. Subtext of maternal substitution (lost boy ↔ daughter) operates through locket press and braided laughter, never stated. Final waltz reweights “preserve” from static archive to living rhythm. Avoids moralizing; resonance lingers in copper darkness. Slight over-explanation of “artifacts become verbs.”</comment>

<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric remains tightly bound to archivist’s perceptual filter: walnut ink = bruised violets, gulls = ghost-children. Syntax lengthens during sketching, then fractures under headlights. “We will keep telling” slips into first-person plural without head-hop, aligning reader to covenant. Filter verbs (“she thought”) are sparse and voice-motivated. Distinct cadence differentiates security guard’s spoken plainness.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High density: single sentences couple sensory, emotional, and thematic work (“ink blooming like bruised violets across the parchment”). No loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts are surgical. Mixed metaphor risk—“laughter braided into ribbon”—reads purposeful under lyric license. Final line stumbles slightly with “notes stumbling then catching, like gulls learning wind,” a comparison that feels stretched.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: conservation as burial, archive as seed. Negative-space portrait of drowned boy avoids sentimental trope. Risk-taking in relinquishing the token object rather than clutching it reverses expected conservation arc. Could edge higher if boy’s history were less reportorial.</comment>
