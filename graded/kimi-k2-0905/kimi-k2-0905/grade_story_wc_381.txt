<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The summoner’s interior contradiction—his need to erase prophecy while forever carrying it—is embodied in the swallowing of the sphere; the final smile shows cost. Micro-choices (pressing paper to sternum, stepping into brook, spoken “.”) all flow from his monastic vocation. No second character on page, so relationship crucible N/A. Flaw and endurance stay specific to him; the cracked smile is earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each silence sample adds density until the origami galaxy reconfigures the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise—he walks on with the rotating sphere inside, a felt, visible cost. Orientation anchored by word 50 (“solitary summoner knelt beside the quiet brook”). No causality breaks; prophecy swallowed, not solved, so path remains foreclosed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Brook, moonlight, paper, and body function as micro-setting: cold water grips ankles, heart-heat softens paper—choices are constrained by these tactile limits. “Terrestrially cosmic mirror” reappears at end, now reweighted after the swallowing. No spatial drift; every object is handled or reflected upon. Environment directly supplies the silence he mines.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—silence must defeat coded prophecy—signaled in paragraph 1. Escalation: each mapped hush tightens the noose of sound until the drumbeat of code arrives; summoner’s agency creates the vacuum-mouth that nearly fails, then the spoken “.” ends the climb. Cost is the internalized sphere, a persistent constraint that will keep murmuring against bone.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges: tranquility is not fire’s absence but its mastered blaze—shown via swallowed sphere, not stated. Binary-infused birdsong stripped back to innocent dawn song reweights earlier “babies cried in binary.” No moralizing; final image of quiet flag planted in morning soil offers non-literal answer. Ambiguity remains: he still carries the blaze.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to summoner’s perceptual signature—moonlight as “terrestrially cosmic mirror,” silence tasted as copper. Syntax lengthens and compresses with task: catalog of hushes builds cadence, then single-word “.” snaps it. No head-hop; diction stays within his monastic lexicon. Patterned repetition (“smoothed hush,” “terrestrially cosmic”) is taught early and pays off at close.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry triple duty: sensory image, metaphor, and forward motion. No scaffold loops; each crane replication is a new beat. Figurative layering peaks at “galaxy made of absences” but remains coherent under accumulative lens. Final line breathes, giving closure without flab. Minor echo—“tranquil blaze” appears twice—does not dull final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Folding silence into origami that swallows prophecy is a fresh synthesis; origami-as-vessel for anti-sound feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric density is sustained without clarity loss. “Spoken period” as spell is a non-obvious tactical choice that reweights grammar itself. Concept commits fully—no retreat to generic fantasy resolution.</comment>
