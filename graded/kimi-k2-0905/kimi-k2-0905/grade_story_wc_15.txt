<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Calyx’s interiority is lyrically specific, his surrender to the canyon’s compulsion credibly embodied. The bleeding-palm beat gives us a visible cost tied to his optimism, earning the final renunciation. Yet the shift from passive dream-cargo to active weaver feels slightly under-motivated; we are told he “understood” but not shown the micro-choice that tips him from pawn to agent. Still, the hierarchy of values (story > safety > self) is legible in the final kiss of cloth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each image layers density until the final cadence shift reweights the stake. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Calyx’s kneel and whisper crystallize cost without restoring the lost sea. The illustration plate’s dissolution and the first orchid wave land the before/after change on the page. One soft spot: the canyon’s sudden gift of new passages reads a shade convenient, but the loom’s autonomous spin immediately re-anchors the magic within the established dream-logic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Red sandstone, salt breath, driftwood loom, flaking ink—every detail is filtered through Calyx’s poetic sensorium and braided to action. The canyon walls actively constrain movement and later enable the star-stairs, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is immaculate; footprints, spirals, and switchbacks track cleanly. Only the moonlight “spilled milk” risks cliché, but its tactile placement inside the cavern keeps it fresh.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</question>
<comment>The dominant stake—can the unmade world remember its name?—is signaled in paragraph two and tightened when each stitch costs blood. The loom’s autonomous turn is the single decisive intensification, foreclosing retreat. Pressure stays coherent under the Accumulative lens: image accretion = rising cost. The price is legible, but a second intermediate loss (a snapped warp thread, a failed rhyme) would have pushed the score higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question>
<comment>Theme emerges from the concrete act of weaving ruin into reverence; no character sermonizes. The final whispered line offers a Charged Poise that reweights every prior broken precedent without moralizing. Orchids-in-salt function as conceptual repricing rather than pasted symbol. A hairline deduction for the echo of “broken precedents” in narration—borderline thematic statement—but it is embedded in Calyx’s couplet, preserving subtext.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>The lyric third-person hovers at focal-plane distance, never leaking outside Calyx’s perceptual palette. Syntax glides from long breathless cadences to the staccato of “porcelain becoming shell,” mirroring loom acceleration. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks; diction stays within a sailor-poet’s lexicon. The faint archaic tint (“saline solace”) is earned by the mythic register and remains consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is deliberate yet varied; no template cadence or synonym churn. Metaphors are purposeful (“moonlight pooled like spilled milk” risks cliché but is immediately activated by the loom). Information density is high: each sentence layers image, memory, and motion. A single over-rich phrase—“orchid solace—sweet, funereal”—flirts with purple, but the next clause grounds it in renewal, so clarity survives.</comment>

<grade>9.1</question>
<comment>The fusion of maritime elegy with textile myth feels inevitable and fresh. Returning the sea as illuminated verses rather than literal tide is a conceptual risk that pays off. The orchid-in-salt image is specific, not ornamental, and recharges the opening plate. The story could only happen inside this red canyon loom; swap setting or craft and the arc collapses, meeting the transformation test.</comment>
