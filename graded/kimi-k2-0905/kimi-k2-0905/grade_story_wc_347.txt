<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mara’s reluctant endurance is etched into every gesture—clenching the nut, hating the orchard, pocketing the sharp shell halves—so the final renunciation feels pre-paid. Contradictory impulses (duty vs. hatred) coil inside a single continuous scene, culminating in the costly hand-print constellation that forecloses her own escape. Micro-choices (spitting kernel, smearing mash, counting heartbeats) reveal a hierarchy of values without exposition. The only hairline slip: “graceless beauty” is named once, not quite earned through embodied cost alone.</comment>

<comment>The causal chain is lean and irreversible: because Mara cannot step on stone, she invents the warmth-ghost trail; because frost clock is live, the hand-print must glow now. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the crystal fossils eternalize her exclusion, a social/ontological cost that reweights the entire rule-set. One transition (cliff rim → final vantage) is legible under dusk tracking. No orientation debt; who/where/when are anchored by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Mechanical birds, frost-laced grass, and the nut-shell’s microscopic ridges are not garnish—they constrain tactics (can’t enter, can’t shout, must use oil). The cliff shadow’s kiss with the frost line is the micro-setting that literally maps the exit, charging the final image. Environmental details evolve: frost progresses from brittle to noose to crystal fossils, mirroring tightening stakes. Cold is felt through gloved palm, molars, boot crunches—tactile economy at work.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—get them out before frost—tightens with visible granularity: grass blades acquire “tiny white nooses,” frost forms in real time after last heel vanishes. Mara’s agency is inventive (arrows → handprint constellation) and priced by her own permanent exile. No coincidence; even the deceptive moonlit path is a rule-set hazard, not luck. Escalation is a single deepening rather than reversal, but it forecloses her last hope of walking out.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the paradox of “graceless beauty”: salvation is possible only for the saved, never for the savior. The nut’s mutation from snack to blueprint to crushed oil literalizes the idea that the same seed can feed or illuminate, but not both. Final image of crystallized handprints reconfigures the moral calculus—her prints become permanent monuments to unfreedom. No moral is stated; the cost is felt in frozen flesh and sharp shell halves.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited clings to Mara’s perceptual signature: she notices clicks like metronomes, tastes iron and pine, counts heartbeats—never slides into traveler POV. Syntax compresses under pressure (“Time thinned; frost began to lace…”) then elongates for the final vista. Diction stays within her rustic lexicon; no academic register drift. Patterned repetition of “she moved…she pressed…she spat” teaches the ritual cadence and pays off in the final fossil moment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or paraphrase; each sentence advances image or tactic. Metaphors are consistent (metronome clicks, candle-warmth bleed) and physically coherent. High information density: “nut-kernel…oily mash…five warm dots” packs tool, action, and image into one beat. No scaffold; even the frost progression is shown through changing adjectives, not repeated statements.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The cursed-orchard + mechanical-bird combo feels inevitable yet fresh—Victorian clockwork horror grafted onto folktale arbor. Warm-handprint guidance is a specific, non-obvious inversion of the usual breadcrumb trope. Conceptual risk: protagonist never enters the maze, yet tension escalates; the gamble pays off. Minor proximity echo to Pan’s Labyrinth, but the brass birds and blueprint-nut twist it into singular territory.</comment>
