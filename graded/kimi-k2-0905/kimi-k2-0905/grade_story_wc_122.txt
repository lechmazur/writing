<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory need to “hear” silence through vibration is embodied in every tactile choice; the filing of the needle and the palm-to-drum beat dramatize her hierarchy of values with visible cost. Interiority stays concrete—no label-speak—yet the sister-grief motive is front-loaded in a reflective block that slightly flattens early pressure. The final renunciation (lifting the needle, choosing forward drumbeats) is earned by the preceding backward spin and is individuated to her deaf sensorium. Relationship crucible with Temen is present but thin—his single signed prompts are more facilitator than pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the filament-needle’s spent smoothness and the drum’s forward pulse reweight the hush from vacancy to resonance, cost felt in the tear she can’t hear but we see. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: backward lullaby density + drum-birth pattern shift = emotional repricing. Orientation is swift (cavern, frost, who, when by line 3). No lens ambiguity or teleporting props; the needle’s fracture traces cleanly into its polished finale.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cedar-dust motes, goatskin lakes, and pedal-lathe hush are filtered through Mara’s vibration-seeking POV; the brass phonograph’s “broken wing” and the jagged spark of the snapped needle constrain her crafting choice. Micro-setting (the needle itself) charges the final image when its worn smoothness hangs against her sternum. Cold season seeps through stone fissures, guiding her underground quest; weather stays causal, never postcard. Spatial choreography is immaculate—bodies, bench, turntable, drum frame track without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—defeat numbness via reversed sound—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when the backward lullaby physically peels “a translucent layer from the cocoon.” One meaningful deepening suffices: the reversed notes recover the laughing-sister memory, forcing grief to arrive loud inside silence. Cost is visceral (tears, exhausted filament). Agency is hers: she lifts the needle, presses the new drum to her chest. No coincidence, no abstract stakes—every intensifier is tactile.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the paradox of silence as livable resonance rather than absence; no final moralizing, only the image of snowflakes landing with a hush she “almost hears.” The filament motif reweights from broken antenna to polished memento without symbolic over-shouting. Subtext in Temen’s single drum tap: grief shared without audible language. Emotional aftereffect is concrete—readers re-feel their own muted seasons through her skin.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Mara’s tactile sensorium; perceptual signature is unmistakable—“vibrations entered the bones of her ankles like a shy knock.” Rhythm modulates: long breathy cadences for cavern hush, staccato clauses when filing metal. No dialogue contamination (only signed gestures). Compression taught early (“gestured alphabet they both favored”) legitimizes later ellipsis. Diction never exceeds her knowledge state; no filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings avoid template cadence. Dense doubling—e.g., “backward recorded songs could unwind memory, let hidden voices speak in reverse against grief’s forward march”—carries two ideas without scaffold. One strained metaphor: “goatskin stretched like moonlit lakes” is borderline purple but fits the cavern’s hush. Zero paraphrase loops, zero synonym churn, no mixed metaphors in peak beats. Final line earns its quiet cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: deaf music teacher + reverse phonograph + drum birth = non-obvious path through grief. Tropes (needle-as-hope, seasons-as-change) are ground-level, not imported. Risk in lyric accumulative structure pays off: the backward lullaby pattern is taught early and re-prices at closure. Specificity anchor: the 1932 shellac disc label grounds era without exposition dump. Conceptual integrity holds—no retreat into generic “healing” cliché.</comment>
