<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her fingers on the dial, the illicit thrill of prying the scanner—while contradictory impulses (curiosity vs. self-preservation) act simultaneously. Motive intensifies cleanly: protect Lila’s voice → expose Hask → public credit. The final renunciation (letting the battery die) carries visible cost and is earned by prior causal chain.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the uploaded ledger can’t be silenced, Hask collapses under undeniable voices, Mira’s hearing-aid silence signals duty discharged. Causal lens holds throughout—every beat is because/therefore. Cost is legible in the crumpled director, the dawn headlines, and Mira’s deliberate battery death.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium, koi-wall, and rust-recording corridor constrain movement and stealth tactics; the hearing-aid itself functions as micro-setting that gates perception. Sodium-orange lamp and orchid-rot scent are filtered through Mira’s tracer-biased attention. Final image of sunrise burning off mist reweights the world as “slightly more honest,” charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—protect Lila’s posthumous voice—tightens when Hask blocks exit, forcing the trade-off: hand over postcard but ledger is already public. Escalation is causal: each pulse pushes Mira deeper, each discovery raises corporate risk. Visible price: Hask’s collapse, Mira’s battery death, dawn headlines that can’t be retracted.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: heroism is overheard, traced, assured—not claimed. The ledger propaganda vs. Lila’s erased donation reframes “incidental” acts as the true miracle. Final image of sunrise fixing a more honest world offers Conceptual Repricing; no moral is spoken, yet reader feels credit restored to the voiceless.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is compressed, sensorily biased, tracer-technical: “clipboard labeled ‘contact tracer for hearts’ already half-draped in moss.” Rhythm accelerates under pressure—“twilight thickened; the dead called louder”—then quiets into the battery-death hush. No head-hopping; distance stays tight inside Mira’s hearing-aid filter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line craft is dense and propulsive: “vines had learned to mimic heart valves” does double sensory-concept work. Occasional elevated diction (“sodium-orange,” “fibrillation”) fits the clinical tracer POV. No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent. Minor overwriting in mist-ribbon sentence but it charges the spectral closure image, forgiven.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise—ghost-heart telemetry via antique hearing-aid—feels fresh yet inevitable. The tracer’s curiosity repurposes bureaucratic tools against erasure, synthesizing tech, grief, and archive heist into one lyric pulse. Risky choice to let the dead chorus stay unheard by reader yet still collapse the villain pays off through charged poise rather than spectacle.</comment>
