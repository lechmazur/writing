<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The dreamer’s interiority is unwaveringly concrete—every tactile interaction with the brass mount, every meteor-syllable she “hears,” is an embodied, idiosyncratic beat that externalizes her creative wound. Contradictory impulses (dread of forfeited dreams vs. pull toward cosmic inscription) are enacted simultaneously in scene, not summarized. The final dissolution is earned: each prior micro-choice (loosening clamps, arranging parts into a self-constellation) visibly forecloses retreat, paying the cost of bodily extinction for the release of collective creativity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the protagonist’s physical extinction rewrites the sky’s rule-set so future artists can “create again.” The causal chain (meteor-sentence → dismantling → sky-rewrite) is unbroken, cost legible in her vanished body. The lyric-accumulative pattern is taught by the second paragraph; aurora threads the final skeleton, reweighting prior motifs under the same lens. No orientation debt; who/where/when are anchored in the first 60 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The brass equatorial mount functions as micro-setting: every screw and frost-rimed latitude scale constrains her dismantling choices and ultimately becomes the constellation that receives her dissolved body. Aurora-lit snow refuses to adhere to the dark-glass circle—an environmental echo of the rewritten creative law. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven: she reads meteors like Braille, tastes scissors’ metallic sting, priorities filtered through an astronomer-artist’s synesthesia.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—free imprisoned creativity or future artists perish colorblind—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightened when dismantling becomes irreversible. Each meteor syllable increases pressure under an Accumulative/Textural lens; the final “create again” reweights the cost from personal death to cultural survival. Visible price: her body dissolves; the telescope’s broken spine remains in the snow as persistent constraint.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: the necessity of creative memory versus institutional erasure is enacted through stardust inscription, never asserted. The final invitation “create, or perish, or create again” is image, not moral, offering ambiguous perpetuity rather than prescription. Subtext coils in the scissors’ metallic sting and the classroom cupboard’s chalk smell—quiet emblems of systemic suffocation that resonate without exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is synesthetic, rhythmically controlled: long breathless sentences mimic auroral drapery; fragmentary meteor phrases serve as caesuras. Perceptual signature is astronomer-poet—celestial mechanics rendered in tactile, almost eroded diction (“broken spine,” “ migraine of unborn constellations”). No head-hopping; lyrical compression is taught early and paid off when she writes on vacuum itself.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>High information density: each sentence either advances dismantling, deepens sensory texture, or reweights the cosmic stakes. Figurative language is pattern-taught (meteor = Braille, aurora = ink) and never muddles causality. Zero loops or scaffold; no register drift. Final line cadence mirrors opening hush, creating circular propulsion without monotony.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade>
<comment>Fusion of astronomical hardware with cosmic creativity myth feels inevitable yet unexampled: dismantling a telescope to re-inscribe the sky is a non-obvious synthesis that could not swap places with any other tale. Risk-taking—protagonist annihilation as affirmative closure—heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity of “dark glass circle where snow refuses to stick” locks the conceit into tactile reality, preventing allegorical drift.</comment>
