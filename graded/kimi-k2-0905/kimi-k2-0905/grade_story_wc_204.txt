<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Corwin’s cracked-chase heart and trembling ink-stained fingers give us embodied, idiosyncratic interiority; his micro-choice to uncork the whisper against the keeper’s warning crystallizes a hierarchy of values with felt cost. The lone flaw: the mirror-keeper dissolves off-stage, so relationship-as-crucible pressure is only implicitly implied, slightly under-cooking secondary-character traction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the library folds into a sigil tucked behind a heartbeat, re-weighting the rule-set of negotiable reality with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal linkage holds—because he prints the sentence, therefore the orchard destabilizes and time folds. Pattern (frost→sentence→sigil) is taught early and paid off in the final image under an Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Glass orchard library, cloud-vellum, ticking numerals in apples—every sensory anchor is filtered through Corwin’s typographer gaze and constrains his tool choices. The frost-pane “copper wires” return as the spiral that points nowhere/everywhere, charging the final image; environment literally guides the rupture step. Spatial choreography stays coherent as deck tilts and ballast-books slide.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—“compress eternity into a moment”—is signaled in paragraph three and tightens when the printed sentence destabilizes the perfect system, foreclosing the safe orchard path. Cost is visible: library folds, keeper dissolves, Corwin exiles himself onto cloud-sea. One meaningful deepening suffices for this length; no reversal needed under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question>
<comment>Theme emerges organically from the particular act of printing a forbidden sentence: language as rupture, eternity as fold, systems as fragile fruit. Final image—Corwin’s exhaled whisper searching for the next system—offers a resonant, non-moral answer. No explicit thesis; complexity lingers in the private glyph tucked behind a heartbeat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</question>
<comment>Distinct rhythmic texture—chiming crystal fruit, steel-orchid press, oily pollen—echoes Corwin’s ink-and-metal perceptual signature. Compression and patterned elision (“air had become negotiable too”) are taught by line five and paid off when he inhales frost into lungs already full of future alphabets. No head-hopping; POV distance stays stable and modest.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty: “the platen descended, and the sentence bit the paper like frost teeth” advances action while re-inscribing the frost motif. Rhythm modulates from lullaby chiming to punched-clang of type slugs. One micro-loop: “letters kept falling out of order” is restated twice within 40 words; minor but does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</question>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: letterpress + floating glass orchard + negotiable reality yields a premise impossible to transplant unchanged. The bottled whisper as movable type slug is a risk-taking turn that heightens stakes without gimmickry. Risk bonus +0.3 applied; the concept commits fully, retreating nowhere.</comment>
