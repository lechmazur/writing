<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elara’s “carefully resourceful” trait is repeatedly dramatized (paper compass, seed-word bargain) and costs her a year of life, but the time traveler remains a mere plot hinge—his interiority summarized, not embodied. The diary-as-extension-of-voice tightens the link between tool and motive, yet relational pressure is absent. The final renunciation earns its poignancy because the price was tactile, not abstract.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elara plants absences into the world, the diary page flutters, and the cello chord reconfigures the reader’s sense of history’s cost. Causal chain holds from synonym-seed → cipher → door → theft of emptiness. Orientation is quick (obsidian shelf, mountain pulse by line 1), transitions legible across glossary-stairs → root-reading-room, lens stays Accumulative/Textural throughout. Only micro-slippage: “year removed from her death” is stated, not dramatized, so the cost is felt but not visible in body or aftermath within scene.</comment>

<comment>The living root-walls and staircase-glossary physically constrain movement and supply the language-cipher itself; the diary is a micro-setting that re-charges at closure when its blank spaces are replanted. Sensory economy is exact—cold obsidian, pollen-dusted spin, cello note at dawn—each mirrored in Elara’s internal state without overt symbol. Spatial choreography is flawless: downward fold, suspended paragraph, collapse through footnotes. Mountain-as-bookstore never slips into postcard; it is navigated by touch and lexis.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—steal back unlearned lessons before they bloom into war—is declared early and tightens when the door demands an unspoken word, forcing Elara to barter her lifespan. Escalation is single but meaningful: the hybrid seed-word narrows options to “pay with death-time or fail.” Cost is legible (one year gone), though the traveler’s jeopardy feels auxiliary rather than reciprocal pressure. Absence-theft as tactic is inventive escalation, yet the global stakes remain abstract off-stage “war” rather than a visible impending casualty.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges obliquely: ignorance cultivated becomes future violence; silence replanted becomes second thought. Subtext carries in gesture—pollen released on wind equals humility sown. No moral is stated; the cello chord in dreams is the non-literal answer. Final image of diary seed drying into future growth reweights prior botanic motifs without sentimentality. The refusal to show the averted wars keeps the irony alive and earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is dense, synesthetic, linguistically obsessive—perfect for an arcane linguist. Rhythm modulates: long liquid sentences for descent, staccato when time hiccups. Non-standard grammar (“staff line,” “comma slicing his wrist”) is pattern-taught early and pays off. No head-hopping; traveler’s POV is externalized through Elara’s gaze, keeping focalization pure. Occasional elevated Latinate diction (“chronometer,” “solanum”) fits her vocation yet risks register drift in one beat, not enough to cap.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>High information density—each sentence performs dual duty: “folding empty spaces between pages” advances action while prefiguring theme. Metaphors are coherent (library as clef, mountain as staff) and internally consistent. Minor scaffold: “Rescue missions, she reminded herself…” is self-expository; could lose the clause without loss. No loops or synonym churn; cadence varies. Filter verbs nearly absent; strong verb preference (“she pronounced it, feeling the sound remove…”) keeps immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The library of unlearned lessons is a fresh conceptual spine; botanic linguistics grafted onto temporal debt is non-obvious synthesis. Risky second-person flirtation (“return what you never taught”) pays off by making the reader complicit. Transformation test fails—names/places could not swap without destroying logic—proving integration. No recognizable pop-culture echo; the cello chord reinvents the Orpheus trope without citation. bold structural choices (glossary staircase, paragraph-prison) heighten stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
