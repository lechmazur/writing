<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is lush and sensorially grounded; her “calm lantern” curiosity flickers under pressure, showing believable contradiction. The moment she presses her palm to stone and feels “a hush that curled inside her ribs” embodies motive through visceral action. Yet the arc is essentially contemplative; no external choice after the threshold walk carries visible cost, so the renunciation feels gently rather than wrenchingly earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the open chapel door re-weights the premise—silence becomes an inverted map—and the cost is the dead projectors and her relinquishment of footage. Causality is lyric-Accumulative: rain, torn map, and layered frescoes accrue until stillness itself “opens.” Orientation is taught early via the henge vault and projector crate; spatial logic holds. The only causal fuzz is the exact mechanism by which “quietness” triggers the door, but the surreal rule is internally consistent and pays off in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rain, flaking fresco layers, and the stone bench function as micro-setting that constrains action: rain erases the day’s work and rinses perception; fresco strata reveal prior cartographies of belief; the bench anchors the final beam of stormlight. Sensory detail is selective—sound of rain on tarp, taste of mineral hush—tightly filtered through Elara’s map-framer bias. The henge vault geography is coherent; no floating rooms or white-space syndrome. The setting directly charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</question><comment>Dominant stake—interpret silence as language—signalled early. Pressure escalates by Accumulative/Textural accumulation: each raindrop, fresco flake, and flicker of footage thickens the texture until silence itself becomes the continent. The decisive tightening is the moment the two projections ghost together, foreclosing the possibility of empirical proof and forcing the empathic stance. Cost is conceptual—she abandons the footage and the map—but felt rather than visceral, keeping the score below 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Theme emerges from concrete returns: map tear = chapel threshold; reopened chapel = reopened parchment in slow fibre-years. No explicit thesis is stated; insight arrives as image—“the known world was the blank margin.” The final shielded openness reweights silence from void to cartographic continent, achieving Conceptual Repricing with undeniable conceptual cost. Complexity is preserved: translation is deferred, not solved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s perceptual lens: syntax lengthens and clauses Layer like fresco strata, mirroring her map-framer mind. Diction—“soft hammer,” “disciplined beam of stormlight”—is precise yet poetic, never purple. No dialogue to test, but internal voice modulates under pressure: sentences fragment slightly during the palm-to-stone beat. Patterned repetition (“reopen... reopened...”) is taught early and pays off at closure; zero head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Sentences propel: each carries at least two jobs (e.g., “Rain hissed against the tarp... rinsing the world so it could speak”). Metaphors are internally coherent—tear in parchment aligns with lintel shadow, no mixed vehicles. One paraphrase loop spotted (“rain that drummed now had drummed then”) but it serves cadence and does not obscure causality. Zero scaffolding, template cadence, or filter-verb stacks; opening and closing images are sharp and artifact-free.</question>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Fusion of cartography, archaeology, and film conservation feels fresh and specific to Elara’s profession. The notion that silence is an upside-down map reframed by empathy is a non-obvious conceptual turn. Risky lyric structure taught early and held to a clean Charged Poise ending. Minor deduction for echo of familiar “scholar enters sacred silence” trope, but the footage-comparison and fibre-years knitting lend irreplaceable specifics.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.4</question><grade>Her perceptual choices—lining up map tear with lintel shadow, comparing frames—drive every beat. Without her methodical curiosity the footage would never be re-examined and the chapel would stay closed.</question>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</question><grade>The henge appears in opening anchoring and returns as the physical source of the shadow that aligns with the map tear; it also supplies the vault space that houses the chapel. It is not handled physically, so beat count is lower.</question>

<question>9 C</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>The whispered chapel is the literal threshold she must enter; its shift from closed to open reweights the entire epistemology of the story. The final beam of stormlight inside it delivers the Conceptual Repricing.</question>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>Her methodical nature enables the frame-by-frame comparison that exposes the impossible change; it also delays her crossing until she has matched the chapel’s stillness, making curiosity the gatekeeper.</question>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</question><grade>“Reopen” is the pivotal action: the chapel reopens only when her attention grows quiet enough, and simultaneously the parchment’s fibres begin their slow reopening, linking interior and material worlds.</question>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>The silent footage comparison is the engine of discovery; mechanics matter (frame-by-frame, lightning-bleached still) and directly create the pressure that forces her to abandon empirical proof for empathic stance.</question>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.7</question><grade>The rain-scoured vault supplies the tactile pressure (rain erasing work) and the revealed older fresco-map that teaches her the layering rule; environment literally guides her final acceptance of slow time.</question>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</question><grade>The torn map signals the hinge between known and unknown early and reappears knitting itself in the final image; it metaphorically times the long arc of reopening, though no ticking clock pressures immediate tactics.</question>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.0</question><grade>Her desire to interpret silence with empathy is dramatized when she chooses to sit quietly inside rather than extract relics, paying the cost of relinquishing recorded evidence and accepting un-translated silence.</question>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.5</question><grade>Shielded openness is embodied in the final stance: she carries no footage, only an internal openness that protects the silence from being colonized by translation, and this tonal modulation directly charges the closing image.</question>
