<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aurelia’s contradictory impulses—guilt vs. the need to reimagine—are dramatized in the shard-handling beats; her final renunciation is earned by the mirrored storm ordeal and costs her corporeal self. Interiority stays concrete (“burnished sorrow that lacquers”) and avoids label-speak. One slip: the archaeologist enters so late that status dynamics can’t complicate her, capping relationship-as-crucible utility at this length.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: crushing the shard rewrites the asteroid’s reality and seeds a new polis, cost paid with her dissolution. Causal chain holds: shard vision → mirror-denial method → storm bypass → sacrificial remake. Orientation is taught early (“baroque asteroid’s obsidian wall”) and anchors hold; no lens ambiguity. One transition (her kneel to intruder entry) is clean and contiguous.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The mercury-ceiling mirror and velvet drapes physically constrain her tactic and charge the final image; the shard’s “glassy throat” acts as micro-setting that stores futures. Sensory triage (warm air, ink-taste) tracks with emotional beat. Spatial choreography is flawless across the cello climb and drape pinning. Environment directly shapes the success condition—mirror denial—meeting the 9+ constraint test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—redeem a failed revolution by reimagining it—tightens when the shard shows the unbuilt city, then narrows further as the time-storm threatens to erase even that dream. Her mirror-covering method is an active, costly escalation that forecloses retreat. Price is legible: bodily dissolution and permanent exile from the new world she births. Under causal lens, because/therefore linkage is intact.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the iterative image of mirrors and reflection: revolutions fail when they chase external images instead of imagining inwardly. Final reconfiguration—mirrorless palace becomes a living poem—reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext in the archaeologist’s corrupted recorder (“suddenly full of poems”) implies art supersedes data. No thematic echo in final paragraph; resonance is imagistic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Aurelia’s perceptual filter: baroque diction (“harpsichord,” “gilded room”) matches palace decay, while compressed clauses (“She whispered a stanza…”) accelerate under pressure. Patterned repetition of mirror/veil imagery is taught early and pays off in the final drape. No head-hopping; archaeologist’s POV is surface-only. Syntax mirrors emotional crescendo without drumbeat monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence layers image + action (“pulling cloth across silvered glass while humming…”). Mixed metaphors are avoided; “ribbons of chronology twisted like silk scarves soaked in blood” sustains coherent vehicle. One minor scaffold: “the air grew warmer, as though sorrow itself were being tucked into bed” slightly abstracts the prior warmth cue, but it does not touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Synthesis of baroque space-opera, lyric poem, and revolutionary memoir feels singular; the shard-as-urn-of-unlived-futures is a fresh speculative object. Risky choice to dissolve protagonist into pure concept pays off because earlier beats foreshadow silica-lattice storage. The mirror-storm mechanic repurposes classic gothic mirror trope into temporal physics without exposition dump. Transformation test: story collapses if any core image is swapped.</comment>
