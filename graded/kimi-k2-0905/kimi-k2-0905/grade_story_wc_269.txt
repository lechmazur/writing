<question>1</question>
<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Mira’s grief-tempered vigilance feels lived-in; her need to “keep the station listening” supplies a persuasive through-line. Interiority is concrete—tears on a dive mask, salt-feathered paper—but the late pivot to hidden-reef destiny leans on summary (“she understood…”) rather than a visible micro-choice that costs her something tangible. The endurance stance at the end is credible, yet the story withholds a beat that shows her relinquishing an alternate future; we’re told she accepts memory-keeper duty rather than watching her hand let go.</comment>

<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Causal chain: map discovery → dive → reef-hologram → acceptance holds cleanly; each step because/therefore narrows her options. Closure lands as Charged Poise—“gate left ajar” reweights her prior isolation with conceptual cost. Orientation is anchored by word 40; no penalty. Lens stays situational/accumulative, coherent to the final tapping beat. One soft spot: the pillars’ sudden data-storage power isn’t seeded; the rule arrives exactly when it solves the mystery, a mild late-cheat that keeps the score sub-9.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Lagoon, submersible, carved limestone ridge—each is sketched with sensory economy; seafloor “shaved clean of life” both mirrors Mira’s desolation and physically guides her to the slot. The station itself functions as micro-setting: its stilts, ladder, and hatch constrain her solitude and later enable the dive. Salty atlas fragment and sonar-capped pillars carry the final image; without them the reef-reveal stalls. One minor slack: “projected light—an entire ecosystem reassembled” could use a concrete sensory pin prior to the hologram fade.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“will the vanished path stay erased?”—emerges once the penciled circle appears and tightens when the seafloor stairs surface. Escalation is single-arc: curiosity → unease → revelation; the hologram’s resurrection visually re-prices loss, forcing her stance crystallization. Price is visible conceptually but not felt corporeally—no dwindling air gauge, no risk of entanglement—so cost stays lightly intellectual rather than visceral. Still, agency stays hers: she alone descends and inserts the map, no deus-ex tide.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of hidden continuity—“some paths disappear so they can be remembered”—grows from concrete particulars: coral genocide photos, atlas lacuna, sonar echo. No overt thesis statement; meaning arrives in the pillars’ exhale of silt that momentarily reconstitutes color. Final image of resumed tapping reconfigures her exile into stewardship, inviting reader to connect memory-as-responsibility. Ambiguity is meaningful: we’re left unsure whether regrowth is literal or ritual, a credible counter-reading that resists tidy hope.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly lashed to Mira’s perceptual filters—metal “answers back with a hollow sheen,” reef water drops color “like a curtain.” Rhythmic control: long sentence for descent compression, fragment at “Path 27—Witness Return” mimics sonar ping. Lyric elision (“memory dragged her back…”) is pattern-taught early and paid off in hologram flicker. No dialogue to corrupt voice; prose syntax echoes her tactile loneliness without drifting into purple. Register stable—scientific diction (“thermocline,” “hydrophone”) stays within her professional lexis.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Sentence variety strong—no template cadence; opening noun-phrase opener (“The sea level monitoring station…”) and later verb-fronted fragments (“Down through the thermocline…”) modulate tempo. Mixed metaphors rare; “white mantis above the lagoon” sharp, not repeated to death. One scaffold trace: “a practice of tapping rhythms on surfaces” is cycled verbatim three times—economical for motif but edges toward loop; does not touch closure beat. Information density high—each sentence advances image or plot; pronoun references clean; no homophone slips. Paragraph cuts purposeful; none removable without loss.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fusing climate-loss elegy with Atlantis-like submerged archive feels fresh; transformation test fails—this exact emotional math needs coral + cartography + sonar code. Risk in near-future eco-parable is high, yet grounded specificity (fossil-fuel ban, bleaching witness protocol) prevents allegorical drift. Hidden reef as data server literalizes “memory” without gimmick, payoff seeded by atlas lacuna. Tropes of lost-civilization and ghost-reef are re-inflected through bureaucratic loneliness rather than adventurer romance.</comment>
