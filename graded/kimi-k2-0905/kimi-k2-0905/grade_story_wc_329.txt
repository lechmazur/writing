<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical and idiosyncratic—“glass parted like water,” “heartbeat of a world learning to break free”—but the arc is a single, tide-like swell rather than a hierarchy of contradictory impulses. The renunciation (seed left on railing) is legible and earned, yet the emotional cost is diffused across metaphor rather than dramatized in body or voice. No secondary character on page, so relational crucible waived; micro-choices (skipping every fourth beat, kneeling to plunge fingers into glass) are concrete and tie motive to mythic task.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: seed on railing, orchard exhaling, statue waving—options reconfigured, cost felt as “echo of a shell that had learned to beat.” Causal chain (lullaby rhythm → guardian hesitation → glass partition → seed extraction) is intact; no teleporting props. Orientation (who/where/when) is taught in first 25 words; no penalty. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of inversion (upward blossoms, backward lullaby, shell dissolving) deepens until meaning flips at threshold image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sky-bridge glass planks, copper-eared statues, singing apricot trrees—each detail is filtered through Calla’s perceptual bias for sound and tension. The locust-shell-as-map and seed-as-sunrise are micro-objects that constrain tactics and charge the final image, satisfying 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is clean: three planks advanced, bridge sways, seed set on railing. Economy is exemplary; no encyclopedia dumps.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rescue last seed before orchard gears crystallize—is signaled in paragraph 2. One meaningful tightening: when guardian hesitates, live option narrows to “advance three planks or lose the moment.” Cost is conceptual but legible: orchard’s exhale and statue’s cracked smile show beauty reasserted at price of mechanical stasis. Agency is lyric but causal; no coincidence resolves.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from inversion pattern: lullaby backward, blossoms upward, shell becomes gold dust—beauty renegotiates its own terms rather than being reclaimed. No moralizing line; final image of seed humming “resonantly soft” reweights earlier stakes. Ambiguity lingers: orchard now blooms “outward instead of upward,” tasting of escape—invites reflection without thesis. Emotional aftereffect is wonder tinged with loss, earned through sensory particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric hovers at psychic distance 2–3, modulating with tension—short, breathy clauses under the bridge’s sway; longer, luminous phrases at seed release. Diction stays within Calla’s musical lexicon: “bow tasted the dusk air,” “strings resonantly soft.” No dialogue, so voice contamination avoided. Patterned inversion acts as rhythmic motif, taught early and paid off at closure; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Metaphors are dense—almost every sentence—but they form a coherent lyric system rather than purple accretion: glass/water, shell/map, heartbeat/bridge. Zero scaffolding, loops, or synonym churn; no mixed metaphors. Sentence rhythm mirrors musical phrasing, accelerating at crisis, exhaling at seed release. Opening and closing lines are ear-tested and propulsive. Minor register spike—“conceptual repricing” vibe—kept below 9.0 line.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fusion of clockwork orchard and sky-bridge violinist feels inevitable yet uncatalogued; inversion of gravity and lullaby is a fresh inflection on “mechanical vs. organic” trope. Specificity—copper ears swiveling, apricot blossoms rusting—prevents generic fantasy drift. Risk in lyric compression heightens coherence rather than obscuring. Transformation test: story collapses if Calla is any artist but a violinist whose rhythm can skip beats.</comment>
