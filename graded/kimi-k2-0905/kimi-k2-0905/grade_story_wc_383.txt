<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her palms press the shell, her vision bleeds colour—contradictory impulses (sceptic vs believer, daughter vs public figure) coexist in-scene. The micro-choice to kneel, hum, and pay with colour-loss is earned and irreversible. The only drag is a faint “therapeutic” gloss on “isolation into independence,” but the body keeps the score so the arc lands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a crisp Conceptual Repricing: the lullaby threads into strangers’ throats, the Bureau’s frame is publicly overthrown, and Mara’s grey vision is an undeniable cost. The drive lens is accumulative/textural—pattern of echo, colour-leech, bloom—taught by line 4 and tightened in the final image. Causality is lyric but legible: shell → garden → archive → communal contagion. No orientation debt; space/time held in velvet grip.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The garden is not backdrop but instrument: indigo hedges funnel, foxglove mirrors, pond becomes printing press. Micro-setting objects—shell, gate hinge, colour-draining petals—constrain every tactical move. Sensory palette is biased to touch and sound (velvet, chlorophyll mist, lullaby) that physically transfer memory. Spatial choreography stays coherent across the single continuous scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—recover the quarantined lullaby—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightened when each sung syllable literally costs a colour. One meaningful escalation: the garden begins to archive only after Mara commits her body and pigment. Agency is renunciation/endurance rather than external victory, fitting the accumulative lens. Cost is visible on the page—“twilight drained to grayscale”—so pressure coheres.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from pattern, not pronouncement: private absence → public contagion, isolation → plural anthem. Shell, colour, lullaby reweight from personal relic to civic vaccine without authorial commentary. Final image of stranger humming reframes prior losses as communal antibodies. No moral sermon; complexity (Bureau’s logic, Mara’s complicity) remains intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person POV stays locked to Mara’s perceptual signature—velvet, bruise, vinyl, chlorophyll—without head-hop. Syntax flexes with pressure: clauses shorten as colour leaves, rhythm mimics three-note lullaby. Diction within plausible lexicon except one stray “resonance structures” but the context teaches it early. No dialogue, so voice purity is total; perceptual signature is distinct and sustained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, lyrical, but information-stacked: each sentence does two jobs (image + causality). One mixed metaphor—“bruise inside a garden”—but it’s taught immediately as colour logic and paid off. No loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts are purposeful. Opening and closing lines anchor and resolve with mirror precision. Minor purple tinge in “chlorophyll mist” but momentum never stalls.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: memory-as-virus, garden-as-3D printer, shell-as-cryptographic key. Bureaucratic quarantine treated as literal physics of colour and sound. Risk—lyric anti-causal structure—pays off because pattern is taught early and closure is publicly charged. Not a derivative dystopia; the politics grow from a lullaby, not a pitch deck.</comment>
