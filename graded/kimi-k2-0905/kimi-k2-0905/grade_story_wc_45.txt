<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—believer in tea-and-forgiveness now fractured by the living corpse—grounds every beat; the opal tooth, the pear-fed soil, the changeling’s map all force micro-choices that visibly tilt her hierarchy of values. The final renunciation (she stays silent at dawn, sleeves rolled to splint new falls) lands with cost and is earned by the trail of prior causal links; no diagnostic self-talk under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the garden rewoven, the village gossiping under pear-light, Elara’s cartography of fractures now guiding her next bone-setting season—cost is the permanent loss of her former certainty and the ethical weight of silence. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: each image (mint/iron air, vertebra-sundial, tooth-constellation) layers density until the final image reweights the whole moral ledger. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3; no causal amnesia; the single transition from bench to briar path is legible and brief.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The secret garden’s bruised-mint/iron scent and the hedge-hum of “nostalgic innovation” are not garnish—they guide Elara’s attention toward the briar path and later fertilize the winter pears that physically manifest the lie-turned-life. Micro-setting objects (baby tooth, vertebra-sundial) constrain choice: the tooth must be socketed into the constellation map to complete the sky-circuit. Spatial choreography is flawless; bodies, briars, and bones track cleanly across the single move from bench to dial.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“how to turn wrongs into constellations instead of scars”—is voiced at the garden bench and tightens when the changeling offers the birch-bark map of her missteps. The single deepening (placing tooth into the constellation’s jaw) narrows options: she can no longer live in the old certainty; the village will keep eating the pears fed by the substitute body. Cost is visible—she swallows chalk-thunder taste, accepts perpetual ethical ambiguity, and foregoes the comfort of public absolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete arc: “every mistake honestly honored becomes a lantern” is dramatized by the pear harvest, the map of prior judgments, and her silent roll of sleeves. No final-paragraph moralizing; the last image (children retelling her tale under luminous pears) reweights earlier horrors into communal light. Counter-readings linger: is silence complicity or mercy? Complexity is embraced without hedge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature—“turning the changeling’s baby tooth between her fingers like a dim star”—is instantly character-specific and recurs with altered resonance. Syntax waxes lyrical under pressure (“the cleft in certainty had opened right through her chest”) yet never drifts into purple; rhythm breathes with beats. No dialogue, so voice convergence not tested; interior diction stays within a rural bone-setter’s plausible lexicon. Patterned elision (“the story itself wearing a smile”) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Line-level density is high—“opalized, root curled like a fetus” does triple duty as visual, haptic, and thematic seed. No loops, no filter-verb stacks, no mixed metaphors; register remains internally consistent. One minor scaffold: “the garden smelled of bruised mint and iron” could compress further, but it advances atmosphere and costs nothing at closure. Final image (“lantern in the ribs of the world”) lands clean without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</comment>
<comment>Fairy-tale tropes (changeling, hedge maze, substitute corpse) are reforged through Elara’s bone-setting vocation and the ethics of nourishing lies; the synthesis feels inevitable, not gimmicked. Specificity—willow splint song, yew-log corpse, vertebra-sundial—anchors freshness. Risk is taken in quiet renunciation rather than spectacle; coherence survives unscathed. Could not swap names/places without collapsing the rural-healer idiom and pear-fed constellation logic.</comment>
