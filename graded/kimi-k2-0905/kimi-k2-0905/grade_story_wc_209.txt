<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Liora’s quietly driven need is palpable and consistent, but her interiority stays in lyric register—more observation than contradictory impulse under pressure. The final stance (leaving the pavilion) is legible as renunciation, yet the cost is more conceptual than embodied; we feel the idea of loss rather than a specific forfeiture on the page. Micro-choices (painting on glass, lying under branch-rosette) show values, but they are staged as ritual, not dilemma. Enough for solid characterization, short of the visible cost that would push higher.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/lyric lens holds: each seasonal image adds density until the moonflower opening re-weights the premise. Closure is the Conceptual Repricing—Liora mails the postcard back with “The shadow is the root of the glow,” revaluing darkness as creative source. Cost is conceptual but undeniable within the lyric contract. Pattern is taught early (postcards, glass, hush) and pays off in final indigo panes; causality is associative, not sequential, which fits the chosen lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Amber pavilion, copper ribs, frost on eyelashes, indigo on glass—each sensory hit is selective and stakes-bearing. The etched-glass motif migrates from postcard to painted pane, constraining her final medium and image. Weather tracked month-by-month tightens the clock without slipping into weather-report cliché. Micro-setting (glass as canvas) directly shapes the closure image, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“understand why flowers bloom at night”—is signaled early and deepens through seasonal absence. Tightening occurs when snow retreats and moonflower buds appear; the bloom is the living answer, no external antagonist needed. Agency is attention/endurance rather than confrontation; cost is the winter-long solitude and eventual act of leaving. Pressure stays coherent under accumulative lens; one meaningful intensification suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from iterated glass/images: darkness not as void but as substrate for color. Subtext lives in gesture—painting negatives so night can glow—never thesis-stated until the closing postcard line, which feels earned. Ambiguity remains: is retreat victory or surrender? Complexity embraced, no moral spoon-fed. Resonance lingers through the final painted panes that keep “blooming” for travelers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person lyric hovers close to Liora’s perceptual skew—synesthetic, painterly, cathedral-obsessed. Rhythm swells and contracts with seasonal cadence; sentence length mirrors thaw/freeze cycles. No head-hopping; distance stable. Filter verbs (“she felt”) are sparse and voice-motivated, not scaffolding. Register stays within an artist’s diction; indigo, umbral, nicotiana feel precise, not thesaurus-flashy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Figurative density is high but patterned early (glass, hush, bloom) so payoff justifies the risk. No mixed metaphors; each image extends the cathedral/light logic. Occasional lyric overlap (“quilt of white,” “faintest perfume”) but spaced enough to avoid loop. Final painted panes sentence propels outward without clutter. Read-aloud rhythm intact; paragraph cuts land on image-turns that re-charge stakes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: uses familiar artist-in-retreat arc but filters it through nocturnal botany and cathedral-glass physics. Moonflower as answer to painter’s block is non-obvious; risk of painting on actual pavilion glass is bold yet credibly prepared. Transformation test—names/places changed, the glass-negative-to-glow mechanism still unique. Specificity of 1912 violet-ink postcard anchors history without waxing nostalgic. Vision feels singular, not prompt-stitched.</comment>
