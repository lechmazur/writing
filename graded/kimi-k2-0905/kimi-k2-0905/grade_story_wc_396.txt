<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—trained detachment vs. surging re-claimed empathy—drives every beat; the swallowed-crate moment crystallizes her hierarchy of values with visible cost. The final smile in the mirror is earned by the causal chain of glass-for-glass, crate-for-conscience. Minor slip: “heart unhidden” leans label, not embodied, but the prior physical toll (lost reflection, pier collapse) already paid the price. Sufficient for high band, not immaculate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Causal lens holds throughout: because she embeds empathy into the sphere, therefore the sea locks and the border becomes bridge. The harbor detour is a motivated ellipsis whose payoff (her reflection trapped, Keeper drowned by returned apathy) lands unmistakable cost on-page. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the orchard now tastes of apple not salt—rule-set rewired. No orientation drift; mirror-rule is taught by word 50 and re-activated at end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Lighthouse orchard, ice floes, nailed mirror trunks, and body-as-tool all constrain tactics: floes set the dawn deadline, mirrors gate the time-splice, sphere’s new beacon rewrites night-readings for future keepers. Highest apple bough is micro-setting that charges final image. Weather (dawn bleeding) couples to internal thaw. No occupational error; maritime detail minimal but sufficient. Spatial choreography clean—pier collapse tracked shot-by-shot.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Single dominant stake—prevent cycle of detachment—tightens when she trades her reflection for the crate’s empathy, foreclosing perpetual neutrality. Escalation is causal: each shard-feed narrows options until only full surrender remains. Cost is visible: lost reflection, pier boards cracking under Keeper’s guilt, her sob-drenched swallow. One reversal suffices at this length; no reliance on coincidence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without label: empathy as renewable resource vs. commoditized feeling. Sphere-as-beacon reprises “light” trope but reweights it from surveillance to care—Conceptual Repricing. Final orchard taste of apple packs sensory answer to abstract question. No sermon, no character spells out thesis—image does the work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is stable: cold maritime diction, synesthetic bleed of grief into taste and color, rhythmic mirroring of ice-crack cadence in syntax. No head-hopping; single POV holds. Compression (“grief-soaked planks”) taught early and paid off. Minor rise in diction register at “conceptual repricing” moment but stays within Mara’s heightened sensorium; does not rupture voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High information density: each sentence advances image or causality—no scaffold. Varied sentence rhythm mirrors floe-shift urgency; participles used only when simultaneous action is real. Zero mixed metaphors; glass-pier-sea metaphors stay in coherent liquid/solid constellation. No loops, no synonym churn. Final line bell-ring is acoustic full-stop that seals cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fusion of polar lighthouse, emotional-ethics orchard, and mirror-gate time travel feels non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Keeper’s self-fragmentation as capitalism of conscience is fresh twist on memory-market trope. Risk: lyric compression risks opacity, but pattern (mirror → crate → sphere) keeps legible. Specificity of “name sewn into coat hem” prevents generic refugee tableau. Concept commits fully—no retreat to safer realism.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Shadow-laced peacekeeper: early setup, drives every major beat—detachment training vs. empathic sight creates internal crucible; choosing to swallow her own bottled empathy is the irreversible turn that reconstitutes the sphere and rewires future protocol. Irreplaceable; swap occupation and the entire moral engine collapses.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>9.6</grade>
<comment>Broken crystal ball fragment: present in opening beat, middle feeding sequence, and final reconstitution; each use escalates—first as sensor, then as doorway key, finally as new beacon. Its fracture-to-sphere arc literalizes the story’s thematic repair of fractured empathy. Remove it and no plot axis remains.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Courageous anomaly: established at first third as innate empathic sight plus trained suppression; this contradiction forces the catastrophic choice to reclaim feeling. Trait shapes tactics—only she can read shards and survive mirror passage. Cost visible when reflection is forfeited. Not merely thematic label; it is the causal engine.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Calmly intuitive: enables steady breathing match to sea cadence and delays panic long enough to complete reconstitution; paradoxically makes the eventual emotional flood more acute. Trait constrains—calm costs her time, tightening dawn deadline. Returned empathy then ruptures calm, proving trait’s limit.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>9.7</grade>
<comment>Reconstitute action: named goal from inciting line; every micro-feed of memory into shard is a development beat; final hanging of perfect sphere is the payoff that reweights orchard’s meaning. Action is non-swappable—without it, the border stays barricade, not bridge.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Vintage store mirrors: mechanics taught early (nailed to trunks, polar sunrise warps); serve as literal time-gate and collateral prison for her reflection. Mirror acceptance of glass into doorway is causal hinge for entire harbor detour. Final wipe of condensation reprises mirror, showing cost of lost reflection.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Lighthouse orchard above shifting ice floes: supplies hard dawn deadline, acoustic environment (cracking ice = thunder), and unique micro-climate where apples survive frost. Setting becomes final beacon platform; ice locking at end externalizes the new emotional stasis. Geography is active character, not postcard.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Weighted breath before reply: title phrase signals compressed temporal window; dawn acts as ticking clock, tightening each shard-feed. Time not tracked to minute, but emotional breath-cadence alignment provides felt countdown. Could be slightly more granular, but sufficient to force early final gambit.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>9.5</grade>
<comment>Map empathy onto action: desire stated, conflicted against protocol, dramatized when she literally ingests empathy and risks drowning in it. Success rewrites keeper protocol for future generations. Motivation is the thematic through-line; remove and story loses its moral momentum.</comment>
