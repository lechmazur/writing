<comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—grief’s paralysis versus the need to thaw—remains embodied in every micro-choice (rubbing the bookmark, narrating to steady her hands). The decision to leave the dome behind crystallizes her shift from escapist maker to caretaker of shared space; cost is visible in the relinquishment. No diagnostic clichés; her flaws complicate the act. Single POV keeps pressure tight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory layer (drip, cardamom ghost, tape ribbons) thickens the stake until the final image reweights “safe zone” from possession to gift. Closure is a Charged Poise—Mara’s exit leaves the dome/console as resonant object for strangers, cost legible in her footprints erased by melt. No orientation debt; anchor triad delivered by line 4. Persistent constraint: the bookmark-turned-floor stays behind, forever inaccessible to its maker.</comment>

<comment>The console room’s metallic hiss and sliding ice function as micro-setting that constrains every tactical choice—fuel harvested from chair, glass curved against iron struts. Cardamom scent and mercury vapors are filtered through Mara’s glassblower bias (smell = batch ingredient, metallic = colorant). Final image marries environment and body: silver puddles reflect a sky “free of winter’s clamp,” literalizing the thaw as both weather and heart. Setting charges closure without ever describing walls.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—“craft safe zones for inquiry”—tightens when Mara realizes the zone must stay, not travel. One meaningful deepening: narrating shifts from self-soothing to world-addressing, proving language itself can solder cracks. Cost is the forfeiture of the first finished dome, a visible price on page. Accumulative pressure (density of thaw imagery) reweights the stake without need for external antagonist.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of sanctuary: retreat becomes offering. The cracked bookmark turned relic floor reconfigures “safe” from private to communal without a moral stated. Final image of footprints lifted off ground conceptually reweights grief’s weight into weightless forward motion. Subtext operates in silence—she never names the funeral or the person, yet every drip is elegiac.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature: glass artisan sees “mercury dreams,” measures danger in “bloodless edges,” tastes cardamom as batch ingredient. Rhythm accelerates with short declarative beats during ice crash, then elongates in lyrical exit sentence. No head-hopping; free indirect style stays fused to Mara’s lexicon. Dramatic narration is voice-motivated compression that pays off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>High information density: single sentences fuse sensory, emotional, and tactical work (“She positioned the cracked leather bookmark between two iron struts, using it as a calibrated guide…”). Figurative language is patterned early (“harvesting mercury dreams”) and paid off in closure; no mixed metaphors. Zero paraphrase loops; each image advances situation or choice. Minor scaffold: “the fire took” could compress, but does not touch closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: climate-science ruin + grief-craft + performative narration = unfamiliar tonal alloy. Bookmark resurrected as architectural spine feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk of leaving the artifact behind heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry. Specificity of glassblower perception prevents trope drift.</comment>
