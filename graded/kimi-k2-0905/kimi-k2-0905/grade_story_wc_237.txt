<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lina’s held-breath terror and brother-grief are viscerally embodied; the micro-choice to keep drawing while her lungs crystallize shows a hierarchy of values under pressure. The split quill at the end is a perfect external trace of internal cost. Interiority occasionally drifts toward poetic abstraction (“story torn from the world”), softening the psychological precision demanded at this tier.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The causal spine—fail the childhood timing ➜ brother dies, revisit that timing deliberately ➜ rewrite grief—lands with audible click and visible cost (split quill, rock rising). The single-scene orientation is anchored by line 3; no lens ambiguity. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the same superstition that killed now releases, the platform literally lighter.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The floating rock, rail-less and dew-beaded, is not backdrop but active constraint: “trust kept you aloft, but terror worked just as well.” The kettle’s soundless hiss and the mirrored tatami form a micro-setting that times the decisive stroke. Environment, tool (quill), and body together charge the final image—rock drifting higher—so the 9+ gate is met.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early: rewrite grief or repeat it. The typhoon clock tightens options stroke by stroke; the twelfth seals both rune and breath, foreclosing retreat. Cost is legible—crystallized shards become speakable words—yet escalation leans on poetic compression rather than a second tactical reversal, keeping it just shy of the 8.8 band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of childhood superstition into adult agency: scars become stories that can fly rather than cut. The final image of the rock rising reweights the premise without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers—did the spell or the telling lift the weight—inviting reflection while remaining coherent.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person intimate maintains disciplined psychic distance; perceptual signature is sharp—tea-dark lake, squid-ink with jade, bergamot-cedar exhale. Syntax coils like breath held, then releases in shorter cadences when the rune seals. No head-hopping; the one-line teacher dialogue is functional, not voice-contaminated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm mirrors lung constriction—long clauses tightening, then fracture into motes. Figurative language is selective; no metaphor contradicts the physics of the scene. A single scaffold loop (“three inches above… three inches higher”) is thematic echo, not clutter, and pays off in closure. No artifact touches the final beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Floating rock + inked breath-crystallization gives a fresh inflection to familiar grief-ritual tropes. The inversion of superstition into release feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk—letting the climax hinge on a single rune-stroke—heightens stakes without obscuring causality. Could edge higher if the world rule-set were seeded one beat earlier.</comment>
