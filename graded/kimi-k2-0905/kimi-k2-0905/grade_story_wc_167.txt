<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is concrete and profession-specific; her micro-choice to speak value aloud crystallizes a believable renunciation of utility-logic. The scar-memory to Carina is a vivid self-map, yet the beat remains solitary—no secondary pressure or status shift on the page—so relationship crucible and status bullets are waived. A hairline slip: “constellation Carina” label could have been embodied a beat longer. Closure still lands with felt cost under Earned Stasis, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the prism’s flares intensify pattern-density until the lattice reseals windows—visible Decisive Change with conceptual cost. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are locked by line 3; no penalty. The drip-ring cipher is taught immediately, so the pattern payoff at closure is legible. Persistent constraint: the healed cracks remain in the town’s glass, a lived price that shapes future storms.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is micro-tuned to body, tool, and tide: ankle-deep salt water, flat stone as anvil, prism as lens—each constrains Mara’s kneel, hurl, and final exhale. “Salt wind that carried kelp and rust” is sensory economy filtered by glazier’s bias. Spatial choreography holds across the single scene; no impossible positions. The healed skylight/greenhouse/clockface triplet recharges the bay-at-dawn frame in the closure image, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—illuminate value before sunrise—tightens when the auroral flare threatens brutal daylight audit. One meaningful deepening: violet lattice meets water, reframing mundane relics as luminous. Agency is ritual attention and spoken valuation, not combat, yet it forecloses the path of letting the world devalue these items. Cost is conceptual but undeniable: the prism dissolves, its loss the price of communal re-enchantment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the triad of objects—teacup, harmonica, scar—refracted through prism-light: worth is read, not priced. No overt thesis; the bay’s hum is the non-literal answer. Final image of sealed cracks offers Charged Poise—radiance now visible only to those who pause, a resonant reconfiguration of perception. Ambiguity lingers: next storm will crack again, implying an endless ledger, avoiding tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is consistent glazier-poet: “storms slid off them like apologies,” “noctilucent reckonings.” Syntax lengthens under wonder, shortens under action—“She hurled the glass”—mirroring breath. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets waived. Patterned elision (noctilucent, ledger) is taught early and paid off at closure; no head-hop or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rhythm modulates from languid dawn observation to kinetic arc of prism; no template cadence. High density: “violet thread of sky,” “latent auroral residue” each do image + atmosphere + stakes work. One mixed-metaphor risk—“ribbons of silver fire spelling out debts”—but physical logic holds (ribbons = aurora, debts = ledger). Closure image remains lucid; artifact does not touch final beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: harbor glazier reading glass-grain and tide-rings as ledger entries reframes the everyday-object-as-archive trope into a coastal ritual. Prism-atrium from abandoned lighthouse is specific, irreplaceable. Risk—lyric accumulative structure—heightens coherence without gimmickry. Proximity check: no close echoes; vision feels singular.</comment>
