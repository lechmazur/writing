<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority is sensorily vivid (“citrine applause, indigo silence”) and characterizes the ghost’s synesthetic craving, but his contradictory impulses remain static; he wants an encore yet never risks failure or alters tactics. Lila appears only to facilitate, not to challenge, so the relationship is mentor cameo rather than crucible. Micro-choices (tying thread, flipping coin) enact desire yet carry no visible trade-off; the bow feels pre-ordained, not costly renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens: each echo layer thickens nostalgia until it crystallizes the ghost’s restored outline—effective Charged Poise. Orientation is immediate (ghost, empty theater, after closing) and the orchard rules are taught by sensory payoff. Causality is metaphoric (echoes → materialization) rather than sequential, but the pattern is coherent and the final bow carries undeniable conceptual cost: he becomes the actor he died as, foreclosing future decay.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The tarot coin and orchard function as micro-settings that constrain tactics: only the coin can “ring” time, only the orchard can amplify echoes. Sensory hierarchy is ghost-specific (scent = sound, color = emotion), anchoring POV. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from curtain to maze to stage-within-garden. One minor slip: “minutes fracture into colored ribbons” is read as metaphor, yet later treated as literal traversal—clarity recovers in the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“one more ovation to stitch memory”—is signaled early. Escalation is textural: each echoed memory adds density until applause materializes; options narrow from wandering to crystallized embodiment. Cost is conceptual: he accepts timeless stasis as a perpetual performer, forfeiting further change. Agency is present (he ties, walks, bows), but the tightening is driven by cumulative resonance rather than a reversible decision, fitting accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme: art’s afterlife exists only while audience memory lasts. Emerges through image (empty seats sigh dust, orchard blooms backward) rather than statement. Subtext in Lila’s teasing “Still craving applause, Casper?” lets irony sting without sermon. Final bow reweights earlier craving into willing entrapment; ambiguity lingers—applause is eternal yet ghost remains unseen by living audience, avoiding tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric maintains consistent spectral distance; perceptual signature synesthetic (tastes starlight, sees trumpet solo as gold spirals). Rhythm modulates: long breathless sentences for maze drift, clipped clauses for coin spin. Diction stays within ghost’s vintage lexicon (“brocade,” “rosin”). No dialogue until Lila’s single line—its jazz-era lilt contrasts with surrounding perfume-violins, proving voice control. Filter verbs absent; immediacy intact.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Read-aloud ear excellent: syntactic variety, no template cadence. Information density high—each sentence layers scent-sound-color. One paraphrase loop: “echoes that were also scents… each echo a thread” could compress. Metaphors are coherent (popcorn/rosin/brocade all theater-specific). No artifact touches closure. Opening line anchors; final line “endless encore beneath his translucent ribs” propels off “ribs” consonance, satisfying cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fuses ghost story, backstage lore, synesthesia, and tarot into a fresh constellation. The “orchard fed by mourners’ memory” is a non-obvious twist on haunt topology. Risk—lyric accumulative structure rather than causal plot—pays off by making nostalgia itself the engine. Transformation test: could not swap coin for rose or orchard for attic; each element’s specificity is irreplaceable. Minor echo of “audience-as-afterlife” trope, but infusion of synesthetic seamstress refreshes it.</comment>
