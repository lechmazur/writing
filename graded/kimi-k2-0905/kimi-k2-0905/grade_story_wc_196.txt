<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rowan’s interiority is vivid—her fingertip “tracing a scab,” the heartbeat skip at the button—but the final beat (whispering Marcus into snow) is the only micro-choice that visibly costs her something. Earlier beats are observation-heavy; the dust-reading is luminous yet passive, so the shift to active archival intervention feels slightly under-cooked in causality. Still, her contradictory desire—stipend versus secret vigil—stays alive in every beat, and the button re-centers her great-uncle wound without exposition. The endurance arc (keeping the button in play for a future seeker) earns a credibly weighted stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural lens is declared early (“dust that coughed stories”) and holds: dust → crescent → line → dots → photo → new folder → envelope. Closure is a Charged Poise: Rowan seals the box, city snow begins its own accretion, and the button’s afterimage transfers vigil from her to the unknown next archivist—cost is the lifetime watch she recommits to. One transition (room → corridor → street) is legible; orientation is anchored by word 60. No prop teleporting; the brass button’s entry is unmotivated by intake forms but that very unmotivation is the inciting mystery, not a logic break.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>The file room is smelled, touched, heard (fluorescent hum), and used—drawer gaps, banker’s boxes, gooseneck lamp all constrain how Rowan can move and discover. Dust becomes a literal manuscript whose ridges she “reads,” turning micro-setting into plot engine; the tabletop halos mirror her own concentric grief. Snow outside reprises the dust motif, now as potential “small kindnesses” accumulating—setting charges final image. Spatial choreography is flawless; no floating furniture, and distances (drawer to table to box) remain trackable.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—magnify a small kindness until it can “prove the past had not been waste”—is voiced on page 1 and tested twice: (1) dust-reading must yield legible hope, (2) button must be re-homed so a stranger might one day feel found. Escalation is textural: each dust glyph narrows her options until the only remaining act is to insert the button into Marcus’s null file—this deepening reweights the archive from dead-storage to future-compass. Cost is opportunity/time: she commits to endless nights of “brush poised” vigil; snowflake catch crystallizes that price on skin.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through repeated accretion metaphors (dust, snow, skin) rather than thesis lines: what seems waste (orphaned button, blank discharge line, unclaimed stories) can become transitive compass if someone shoulders the labor of witness. “Unknown histories” reframed as “futures disguised as pasts” gives the concept legs without preaching. Final image non-literally answers the prompt’s question: small kindness ≠ rescue but transmission—a hall one must keep walking. Sentimentality is resisted; peppermint memory is kept short, and the echo of Marcus remains a blank, not a miracle reunion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyric third-person POV sustains a controlled, antiquarian diction (“infantryman’s insignia,” “camel-hair brush”) that feels native to an archivist who names artifacts for a living. Syntax lengthens and shortens with emotional temperature—long clauses for dust meditation, staccato “She sealed the box” for decisive beat. No filter-verb clusters; perceptions are direct (“heart stuttered”). Metaphors stay era-appropriate (sailors, battlefield sunrise) and avoid purple overlay. Voice modulates without slipping into omniscient editorial; Rowan’s perceptual signature (“paper yield like old scab”) stays consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</question>
<comment>High information density: one sentence can stage, sensorize, and emotional-track (“Accumulated dust patterns...slow rain of forgotten skin”). Rhythm alternates between imagistic cadence and decisive single-clause beats; no template cadence detected. Figurative layering is disciplined—dust = script, snow = compass—each returns to reconfigure meaning instead of decorating. One mixed-metaphor risk: “sunrise over a battlefield” for lamplight on dents is borderline, but battlefield reference is anchored to uncle’s fate, so coherence holds.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Foster-care archive as liminal sanctuary, dust as palimpsest, and orphan button as baton form a fresh synthesis; none of the trope parts arrive pre-packaged. Central premise—archivist re-animates absences by physically re-cataloguing an uncatalogued thing—turns bureaucratic futility into quiet resistance. Risk of passivity is acknowledged and solved by the envelope insertion beat. Specific detail (“1987-C”, “county still paid her”) grounds the concept in institutional reality, preventing allegory drift. Transformation test: rename Rowan and relocate to museum, emotional engine collapses—proof of particularity.</comment>
