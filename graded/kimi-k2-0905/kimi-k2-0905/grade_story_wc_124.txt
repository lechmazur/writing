<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elian’s grief is a living contradiction—he both clings to and diffuses Lira’s scent—embodied in every micro-choice from the cautious inhale to the vial buried like a seed. The internal clash between broker habit and bereaved lover drives each beat; the final renunciation of selling lanterns tomorrow crystallizes a visible cost. No stock interiority; every thought is filtered through olfactory memory and the synesthetic glow of ultraviolet flora. Flaws (broker detachment vs. raw need) actively complicate tactics and foreclose the old life.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: every sensory vignette layers density until the final “forgiveness distilled from orchid, metal, and the last shared breath” reweights the entire archive of scent-memories with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation anchors (who=lantern broker; where=extinct-plant greenhouse; when=night of olfactory collapse) are fixed by line 3 and never waver. Closure is a Charged Poise: Elian steps into a city that has no smell, carrying a private atmosphere—an earned stasis that forecloses his former trade. No causal breaks; even the ghost orchid’s reanimation is seeded by Lira’s esters.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The greenhouse is not backdrop but instrument: ultraviolet panels click on schedule, engineered fungi digest scent, and the orchid itself grafts new metallic notes onto Lira’s perfume—each detail constrains or enables Elian’s grieving ritual. Spatial choreography is immaculate; the vial moves from coat pocket to railing to root with no ghosted positions. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—Elian notices iron, meteor dust, the salt of a neck after dancing—never a tourist catalog. The final image of “crystal shadows of fragrance” recharges every prior glow.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can Elian risk inhaling grief and still survive the memory pressure? Each aromatically cautious breath tightens the screw; the orchid’s sympathetic bloom adds the new note of hospital bracelet, forcing Elian to accept that the world *can* change yet smell identical. Escalation is textural—density of molecules equals density of loss—until the final exhale releases blue lanterns of ache, visibly paying the cost. No coincidence; every intensification is either Elian’s doing or the greenhouse’s engineered response to his offering.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: scent as time travel, grief as cultivation of ghosts, forgiveness as hybrid molecule. The returning image of “crystal shadows” shifts from perfume vial to private atmosphere, reconfiguring meaning in the final line. Subtext in gesture—kneeling, brushing soil, burying vial—carries more weight than any spoken word. No moralizing; the insight that tears are a refusal to accept an unchanged world is earned through sensory pressure, not assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is synesthetic, compressed, and rhythmically controlled—“light without heat,” “floral gravity collapsing his chest.” Perceptual signature is broker-detached yet lover-raw: Elian catalogs molecules even while suffocating on them. No head-hopping; single POV remains locked to Elian’s nose and grief. Syntax breathes with caution—long sentences for reluctant vapor, fragments for impact—without drumbeat monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances image, character, or atmosphere. Metaphors are coherent—ultraviolet cathedral, stained-glass petals—never mixed or contradictory. Information density is high: one drop of liquid carries bed-mornings, burnt sugar, hospital bracelet in a single capillary pulse. Read-aloud rhythm modulates from slow reluctant ribbon to sharp metallic note, mirroring emotional crest.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade>
<comment>Premise—broker traffics in light after smell extinction—feels inevitable, not gimmicky. Ultraviolet greenhouse for resurrected flora is a fresh crucible for grief; orchid that remixes personal perfume is non-obvious synthesis. Risk of synesthetic lyricism is embraced and paid off: final “crystal shadows of fragrance” could not exist without the prior molecular cathedral. Transformation test fails—swap broker/perfumer/greenhouse and the entire emotional algebra collapses.</comment>
