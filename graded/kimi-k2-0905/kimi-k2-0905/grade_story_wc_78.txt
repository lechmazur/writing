<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The prophet’s interiority is concrete and embodied—he “pressed an ear to the wind,” “sketched resonance,” “listened”—and his contradictory impulse to convert danger into music drives every beat. No secondary characters exert pressure, so relationship crucible is N/A; his micro-choices (strike barrel, rig bamboo crown, summon crew) escalate stakes and visibly cost him calm. The final endurance—standing silent, absorbing the raft’s new heartbeat—is earned stasis that forecloses retreat. Voice stays singular, never drifts into label-speak; flaw is purely solitary obsession, fully accepted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the raft’s silence is reconceived as groove, the prophet’s earlier fractal sound loops become literal propulsion, cost is the forever-loss of wind-reliance. Causal chain holds: because he layers resonance → therefore micro-breezes → therefore bamboo crown → therefore forward motion. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) is secured by word 30. No lens ambiguity; accumulative/textural design tightens once through cadence shift rather than plot reversal. Minor cap: no persistent physical price is felt by the prophet’s body, only conceptual cost—keeps it shy of 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The floating orchard is not backdrop but tactical instrument: peach cambium conducts F-sharp, glass buoys become bells, deck planks double as speaker cones. Micro-setting—the music glade, seed-pots, kerosene lamps—constrains where children sleep and where dub can occur. Spatial choreography is flawless: prophet climbs, descends, stands prow, rigs crown; crew tap rails; children dance in cleared circle. Weather evolves from lyre-cloud to spiral-eye, each shift causally linked to sound-fractal feedback. Final image of raft dragging its own acoustic wake is inseparable from setting, charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: convert lethal calm into motion via resonance; signaled in line 1. Single meaningful tightening: Doldrum Wall arrival strips every conventional option, forces invention of acoustic oars. Cost is visible—prophet’s solitude, crew’s exhausted drumming, loss of silence as permanent obligation. Agency remains with prophet throughout; coincidence (cyclonic eye) is triggered by their collective rhythm, not random rescue. Escalation is accumulative/textural: density of beats increases until air itself yields. Would enter 9-band if a personal, embodied price (bleeding knuckles, voice loss) were dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: obstacles → instruments, silence → groove. Motif of fractal echo repeats from inked parchment to sky spiral to bamboo crown, each iteration reweighting stakes. Subtext is the colonial guilt of drift-orchard, exile-as-art; never named, felt in “orchard…who had forgotten the shore.” Final image of raft as self-rowing orchestra offers Conceptual Repricing: progress now demands perpetual performance, endless labor. No moralizing, only charged poise. Complexity lingers—progress bought with unending noise, beauty married to exhaustion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is lush yet precise: “clouds moved in slow arpeggios,” “blue afterimage” of swung mallet through vacuum. Syntax lengthens under calm, fragments under drum-circle frenzy, mirroring pressure. Compression is taught early—“sketched resonance”—and paid off when parchment notations become score for bamboo crown. No dialogue, so voice never contaminated; free indirect stays clean. Single POV maintained; no head-hopping. Diction stays within prophet’s lyrical-technical lexicon; whale-bone, cambium, overtones feel native. Rhythm control peaks in final paragraph, breath-like cadence matching cyclonic inhalation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Read-aloud ear test: sentence lengths vary from rolling lists to terse commands; paragraph cuts mirror scene breath. Information density high—one line can stage, characterize, and foreshadow: “He carried nothing but a single xylophone mallet carved from whale-bone…” No synonym churn or template cadence; each metaphor is internally coherent (lyre-cloud, nautilus sky). No mixed metaphors; physical logic respected. Only micro-scaffold: “the prophet did not smile; he listened” could lose second clause, but it sharpens beat. No artifact touches closure. Proofing clean; pronouns anchored.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Premise—orchard-raft acoustically propelling itself across doldrums—is non-obvious, fully committed, logically extended. Tropes of prophet, storm, and sea are inverted: prophet engineers rather than predicts; storm is instrument not enemy; raft becomes speaker. Specific detail—drumfish silver, F-sharp in cambium—creates irreplaceable texture. Transformation test fails if relocated to land; sound-propulsion requires salt-soaked roots. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off: fractal pattern taught early, reappears in eye-of-wind. Synthesis feels inevitable yet fresh. No derivative template detected.</comment>
