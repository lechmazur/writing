<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The chronicler’s habit of sidelong noticing is dramatized in every gesture—touching tide-words, offering the cicada palm-up—and the daughter’s mirrored “sideways watching” shows a credible shift. Interiority stays concrete (“texture of time… something that can be touched while it disappears”) and the final renunciation of grievance is earned by the pool-side silence and shared warmth. Minor deduction: the wife back-story is delivered in a single expository parcel rather than being probed under pressure, so the emotional cost feels slightly pre-packaged.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Closure is a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration: the warmed cicada and merged silhouettes make reconciliation legible without declaration, paying the cost of swallowed pride. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—each tide-image thickens the dominant stake of “will they speak again?”—and the final cadence shift (“neither night nor day”) reweights time as shared silt. No orientation debt; spatial/temporal anchors (grotto, lantern, star-shift) are fixed by line 5 and return to charge the ending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The grotto acts as a tactile crucible: limestone ribs, phosphorescence, and the gritty basin constrain where feet can rest and where the lantern light lands, forcing the母女 to share a visual field. Micro-setting success: the jade cicada’s temperature change is a measurable environmental feedback that marks the reconciliation beat. Sensory selection skews tidal—salt on lips, drip-syllables—mirroring the emotional ebb without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—repairing the conversational rupture—is signaled in line 2 and tightened only once, but that tightening (the daughter’s hesitant footstep) meaningfully forecloses permanent estrangement. Cost is visible: the mother’s apology is shaped like an insect, a physical forfeiture of pride; the daughter’s half-sob laugh pays the emotional admission price. Under Accumulative lens the pressure rises via image-density rather than plot reversals, satisfying the single-intensification rule.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges sideways, congruent with method: transition is not calendar but patience, sung by cicadas and tide-pools. The final image—morning color that is “neither night nor day”—reconfigures the concept of time from wound to silt-layer, offering a non-literal answer without moralizing. No thematic echo penalties; the one overt metaphor (“pause… is itself a creature”) is dramatized by the breathing pool, not narrated as thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</question>
<comment>Third-person focalization stays tight to the chronicler’s perceptual signature—lanlight fractures, anemone hearts—syntax lengthens then contracts with surf-like rhythm. No head-hop; daughter’s interior is surfaced only through audible breath and gesture, maintaining distance. Filter verbs (“she realized”) are minimal and voice-motivated, appearing only at pivot beats where reflection itself is the action.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies from long tide-swell sentences to staccato drip-syllables; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Metaphors stay coherent within marine logic; “limestone ribs” and “throat between worlds” share anatomical axis without mixed vehicles. One scaffolding trace: “texture of time” is repeated three times; because the final repetition is charged by erasure-in-sand it earns its keep, so penalty capped at −0.2.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</question>
<comment>The tide-pool reconciliation is fresh, but the estranged-duo-using-nature-as-proxy structure is familiar; specificity of cicada lore and sideways method lifts it. Risk taken in lyric compression (no spoken dialogue until final paragraph) pays off by making silence the active agent. Transformation test passes: swap cicada for shell and grotto for forest and the emotional algebra collapses because cicada seventeen-year rhythm is load-bearing.</comment>
