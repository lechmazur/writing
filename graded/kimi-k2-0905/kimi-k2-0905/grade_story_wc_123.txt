<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s “credibly curious” trait is dramatized in the immediate kneel-and-wait beat; her refusal to seed falsified data is a credible renunciation that costs her the surface life we glimpse in the opening. The contradiction between professional precision and outlaw loyalty is held in scene, not summary. Minor slip: “integrity flared like a lantern in wind” drifts toward diagnostic label-speak, trimming the top.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: forged note → lateral move → shaft descent → uncensored readings → backward-written strips released. Each step forecloses the previous option and the closure image (“truth finds its own velocity”) carries undeniable conceptual cost. One micro-turn is sufficient; the lens stays causal throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The courtyard, shaft, and ghost-grid zone are anchored by 120 words and re-employed: gargoyle eye opens the shaft, lichen map redraws stakes, rain finally falls ungauged—charging the closure. Sensory triage matches Elara’s instrument bias—sound of boots, smell of wet limestone, pulse of lichen—rather than tourist catalog. No orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether weather truth survives censorship—tightens when Elara realizes the zone traps raw data, not disease. Her decision to inverse-date the strips pays an on-page price: she seals herself underground, forfeiting dawn-citizen life. Cost is visible; escalation is single but sufficient.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges without citation: information as weather—un-smoothable, needing open sky. The final silver rain reweights every prior gauge reading; no moralizing paragraph required. The vellum-in-her-handwriting motif recurs with shifted meaning, satisfying the recurrence test.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays inside Elara’s instrument-filtered perceptions; diction (“wind shear to the third decimal,” “phosphorescent lichen drew a map”) is specific to storm recorders. Syntax lengthens under calm, fragments under shaft descent—rhythmic control taught early and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density: one sentence can anchor place, body, and tool (“She slipped the vellum into her pocket, shouldered her satchel of barometers, and began to move”). Metaphors stay physical—sky “bruised,” lichen “pulse”—avoiding purple. A single paraphrase loop (“pigeon feathers… pigeon had trained here”) is minor; no artifact touches the ending.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The meteorological archive as censorship organ, lateral shaft as dissident fiber-optic, and backward-dated strips as peer-to-peer forecast are a fresh synthesis. The pigeon courier re-casts bird-as-modem without steampunk clutter. Conceptual risk—quiet ending underground—pays off by recharging the rain image.</comment>
