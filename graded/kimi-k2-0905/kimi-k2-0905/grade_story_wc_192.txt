<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Interior contradiction is vivid—“teaching herself to suffocate properly”—and scars glow only when shared, grounding the ghost-therapy. Yet the keeper’s own suffocation is told, not dramatized in a present beat, so her final “beginning” feels foreshadowed rather than freshly earned. Still, micro-choice (ring pressed to boy’s absent heart) visibly alters both souls and links their cost.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each burn-scar, breath-hold, and star-ash layer thickens until the ring becomes a literal threshold that reweights living/death stakes. Closure is a Charged Poise—she will “practice suffocating again”—with undeniable cost (solitude, perpetual lung-death). Orientation is clear by line 3; no causality breaks, though the boy’s suffocation-backstory is delivered in one compressed info-drop rather than earned revelation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The sanctuary’s collapsed roof, charcoal walls, and star-ash function as micro-setting: proximity dictates ritual circle, scorched floor provides the only safe stage, ring cools in ash-light to mirror lung-cooling. Sensory economy favors texture (iron weight through thin robe) over vista, and spatial choreography tracks ring, scars, and breath without drift. Final image (iron reflecting starlight like frozen tears) recharges the opening tear-metaphor, satisfying closure linkage.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: can the keeper teach a ghost to exhale so she can inhale? Pressure tightens once when shared scars ignite—one live option (link pain) forecloses retreat. Cost is conceptual: perpetual self-suffocation becomes her oxygen. Escalation is singular but sufficient for 700-word window; no reversals needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from reversed respiration: death practiced as life. Subtext lives in gesture—ring on chest substitutes for heartbeat denied to both. Final image reweights “frozen tears” into supply of breath, avoiding moral statement. The loaded emptiness is felt, not labeled, in the closing cadence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric, compressed, with patterned elision taught early (“tender shadow keeper” as oxymoron) and paid off in final suffocation practice. Syntax mirrors breath-shortage: em-dash halts, clause-stacking mimics lung-cram. No head-hopping; keeper’s perceptual signature—every external detail filtered through skin-weight and lung-pressure—remains coherent. Dialogue minimal, stylized, goal-driven.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>High density: “iron weight through thin fabric” does atmosphere + stakes + body in five words. Occasional metaphor stack (“loaded emptiness of someone who had forgotten how to breathe”) risks purple, but pattern is taught and echoed, so tolerated. No loops or scaffold; rhythm accelerates into final dissolution. Pronouns stable, tense clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh angle: ghost therapy via mutual suffocation ritual. Trope of haunted sanctuary is re-etched through charcoal-star roof and ring-as-threshold. Conceptual risk—death-as-breathing—commits fully and lands coherent. Specificity of glowing scar-web prevents generic “ghost hug.” Final reconfiguration feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
