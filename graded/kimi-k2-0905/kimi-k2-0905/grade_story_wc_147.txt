<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira’s compulsive coiling of the copper strap, her salt-tear baptism of the organ console, and the final surrender of the emptied vial crystallize a credible arc from guilt to gift. The interior contradiction—cartographer who maps yet cannot escape—stays embodied, not abstract. Micro-choices (tightening coil, uncorking vial) visibly reorder her hierarchy of values. Cost is palpable: she trades her last unlogged memory for the chord that may outlive her lungs.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the temple keeps singing while Mira is hauled toward a sky she may not reach. The lilac-tinged aria reconfigures solitude into signal, undeniable conceptual cost. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: scented drop → luminous plankton → cathedral resonance. One soft spot: orientation is fractionally late; “cracked lapis tiles” and “flooded nave” arrive after the first 120 words, though the disorientation ultimately pays off in the hush motif.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Environment is never backdrop; pressure equals depth equals dwindling air. Cracked lapis, whale-rider murals peeling like wet parchment, and the coral-choked organ constrain every gesture. The copper coil and crystal vial act as micro-setting, their changing states (tightened, uncorked, emptied) directly governing tactic shifts. Final image of bubbles shaped like lilac blossoms recharges the entire sensory palette.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—make the temple speak before air runs out—tightens exactly once yet decisively: when Mira risks her last unlogged memory. The scented drop’s translation into frequency is the single, visible price that alters options; failure means permanent silence. Escalation is textural, not causal: hush → resonance, solitude → signal. Cost is legible in the lung-burn and the emptied vial left behind.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges without dictation: memory as transmissible music, solitude as renewable chorus. Subtext hides in gesture—tightening coil = rosary of guilt; lilac drop = secular host. No character articulates “loneliness can become signal”; the organ’s exhaled blossoms do the arguing. Complexity preserved: temple’s adoption of her past is predatory and tender simultaneously.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice owns a perceptual signature: salt-tear brine, violet star of scent, radio-note tremor. Syntax mirrors pressure—long flooding clauses until the chord releases in short, bubble-shaped bursts. No head-hopping; single POV stays strictly interior. Occasional tilt toward poetic register (“slowmotion thunder”) is earned by prior pattern of liquid imagery.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is high-density yet breathable; every sentence advances atmosphere or tactic. Metaphors are coherent under water logic: “stone tendrils,” “organ… heart that had forgotten its rhythm.” No scaffold loops; no synonym churn. Peak beat—“She uncorked the crystal perfume vial. The lilac drop drifted out…”—is crystalline, uncluttered. Minor waiver: “slowmotion thunder” risks purple, but cadence demands the slackening.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Familiar rescue-in-drowned-temple is retooled through scent-as-frequency, cartographer turned beacon. Lilac perfume as signal converter is non-obvious yet inevitable hindsight. Temple’s loneliness adopting human memories flips usual “human appropriates sacred” trope. Risk taken: lyric compression over linear cause, paid off by resonant closure. Specificity—from lapis to plankton—anchors freshness.</comment>
