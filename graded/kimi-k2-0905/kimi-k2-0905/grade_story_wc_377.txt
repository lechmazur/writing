<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The tuner’s thirty-year silence, refusal to speak, and final wordless gifting of the wedge are embodied, costly choices. Interior contradiction pulses in the tension between her mute renunciation and the compulsion to keep wonder alive. The heart-sync moment crystallizes a credible, earned change: silence becomes the resonant cavity for future voices. No stock phrasing; every gesture is specific to this ascetic, acoustic vocation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens: each shard adds a new bronze wedge, glacier drop, or micro-adjustment until the comet’s ionic bow reweights the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise: the sculpture’s glow lingers, the boy’s fist closes—cost is the tuner’s emptied pockets and lifelong labor. Causality is lyric-causal: “because she towed every piece, therefore the sky keeps the tremor.” No orientation debt; anchors (bluff, dusk, comet cycle) are legible by line 5.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Environment (basalt stair, thinning air, kinetic ribs) directly constrains every micro-tuning move. The iceberg fragment functions as micro-setting: its melt-rate forces nightly recalibration. Final image—glow persisting above clouds—fuses sky and sculpture into one charged spatial chord. Texture is selective: no visual catalog, only the data a tuner’s ear-fingers would need.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve the color of wonder—tightens as the comet’s approach shortens the calibration window. One meaningful deepening: the iceberg’s shrinkage from glacier to pearl visibly raises the cost of failure. Agency is attention and micro-adjustment; renunciation of speech forecloses any verbal fallback. Price is legible: she leaves empty-pocketed, lifetime of bronze spent, ice gone.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the accretion of metal and silence: wonder is a frequency, not a feeling. Subtext in the boy’s open mouth—next generation’s receiver—needs no exposition. Final image reweights prior material: the sky keeps the tremor, a conceptual repricing that makes her lifetime labor a renewable instrument. No moralizing; the resonance is optical-acoustic, not proverb.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is a percussive, metallic lyricism: “clacking bronze wedges,” “chordless inhale.” Perceptual signature is tuner-specific: she reads micro-oscillations the way priests read breath-scriptures. Syntax mirrors kinetic tension—clause stacks balance like cantilevers. No head-hopping; the single POV sustains its idiom even at climax.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with calibration: short clauses for micro-adjustments, long rivers for comet arrival. Figurative language is sparse and physics-loyal; no mixed metaphors. One paraphrase loop detected (“the droplets glistened like newborn stars before evaporating into the high blue”)—minor, does not touch closure. Information density high; every sentence advances tuning stakes or sensory data.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Premise—silent bell tuner builds kinetic monument to preserve wonder via comet-bowed alloy ribs—is non-obvious and fully committed. Risk of wordless protagonist in a word-heavy medium is embraced, not hedged. Synthesis of acoustics, glaciology, and celestial mechanics feels inevitable in hindsight. Specific detail (bronze wedge from every continent, glacier-forged steel) grounds the concept in planetary lived history.</comment>
