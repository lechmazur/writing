<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Ms. Penumbra’s “sanely eccentric” interiority is textured through obsessive cataloguing and tactile scarf-memory, but the climactic insight—“she was the observer who collapsed the wave function”—is declared, not dramatized with visible cost. The scarf’s analog memories generate embodied micro-choices (tracing spines, warmth flashes) that foreshadow her role, yet the final collapse into meta-observer feels intellectually neat rather than a painful foreclosure of her previous human scale. Still, contradiction is present and sustained: order-seeking woman embracing infinite curvature. No label-speak in peak beats; voice stays particular.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: infinite-curvature center reweights her earlier “search for where stories live” into responsibility for birthing them—cost is the irreversible shift from discoverer to midwife, felt in the scarf’s glowing tangle. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: repeated hyperbolic imagery and scarf-warmth beats tighten the dominant stake (finding pre-narratives) until space itself folds into obligation. Pattern is taught by 25 % (179°→181°→beyond), transitions legible, no orientation debt. Persistent constraint: scarf now carries ten-thousand-novel light; will shape every future shift she mediates.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Scientific-poetry library functions as micro-setting: shelves curve “like inside of a seashell,” constraining locomotion and mirroring her mental warp. Hyperbolic geometry is not backdrop but tool—she steps through angles Euclidean disallow, the physical rule-set enabling her final access to pre-narrative void. Tactile specificity anchors abstraction: “weight of alien suns, texture of unborn languages.” Environment charges final image: infinite-curvature center becomes the literal place where every point touches every story—setting and closure inseparable.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—locate the source of unwritten stories—tightens when scarf warmth signals proximity, then deepens as she realizes the library’s curvature is generator, not container. One meaningful escalation: crossing 179°→181° shelves narrows options from observer to active midwife; hyperbolic space demands she fold narratives into authors. Cost is legible: she forfeits innocence of discovery, accepts eternal labor of collapsing possibility into prose—glowing scarf equals visible price. Agency is attention/stance crystallization rather than external defeat; fits Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: cataloguing obsession meets non-Euclidean infinity, yielding quiet thesis—stories are not found but forced into being by those willing to inhabit the folds between experience. No abstract statement; insight grows from scarf-memory, graduate-student mutter, poet’s shiver. Final reconfiguration reframes earlier poetic topology as labor, not wonder. Resists tidy moral; ambiguity lingers: will the ten-thousand-novel light eventually burn her out? Answer left charged but unspoken.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice carries mathematician-librarian perceptual signature: equations that rhyme, verses that calculate; syntax stays curled, recursive, mirroring hyperbolic cadence. No dialogue to test, yet interior diction remains consistent: “metrical lullabies,” “topological pressure.” Filter verbs serve voice (“she understood now why…”) rather than dulling immediacy. Compression taught early (“179 degrees, then 181, then beyond what Euclid would allow”) and paid off at closure; rhythmic control heightens pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dense figurative language is patterned, not gratuitous: every metaphor is topological (seashell, Möbius, negative curvature) so vehicles cohere. No mixed metaphors or synonym churn; “tattered silk threads now glowing with the light of ten thousand unwritten novels” is precise culmination, not purple excess. Sentence variety supports momentum: long accumulative clauses build to short crystallizing fragments. Minor scaffold: “she understood” appears twice in closing paragraph—does not obscure cause/effect or dull final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Premise—pre-narratives existing in hyperbolic library negative space—is non-obvious synthesis of geometry, memory-textile, and literary metaphysics. Risk of abstraction countered by embodied scarf-archive and tactile shelf-angles. Transformation complete: reader leaves convinced stories gestate in unseeable folds—fresh angle feels inevitable in hindsight. No familiar template echoed; avoids “magical librarian” cliché by making her role cosmic laborer. Bold conceptual commitment pays off in glowing ten-thousand-novel scarf image.</comment>
