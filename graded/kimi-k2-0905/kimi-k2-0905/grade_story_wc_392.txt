<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory motives—hunger for truth vs. recoiling from her own past—are dramatized in the tactile choice to keep walking despite the memory-hit at lantern-flicker; the final "small rebellion" of filing the full report is earned by that causal chain. One interior cliché ("hit like a train") and the late-arriving father-link slightly dilute the sense of prior inevitability, but the embodied tremor on finding the journal shows emotion in muscle, not label, satisfying the 9- test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lens is Accumulative/Textural: tally-wall → hidden journal → generational echo tightens moral weight without causal reversals, landing in a Charged Poise where silence is refused. Orientation anchors by line 6, single transition at alcove keeps scope legal; cost is the irreversible outing of systemic guilt ("she would file the story carved into these walls"). Closure effect clear, though father insertion feels like an 11th-hour rule bolt that slightly muddies earlier constraint.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Tunnel throat, brass-warm lantern, damp chill, and marrow-shaking iron rungs are filtered through Mara’s professional eye for evidence, guiding her next move (kneel, pry box, read). Spatial choreography is immaculate—400 m mark, pipe, platform—so the setting literally supplies the hidden journal that reweights everything. Micro-setting (lantern) constrains visibility and therefore choice in two beats; final image of lantern guiding "these memories out" recycles its symbolic freight without forcing it. No orientation penalty; environment charges closure under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—whether inherited complicity can be refused—tightens once: discovery of Park’s real journal converts abstract guilt to concrete family linkage, raising cost of silence. Escalation is textural density, not causal turns; sufficient for length. No false coincidence; protagonist’s decision to keep walking back with evidence is agency under pressure. Cost visible: professional risk plus filial betrayal now on paper.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges from tally marks → water weaponized → father’s silence: complicity calcifies in darkness; refusal to perpetuate silence is the only release. Subtextual symmetry—lantern once guided slaves, now guides damning memory—earns final line resonance without moralizing. No thematic echo sentence; complexity preserved (city still brittle). Final image reweights prior motifs (tally, water, light) with undeniable social cost.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Mara’s perceptual hierarchy—she notes concrete grooves, hears boot echo, misremembers father scream; no head-hop. Syntax modulates: longer clause chains during memory flood, shorter fragments when lantern steadies, mirroring pulse. Diction ("calcified," "ghost signal") fits investigator lexicon; no corporate intrusion. Filter verbs minimal; one soft intrusion is "she realized suddenly" – forgiven. Read-aloud cadence varied, paragraph breaths align with descent/return motion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dense layering: boots echo / iron rungs / lantern warm / brass surface—each noun carries sensory weight without modifier stack. No mixed metaphor; tunnel-as-throat remains consistent. One paraphrase loop: "She understood... she understood" within 3 lines → −0.2. Sentence starts vary, no template cadence. Active verbs ("descended," "gripped," "refused") replace nominalizations. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line returns lantern image with accrued freight. Minor scaffold: "memory hit like a train" is stock, but does not touch closing beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: drought politics + subway tunnel as confession booth + lantern re-purposed from Underground Railroad to ethical exodus. Specificity—tally-mark weeks, brass warmth—prevents swap with generic noir. Risk of father late-add is bold but pays off by universalizing complicity. Conceptual integrity intact: story commits to infrastructure-as-crime-scene premise without flinching. Not derivatively close to any famous scene. Emotional specificity avoids template victimhood.</comment>
