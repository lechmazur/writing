<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrically specific (“fiercely meditative” enacted through patient butterfly-watching), but the decisive change—choosing “gardens where grief can keep transforming” over carved stone—relies on ancestral exposition rather than a visible micro-choice that costs her on the page; the grandmother-voice spells the insight instead of forcing the carver’s body to act against prior habit. Still, the ribbon warmth and dawn-time emergence give embodied cost, keeping her above the 9− gate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final image of ribbon-now-holding-wing-fragments re-weights her profession and the village’s ritual from “finality” to “ongoing transformation.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—poem-shreds on chrysalises build pattern until the swarm reconfigures meaning—felt cost is undeniable, no contradiction. Orientation anchors inside 120 words (greenhouse at dusk, her chisels, migration intent).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Greenhouse glass, thunder, and potting benches filter through the carver’s stoneworker gaze (rust = time, cracked terracotta = unplaced headstones); the oak cracking the roof literalizes grief breaking containment. Micro-objects—ribbon, chisels, poem-fragments—constrain later choices and charge the final image. Spatial choreography clean; no static catalogue.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“understand why grief feels heavier”—tightens when she realizes she has already carved the unmarked headstones in sleep, foreclosing denial. Under Accumulative lens, density of poem-wrapped chrysalises and swarm-spelled verses re-weights cost; the price (her sleepwalking labor revealed) is legible. No causal reversal, but pattern-break sufficient at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: traded poems = chisel-strokes against sorrow; final image of ribbon-holding-wings answers the thematic question by turning memorial from static stone to living garden. No moralizing; irony resides in her unconscious carving of grief she sought to name. Resonance lingers in butterfly wings carrying poems away—complex, untidy.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Lyric third-person floats close to carver’s perceptual filter—“glass panes rattled with thundering calm” mirrors her meditative pulse; patterned elision (“spectral mentorship” left metaphoric) is taught early and paid off. No dialogue, avoiding voice-collapse risk. Syntax stays chisel-staccato under pressure; no filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High density—“each poem traded at dinner was a small death”—performs triple duty (metaphor, plot, theme). Rhythm modulates: long sentence for swarm-spelled poems, then staccato clause “Inside this living tomb, she understood.” One scaffold: “thundering calm” repeated twice; pattern justifies echo. No mixed metaphors; closure beat crystal-clear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fusion of grave-carving, butterfly migration, and poem-trading feels inevitable, not grafted. Fresh angle: memorial as living chrysalis rather than stone. Risk in lyric abstraction paid off by final re-ribboning with wings—image could not transplant to another plot. No derivative premise; village ritual invented and grounded.</comment>
