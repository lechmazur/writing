<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Chen’s contradictory impulses—spy habit vs. lyrical escape—are alive in every micro-choice (palming film, hollowing bolt, whispering lyrics). The final renunciation costs his identity and safety, foreclosed by prior beats. Keeper remains functional foil; no headcount harm. Interiority avoids label-speak; embodiment strong (“pulse syncing with the turning beam”).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Closure is a clean Earned Stasis: Chen vanishes, island inside him, microdot specs traded for reading glasses—visible conceptual cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of “open secrets” tightens until the final image reweights meaning. No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) landed by line 20. Persistent constraint—prophetic fortune—shapes tactics throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Lighthouse, rocky spine, and hollow bolt function as micro-setting that constrains tactics (exposure by beam, smuggling inside bolt). Final image—“submerged spine of the island hummed”—recharges prior lithophone motif. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV priorities: Chen notices tide-strike pitches, not tourist vistas. Spatial choreography clean; no geography drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—own disappearance—signaled early; tightening occurs when fortune accidentally becomes self-prophecy, narrowing options to flight. Cost legible: forfeits home, name, buyer income. Agency drives every beat (film palming, cookie hollowing, oar strokes). No coincidence; escalation coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</question>
<comment>Theme of “open secrets” emerges through reversal: Chen’s public fortunes are the truest espionage, his final secrecy is art. Final image reweights earlier “rock inside you” from threat to liberation. No moralizing; resonance built from concrete particulars (cookie cracked, bolt hidden). Ambiguity lingers—island hums unanswered—inviting reflection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice owns distinct lyrical compression and maritime cadence taught by line 3 (“beam overhead sweeping its familiar enigma”). POV stable third-person centered on Chen; no head-hopping. Syntax mirrors spy precision vs. poetic swell. Dialogue sparse, subtextual (“light talks”). No filter-verb stacks; diction stays within Chen’s plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>High information density: single sentences deliver micro-action + image + spy tech (“palming a strip of sub-miniature film against the page; the lighthouse lamp would provide the exposure”). Rhythm modulates—short clauses under pressure, longer lyric coils at rail. Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. Opening and final lines anchor and resolve by image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</question>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: fortune-cookie writer as spy whose most dangerous prophecy is his own exit. Lithophone island, microdot specs, and hollow bolt feel idiosyncratic, not scavenged. Risk of lyric insider reference (“negative developing in a tray”) pays off by charging closure. Transformation test fails—story collapses without these exact parts.</comment>
