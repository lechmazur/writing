<comment>The alchemist’s contradictory drives—logic versus reverence—are dramatized in embodied micro-choices (kneeling to feel soil, flint strike, ribbon from mother’s dress). Her final act of melting the crystal is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: the orchard’s exhalation and the white-ink flock patterns flaring across her skin. The “secretly sentimental” trait, however, is told once rather than revealed through contradiction; that keeps it just shy of 9-band.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the hovering drop refracts the entire orchard, re-weighting stakes without heat. Causal chain holds—starling coordinates → crystal location → flame reveal → drop hovering—each step narrows options under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Cost is legible in the final image: she is “unchanged in form yet rearranged in axis,” a conceptual re-pricing that makes the before/after legible.</comment>

<comment>The orchard is not backdrop; mica flashes, quince scent of “winter apples and distant thunder,” and the silver tongs constrain her reach and timing. Spatial choreography is clean: three spirals north, two roots east, scent sharpening to metallic taste—each environmental detail tightens the search beat. The final image recharges these specifics when the drop holds the entire orchard upside-down inside itself.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—prove logic and reverence can coexist—is signaled early and tightened when the impossible crystal is located despite scientific impossibility. One meaningful deepening: the flame does not consume but reveals the orchard’s compressed history, raising the cost of failure. The price is felt in the indigo-ribbon cut from her mother’s wedding dress, a concrete forfeiture that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: the final hovering drop reweights the opening equation—logic offered its last equation, intuition answered with an open hand. Subtext operates in silence (the hush before creation) and image (starling flock as manuscript). The ending refuses moral summation; instead it offers a resonant non-literal answer: “to sing it rightly,” making the thematic cost felt rather than declared.</comment>

<comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains stable focalization; perceptual signature is alchemist-specific—vials clink, mica flashes, prime numbers sung to a starling. Rhythmic control accelerates at the strike of flint, then breathes into long sentences during the orchard’s exhalation. Patterned elision (“the hush before creation”) is taught early and paid off in the final transparent flame.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry triple duty: “Flame leapt, obedient yet wild, painting her auburn hair with embered halos” advances action, character, and atmosphere in one sweep. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; metaphor chains stay coherent (“liquid iron,” “aerial manuscript”). Minor scaffold: “the same cadence” and “the same minor seventh” echo without new pressure, keeping it just below 9-band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of alchemy, starling murmuration, and impossible dew crystal feels inevitable in hindsight yet non-obvious at entry. Risk-taking—frozen dew above heart, transparent flame—heightens stakes without gimmickry. The orchard’s compressed history (child, comet, alphabet-dreamer) is specific to this voice rather than generic mythic furniture.</comment>
