<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The vendor’s interior contradiction—selling absences while secretly craving her own erasure—surfaces in the moment she drinks moonlight and becomes a door; the embodied cost (her vanishing) is legible. Micro-choices (pricing in “seconds of unlived time,” corking the librarian’s memory) reveal a hierarchy of values that tightens to the self-negating climax. The ledger-mirrors that erase buyers’ reflections store white-space hum as permanent, felt price. Voice stays singular, but the lack of secondary pressure keeps her arc just shy of crucible heat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the vendor’s self-erasure reweights the premise—stories begin only where memory ends—and the glimmering parole letters reassemble into the reader’s next first sentence, making the conceptual cost undeniable. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each bottled absence adds density until the orchard sags, the final shatter reconfiguring meaning. Orientation is taught immediately (“brass doors exhaled their first official breath”) and pays off when the building tilts, waiving any penalty. One micro-turn—realizing she is the protagonist—deepens rather than breaks pattern.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The glass orchard library is not backdrop but active pressure: crystal fruit chiming syllables, shelves rearranging to erase aisles, clouds writing dedications that fade unread. The obsidian floor’s “algorithm of absence” directly shapes the vendor’s table placement and pricing method, while the moonlight beam refracts possible prologues onto the ceiling—setting literally projects narrative options. Spatial choreography stays clean: boy steps between shelves, librarian drifts, vendor folds table, all tracked without float. Environment constrains the final image: the library seed-crystal nucleates only by the absences she Collects, so her vanishing is inseparable from setting physics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—quantify absence to buy beginnings—tightens when each sale adds narrative weight that threatens the floating library’s buoyancy, a visible price. The vendor’s agency escalates via pricing choices that foreclose her own future: raising costs in “seconds of unlived time” ultimately costs her entire existence. One meaningful deepening occurs when she drinks the moonlight, turning herself into the door she once only reflected—this narrows options to zero and reweights the stake under Accumulative lens. Cost is legible on-page: her footprints exit onto a shore of white space where nothing yet exists.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question><grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: stories are born only in the negative space left by what we refuse to live or remember. The glimmering parole letters reassembling into “whatever tale the next reader would dare to begin” reweights prior absences into creative potential, a resonant non-literal answer. Subtext operates in gesture—the librarian staggered by a childhood he was never given—and in the vendor’s unspoken self-erasure that mirrors her merchandise. Complexity lingers: the reader is dared to begin, implicating us in the cycle of abandonment and creation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person omniscient stays stable, filtering every perception through the vendor’s perceptual signature of absence-measurement: she “incises the day,” “lets hours bleed in measurable drops,” and finally becomes measurable absence. Diction—“parole word,” “algorithm of absence,” “conceptual repricing”—remains within the narrator’s invented lexicon, never drifting into explain-y register. Rhythm modulates: languid opening sentences mirror cloud-float, then tighten into clipped transactional exchanges, accelerating to the final shard-like cadence of scattered letters. No head-hopping; even the librarian’s stagger is observed externally, maintaining distance control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentence-level propulsion is high: each line layers image, action, and concept—“she uncorked the largest bottle, releasing a beam that stretched across the atrium and refracted through the fruit, projecting fragments of possible prologues”—without scaffold. Metaphors stay coherent within the physics of the world (moonlight as ribbon, absence as weight). Zero paraphrase loops or synonym churn; no filter-verb stacks. Occasional elevated diction (“nucleate,” “ephemeral dedications”) is purposeful, voice-motivated, and taught early, so it never jars.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise—absence-as-currency in a floating narrative seed-crystal library—feels inevitable yet wholly fresh; no extant template matches this logic. The inversion that the vendor must subtract herself to enable any story fuses character arc and world rule into one irreversible turn. Risky lyric compression never obscures clarity because the pattern of “bottle → absence → narrative weight” is taught by 25% and reprises at closure. Specificity carries universality: the terror of unlived seconds and unread dedications is human even inside impossible physics.</comment>
