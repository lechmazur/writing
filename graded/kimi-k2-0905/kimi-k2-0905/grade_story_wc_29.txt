<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyra’s interiority is vivid—her chest registers the town’s fracture as “subsonic tremor,” her lips taste copper during the counter-broadcast—but the “cosmic tricksters” remain an abstract antagonist, so her drive to “interfere” is more concept than contradictory impulse. The earned cost is present: she forfeits certainty, embraces chaos, and ends with “engine oil and ozone” on her skin, yet the moment of sacrifice is narrated rather than dramatized in a single visible beat. Still, her perceptual signature—charts as newspaper of possible futures—individualizes her and sustains pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The piece teaches its Accumulative/Textural pattern early—modulated pulses → ionospheric skip → 37 Hz lullaby—and lands a Conceptual Repricing closure: the town’s loudspeakers hiccup, adversaries lower signs, and “grit…can become a cradle.” Cost is legible in the final image: Lyra presses palm to cooling transmitter, feeling “faintest tremor of returning civility.” Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within 50 words; lens holds without slippage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The cinder-block station smelling of “burnt solder and decades of vinyl dust” is tactile and instrumental: the antique tower becomes the weapon, the warped glacier record the chaos-carrier. Moonlight braided with generator exhaust charges the final image. Micro-detail—SWR needle kissing red, capacitors whining—grounds the speculative tech. Setting constrains every tactical move; no haziness.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent subsonic incitement—tightens through frequency hops and hardware limits; the 5-second “sky-calm” window forecloses retreat. Lyra’s switch from sine generator to glacier pops is a visible tactical trade-off that costs certainty and risks overload. Cost is felt: knees buckle under feedback howl, dogs fall silent, town awake without whispers. Escalation is textured, not causal-chain, but pressure accumulates cleanly under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme—“interference as love”—emerges from the glacier pops’ chaos embracing chaos, not from slogan. Subtext lives in the silence after howl: adversaries “exchange the bewildered eye-contact of sleepwalkers,” reweighting prior hatred as borrowed script. No moralizing; final tag is taut, hopeful yet conditional. Image of grit becoming cradle re-prices the premise without abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is dense, lyrical, compression-patterned: “velvet migraine,” “dolphin-quick hops,” “chipped silver coin.” Syntax mirrors electronic tension—long breathless clauses, then surgical fragments. No head-hopping; perceptual signature stays locked to Lyra’s technician-poet ear. Register never drifts; even technical terms (SWR, ionospheric skip) are filtered through her solder-scented cognition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Almost every sentence carries dual duty—texture and causality: “generator exhaust braided with moonlight” simultaneously paints air and signals overload. No loops, no scaffold, no filter-verb stacks. Metaphors stay coherent under pressure; “gritty lullaby that tasted of copper and thunderstorms” keeps sensory hierarchy. Minor overwrought moments (“color of dried blood”) do not touch closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Trope of “alien signal incites violence” is retooled through radio-engineering specificity and town-politics granularity, not shiny tech. Glacier-calving vinyl as anti-alien carrier is a fresh, earned inflection. Risk—lyric density inside tight tech procedural—pays off in closure image. Conceptual integrity holds: no retreat into generic SF shorthand; stakes stay human-scaled yet cosmic.</comment>
