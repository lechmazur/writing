<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is concrete—her thumb on warm ink, ear to the wall—and her refusal to confront Rico/Jun dramatizes a genuine, costly renunciation. The “open lock” doodle crystallizes her stance, but the moment of letting-go is slightly under-dramatized; we see the symbol, not the internal tremor. Still, her contradictory impulses (accuse vs. absolve) coexist in the same beats, earning the change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: doodles → eavesdrop → lens discovery → communal film → forgiveness. The scavenger-hunt reveal is a micro-turn rather than a reversal, but it meaningfully reweights stakes from theft to trust. Closure lands with visible cost—Mira shoulders the “cloak” of trust, a social price. One soft spot: the prank’s engineered innocence is confessed rather than pressure-tested.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>“Crystal whispering forecourt after rain” is immediately anchored and re-enters the final sweep, charging the “resonant hush.” The missing lens micro-setting constrains action twice—search, then projection—earning the high-band gate. Sensory selection stays urgent: wet-stone smell, dust like plankton, rag-wrapped glass. Spatial choreography is flawless; no impossible body or prop drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—thaw mistrust—tightens when eavesdrop redefines the lens from evidence to olive-branch. One meaningful shift: knowledge that the “crime” was prank compresses Mira’s options to absolve or indict. Cost is legible: she forfeits moral high ground and accepts vulnerability by handing over the annotated ticket. No redundant intensifiers; coincidence merely reveals, not rescues.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the ticket’s evolving symbols: stitched mouth → open lock, secrecy → transparency. No declarative thesis; the silent staff-memories film is the non-literal answer. Subtext in Rico’s “afraid of staying frozen” and Mira’s gravel-soft reply carries the ethical calculus. Final image of sweeping together resists tidy moral, offers charged poise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lingers inside Mira’s perceptual filter—“listening to snow fall upward”—without head-hop. Syntax flexes with pressure: clipped “She almost stepped out” vs. lyrical “dawn began to unbutton the sky.” Diction stays within night-registrar lexicon; no corporate register drift. Dialogue is sparse but distinct: Rico’s mutter vs. Jun’s crisper cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with scene tempo: long sentence for dust-plankton calm, staccato for gate-locking dawn. Information density high—ticket, lens, prank, absolution packed without scaffold. One near-loop: “resonant hush” repeated but reweighted at closure, hence forgiven. Metaphors (snow upward, cloak of trust) are coherent, not contradictory.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: prank-as-absolution inside a post-rain concert hall. The archival staff-reel as silent apology avoids formulaic confrontation. Risk—gentle resolution—pays off by reconfiguring trust instead of exposing crime. Not quite transformative enough to feel inevitable in hindsight; swapable to another workplace, hence stays sub-8.8.</comment>
