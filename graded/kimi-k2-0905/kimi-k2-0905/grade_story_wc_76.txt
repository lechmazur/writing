<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The maker’s self-contradiction—yearning to escape death yet feeding the stone with dread—is dramatized in every micro-choice; cutting the string and accepting normal time costs him his gift, a price legible on the page. Interiority is concrete (“latent radiance now a visible ember eating the string”), never label-speak. No second character on stage, so relationship bullets are waived; the crucible is self vs. time. The final smile and whispered thanks show earned endurance with visible forfeiture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each yoyo attempt → brick loosening → gear reveal → opposed-torque gamble. Closure is a Decisive Change: he slits the string, lands in the workshop, clocks now forward—cost is the loss of reversed time and spent stone. Orientation anchor (“stood on the slick basalt steps… low tide hiss”) arrives by word 24. No teleporting props; every object state (stone warm → ember → cold crack) tracks cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lighthouse, tide, and yoyo-as-tool constrain every move: slick steps foreshadow the mural fall; copper-wire hair conducts the stone’s heat into the mechanism; reverse-gear whine sets the final fold. Body-as-micro-setting: wrist-wound string cuts skin-creases, sparks spray darkness. Final image—stone cracked among untouched gears—recharges the opening thirst. No white-room lapse; spatial choreography survives brick levitation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—evade dawn death—tightens when each failed yoyo trick loosens a brick and accelerates mural clocks. Opposed-torque gamble visibly narrows options: “tear a hole in the hour itself” vs. falling image. Cost is paid on-page: gift erased, stone spent, memory of thirst gone. Agency drives escalation; luck only complicates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the time-reversal conceit: possibility purchased by surrendering specialness. No moralizing; final clock that “told no time at all” reweights earlier reversed gears into quiet freedom. Subtext in gesture—fingering cracked stone like a relic—implies gratitude for mortality restored. Ambiguity lingers: is forward time liberation or loss?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays strictly inside the maker’s perceptual filter; no head-hop. Diction—“dying star,” “hourglass dripping in reverse”—is metaphysical yet anchored to craftsman lexicon. Rhythm accelerates with parataxis during spiral-door leap, then exhales into longer sentences at the workbench. No filter-verb clusters; every image is sensuously embodied.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High-density lines (“time folded like paper; the maker saw two futures”) advance story and image simultaneously. No scaffold loops; each sentence adds new physical or causal information. Mixed metaphors avoided; lighthouse as bell, yoyo as escapement mesh cleanly. Final whispered thanks replaces explanatory paragraph, earning concision.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Clockmaker-versus-prophetic-death is familiar, but welding yoyo-as-escapement to hunger-stone-as-fuel is a fresh, irreplicable synthesis. Conceptual integrity: reverse-time rules are taught early and obeyed; no late cheats. Risk of baroque overload is held in check by concrete metallurgic detail. Transformation test fails if names change—lighthouse gears and copper-hair string are particular.</comment>
