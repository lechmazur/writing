<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The prophet’s precognitive amnesia is dramatized through embodied ritual (chalk on palm, spiral of driftwood) rather than label-speak; his compulsive marking and relistening reveal a hierarchy of values—memory over safety, echo over future. The stance crystallizes in earned stasis: he accepts tomorrow’s erasure, pays the cost of perpetual re-search. Interiority stays concrete (“metallic on his tongue like the flavor of aging itself”). Only flaw: no contradiction between wants/needs is staged; the loop feels fated, not chosen under fresh pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each chalk mark, tape hiss, and fog dissolution adds density until the final spiral reweights the stake—prophet becomes the sound he seeks. Orientation is clear by line 4; no因果 breaks. Closure is a Charged Poise: tape clicks off, spiral drawn, cost is the knowledge that tomorrow’s self will re-enact the loss. Minor waiver: lens ambiguity at midpoint (causal vs. lyric) but pattern is taught and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fog sculptures, VHS shells, and driftwood bones are not backdrop—they constrain movement and shape the spiral path. Micro-setting (chalked mirror frame, yellowed cassette) functions as tool that charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: oxide sweetness, praying-hands fog, gravel crunch all serve the search for impermanence. 9+ gate cleared: driftwood markers materially guide the closing spiral.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capture the sound of growing older—tightens through each failed preservation attempt; options narrow to acceptance. One meaningful deepening: tape played once, tomorrow forgotten, spiral must be redrawn. Cost is legible: perpetual re-enactment, no exit. Coincidence (recorder appears) complicates rather than rescues; agency remains in the act of listening and marking.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from material particulars: magnetic decay = human decay. Subtext in gesture—spiral is both path and ouroboros—requires no exposition. Final image reweights premise: clinging to echoes is letting go. No moralizing; resonance lingers in the audible hum between innocence and experience.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyric-compressed diction (“brittle shells of forgotten memories”, “tidal longing”) is pattern-taught early and sustained. Perceptual signature is consistent: prophet notices erosion, oxide scent, prayer-shaped fog. No head-hopping; tense stable. Rhythm accelerates with tape playback, then settles into cross-legged stillness—modulation matches emotional cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: each sentence layers sensory, metaphoric, and causal work without scaffold. Metaphors stay coherent (fog = breath, driftwood = bones). Zero loops or synonym churn. Minor register lift (“precognitively forgetful”) is voice-motivated and legible. Closure image untouched by artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—prophet who remembers future but forgets past—is non-obvious synthesis of memory, time, and decay. Risk in lyric accumulative structure pays off: repetition is thematic engine, not gimmick. Specific inflection: cassette tape as clock, driftwood as compass. Conceptual integrity absolute; retreat would destroy the spiral.</comment>
