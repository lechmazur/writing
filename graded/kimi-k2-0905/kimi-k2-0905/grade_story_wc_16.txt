<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara’s “carefully reckless” paradox is dramatized twice—triplicate seals while holding a match, then leaving the ink well behind—each move exacts a visible forfeit and locks the trait to closure. Interiority stays concrete: her pulse hammer yet steady hand, ash-and-honey syllables on tongue. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived; single-POV interior contradiction and embodied cost satisfy 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: by surrendering the ink well Elara trades personal proof for civic resonance, cost legible in “her absence the final note.” Causal chain holds—because she offers restitution, the archive reciprocates, therefore trust can propagate—lens stays causal throughout. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) delivered by word 30, no debt incurred.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The archive itself functions as micro-setting: creaking shelves, iron-tasting dust, and the mural of stitched mouths physically resist her quill, constraining her choice to speak restitution aloud. Glass ink well evolves from tool to aurora-like relic, charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy skews auditory—chords, humming—mirroring the sonic stakes of trust.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—restore trust through sonic translation—tightens once: from “translate” to “return what was stolen,” foreclosing the option to keep the score. Cost is the ink well itself and her anonymity, both on-page. Escalation is causal and sufficient for the length; no reversal required.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the sonic covenant motif: trust is a chorus, not a decree. The final image of the humming archive reweights all prior glyphs as living voices, achieving resonance without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture—leaving the ink well speaks louder than any manifesto.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lush yet precise, syntax lengthens during lyrical surges then fractures under pressure (“she dipped—galaxies—then dissolved”). Perceptual signature is music-shaped: every noticed detail vibrates, twinkles, or hums. No head-hopping; register stays elevated but anchored in Elara’s scholar-lexicon. Patterned repetition (“symphonies of truth”) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density: one sentence often layers sensory, emotional, and symbolic work. Figurative language is dense but patterned, never muddled; mixed-metaphor guardrails passed. Rhythm modulates with scene breath, no template cadence detected. Minor paraphrase loop “promise…promise” is purposeful, not artifact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise fuses dead-language archives with sonic covenantal theory—fresh synthesis. Risk: leaving the magic artifact behind rather than wielding it; this reversal is earned and heightens thematic cost. Specificity of prismatic ink, stitched-mouth mural, and choral trust prevents generic transfer to another setting.</comment>
