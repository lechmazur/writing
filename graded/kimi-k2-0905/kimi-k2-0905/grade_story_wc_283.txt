<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interiority is sensorily rich and embodied; the turner’s contradictory impulse—choosing to “unscramble” rather than accept the Abbott’s verdict—drives every beat. Micro-choices (laying out buttons, uncorking the jar, pocketing two keepsakes) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The lack of a second on-page character keeps relationship pressure off the table, but the protagonist’s self-confrontation sustains credible tension. The walrus-ivory / Bakelite pairing in the final image crystallizes a lived history of shed pain and child-chewing terror, earning her quiet renunciation of the tower’s sand-mandate.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the cracked prophecy is re-weighted from “world narrows to a thread” to “garment we button together,” with the canyon echo’s refined silence as felt cost. Causal linkage holds: cracked bulb → leakage → cataloging buttons → spiral restring → silence absorbed → jar resealed with choice-weight. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“amber warehouse beneath the cliffs”) and re-anchored at every transition; no ambiguity at closure. Persistent constraint—the tower now “glinted like a needle”—shapes her next offer to the monks, foreclosing a return to sand-turning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The warehouse’s fossilized-honey beams and resinous dusk function as a micro-setting that constrains acoustics and makes the silence swallow footfalls; buttons laid on a pine plank become the floor’s new constellation. Spatial choreography is clean: spiral circles track generations, gaps mark lessons, boots crunch specific plastics and nacre at the center. Weather is internalized—the “dawn’s first blade” ignites amber walls—charging the final image. Only the “cliffs” remain a gestural backdrop rather than a tactical obstacle, keeping the score just below the 9-band gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether prophecy will narrow futures or reopen them—tightens when cataloging buttons reveals a counter-pattern of continual re-fastening. The protagonist’s agency drives every turn: choose to catalog, uncork, restring, re-seal. Cost is visible: the tower role is foreclosed, the jar regains weight of choice, not sand. One escalation cycle suffices for lyric-accumulative design; coincidence is absent. The price could be even more viscerally corporal to reach the 8.8+ band, but the conceptual cost is legible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Theme emerges from the tactile particular: buttons as witnesses, silence as shared wisdom, sewing versus narrowing. No final-paragraph sermon—insight is delivered via scent of turpentine, salt, iron. The counter-pattern against apocalypse is earned through night-long labor, not assertion. Ambiguity lingers: villagers “understood without a word,” yet the garment is unfinished, inviting future hands.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a distinct perceptual signature: “every footstep sounded like a secret being swallowed.” Diction stays within the turner’s lexicon—no academic register drift. Rhythm modulates: long honeyed clauses in amber dusk shorten to “she lifted the empty jar” at climax. No dialogue to distort voice; compression and elision are pattern-taught early (“for three cycles…”) and paid off in the final lullaby hush.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Sentences carry double duty: “resinous beams filtered dusk into fossilized honey” fuses setting, atmosphere, and metaphor in one breath. Metaphors stay coherent—no mixed vehicles. A few near-adjacent color adjectives (“old copper,” “fossilized honey,” “molten glass”) risk visual checklisting but serve the amber motif. No loops, scaffolds, or synonym churn; information density remains high without purple overload.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</question><comment>The prophecy-to-buttoning synthesis feels inevitable yet non-obvious: lost fasteners as archival future is a fresh angle. Buttons constrain choice—each gap a lesson—avoiding quirky ornament. Risk in lyric structure pays off: silence teaches collectively, not sand. The transformation test fails if sand or buttons are swapped, confirming originality.</comment>
