<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and character-specific; the narrator’s guilt, craft knowledge, and sensory bias feel lived-in. The decisive moment—threading the card through the rope—crystallizes his renunciation of bronze-forging for breath-capture, paying the cost of letting the paper dissolve. Micro-choices (warming each strand, tasting thaw-water names) embody his hierarchy of values without therapeutic self-analysis. No contradictory impulses are rendered simultaneously in scene, so the 9+ quick test isn’t quite met, but the arc of forgiveness to transmission is credibly earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the card’s dissolution reweights preservation from static artifact to mutable air, felt cost unmistakable in “heavier by the cargo of voices.” Accumulative lens holds throughout—each sensory braid adds density until the aurora flares white, then eases into dawn melt. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are taught by line 3 and payoff at closure when the same aurora skylight dims. No causal breaks; rope-and-card mechanics are legible and constrain the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The sanctum’s black-ice pylons, lavender-reflecting braids, and frost-lensed skylight actively constrain gesture—kneeling, warming strands, hearing sub-audible hum. Environment charges the final image: aurora dimming to “customary emerald hush” mirrors the shift from capture to release. Micro-setting (the frayed card scrap) functions as terrain the protagonist must physically lace, not merely admire. No spatial drift; bodies, rope, and skylight track cleanly across the single continuous scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving names before glacier erasure—is signaled early and tightens when the card’s fragility forbids mechanical playback, forcing the improvised rope-loom transduction. One meaningful deepening occurs: the rope’s fibres “drank the pattern” and the pylons hum, audible cost that forecloses the option of keeping the paper. Protagonist’s agency drives every beat; no coincidence resolves tension. Cost is visible yet not persistent enough for 8.8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: memory survives only by surrendering permanence—bronze bell replaced by breath-on-wind. The punched-card-cum-lullaby reconfigures from fragile relic to mutable medium, reweighting preservation as transmission. Final image of “spring rivers learning names” offers non-literal answer to loss versus memorial. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the unrecoverable paper.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person voice sustains a rhythmic, chant-like cadence that mirrors organ-card perforations—short clauses, em-dashes, colon breaks—taught by sentence 1 and paid off in the dissolving final line. Perceptual signature is concrete and idiosyncratic: “coppery ghost of old blood,” “scalloped by boot heels.” No head-hopping; lexicon stays within a caster–archivist’s diction. Compression under aurora flare heightens rather than obscures clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentences perform double duty: “I spread the card on the packed snow like a map of negative stars” advances action while layering metaphor. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; each clause adds new sensory or causal information. Figurative language is patterned (ice, breath, music) and pays off in closure. Minor overwrought phrase (“snowmelt ardor”) is the single hairline slip preventing 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Forged-bell-caster turned breath-archivist is fresh vocational fusion; rope-as-loom organ-score is a specific, non-obvious transduction machine. Risky lyric compression succeeds because pattern is taught early and closure remains legible. Premise could not survive swap to generic survivor—craft knowledge drives mechanics. Transformation feels inevitable in hindsight yet surprising in execution.</comment>
