<comment>The timekeeper’s tactile obsession with the urn fragment and price-tag ledger gives a consistent, embodied motive; his climb and final trade show a micro-choice hierarchy. Interiority stays concrete (“metallic dust that settled on the tongue”). Yet the closing swap feels lightly motivated—no prior contradiction or flaw is risked or paid, so the renunciation cost is present but thin.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the shift from measuring time to exchanging sensations is crystallized when the fragment is traded for a snow-globe minute, reweighting the world’s currency. Causality under Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each description-tag adds density until the final barter reconfigures meaning. Orientation is anchored by word 80; no teleporting props. Cost is legible—“genuine shiver” and the felt footstep-Braille—though the beat is brief.</comment>

<comment>Emerald silo, rusted gauge, and wheat horizon are sketched with selective sensory economy; the porcelain shard serves as micro-setting that constrains the final trade. Dust motes and iron-tasting light integrate into the texture-of-time premise. Environment does not physically block choices but metaphorically charges the closing image; hence misses the 9+ gate yet remains vivid and purposeful.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—rediscover felt time—signals early and tightens through each price-tag description; the fragment trade forces a concrete forfeiture, narrowing options from keeper to participant in the new barter economy. Escalation is textural: blank tape/newspaper vs. inked tags heightens the contrast between erased and remembered time. One meaningful deepening suffices; cost is visible but not irrevocably painful.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: when numbers collapse, narrative memory becomes currency. Subtext lives in the boy’s shrug and the woman’s departing footsteps—commerce turned elegy. Final image of “first minute of every December” offers resonant ambiguity without moralizing. No thematic echo violations.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person POV stays tight to the timekeeper’s perceptual filter—cracked glaze = cracked hourglass, iron-taste of light. Syntax lengthens during ascent, then fragments at the swap, mirroring attention. No head-hop; diction stays within his weathered lexicon. Distinctive, consistent, and pressure-responsive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with ascent and sale bustle; sentences vary in length and opening. Figurative layering is dense but patterned—time as dust, currency as story—without mixed metaphors. One paraphrase loop (“price tags… descriptions” twice in 40 words) docks 0.2. Otherwise lean, information-dense, and read-aloud clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise flips apocalypse into lyric commerce: numbers strike, so garage-sale prose becomes coin. The price-tag micro-diaries feel fresh and inevitable; the urn-shard cairn atop a grain-silo clock-tower images a world remade. Risk—abandoning numeric time—heightens coherence without gimmickry. Transformation survives proximity checks.</comment>
