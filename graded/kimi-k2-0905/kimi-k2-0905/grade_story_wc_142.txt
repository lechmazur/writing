<comment>Lina’s interior contradiction—wanting the city unchanged yet fearing its erasure—drives every graffiti stroke and midnight speech; the stone chip’s final swing against her chest tolls the cost of that split. Emotion stays embodied (thumping necklace, candy-for-stories barter) rather than diagnosed. The renunciation of the chip’s talismanic certainty is earned: she has rehearsed losing the city all night. Only the Syndicate negotiators remain silhouettes, but they are plot functions, not crucible partners, so relationship pressure is absent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: Lina’s release of the stone reconfigures “becoming” as an endless drift rather than a possessable landmark, and the cost—perpetual unreadability to outsiders—is legible in the final image of the city sailing “unreadable.” Causality holds: each graffiti tag, barge swap, and riddle child is a because/therefore riposte to the inspectors’ arrival. Orientation is anchored by line 3’s drowned coast and calliope dawn; no disorientation persists. One minor scaffold: “bright, rickety, and unreadable” triad could compress, but it does not dull the final toll.</comment>

<comment>The raft city is not backdrop but tactical terrain: container alleys allow covert graffiti, deck swaps obstruct inspectors, carnival masks weaponize spectacle. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—Lina catalogs “corporate teal” and “surveyors’ orange” as threats, not décor. The stone chip functions as micro-setting; its grain “like tiny waves frozen mid-crash” mirrors the city’s stasis-in-motion and charges the final release. Spatial choreography is clean: inspectors retreat to speedboat, children orbit Lina, no impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve communal autonomy—tightens when the Syndicate’s measuring tapes translate into “bigger barges and sharper contracts.” The meaningful turn is the overnight layout swap: libraries for gaming barges, poems for plush prizes; this forecloses the investors’ comfort zone and carries visible price (sunrise bread now free, bankrupt baker’s subsidy). Escalation is accumulative: each grotesque mask adds density until the city becomes illegible capital terrain. Cost is felt but not yet paid in blood or cash; the threat remains prospective, capping the score below 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme—value of unownable drift—emerges through image, not thesis: the city that cannot be read is the city that cannot be bought. Subtext lives in graffiti semiotics (harlequin tears, roulette wheel) and the children’s riddles that repurpose candy as oral currency. The final image reweights the opening “perpetual carnival” from nostalgic refuge to ongoing refusal of price. No moralizing paragraph; the toll is the stone’s unmoored swing, a non-literal answer to the privatization question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is carnival-barker cadence fused with anarchist cartographer: “strings of bulbs flickered on to keep the dark from remembering land prices.” Perceptual signature is Lina’s—she sees colors as trespass, hears calliope as klaxon. Rhythmic control peaks in the burning-cursive “reclaim” and the final litany “bright, rickety, and unreadable.” No head-hopping; collective “they” is choral exterior, not interior slippage. Compression like “gravity became negotiable” teaches the pattern early and pays off in the unreadable drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is dense yet buoyant: single sentences perform world, metaphor, and plot (“corporate teal…surveyors’ orange”). No loops or scaffold; each clause advances. Metaphors stay coherent—stone as bell, city as unreadable text—without mixed collisions. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image. Minor overwrite: “投射的火花” is untranslated fire that may jolt anglophone ear, but the flare is brief and thematically apt, so penalty stays sub-0.3.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Floating carnival-as-city-state is fresh, yet the deeper originality is treating gentrification as surreal circus takeover: poems on dissolving rice paper as prizes, investors mocked by their own grins. Specificity—painted ferry prows, gold-toothed calliope—prevents abstract allegory. The stone chip’s evolution from heritage talisman to relinquished bell feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk—letting the city stay rickety rather than victorious—heightens theme without obscuring clarity.</comment>
