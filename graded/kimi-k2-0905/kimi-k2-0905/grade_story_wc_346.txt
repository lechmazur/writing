<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The adjuster’s contradictory impulses—duty to the Council vs. ache for the puppet—collide inside each lullaby iteration; embodied in cracked lips against splintered wood, the choice to stay and erode is earned by every prior cradle she rocked. The broken puppet’s milky eye asking if salvation is worth finishing the song crystallizes the cost on-page. No stock labels; interiority stays concrete, trembling fingers, iron-taste acceptance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: her eternal whisper pressed to the pane reconfigures time itself, the price erasure of her own future. Accumulative lens holds—each nested lullaby beat adds density until silence circles back to music; the pane’s final transparency is the visible cost. No orientation debt; lighthouse, dusk, who and when anchored by line 3. Cause/effect intact—because she sings, midnight retreats.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The lighthouse’s spiral rails shrink like birth canals, constraining ascent; the pane of hush and puppet head act as micro-setting that charge the final image. Salt-stained iron curls, damp sand that remembers footsteps, cooling glass against forehead—selective, tactile, filtered through adjuster’s exhausted body. Environment literally guides choice: only at the summit can the pane swallow sound and reverse time.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—halt doomsday—signaled in title; escalation is the thickening of lullaby iterations that gradually turn the pane transparent, each loop carving lifelines she must forfeit. One meaningful tightening: when midnight shudders backward one tick, the cost becomes her perpetual erosion into salt. Agency is endurance/renunciation; she could flee but presses forehead to glass, foreclosing escape.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: imperfection as the only song worth singing, cracked mouths still shaping mercy. Subtext lives in the puppet’s flaked crescent smile mirrored in her own accepted flaw at the end. Final image—her ghost mirror letting future children sleep—reweights all prior cradles into a conceptual social cost we feel. No moralizing; resonance arises from specific iterated lullabies, not abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: gears she “no longer trusted,” sand that “remembered every footstep,” pane that “drank the orange afterglow.” Syntax compresses under pressure—“thought dissolved into the hush.” No head-hopping; lyric elision taught early (“nested patterns of salt-stained iron”) and paid off at closure. Dialogue absent by design; voice holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>High information density: each sentence does two jobs—world, emotion, metaphor—“veins of mercury pumping beneath numerals that bled.” No loops or scaffold; rhythm varies from long breathless climbs to fragment—“Midnight shuddered.” Metaphors stay coherent (pane as tongue probing sore tooth). Minor purple tint in “bruised purple” but supports tone; does not obstruct closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: doomsday adjuster + pane of hush + lullaby as time-reversal engine feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk—lyric accumulative structure that ends in Earned Stasis—heightens meaning without gimmick. Specificity anchors novelty: 1943 London flak, glacier colony ship, dream-city toy radio. Transformation test passed; story collapses if any element generic. No template echoes.</comment>
