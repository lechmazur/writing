<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The reaper’s contradictory impulse—longing to name the fear he breeds—powers every beat; the plague-cot flashback crystallizes his guilt and the final paper-souls lift carries visible cost. No voice leakage; interiority stays bone-dry and specific to an immortal who has forgotten how to speak. The micro-choice to shatter the wax cylinders (freeing trapped voices) directly earns the absolving pulse he feels in his hollow chest. Flaw: late-arriving realization “every soul he reaped had paid…” is slightly abstract; still, the embodied ledger of initials on the atlas converts it to felt weight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each image (quartz dust, copper mirror, paper boat) layers density until the atlas page re-weights into a ledger of sacrifices. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise: the reaper steps onto borrowed starlight, now pulsed by human cost rather than theft. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“ancient observatory at dusk”). One causality hairline: the atlas boat’s keel “cuts the star-sentences until they bled” is poetic but physically fuzzy; however, the beat’s symbolic turn is taught early, so waive penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Observatory, copper pool, and atlas page each constrain tactics: the dome’s star-map sentences force confrontation; the liquid-copper mirror traps his reflection; the atlas folds itself into vessels that carry the named sacrifices away. Micro-setting qualifies; the atlas page’s evolving states (flat → boat → ledger → paper souls) directly charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy skews visual, but the brine/gunpowder smell and frost fingertip widen the palette. One minor telescope lens continuity skip (quartz dust vs. cracked lenses) does not disturb choreography.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reaper’s need to name the fear he creates—tightens when star-sentences literalize people’s last bargains. Agency: shattering cylinders releases voices that complete the sentences, narrowing his option to keep stealing existence; instead he folds their payment into ascending paper souls. Cost is visible: the brother’s accusing gaze in the copper mirror and the warm “tear” streak make the price legible. Escalation is single but sufficient under Accumulative lens; no reversals needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sacrifice as echo emerges solely through images: krakens drawn by doomed sailors, star-sentences of last bargains, atlas turned ledger. No moralizing; the final pulse inside the hollow chest reweights centuries of death as unpaid debt now acknowledged. Ambiguity lingers: forgiveness is felt, not declared. Insight is earned via concrete sequence rather than platitude.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is perceptually specific: “boots grinding quartz dust that had once been lenses,” “silver lice” constellations. Rhythmic control compresses under pressure—“Memory slammed into him like chapel bells”—then elongates in the ash-settling cadence. No head-hop; diction stays within an ancient death-agent’s register. One elision—“words were for the living”—is taught and paid off when he can only click his jaw.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High density: “Each monster was a sacrifice crystallized” performs thematic and narrative work in one stroke. No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay consistent (starlight as dripping fluid, copper as mirror/ledger). Sentence variety accelerates the observatory awakening then breathes at the paper-souls lift. Minor register spike—“conceptual repricing” concept is implicit, not labeled—so no drift penalty.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: immortal bureaucrat of death forced to audit his own unpaid tab via nineteenth-century nautical star charts and wax cylinders. Risk of lyric montage pays off because closure remains legible. Specificity—krakens as widows’ recognition guide, quartz dust from shattered lenses—anchors the fantastical in lived detail. Transformation test fails: swap reaper with generic ghost and the moral ledger collapses; hence originality is high.</comment>
