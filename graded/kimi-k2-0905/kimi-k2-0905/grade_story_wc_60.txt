<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is concrete—her skepticism shows in testing the box’s weight and in the measured way she speaks to it at the end. The “liberation, not grief” motive drives every beat; each fountain stop is a micro-choice that dissolves a shard, visibly foreclosing the option to keep repressing. Contradictory impulses (yearn to forget vs. need to witness) play out in real time as she lifts, touches, opens. Cost is legible: the empty box is physically lighter, the sky re-animates—an earned stasis that accepts the family she cannot reclaim.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the memories dissipate as steam, the geese resume—an image that reweights the whole premise of “trapped” past. Causality is accumulative/textural: each breadcrumb of light thickens the pattern until the final release, cost felt in the hollow box left behind. Orientation is immediate—who, where, when inside 30 words. No lens ambiguity; the sidereal patience motif holds from first line to last.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The city’s dry fountains function as micro-setting: each basin’s state (glass water, mirror surface) directly constrains what memory Mara can access. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—she notices temperature shifts in the box before any visual detail. Spatial choreography is clean; she walks the breadcrumbs, never teleporting. The final image—the empty fountain basin now irrelevant—charges the release, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—liberate the memories—tightens four times, one per fountain, each dissolution narrowing the option to keep denying. Agency is accumulative: handling the box dissolves shards; the cost is the accumulating lightness she must finally accept. No external reversals needed; pressure is internal and coherent. Final price is the hollow box she can now abandon, foreclosing her exile from her own past.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the pattern of fountains-as-memory-sites; no abstract statement needed. The image of paused geese migrating away with the steam is a non-literal answer to how forgetting happens—by being witnessed, not willed. Subtext is in gesture: speaking to the box as “daughter” rather than skeptic. Moral complexity remains—she once abandoned a child herself; the story does not pardon, only releases.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded: “sidereal patience of stars long dead” is compressed, taught early, paid off when the stars’ patience ends and geese move. Syntax modulates—long sentence for frozen geese, fragments as shards dissolve. Perceptual signature is skeptical-scientific: she tests weight, temperature, reflection. No head-hopping; single POV holds. No dialogue, so no register drift; prose rhythm heightens without obscuring causality.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Information density high—“memory of water lingered in every dry basin” does three jobs. Figurative language is patterned (sidereal, breadcrumb, perfume) and resolved at closure. No mixed metaphors; loops or scaffold absent. Final image crystallizes without clutter, meeting 9+ bar.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: memory-as-constellation trapped in stained-glass is not stock magical object. City of dry fountains reverses expected water-memory trope. Risk—lyric accumulative structure rather than causal plot—pays off in resonant reconfiguration. Specific detail (salt-and-iron kisses, glass water) prevents abstraction. Would collapse if names or setting swapped, proving conceptual integrity.</comment>
