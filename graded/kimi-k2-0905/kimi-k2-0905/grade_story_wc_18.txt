<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The mirror maker’s interior contradiction—longing to dissolve boundaries yet needing to reclaim her own dream—remains embodied in every breath and micro-choice; the bleeding palm and restored sextant crystallize her cost and earned reintegration. Motive intensifies cleanly from stalled mirror → orchard return → blood payment → dream rooted. No second character on page, so relationship bullets N/A. Closure choice is causally earned and irreversible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Causal lens: each breath/blood act tightens options until the dream is re-anchored. Orientation (who/where/when) is clear by line 3. Closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost—blood, soldered sextant, sapling mirror-leaves—reconfiguring solitude into orchard-rooted growth. No lens ambiguity; constraint persists in the sapling.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fog, frost, and mirrored leaves are filtered through the maker’s glass-blower perception; every sensory pick guides her breathing cadence and final palm-press. The orchard’s resurrection is tactile, not postcard: frost melts under palm, bark shines obsidian. Micro-setting (body, sextant, blood drops) constrains the climax. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly within the corridor of mirrors.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—recapture runaway dream—signaled in paragraph 4. Escalation: failed mirror → orchard return → breath-seams → corridor → blood tether → sapling anchor. Each step narrows options under causal lens; blood loss is felt price. No coincidence; dream hesitation is reaction to her pulse-line.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of boundary-dissolution emerges through glass, fog, and mirror-leaves; final image reframes erasure as creative breathing, not destruction. No articulated thesis—meaning arises from blood-paid integration. Ambiguity lingers: glass mountains now rooted, yet still reflective. Final whispered clause reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate maintains glass-artist perceptual signature: “molten glass,” “silver breath,” “needle’s eye.” Rhythm modulates with seven-five breath count; compression under corridor pressure feels intentional. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets N/A. Free indirect style clean; diction stays within artisan lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is dense but pattern-taught (glass, frost, mirror) and pays off in sapling image. No mixed metaphors; “aurora folded into her chest like silk collapsing into a needle’s eye” is precise. Information density high; every line advances breath, blood, or boundary.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: sextant as heart-cutting tool, orchard as mirror-birthplace, breathing as glass-blowing ritual. Dream-capture via blood-tether reverses typical “trap” trope into organic graft. Risky lyric escalation sustained without clarity loss. Specific glass-craft detail makes premise irreplaceable.</comment>
