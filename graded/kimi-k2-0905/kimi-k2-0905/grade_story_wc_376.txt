<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Aurelia’s interior contradiction—her skin blistering at lies yet earning her living gilding them—grounds every move; the moment she trades gold foil for zinc fragments her hierarchy of values flips with visible cost. The archivist’s matching ache is sketched only in glances, but their shared renunciation of filtered speech crystallizes a relationship shift that feels earned. Micro-choices (slipping out before curfew, pressing the calfskin strip among unopened letters) keep agency taut. Only the absence of a deeper flaw or secondary pressure keeps this just shy of 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each shard of map and letter adds density until candor itself becomes the reclaimed water. Closure is a Charged Poise—two silhouettes reflected unafraid in greenhouse glass—whose cost is the irrevocable abandonment of the city’s lie-based survival system. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“greenhouse glass”), transitions are legible across the night’s descent, and the final image reweights every prior filtered breath. No causality breaks; the map’s gap is filled by the archivist’s matching plate, not coincidence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The greenhouse’s pneumatic roots, filtration veils, and decommissioned Fern Cathedral are not backdrop but life-support the characters must betray. The zinc postal plate fragments—handled, matched, and finally clinked like bells—function as micro-setting that alters tactics: without their raised ridges Aurelia could never navigate or trust the path. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: gilded leaf glints under grow-lamps, vines “taste” truth, moonlight stripes the nave—each detail selected to mirror the stakes of candor. Environment constrains the final choice to keep returning nightly, capping the score just below 9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can honesty survive after ecological collapse?—is signaled in the opening paragraph and tightens when Aurelia pieces the map to “find where lost conversations go.” The meaningful deepening occurs inside the cathedral: realizing the repository holds no water but only interrupted words forecloses the fantasy of material treasure and forces the interpersonal risk of staying to read letters aloud. Cost is legible: she forfeits her last gold foil and accepts perpetual exposure to toxic air without filtration lies. The vines’ slight lift is an external register of pressure shift, not a deus ex machina, keeping escalation coherent under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: candor as scarce irrigation. The calfskin strip—never lied to—becomes the sacrament that re-consecrates the cathedral, reweighting earlier gilded lies into a living correspondence. Subtext resides in gesture: two ex-functionaries of deception silently matching postal fragments enact the very candor they fear. Final image of reflected silhouettes offers a resonant, non-moral answer: clarity itself is the new oasis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Aurelia’s perceptual signature—words blister her skin, zinc ridges “promise delivery,” moonlight “stripes” like exhausted parishioners. Syntax lengthens under wonder, shortens under curfew fear; no head-hop. The archivist’s veil-lowering is externally observed yet carries subtextual punch. Distinctive diction (“gilded-leaf,” “zinc-etched,” “filtration veils”) sustains a consistent lyric register without purple drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “she understood then that the map did not lead to gold or water but to the repository of every conversation interrupted by catastrophe” performs four jobs—insight, emotional cost, thematic pivot, and world rule—in one sentence. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances stance or image. Metaphors stay coherent (vines tasting truth extends the greenhouse’s biological air-scrub). Rhythm modulates from long breathless clauses to the staccato of dawn departure. A single hairline slip—“throat tightened with a confession she had never mailed”—edges toward label, but immediate embodiment (“I am lonely beneath my gilt”) rescues it.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of calligraphy, pneumatic post, and eco-dystopia feels inevitable yet unseen before. Turning a shredded address plate into both map and key flips the familiar treasure quest into an archaeology of lost intimacy. Risk is taken in the lyric accumulative structure, but pattern is taught early (“zinc-etched postal plate fragments”) and paid off when the archivist produces the missing piece. The final postal metaphor—Aurelia as “first postmaster of honesty”—reconfigures the entire premise without gimmick, earning the high-band bonus.</comment>
