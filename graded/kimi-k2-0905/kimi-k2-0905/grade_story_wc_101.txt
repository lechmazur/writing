<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is concrete and character-specific—her coat-pocket awareness of the muffled bell, the cart’s false-bottom weight, the pebble ritual—each micro-choice reveals a hierarchy of values under pressure. Internal contradiction flickers only once (hope vs exile fatalism) and is embodied, not labeled. The final silent lift of the bell crystallizes earned endurance with visible cost; no path is reset, no slogans intrude. Voice stays individual, never drifts into committee exile-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the wool slips, the bell stays silent, yet the air vibrates—an amplified quiet that reconfigures the network’s stakes without a physical act. Causal linkage holds throughout: every crate, pebble, and whispered ledger entry tightens options under sanctions. The bell’s earlier set-up (engraved ridge, muffled clapper) pays off in the final image, embedding home as sensory prohibition. Under accumulative lens, pattern intensifies rather than resolves, satisfying the 9+ cost-test on the final line.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Terra-cotta arbor, rattling cart wheels, sage scent through broken tiles—details are filtered through Mara’s vendor-strategy gaze, never touristic. The ridge silhouette engraved on the bell fuses setting and tool, constraining the exodus spiral countdown. Spatial choreography is clean: alley loops, doorway drops, ridge climb track without drift. Environment silently governs tactics—no speech could travel farther than sage-scented dawn.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keep communal memory alive while smuggling survival—tightens when sanctions threaten to ration memory itself. Midnight frequency decision triples risk rather than portions, a protagonist-driven tactic that narrows future options. Cost is legible: heavier cart, tear-smooth pebble, bell’s wool finally removed—each a measurable price. Escalation lands under accumulative lens; no reversal needed, only density shift that forecloses silence-as-safety.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from iterated images of quiet—muffled bell, censored stars, shutter breath—until the final silent toll reframes quiet as collective resistance rather than absence. No character moralizes; Lita’s “memories will be rationed” is a datum, not a thesis. Subtext lives in gesture: pebble exchange = census of persistence. Final image offers non-literal answer: silence can map home louder than slogans.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person close stays anchored to Mara’s sensorium; no head-hop into boy or Lita. Syntax modulates with pressure—long cadence for cart rolls, staccato for clicks. Diction stays within plausible exile-educated lexicon, avoiding academic drift. Filter verbs appear only when voice-motivated (“she felt its tremor”) to show secrecy, not detachment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes: paragraph lengths visually echo climb-descent cycle; no template cadence detected. Figurative control tight—“terra-cotta flakes glinted like dried blood” is single allowed simile, earned by arbor violence. Information density high: one sentence slips rice, oil, stories into cart load. No paraphrase loops; each sensory detail advances goal or stakes. Sentence variety supports momentum under 800-word cap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The sanctions-era “midnight food run as memory archive” angle feels freshly synthesized; nothing reads like stock refugee tableau. Bell-as-map-home weaponizes silence instead of overt symbolism, its engraved ridge locking setting and exile into one object. Risk taken with amplified-quiet tonal axis pays off in final reconfiguration. If ported to another place, entire scaffold collapses—proof of irreplicable specificity.</comment>
