<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vividly concrete—rolling the dice until the chipped one balances on its missing corner embodies her mathematician’s obsession with asymmetry and regret. The contradiction between grim realism and stubborn optimism drives every micro-choice (leaping primes, smearing blood in sigma). Final refusal to step through the ripple costs her the escape she craved, earning Earned Stasis with visible palm-cut price. Only slight abstraction in “ghost-weight of a hand” keeps this from 9-land.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the staircase begins to forget her after she lodges the chipped die like a key—timeless imprisonment revalued into deliberate erasure. Causal linkage holds under Accumulative/Textural lens: each blood-stamped step layers density until the staircase convulses; the missing-corner balance is the pattern-break that rewrites the rule-set. Cost is unmistakable—she trades her memory-of-self for the texture she sought. Minor orientation waiver applies (who/where deliberately blurred), but disorientation pays off in the final image.</answer>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The staircase itself is the micro-setting that constrains every choice: perpetual motion dictates her gait, prime-number leaps, and the final negative count. Velvet-thick air and stone that ripples like water charge the closing hand-touch without overt symbolism. Object-as-setting (the dice) doubles as tool and anchor, their chipped edge literally cutting the sigma-blood that rewrites the stairs. No spatial drift; geography stays coherent even as steps fold like paper.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capture the texture of missed opportunity—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens when she trades infinite climbing for erasure. Escalation is textural: each blood-stamp increases the staircase’s memory of her, paradoxically hastening its act of forgetting. One meaningful deepening occurs at step −1 when she feels the hand reach back yet refuses to grasp it, paying the price of perpetual exile. Cost is legible and protagonist-driven; coincidence absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: regret as an infinite series that can be summed only by self-erasure. The sigma blood-figure re-prices mathematics from proof to scar, reweighting “recursive regret” into lived texture. Ambiguity lingers—was forgetting herself the only escape, or just another unclosed loop? Resonant final image (staircase forgetting) offers non-literal answer: memory and identity are the price of climbing. No moralizing, no thesis line.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: mathematician’s diction (“prime numbers,” “sigma symbol,” “recursive function”) filtered through embodied synesthesia—dice clatter as acoustic proof. Rhythm modulates with ascent: short clauses for climbing, elongated sentences for velvet-thick air. Compression taught early (“probability was a liar here”) pays off in final ellipsis as the staircase forgets. No head-hopping; single POV holds. Filter verbs minimal and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentence-level propulsion is high: information-dense lines (“ghost-weight of a hand that once almost held hers”) do double atmospheric and emotional work. Zero loops, no synonym churn; each metaphor is internally consistent (steps fold like paper—physics of infinite confinement). One near-overwrite: “heart ticking like a gear with a missing tooth” borders on stacked metaphor, but the image of asymmetry justifies it. Final line cadence mirrors staircase falter, satisfying read-aloud ear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: infinite staircase as both mathematical topology and emotional feedback loop, regret modeled as divergent series that demands self-erasure for convergence. Risk in negative-step count and conceptual closure (staircase forgets protagonist) pays off without gimmickry. Specificity of chipped die lodging like a key feels inevitable in hindsight, not contrived. Avoids safety-middle—no tidy reunion, no moral, only texture traded for identity.</comment>
