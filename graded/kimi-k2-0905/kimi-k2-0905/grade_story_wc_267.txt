<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The bellhop’s embodied grief and ritualized bolt-turning give him a sharp, specific interiority; his renunciation at the end—standing sentinel instead of speaking—carries visible cost. Motivation stays legible: every climb re-enacts the theft of voices and measures the price. The boy’s gaze tightens the crucible, but the bellhop’s own contradictory hunger for/terror of sound could be staged more brutally in-scene rather than recalled.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the bolt passes hand-to-hand, reweighting silence from decree to inheritance while the fortress “decides.” Causality holds: each prior climb, bolt twist, and breathless ward moment tightens into the final shared stare. The micro-fracture in silence is legible and costly—no voice is restored, yet the ledger of stolen songs is physically transferred.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The cobalt walls, meltwater constellations, and bolt’s iron memory act as micro-settings that constrain movement and charge the ending image. Selective sensory filters—metallic air, frost-lashed lashes—mirror the bellhop’s narrowed life. Spatial choreography stays clean: staircase, ward, courtyard track without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to survive a world that purchases safety with voices—tightens when the boy’s severed cords literalize the cost. The bellhop’s agency is endurance: remaining motionless anchors the boy and forecloses his own last chance to break silence. One meaningful deepening suffices; price is felt in the whitening knuckles on the bolt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the bolt’s migration: silence as both shield and prison. No moral is stated; instead, the final breathing chorus re-prices the decree—life conceded, voice still forfeited. The image of snow erasing footprints faster than they form offers lingering, unspoken irony about memory and erasure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyric third-person hovers at the bellhop’s shoulder, diction metallic and frostbitten, rhythm echoing hymn cadences. Compression—“seraphically mundane,” “unpardonable silence”—is taught early and paid off in the final charged stillness. No head-hop; perceptual signature stays consistent to one carved sentinel.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density: each sentence layers sensory, symbolic, and causal work without scaffolding. Metaphors (“snowflake more added to the drift”) stay internally coherent; no synonym loops. Clause variation supports breathless ascent and final frozen poise; minor elevated register fits the choir-ghost ambience.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The voice-as-currency premise is familiar dystopian turf, but the piano-bolt as silent hymnal and the discoloration-path as pre-literate map feel freshly particular. Risky lyric accumulation could have collapsed into purple, yet it holds under the bellhop’s pressure. Transformation shows in the bolt’s changed meaning: from anchoring music to anchoring life.</comment>
