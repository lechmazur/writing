<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied—kerosene scent, glowing ribs, translucent grief—yet the mother’s contradictory impulses (to preserve vs. release the dream) are shown more than tested; the micro-choice to light the leaf-chimney crystallizes endurance, but the cost feels slightly under-felt because the daughter remains silhouette, not remembered flaw. Still, the craftsperson’s lens is specific, and the renunciation lands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each crane is a density fold that reweights the stake until the moonstone dust and smoke exit leave the basilica bare. The paradox stair is taught early, paid off when she walks “backward” into dawn’s second replay; closure is the Conceptual Repricing of grief into lanterns that belong to strangers—cost legible in “simply leaving.” No orientation debt; pattern legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Floating stones, steaming tea-leaves that exhale strangers’ dreams, and the cracked moonstone leaking silver are never mere scenery: each constrains her path (she pockets fuel-grief, must kneel at engines, cannot keep the cranes). The glass basilica’s starlight winter breath becomes the final image’s empty nave—environment recharged. Specificity is irreplaceable; spatial choreography clean.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—convert private grief into sharable light—tightens when the moonstone cracks and leaks; each crane steals dream-matter she can never reclaim. Agency is renunciation: she folds instead of clings, foreclosing the option to keep the last dream. Cost is visible (basilica darkens, moonstone dust, smoke scent of bandages), though escalation is single-cycle, not compounded.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: grief as combustible fuel, lanterns as communal ransom. The cranes’ final perch in the tea bushes reconfigures private loss into public utility—Conceptual Repricing that lets “luminous torment” serve strangers. No moralizing; the bergamot-and-bandages smoke is the resonant answer, reweighting all prior dream-fragments.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is a sustained lyric drone—metal of lullabies, footsteps as glass beads—never losing the lantern-maker’s perceptual signature. Compression (“seven strokes water, seven strokes oil”) teaches cadence early; elision in “smoke… simply leaving” pays off. No head-hop; diction stays within her lexicon of craft and grief. Rhythm accelerates at folding, exhales at smoke.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud ear is musical; sentences vary from short gasps to long winding coils without algorithmic feel. Information density high—each image carries craft, grief, and world-rule. One mixed metaphor (“lanterns that would glow each night for anyone who needed light shaped like goodbye”) grazes over-writing but occurs post-closure; no loops or scaffold inside the ending beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The dream-into-origami-lanterns conceit is fresh; paradox stair and replayed dawn feel inevitable, not gimmick. Synthesis of gem-polishing ritual with oneiric engines grounds the fantastical in artisanal truth. Risk—the entire emotional arc is metaphoric—pays off because the final smoke is stripped of image, leaving only scent as cost. Specificity prevents template drift.</comment>
