<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is richly embodied—her “gloomy cheer” and the way curiosity flares violet give contradictory impulses live color. Her micro-choice to gather crater-glass shards and re-story the cliff is earned by the shared ache she feels in the ash. The flaw (compulsion to remember) directly shapes the final renunciation: she walks on without looking back, pocketing only the chime of wonder. Voice specificity keeps her from type; “recollectionist” is never explained yet behaves as an occupation of attention.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because the cliff felt abandonment, therefore Lira offers it a new narrative; because she arranges the mosaic, the sand-path forms. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the living ribbon of light reweights “path” from physical route to migratory story, cost felt in the sealed cave and her empty bucket. One minor causality wobble: the bird’s second seed drop is pure gift, not earned by prior tactics, but it complicates rather than resolves. Orientation anchors (who/where) arrive before 120 words; geode rules taught through color-transliteration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Geode-as-body constrains every move: singing floor, flexing lungs, exhaling salt farewell; the crater glass shards become micro-setting that Lira must handle physically to birth the new path. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—she hears hush, tastes salt, sees violet flare—never tourist catalogue. Spatial choreography is clean: skylight entry, spiral mosaic, whirlwind ribbon, softening ground track without drift. Final image of “ordinary twilight” re-anchors the once-magical space inside lived world.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>Dominant stake—paths disappear when un-walked with wonder—tightens once: the mosaic act forecloses the old route and births a living one, visible cost in the sealed cave and her emptied bucket. Escalation is emotional, not peril-based: abandonment → loneliness → re-storying. Agency is crystallized attention rather than combat; her conjecture and arrangement are the decisive turns. No external antagonist needed; the cliff’s ache is pressure enough.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from motif migration: paths, seeds, birds, memory—all literal before they are symbolic. Final whispered promise reweights “remember” from nostalgic hoarding to generative scattering, avoiding moralizing. Subtext in gesture—gathering shards without looking back—shows renunciation more cleanly than exposition could. Ambiguity lingers: will future cliffs still vanish? The invitation keeps resonance alive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is color-transliteration of emotion, sustained without head-hop. Syntax flexes with pressure: long breathless clauses during whirlwind, then short declarative “She stepped.” Diction stays within Lira’s plausible lexicon—no corporate intrusion. Bird is external agent yet never given interiority; its droppings act, not speak, preserving focalization.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Lyric density is high but patterned early (“transliterate emotions into color”), so figurative profusion reads as taught rule, not clutter. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or motion. Rhythm modulates: fragment “This seed did not bloom; it sank” snaps the spiral turn. Closure line “invisible lullabies” lands clean, no mixed metaphor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>“Sea-foam recollectionist” and a geode that exhales loneliness synthesize fresh myth without exposition dumps. The idea that land feels abandonment and paths can be re-storied rather than rebuilt is non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Risk—lyric accumulation, magical logic—paid off by crystalline closure. Familiar grief-of-disappearance trope is rotated through geological empathy, not human nostalgia.</comment>
