<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ren’s interiority is specific—the salt taste as memory, the decision to leave the door unlocked—and his brush-trembling micro-choices under pressure feel earned. The “intimately aloof” trait is more asserted than dramatized until the cave sequence, where it finally costs him human contact; before that, the label floats. The closing renunciation (leaving the canvas) crystallizes a believable, scaled cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test’s causality clause, yet the slight early over-label prevents a clean 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the hidden canvas’s “temporary eternity” reweights every prior loss and forecloses Ren’s return. Causality holds: cracked mirror → promise activated → wrong turn → shell → copied micro-canvas → transference; each step shrinks options. Cost is palpable in the final breath-beat of “second heart.” Under Accumulative/Textural lens the cadence shift from demolition glare to invisible bioluminescent pulse tightens stakes without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Coastal cave network is not backdrop but actor: salt-glazed walls drip time, plankton clock provides only light, driftwood acts as easel; these details constrain palette and tempo. “Crushed shells chiming like porcelain bells” fuses auditory and tactile specificity that later echoes in the shell’s miniature warehoused pier. The micro-setting of the whelk’s throat fulfills the 9+ gate by charging the final image. Minor over-glitter in “cathedral veins” keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—salvaging the quay’s image—narrows to preserving it inside an unseeable space; the shell’s reveal is the single meaningful tightening that forces the paint-scrap postcard. Agency remains Ren’s at every step; no coincidence rescues or resolves. Cost is legible: he trades public visibility for subterraneous permanence, forfeiting hometown return. The pressure curve is one steady crescendo rather than iterative reversals, sufficient for this length under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>“Temporary eternity” emerges through concrete reversals of scale (town → shell → canvas) rather than abstraction; each physical downsizing enlarges permanence. No moral is stated; the final plankton flare offers a wordless conceptual repricing of loss. Subtextual vein: art’s survival demands disappearance of the artist. One micro-slip—“the promise answering back” anthropomorphizes conceptually—keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person close clings to Ren’s perceptual syntax: salt as memory, gulls as circular saws, keys for people who plan return. Rhythm modulates: long chloride breaths of sentence open with “The mirror cracked…” then collapse to postcard clauses under cave fatigue. No head-hop; distance stable. Filter verbs (“he understood”) appear once but serve psychic shift. Near 9.0 but diction occasionally over-elevates (“cathedral veins,” “conceptual cost”) a hair above painter’s plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentence music is deliberate; parallel anaphora (“the track a scar… asphalt gave way…”) mirrors descent. Metaphors stay physically coherent: porcelain bells → fragile cargo → shell. No synonym loops; each adjective earns keep (“diesel and wet rope” precisely nails harbor perfume). One mixed moment—“intimately aloof” repeats without rephrasing—stubs perfect flow yet occurs early enough to avoid closure contamination.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses familiar artist-seeks-immortality with unfamiliar inversion: shrinking visibility to micro-scale achieves permanence. Wrong-turn-into-hidden-cave could feel contrived, yet salt-industry history on coast makes geological plausibility seamless. Risk of lyrical excess is held in check by concrete specificity—whelk throat as gallery. Transformation test passes: only this painter, this condemned quay, this shell yield this emotional arithmetic. Not quite 9.0 because “temporary eternity” concept, while freshly grounded, edges known artistic metaphors.</comment>
