<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Mara’s skeptical reflex is continuously embodied—touching seams she “refused to believe were magic,” staggering when memories flood, choosing to listen rather than refute. The interior contradiction (grief solved by reason vs. participatory surrender) drives every micro-choice; her final act of loosening borders is earned through the night of felt pressure. Cost is visible: the notebook that once promised proof now carries an “unheard symphony,” a literal foreclosed path. Voice stays particular, never drifts into label-speak; only nit: we get no sensory trace of her body under extreme surge—heartbeat, sweat—so embodiment peaks at 8.4 not 8.8.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each star alignment thickens pattern until porous walls admit whale song; the tile’s lift at midnight is the decisive reconfiguration. Closure—Mara places the tile in tidepool, relinquishing ownership—pays visible conceptual cost: her mother’s empty notebook now houses communal score, academia foreclosed. Causality is lyric, not plot-logic, but pattern is taught early (“numbers crawled when viewed sideways”) and fulfilled when ink becomes staves. No orientation debt; spatial anchors (tower deck, chart table, tide line) remain crisp.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Setting is micro-scaled to body, tile, notebook, astrolabe—each object constrains choice. Tower walls turn “porous,” a literal pressure valve that lets salt air rewrite her glasses; this environmental breach charges the final image. Whale breaths supply time-metered diegetic music, merging with parchment “crests” to make setting co-author of score. Only omit: astronomic specificity (which constellation?) could have tightened one more turn.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“can grief be solved by reason alone?”—tightens when starlight forces participatory memory; option to remain detached is foreclosed on-page. Each alignment is a micro-turn that raises emotional cost; midnight whale chorus bass note is the audible price. No coincidence; pressure accumulates under accretive pattern. Persistent constraint: once tile sings, refusal becomes impossible without betraying self-proclaimed kindness.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme—knowledge as communal voyage, not private proof—emerges solely through image shift: ink becomes tide-crests, notebook becomes communal score. No thematic statement; resonance is the hush between constellations made audible. Final non-literal answer: sky looks like “parchment waiting for the next brave skeptic,” reweighting academia into iterative chorus. Ambiguity lingers—no metric, no publication—yet feels complete.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lush yet controlled; syntactic swells mimic whale song without losing clarity. Perceptual signature sharp—“salt galaxies misted her glasses” fuses world/self. No head-hops; distance stable. Minor cadence repetition (“unheard symphony” used twice) nudges it below 9.0.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences lengthen then clip to mirror breath-beat of whales. Metaphors stay precise—astrolabe as tuning fork, tile as keel stone—no mixed vehicles. Information density high: one sentence often layers sensory, emotional, thematic work. Only scaffold: “like an unheard symphony” appears twice within 30 words; paraphrase loop −0.2.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fusion of magic-square scholarship, whale migration, and grief memoir feels non-obvious yet inevitable. Risk—lyric accumulation replaces causal plot—pays off in closure image. Keel-stone metaphor rewrites both navigation and mourning; specificity anchors universals. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped, confirming freshness.</comment>
