<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and voice-specific; the translator’s guilt and vocation collide in the coral/ink decryption. Micro-choices—pressing thumb to cast, whispering “I unknot by naming”—alter the dyad with the boy and foreclose the fantasy of neutrality. The shared-birthday revelation lands as earned ironic cost. Flaw: the “lotus-hearted” abstraction momentarily slips toward diagnostic-speak, blunting embodied contradiction by a hair.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each droplet, ink smudge, and coral whorl layers density until the final palimpsest reweights meaning. Closure is Charged Poise—coral aligned with plaster, “handle with tides” inscription—visible cost on the page. Early orientation (anesthetic, atrium, twilight) anchors within 50 words, pattern taught by mist-click droplets as syllables. No causal gaps; every beat is because/therefore of sense memory pressing toward confession.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mist-clad atrium and coral fragment function as micro-setting: moisture warps ink, coral’s spiral literally templates the cast’s grooves, constraining the translator’s decryption tactic. Sensory economy is severe—salt-taste of cordite, soft clicks of droplets—mirroring morphine-narrowed attention. Twilight condensation metabolizes into literal metaphor for blurred moral lines. Final image of plaster “grown from the sea” charges the closure under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can naming absolve shared guilt? Pressure tightens when the birthday-date exposes the translator’s complicity, forcing him to voice rather than ferry words. One meaningful deepening suffices; cost is the irreversible fusion of coral and cast—he leaves half the weight behind. Slight reservation: escalation is interior; external artillery remains off-page, so visceral price is poetic rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from iterative images—reef, spiral, ink, salt—culminating in the assertion that trauma can become sediment for new growth. No moralizing; the boy’s “stay” and the nurse’s unseen observation let reader complete ethical calculus. Final re-pricing: translator signs a third language (“tides”) turning bureaucratic discharge into ritual. Lotus-hearted ache is the only near-maxim; its dew-over-blood transmutation redeems the phrase.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person opioid haze sustains synesthetic compression—“anesthetic hummed like distant shelling”—with rhythmic control that accelerates during decryption. Distinct perceptual signature: professional translator notices syllable-clicks, Braille-like ridges, coastal dialect; no head-hop. Coral as “host of sleeplessness” is metaphorically bold yet legible. Filter verbs appear but are voice-motivated (“I realized,” “I understood”) inside morphine fog, paid off at clarity moment when dew forms.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density: single sentences unpack translator guilt, birthday massacre, reef ecology. No synonym loops; each metaphor extends prior vehicle (shelling→distant→aid convoy). Rhythm breathes—long cadence for twilight build-up, staccato for letter-by-letter decryption. Minor overwrought cluster: “chromatic fish; now it hosted my sleeplessness” could prune one modifier, but figurative logic stays coherent. Closure line “quiet percussion of peace still possible” lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fusion of battlefield trauma with reef ecology feels non-obvious yet inevitable; coral as ledger of collective guilt is fresh. Risk of lyrical overload is embraced and controlled, heightening rather than obscuring stakes. Transformation test fails if translator is generic war-vet; here, linguistic craft specificity anchors novelty. Slight deduction for recognizable “scribing on cast” trope, but spiral-coral overlay and tidal discharge signature re-inflect it.</comment>
