<comment>Mila’s interiority is concrete—“flour ghosts,” “bread-born herbs”—and her contradictory impulses (preserve vs. plant) act simultaneously in-scene. The micro-choice to bury rather than eat the loaf crystallizes her value hierarchy with visible cost: she swallows ordinary bread at the end, tasting tears. Competence balanced with genuine uncertainty keeps her from safeness; the only flaw is a faint therapeutic gloss in “she understood the sacred in the ordinary.”

<comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the palace mosaics brightening under Mila’s palm reweight the premise—absolution is not received but continuously cultivated. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each seeded fragment of loaf intensifies pattern until the city’s forgetting recoils. Cost is palpable—“she tasted crumbs on her lips,” “tears salting the crust”—and the persistent constraint of “tenuous absolution” shapes every nighttime burial. No orientation debt; spatial anchors (Rue des Aubes, palace courtyard) arrive by line 50.

<comment>Setting constrains choice: vines part to reveal the tea-house, asphalt scars dictate burial sites, palace stones literally brightened under touch. Sensory hierarchy obeys Mila’s bias—flour ghosts, camellias, basil spelling erased names—integrating detail into action rather than catalog. Micro-setting (the loaf’s residual warmth) functions as portable altar that charges the final image. One minor slip: “distant traffic” is the only modern cue, slightly undercutting mythic register, but it tensions the theme of encroaching normalcy.

<comment>Dominant stake—can memory resist erasure?—tightens through each burial; the meaningful turn comes when Mila tastes crumbs, realizing cultivation beats preservation. Agency remains hers throughout; coincidence merely reveals the tea-house. Cost is cumulative: ritual secrecy, swallowed grief, and the final forfeiture of the miraculous loaf to ordinary rolls. Escalation is textural—each sprout lengthens the leash on forgetting—rather than causal reversal, fitting the accumulative lens.

<comment>Theme emerges from pattern: bread as daily resurrection, gardens as mnemonic liturgy. Subtext lives in gesture—soil under fingernails, lantern steam—never sermon. Final image of seed saved from sacred herbs reweights “ordinary” as continuous miracle without moralizing. The sacred is not returned but revealed as always already present; complexity lingers in the city’s ongoing erasure.

<comment>Perceptual signature is highly particular: “heuristically gentle,” “flour ghosts,” “bread-born herbs.” Syntax mirrors emotional cadence—long breathless accretion during night burials, short clauses at dawn reveal. No dialogue, so voice remains pure interior; diction stays within Mila’s plausible lexicon. Patterned repetition of “tenuous absolution” and “heuristically gentle” is taught early and paid off in the closing scatter.

<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid—“shops forgetting themselves,” “name tags of crust.” No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or pressure. Metaphors stay coherent: ovens exhale, guilt rises like yeast, absolution stays unleavened. Minor register lift in “conceptual repricing” type diction (“mnemonic liturgy”) but it aligns with Mila’s evolved insight and does not obscure closure.

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: urban-memory-loss meets guerrilla-gardening via sanctified pastry. Risk of lyric abstraction is offset by tactile specificity—crumbs as nametags, basil spelling erased streets. The inversion that eating the miracle would seal amnesia is non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Voice, premise, and theme cohere as singular vision; no template echo.
