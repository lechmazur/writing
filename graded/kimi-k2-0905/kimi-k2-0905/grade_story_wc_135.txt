<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The archivist’squiet, inverse heroism—collecting absence instead of treasure—remains consistent and particular; his interiority is lyric yet grounded in embodied detail (salt-crusted coat, valve warming like skin). The final renunciation of “empty satchel” for an echo-archive is earned through a chain of micro-choices and pays visible emotional cost. Secondary figures (janitor, woman) supply immediate pressure without crowding the frame. No interior contradiction is dramatized in-scene; the flaw is implied rather than tested under stress, capping fractionally below 9.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the single trumpet tone folds silence into city doorways—an undeniable conceptual cost under Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is lyric-logical: fragment → whole → public resonance; each shard advances knowledge of what absence sounds like. Orientation anchors (who/where) arrive before 120 words; staggered-interval motif is pattern-taught early and paid off in final cadence. No teleporting props or luck; the missing mouthpiece is foreshadowed and traded for future echo, satisfying because/therefore linkage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Ivory harbor’s rain-slick cobblestones, ozone gutters, and cliff cemetery fog act as micro-settings that constrain movement and supply emotional palette; the trumpet itself becomes portable setting/tool hybrid. Sensory selection is POV-filtered: salt crust, wet hemp, weathered copper—every detail either impedes or enables the next beat. Spatial choreography is clean: pier → kiosk → conservatory gate → cemetery → pier-end; no impossible positions or floating rooms. Environment is not backdrop but mnemonic surface—every surface records what was removed—charging the final sonic image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: compile the scattered absence into a hearable future; pressure escalates through each missing piece of the trumpet. Agency is archivist’s—each negotiation (ledger clerk, janitor, cliff woman) narrows options and exacts visible price (empty satchel promise). The tightening is single but decisive: mouthpiece trade for future echo-archive; cost is felt in woman’s metallic memory and archivist’s public exposure at pier’s end. No coincidence resolves; the final note is earned assembly, not luck—under Accumulative lens the density of silence reweighted into sound is sufficient escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from concrete logistics of absence: absence as salvageable medium, archives as acoustic not paper. Subtext lives in gesture—valve traded like bone, mouthpiece held to taste exile—never thesis-stated. Final image reweights prior material: the blank page of harbor finally “turned” by sound, offering resonant answer to how a city might hearten itself without erasing loss. No moralizing, no tag-line—meaning stays atmospheric yet legible, satisfying the 9- band without reaching the rare air of 9.5.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>First-person lyric voice maintains consistent perceptual signature: maritime metallurgy, archival synesthesia, staggered cadence mirroring broken bell tower. Compression and elision (“sentence snapped in half”) are pattern-taught early and paid off in final folded tone. Diction stays within plausible lexicon of displaced archivist; no filter-verb clusters. Dialogue is minimal but distinct: janitor’s tally-mark mop, woman’s copper eyes—each line carries subtext of fleet-cracked spectacles, advancing goal without exposition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: long breathless anaphora against short surgical fragments; no template cadence detected. Metaphors interlock—cobblestone words, mast sentences—without mixed logic; each image advances knowledge or pressure. Information density high: single sentences fuse sensory, emotional, and conceptual work. Zero paraphrase loops, zero scaffold; punctuation and tense stable. Final trumpet sentence achieves propulsive release without overwriting, meeting the 9+ quick test cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—archivist of ocean-spray absence—flips standard quest: collect nothing to give back sound. Staggered-interval motif and echo-archive are non-obvious syntheses that feel inevitable in hindsight. Risk in lyric accumulation is high yet clarity maintained; absence as tangible medium is fresh without gimmickry. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped—specific harbor, trumpet, exile ledger are integral to emotional calculus, securing near-max originality.</comment>
