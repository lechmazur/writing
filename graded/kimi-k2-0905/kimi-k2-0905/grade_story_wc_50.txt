<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ansel’s quietly obsessive interiority is vivid—his peripherally focused attention becomes a believable cognitive tic that both enables and limits him. The renunciation of duplication at the end (“a key he would never duplicate”) crystallizes a cost, but the emotional turn is compressed into a single sentence; a sharper embodied beat at that moment would have locked 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens is declared early and honored: each mirrored echo adds density until the silver plate reflects nothing—a conceptual repricing that reweights the premise. Causality is poetic but coherent: reverse-feeding silence into the timer literally rewinds time, releasing the lost hours as moths; the final image of “cherries dropping… wearing the clothes of its own absence” lands the cost under the chosen lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Marble surface, caliper-shadow, and silver plate function as micro-setting that constrain every tactical move; the cavern’s reflective veins literally guide the angle studies and later swallow the echoes. Final image of cherries dropping just beyond earshot recharges the acoustic motif, making environment dictate the parting cadence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restoring time to the village—tightens through perceptual density rather than external opposition: each lighter echo is a visible toll paid. The protagonist’s agency is cerebral (reverse-assembly, silence-feeding) yet it forecloses the option to harvest wonder again, a trade-off legible in the silver plate’s blank reflection.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of wonder hoarded versus wonder relinquished emerges without statement: the cellar shelf becomes a secular reliquary whose contents must stay locked. The closing auditory image—fruit dropping in unheard thuds—re-prices the earlier acoustic theft, giving the reader an aftertaste of absence rather than a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice sustains a cool, lapidary lyricism that feels appropriate to a locksmith who thinks in metal and light; compressed syntax (“the brass guts jingling like distant cowbells heard through a fever”) teaches the reader to accept imaginal jumps. Perceptual signature—peripheral vision, mirror delays, acoustic craters—remains consistent, no filter-verb drift under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High metaphor density is patterned early (“marble cavern exhaled cold light”) and earns its keep; mixed registers appear only in low-pressure lines. One scaffold loop—“echoes that chose to stay behind, nesting in the veins of stone” immediately after “echoes nesting”—dulls momentum; otherwise rhythm breathes with scene needs and closure image is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The echo-harvesting clock premise feels freshly minted; the inversion—feeding silence to pay back stolen time—grows inevitability from the cavern’s mirror logic rather than gadgetry. Specificity of locksmith craft (calipers of shadow, scalloped metal) and the final orchard image beyond hearing transform an abstract conceit into sensory memory.</comment>
