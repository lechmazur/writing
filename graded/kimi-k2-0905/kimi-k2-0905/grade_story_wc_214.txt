<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The janitor’s grief-for-the-sky is anchored in granular micro-choices—whispering apologies, leaving dome open—so interiority stays embodied. His contradictory impulse (cling vs. release) is dramatized when he palms the warm charcoal fleck, fusing personal loss to cosmic scale. The final renunciation of the lantern is earned: prior beats show the glass hoarding memories, so surrendering its glow carries visible cost. Voice remains singular, never sliding into diagnostic self-talk; “soft meteor of grief” is image, not label.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the station’s mirrors become a welcoming committee, reweighting the premise that humanity must only observe. Cost is undeniable—he walks down without the lantern, chest now the “softer lamp,” a felt forfeiture. Accumulative lens holds: each meteor reflection thickens pattern until the final image breaks it open into invitation. The yellow heart-shaped afterimage is on-page proof that the universe paid back his vulnerability.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Brass instruments, dust galaxies, and slit of eyepiece are tactile, selective, and filtered through janitor’s caretaking eye. The lantern glass functions as micro-setting: its yellow shard constrains every optic move and finally charges the parting image. Environment guides choice—open dome becomes the culminating act—so setting is not postcard but tactical. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no impossible moves as he kneels, palms fleck, walks away.</question>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can stillness be generative?—tightens when reflections refuse to fade, forcing him from sweeper to intercessor. One meaningful deepening: the charcoal fleck’s pulse escalates abstract empathy into literal time-travel, narrowing options to “burn or change.” Cost is visceral—he weeps, chest opened—altering later tactics (leaves dome open). Agency remains his: no meteor solves the problem; he reconfigures the station’s gaze.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from repeated images of reflected light that shift from hoarding to hospitality; no explicit thesis stated. Subtext lives in gesture—removing lens caps equals removing emotional armor. Final image reweights “strength in vulnerability” without moralizing: the heart-shaped afterimage is meaning made visible. Ambiguity lingers: scientists never know, keeping theme earned, not explained.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: cosmic janitor sees “dust motes like miniature galaxies,” thinks in caretaker metaphors. Rhythm modulates—long lyrical sentences for stargazing, clipped fragments at the fleck touch—mirroring pressure shift. No head-hopping; single POV stays strictly inside his sensory field. Diction remains within plausible lexicon for a solitary maintenance man who inherited grandmother’s myths.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense but breathable; no synonym loops or template cadence. Mixed metaphors are intentional (“black water” folding station) and paid off by closure image. Information load is high yet propulsive: each sentence layers grief, tool, sky. One clause—“primal elegance of shared orbit”—approaches loftiness but is anchored by tactile context, so register drift is minimal and momentary.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: janitor as meteor-confessor in abandoned observatory is not a trope template. Grandmother’s cracked lantern glass evolves from heirloom to star-prison to absent heart—transformation feels inevitable, not gimmick. Risky lyric accumulative structure taught early and lands clean. Emotional specificity (“grief for a planet that forgot to look up”) avoids generic eco-angst; the universality is earned through idiosyncratic detail.</comment>
