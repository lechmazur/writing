<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is sensorially concrete—her fingertip “reading” of steel threads replaces lost scent—and her need to midwife meaning from absence drives every beat. The clamp screw’s warmth and quarter-turn reorientation crystallize her Earned Stasis: she accepts the hollow nose but pockets the screw, foreclosing the fantasy of molecular return while claiming a new vocation. Micro-choices (tracing threads, rotating the scar) enact the theme without diagnostic label-speak. Flaws (passivity during Horace’s absence) are minor and do not touch closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mira rotates the screw to face the float, a visible conceptual cost that reweights time itself into midwifed breath. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each micro-scratch, gurgle, and fog layer densifies until the final droplet “gasp” reconfigures the stakes. Causality is intact: because she lost scent, she maps metal; because she maps metal, she gifts the screw new orientation. Cost is legible in the final image; no orientation debt or lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The water-clock shop functions as micro-setting: gears, loupe, and descending float constrain every tactile action. Fog pressing the windows becomes a diaphragm that times Mira’s interior contractions, charging the final drip-gasp. Selective sensory triage—touch over smell—mirrors her professional exile and keeps description lean. Spatial choreography is flawless; no credibility gaps.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Dominant stake—can meaning substitute for molecules?—tightens when the screw’s micro-scratches force Mira to choose between nostalgic scent-traces and present touch-maps. The quarter-turn rotation is the single meaningful act that forecloses the fantasy of regaining smell; price is the permanent acceptance of absence. Escalation is steady but modest; one beat short of 8.8+ visible price threshold. Coincidence merely reveals, never rescues.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: ordinary miracles are not smelled but midwifed into story through touch and time. The screw’s spindle image in the teared-up loupe reprices the premise—absence becomes generative. No moralizing, only charged particulars. Resonance is durable because it resists tidy redemption.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Lyric compression (“trembling calm,” “occluded view”) is taught in line 1 and paid off in the final breath. Syntax mirrors Mira’s tactile metric—long clauses when reading metal, staccato drops for the float. No head-hopping; Horace’s voice stays exterior. Register stays within a craftsperson’s lexicon; no filter-verb clusters.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>High information density—“birthing clamp screw he had found fused inside the clock’s base”—does triple duty in one line. Rhythm breathes with scene tempo: fog sentences linger, drip lines click. One paraphrase loop (“trembling calm” repeated) is intentional motif; no mixed metaphors. No artifacts touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>The aromatherapist-turned-tactile-semotician is fresh; the midwife’s screw as temporal umbilicus is non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric ellipses heighten rather than obscure. Specificity of clary-sage memory grounds the concept. Transformation test passed: swap lost sense or object and the arc collapses.</comment>
