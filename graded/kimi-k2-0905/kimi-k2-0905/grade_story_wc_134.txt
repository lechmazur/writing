<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The pilgrim’s interiority is richly textured—his sensory memory of rain-on-asphalt becomes the crucible for the magic transfer—yet his own pre-transfer motives remain slightly abstract, preventing a 9-band. The seer’s resignation is embodied in her obsidian-bright smile, a micro-choice that forecloses her escape; the resulting luminescent scar on him is a visible, irreversible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Closure is a textbook Resonant Reconfiguration: the cave’s entrance vanishes after the pilgrim accepts the irreversible transfer, crystallizing the price under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The “steady unpredictability” rule is taught early via echoing chimes and re-paid in the final cadence that seals the cave. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3; no penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The cave is not backdrop but antagonist: every footstep is a note in an ever-thickening score, and the lake that drinks light to return music directly enables the memory-expansion beat. The vanished entrance in the final image is a literal constraint that charges the pilgrim’s burden. Micro-setting (the treble-clef scar) re-weights the body itself as setting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“magnify everyday magic”—tightens when the pearl dissolves into skin, foreclosing return to ordinary perception. Cost is visible: the seer’s futures collapse to a single strand, the pilgrim’s world is permanently overlaid with cave music. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversals required.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: magic is not rare, only quiet, and attention itself is the last sacrament. The final park scene re-prices asphalt scent and pigeon wings into constellations, a conceptual repricing that makes the reader rehear their own world. No tidy moral, only charged image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a perceptual signature—sound as architecture, memory as score—without ever slipping into head-hopping. Syntax elongates then fragments to mimic musical phrasing; “bright darkness” is repeated with shifting inflection, proving tonal control. No filter-verb clusters; every metaphor is physics-loyal to the cave’s rules.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breatheable; sentences open with limestone scrape, chime, nacre swirl—information multiplexing without padding. One mixed-metaphor edge: “abyssal pits below” beside “glass-darkness” costs a hairline slip. No loops, no scaffold, final line cadence lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The conceit—“clairvoyant who didn’t see herself handing the pearl”—is instantly fresh, and the cave-as-composer transforms a standard quest into a score the reader hears. Risky second-person echoes (“you had not yet learned to ask”) are pattern-taught early and pay off in the children’s hopscotch galaxies. Synthesis feels inevitable, not gimmicky.</comment>
