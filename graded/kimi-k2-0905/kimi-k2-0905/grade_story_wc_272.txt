<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elian’s grief-propelled quest is visceral; every beat is filtered through his portraitist eye, so body, tool, and memory interlace. Interior contradiction peaks when he paints a “door only the drowning could open”—a credible, costly renunciation. The tarot scraps act as extension of his hand, giving concrete micro-choices under pressure; no stock therapy-speak, only salt-ink embodiment. Flaw: late switch from external relic-hunt to self-portrait feels one micro-beat under-supported, blunting full 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the spiral-mirror image re-weights the whole quest into perpetual flux, cost paid in drowning surrender. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—each shredded card and groaning shelf layers density until the final cadence shift. One transition (library → foundation stair) is legible; orientation taught by ~100 words via pulsing wall and toppling ledgers. No meaningful causal gaps; constraint (lighthouse sinking) shapes every tactic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lighthouse-library merges micro-setting tools: cracked mirror shard count equals tarot fragments, binding body, object, and architecture. Negative-space portrait reframes sensory hierarchy—visual artist forced to feel salt, mildew, stone. Spatial choreography survives collapse sequence; no impossible positions. Environment directly constrains final choice—only the drowning can open the painted door—earning 9-scope but caps at 8.8 because sea-welcoming beat is slightly under-detailed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—paint her absent face—threads every action; tightening occurs when tarot confetti refuses reunion, forcing self-portrait pivot. Escalation is textural: atlases bleeding contradictory coastlines → mirror cracked into same count → spiral door. Cost is felt: breath, light, time lost to submergence. Agency remains active (he paints, steps through) but coincidence of fragment count feels mildly over-patterned, not fully causal, keeping score sub-8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges as “absence is the purest pigment”—never stated outright, reweighting earlier coastal metaphors into negative-space portraiture. Tarot fragments, mirror shards, and unwritten atlases all spiral into one question: does art end where world begins? No final-paragraph sermon; final image of sealed mirror refracts the question back to reader. Complexity honored: art’s value affirmed yet paid for with physical erasure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is painterly synesthesia: walls “pulse,” ink “squirms,” breath tastes of “shipwrecked letters.” Syntax lengthens then fragments in step with card disintegration; diction stays within artist’s perceptual lexicon. No head-hopping; single POV holds. Filter verbs (“he felt”) are minimal and voice-motivated. Minor rhythm echo in repeated “question”-prefaced clauses is intentional, pattern-taught early and paid off in closing line.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentences multi-task: “salt-stained ledgers toppled around him” sets smell, sight, stakes. Metaphors are internally coherent (lunar wax → tower collapse). Occasional elevated Latinate diction (“grammar of seeing,” “confetti archetypes”) risks mild register drift but stays justified by artist POV. No loops, no scaffold; information-dense. Closing “luminescent ache” is first use of the exact prompt phrase, avoiding premature artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fusing tarot futility with portrait negative-space offers fresh angle on grief-art trope. Lighthouse-as-library then library-as-collapsing-bird risks familiar ruin-porn yet redeems via numeric shard symmetry tying cosmos → cartography → mirror → self. Drowning-door painted with card scrap is bold, non-obvious, inevitable in hindsight. Voice specificity (“patron’s rejection,” “commissioned hues”) grounds concept in lived artistic economy, escaping abstraction.</comment>
