<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Pilgrim’s interior contradictions—between hoarded grief and the urge to gift—are alive in breath-to-breath micro-choices; the soldier-memory and jade transfer are embodied, not labeled. The man’s wrong-buttoned coat and rattling lungs give credible physical shorthand for his flaw. Both surrender the bead, a renunciation that forecloses the safety of private ache and is earned by the shared breathing sequence. Minor slip: “pilgrim of sparks” remains more epithet than lived identity, keeping it shy of 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: every wisteria petal and breath-cloud thickens the texture of withheld affection until the condensation-door image reprices love as river-return, not storage. Causality is lyric—petals accrete meaning—but the final “rectangle of paler dusk” is unmistakable Decisive Change with felt cost: the camera (old witness) dissolves, leaving them lighter. No orientation drift; who/where/when anchored by line 3. Closure beat is clean, single-note, and reweights prior motifs.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Twilight viaduct, wisteria-choked arches, and drinkable purple air are micro-setting that directly constrains the breathing ritual and final door. River-fog functions as both mood and conceptual solvent for unused love. Camera-obscura’s ground-glass becomes a portable staging ground—setting-as-tool that charges the closing image when it vanishes. Spatial choreography (para­pet, arch, orchard beyond) tracks cleanly; no landmark overkill.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent love from rotting the heart—tightens through escalating sensory density: petals → lanterns → orchard fruit. Protagonist’s agency is the invitation to breathe; each shared exhale visibly narrows options until orchard entry is the only remaining path. Cost is the bead itself and the vanishing camera: permanent forfeiture of old witness. One micro-turn suffices for lyric accumulative design; no reversal required.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges entirely through concrete reversal: love is not archived but exhaled. The final “lantern somebody finally remembered to light” reweights the viaduct from mausoleum to beacon without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture—jade pressed to sternum, coat wrongly buttoned—never in thesis statements. Conceptual cost is undeniable: the pilgrim leaves with empty wrist and transparent breath, love now distributed rather than possessed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice owns a consistent perceptual signature: scent is “drinkable,” colors separate into “layers of withheld tenderness.” Breath rhythm governs syntax, mirroring shared inhale/exhale without drumbeat monotony. No head-hop; camera-ground-glass keeps perception anchored. Diction stays inside plausible pilgrim lexicon; occasional elevation (“filament of unspoken love”) is earned by imagistic pattern taught early.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density—single sentences often do image + motive + motion (“petals drifting like slow fireworks through thick, foggy lucidity”). Zero paraphrase loops; no scaffold. Figurative language is patterned and paid off: petals → lanterns → lantern-viaduct. One mixed-metor risk—“river water returning to the river”—but metaphoric logic holds within accumulative lens, never obscures causality at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: camera-obscura + breath-work + wisteria gorge as love-recycling portal. The notion of “unused love” as fruit orchard is non-obvious and inevitable only after the image lands. Pilgrim moniker risks trope yet is particularized through spark-transfer ritual. Risky lyric structure held coherently under accumulative lens, re-pricing love without familiar redemptive arc.</comment>
