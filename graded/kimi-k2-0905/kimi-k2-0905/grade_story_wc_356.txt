<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Myrrh’s olfactory sensitivity and quiet ambition are concretely embodied in the seed-on-cheek test and the silk stitch; her shift from “astonish the village” to humbled gratitude is earned through the tree’s stillness. Interiority stays specific—no therapy-speak—yet the mother–daughter breath-exchange is so understated that status and relational change feel implied rather than dramatized, keeping this just shy of 9.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each sensory beat adds density until the final image reweights ambition into gratitude. Closure is a Charged Poise—the indigo-wrapped journal left for wind-spirits—whose conceptual cost (renouncing acclaim) is unmistakable. Orientation is taught early via “treetop village of Larkspur” and tide reversal, waived penalty. No artifact touches the final cadence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Platform narrowing to “mere suggestion” and bark scarred by grafts function as micro-setting that directly constrains Myrrh’s surgical stitch; the reversing tide and moon-dragged sap are environment-as-clock, charging the final image. Olfactory details (iron, bruised banana) are filtered through her professional lens, not tourist catalog. One hairline slip: “wind-spirits” geography is lightly sketched, but the closing bridge placement maps space coherently.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—grafting a premature corpse-flower bloom—tightens once: the seed must rot enough to fuse yet not attract pollinators. Agency is finesse within sway, visible in the figure-eight knot; cost is the decade-early bloom that forecloses her chance to grandstand. Escalation is accumulative (scent layers) rather than causal-reversal, fitting the lens. Cost is legible but not viscerally painful, capping below 8.5.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the reversal of active/quiet: motion timed to forest pulse becomes stillness, ambition loosens into gratitude. The doodled wrapping-paper motif carries this without abstract assertion; final spiral-of-smoke image offers Conceptual Repricing. No tidy moral—just stance shift—yet the irony that “serenity within motion” is learned by letting the tree move for her could be sharper.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person POV stays tight to Myrrh’s olfactory angle; perceptual signature is consistent (“carrion promise,” “almond-gum scent”). Rhythm mirrors breath: long clauses for sway, staccato for stitch. No head-hopping; mother’s interior is never claimed. Filter verbs serve voice (“she journalized”) rather than dulling. Compression (“bridge became a limb, then a twig, then mere suggestion”) is taught early and paid off in descent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud cadence is fluid; sentence openings vary, no template drumbeat. Metaphors stay coherent (seed veins aligned with doodled bloom). One minor scaffold: “sway without tear” repeats the serenity/motion binary already implicit. Information density high—single sentences do scent + memory + tool work. No artifact touches closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fusion of olfactory grafting ritual with tide-reversed canopy village is fresh; corpse-flower-as-lullaby inverts horror trope. Transformation test fails if relocated to ground-level farm. Risk—lyric accumulation over causal plot—pays off via closure image. Could edge 9+ with sharper socio-botanical consequence hinted but not realized.</comment>
