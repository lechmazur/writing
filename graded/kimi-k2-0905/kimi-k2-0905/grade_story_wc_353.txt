<comment>Ilay’s interiority is concrete and embodied—her paint-stained fingertips, the way she “breathes with that pulse” to match arboreal time. Motivation is clear and intensifies: silence must be answered before the grove forgets. Micro-choices (listening to cracks, strumming the insulator) visibly reveal her hierarchy of values and artistic discipline. Final stance-crystallization—the bow and pocketing of the dulcimer—is earned and quietly costly.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the grove’s hush reconfigures from empty silence to expectancy, the glowing insulator storing anthem. Causality is accumulative/lyric: each strum tightens texture until wood sings. Persistent price—slowed heartbeat, kneeling fatigue, trembling knees—remains legible. Final image (“almost-audible mercy”) crystallizes meaning without exposition.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Setting is micro-specific: moss brightens from dusted gray to living jade, sap becomes brass section. Porcelain insulator functions as environment-within-environment, constraining her tuning choices. Spatial choreography is clean: statue, knees, cupped hands, valley-edge wire all track. Sensory hierarchy (resin scent, glassy ping ricocheting) reflects POV bias.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restore sound before forgetting—signals early. Escalation is textural: each strum adds overtone, microscopic cracks widen, scent released. Agency is present: her mapping and strumming cause the statue’s alto breath. Cost is visible: trembling knees, slowed heart, final bow.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges: silence can become conversation through empathetic attention. No overt thesis; meaning accrues via glass nests, copper veins, siskin-shaped crack. Final reweighting: sorrow learns it can also be comfort. Ambiguity lingers—will the valley remember?—without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric, pattern-taught early (“hush of needles settling”) and sustained. Perceptual signature—fractures as musical intervals, wood heartbeat—remains consistent. Compression (“wordless yet articulate”) heightens without obscuring. No head-hopping; distance stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies: long breathy clauses mirror arboreal time, short pings mimic deer-startle. Figurative language is selective, never clogs high-pressure beats. Zero loops or scaffold; “microscopically” used once, precise. Final line cadence mirrors quiet expectancy. No mixed metaphors.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—sculptor plays a broken statue back to life—feels fresh. Synthesis of arboriculture, obsolete telecom, and music theory is specific. Risk: lyric escalation in place of causal reversals, yet coherence holds. Transformation test fails if statue/wood/insulator swapped.</comment>
