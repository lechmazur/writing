<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara’s yearning is viscerally anchored to the tactile ritual with the film; interiority stays specific (“fingertips tingled,” “voice rising through the rafters”). The final choice—to inscribe release and accept the looping letter—pays off the mother-shaped void without therapeutic gloss. Minor slip: “stored between heartbeats and perforated frames” flirts with poetic abstraction, but embodied cues elsewhere outweigh it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensuous layer (dust, orb glow, projector cough) deepens the stake until the mother-song ruptures the loop. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the letter’s address flips from blank to recipient, reweighting “unused love” with undeniable cost. Causality is lyric rather than plot-driven, taught early and coherent. No orientation drift; space/time stay legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Projection booth micro-setting actively constrains action—sprockets thread Mara’s fingers, balcony door yields only after the film strip is scratched. Selective sensory hierarchy (nitrate scent, velvet nap, monochrome beam) mirrors emotional narrowing. The orb and cigarette case function as extensions of the booth, charging the final image. Environment is not backdrop but surgical tool.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find the lost stanza to rejoin mother”—tightens via each failed vision until the lyric completes itself. One meaningful deepening: blank paper becomes addressed, forcing Mara from receiver to transmitter. Cost is felt in the ashes she pockets. Pressure stays coherent under Accumulative lens; no false escalation beats.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of “love as looping film awaiting projection” emerges through recurring celluloid imagery rather than statement. Final image—letter turning into a strip threading into her chest—reconfigures prior material without moralizing. Subtext of renunciation vs. transmission is left resonantly ambiguous. Postscript line skirts thematic echo but earns its place as dramatic irony.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains tight psychic distance; perceptual signature is cinematographic (“silver screen that had not lit,” “white sprocket holes”). Syntax modulates from languid opening clauses to staccato projector cough, echoing tension. No head-hopping; unreliability is hinted but never breaks. Compressed lyric diction stays legible and pattern-taught.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm alternates between flowing anaphora and clipped beats, propelling the accumulative design. Figurative language is dense yet purposeful—each metaphor (storm as applause, pigeons as sprocket holes) feeds the film motif. No synonym loops or mixed metaphors. One near-scaffold: “dust floated like slow film frames” and “storm without rain, like applause…” back-to-back, but the second reframes stakes, so minor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Merges psychometry with cinema ephemera in a way that feels inevitable yet fresh; the “unused love” concept reframes haunted-venue tropes through analog film physics. Risky lyric structure pays off via taught pattern and charged final splice. Could not swap setting or object without collapsing the emotional engine. Specificity of nitrate scent, wax seal, and orb glow anchors novelty.</comment>
