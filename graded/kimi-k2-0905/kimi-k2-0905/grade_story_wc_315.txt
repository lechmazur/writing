<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is razor-sharp: every thought is filtered through her canopy-trained attention (“the rhythm of leaf and wind,” “soundless echo”). The contradictory drives—guard vs. release—play simultaneously in the penlight exchange and final buckle surrender. Muscle-memory detail turns the buckle into a physical lie-detector; the micro-choice to descend instead of drop it crystallizes her hierarchy of values with visible cost. Older-self reveal could feel contrived, yet it lands because the story has primed pattern-recognition as her religion; meeting the pattern’s author is the only epiphany that could break her.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the snap of the buckle across the gap reconfigures both futures and the entire surveillance premise. Causal linkage holds—every beat is a because/therefore of trust protocols (stolen signal → must descend → must surrender guardian role). The “sky can hold no more secrets” repricing lands with conceptual cost larger than any physical sacrifice. Orientation is taught early by canopy choreography and radio protocol; no debt incurred.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The arbor-as-aerial-observatory is evoked through functional detail—bough as watchtower, leaf silhouette as clock—so setting actively constrains her movement options. Parachute buckle serves as micro-setting that tracks physical and moral state (scratches = successful watches; final hand-off = release). Cloud-sea and moon-glint supply sensory hierarchy calibrated to a lookout’s priorities. No texture overload; every detail either sharpens vigilance or measures the cost of relinquishing it.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve network vs. preserve trust—tightens once yet irrevocably when the stolen signal forces her to choose between protocol and person. Escalation is pure agency: each penlight flick narrows her options from observe → confront → surrender guardian role. Cost is legible in the final image—she resets radio to standby, relinquishing omniscience. No coincidence; the intruder is her own future, making the confrontation inevitable once pattern recognition is her life’s grammar.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: surveillance becomes self-surveillance, trust becomes self-release. Buckle and penlight motifs reprice from control tokens to transfer tokens without thematic statement. Final tally etched into bark converts secrecy arithmetic into release arithmetic—image alone carries the reconfiguration. No moralizing; the silence after the last static crack is the argument.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is unmistakably canopy-trained: “leaf and wind rhythm,” “moonlit canopy,” “cloud sea.” Syntax mirrors altitude breathing—long accumulative clauses that suddenly snap shut like a buckle (“the snap reverberating through both futures”). No head-hopping; older self remains a mirrored surface, voice intact. Compression such as “soundless echo” is pattern-taught early and paid off in final peace, proving lyric elision can be both musical and causal.</comment>

<comment>Sentences perform double duty: “She unclipped the buckle… considered dropping it as a false clue” advances plot, reveals motive, and textures object in one line. Zero paraphrase loops; each metaphor extends the aerial vocabulary (spiraling, canopy, cloud-sea) without strain. Rhythm accelerates with shorter fragments at height of confrontation, then exhales into longer cadence after surrender. No scaffolding, no filter-verb stacks; even abstract nouns like “vigil” are anchored to tactile buckle click.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade>
<comment>Fusion of sky-guard noir with lyric time-fold is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Stolen emergency signal used against the watcher who invented it flips surveillance trope into self-confrontation. Buckle-as-talisman evolves from survival gear to sacrament—fresh symbolic economy born from occupational reality. Risk of meeting older self is high, but grounded in accumulated pattern-recognition obsession; hence payoff feels discovered, not contrived.</comment>
