<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s reticence is shown through marginal living and quiet testimony, not label-speak; her shift from cataloguing to witnessing is subtle but earned. The crystal’s pull on her is never psychologized, only acted upon—she pockets, listens, writes, smiles, leaves. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene; the interior conflict is implied rather than embodied in a single pressured micro-choice. Closure is a renunciation that costs her the library, but the cost is felt more conceptually than viscerally; still, enough specificity exists to keep her above stock “lonely scholar” trope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: sounds layer into a spiral of human moments that reweights the stake from “decode” to “witness.” Closure is a Charged Poise—crystal humming, dictionary opened to “zygote,” Elara walking away—reconfiguring silence into generative memory. No orientation drift; library geography stays anchored through table, gallery, desk. The snowdrop drop is the single tightening that crystallizes inward growth; cost is the recognition that language must now live in voices, not pages—visible on the final page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Library is rendered through selective, POV-filtered detail: brittle spines, slanted dawn light, pressed snowdrop whose petals still white. The crystal functions as micro-setting, constraining her attention and guiding her listening posture; its warmth against palm is tactile. Sensory hierarchy obeys a scholar’s priorities—sound of pages, smell of age, visual brittleness—never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is clean: upper gallery → central table → desk beside last dictionary; no impossible positions. Final image of crystal humming on desk charges the closing stillness, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can silence still yield pattern/growth? Pressure accumulates via each refracted sound; options narrow from “decode” to “witness” without external antagonist. Snowdrop drop is the single intensification, reweighting growth as inward fold—legible cost under Accumulative lens. No reversal, but deepening suffices for 600-word window; cost is conceptual rather than visceral, yet still felt in final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particular sequences: library listening, crystal testimony, snowdrop return—growth as inward fold, language as voiced memory. No overt thesis; final smile at “zygote” offers conceptual repricing without moral. Subtext lives in gesture: closing the dictionary yet leaving the crystal humming = refusal to trap language in print. Resonant ambiguity lingers—future readers will add voices, but Elara’s own cost is quiet endurance outside the gates.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person intimate maintains tight psychic distance; perceptual signature is scholar-specific—“footnotes,” “margins,” “catalogued,” “page 237.” Rhythm modulates: long dusk-like sentences at dawn, then shorter testimony fragments as sounds crystallize. No dialogue, so no voice convergence; interior diction stays within reticent academic lexicon. Crystal’s “sonically reflective” is the one technical phrase, but justified by POV curiosity—no register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “suspended hush that clung to the air like dust motes in a sunbeam” packs simile with tactility. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or sound sequence. Metaphors stay coherent—spiral of moments, rings in a tree—supporting accumulative design. Final lines achieve echoic cadence without template churn; “she had spoken for the silence, and it had answered” lands clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Post-dictionary apocalypse is fresh frame; crystal as sonic memory engine feels non-obvious yet inevitable. Inward-growth inversion via snowdrop rather than upward sprout avoids cliché. Reticent-scholar trope is personalized through marginal life and refusal to look back. Risk-taking—lyric accumulative structure, no antagonist—pays off in resonant quiet rather than gimmick. Could not swap Elara for any generic academic without losing texture.</comment>
