<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Mira’s interior contradiction—absorbing guilt she refuses to feel—drives every micro-choice; the trembling hands while decoding chimes embody the cost. The offer to let the geologist “stand naked with the truth” is a credible renunciation that springs from her accumulated fatigue and earns the story’s moral pivot. Only the “therapy-speak” drift in “protected vulnerability” keeps this from 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the shard, once void, is now “filled with their unspoken grief” and will be returned to the sea—an irreversible reweighting of the premise. Causal linkage holds throughout: because Mira witnesses via the shard, therefore she offers the team the choice, hence certainty is unhooked. Cost is legible in the final line: she takes no payment, only the grief-vessel. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of chime-doubt density tightens once and reconfigures meaning at sunrise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The hollow mirror shard functions as micro-setting: its void literally reframes how Mira sees the geologist and how he sees the coral cities, constraining the final offer. Wind-chime cipher is tactile, lived-in, and supplies the only “tools” Mira handles. Lighthouse breeze and dawn light evolve with the beat—salt coats lips, beam sweeps silence—charging the final image. Meets 9+ gate: recurring object charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will Mira sell absolution or witness truth—tightens once when she decides to carry grief instead of payment. Escalation is accretive: each decoded chime adds density until the brass bell’s hairline crack sings “we’re asking you to make that okay,” forcing her final stance. Cost is visible: she forfeits fee and takes contaminated shard. Could use one sharper tactical loss to reach 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: moral outsourcing hollows everyone until bearing unacknowledged grief becomes the only honest currency. Subtext lives in gesture—Mira’s trembling hands, the geologist’s fractured reflection—never exposition. Final image of shard returned to sea reweights the entire premise: absolution cannot be rented, only carried. No moralizing, only resonant reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is razor-sharp: Mira notices “conscience-for-hire whose services were booked until sunrise” and reads wind-chime Morse with priestly precision. Syntax lengthens under fatigue, then fragments at dawn: “stand here naked with the truth.” No head-hopping; distance stays tight inside her filters. Lyric compression (“salt and regret”) is pattern-taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from 5-word fragments to 32-word coils; no template cadence. Information density high: one sentence often sets scene, advances plot, and textures emotion (“hollow mirror shard…tunnel where reflections went to dissolve”). Only one soft paraphrase loop—“certainty unhooked and flapping like a loose sail”—keeps this from 9+. No artifacts near closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Conscience-for-hire is a fresh frame; pairing it with wind-chime cipher and grief-mirror creates a singular synthesis impossible to transplant. Risk—lyric accumulative structure rather than causal plot—pays off by making the final renunciation feel inevitable. Specificity of coral cities “they’d sentenced to death” anchors abstraction in ecological stakes. Conceptual integrity intact: no retreat from the bleak premise.</comment>
