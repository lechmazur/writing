<comment>Mireya’s gentle obsession with forgotten things is shown through tactile seed-sorting and miniature monument building; her interiority remains crisp, never drifting into label-speak. The moment she palms the moonstone dust and sees the mirrored arbor above, her renunciation (releasing the last fragment) carries visible cost—she palms moss instead of power. Yet the transformation reads as quiet acceptance rather than wrenching contradiction; a sharper internal fracture would have pushed this into the 9-band.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the sky’s mirror-world accepts the monuments, leaves descend, and “mossy delight” reweights memory itself. Causality is lyrical-accumulative: each tiny monument warms the dust speck until the sky answers; the final image of pollen spirals and peat-scented mulch crystallizes the new equilibrium with unmistakable cost. One micro-turn (leaves reverse direction) is cleanly prepared by rune prophecy and Mireya’s iterative offerings; no outline-like sequencing.</comment>

<comment>The arbor’s silver bark and upward-drifting leaves are filtered through Mireya’s ritual attentiveness; every detail seeds later action (cupped acorn, lichened branch). Micro-setting—moonstone dust cupped in a palm, twig cradle straddling a twig—literally constrains monument placement and charges the final ascension. Spatial choreography is immaculate: we track her climb, release, descent, and the mulch carpet that ends the tale. Sensory hierarchy favors hush, peat scent, and heartbeat-matched seed hum—never tourist catalog.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—restore grove equilibrium by remembering—signals with first rune leaf. Escalation is accumulative: each monument warms the dust speck, narrowing options to final release; the sky’s acceptance exacts the irreversible price of giving away the last relic. No coincidence; every upward leaf is answered by human craft. The tightening is single but sufficient for lyric frame: “the gentle weight of everything we refuse to let go” lands as felt cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from particular monuments—“laughter of extinct starlings,” “names unspoken after quarrels”—rather than abstract plea to remember. The mirrored arbor above acts as non-literal answer: memory must be released to become sustainable. No final moralizing; children’s rhyme arrives as world-fact, not author thesis. Subtext in silence: when travelers whisper thanks to forgotten pieces of themselves, the story lets us feel our own unspoken losses.</comment>

<comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains consistent fern-frond syntax and temperate diction; no head-hop. Perceptual signature is botanically intimate: “pollen spirals,” “root whispers,” “catwalks of silver bark.” Rhythm swells and subsides with leaf motion; no algorithmic cadence. Compression is taught early (“ritual older than the arbor”) and paid off in mirrored sky; elision stays legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High information density: single sentences often fuse sensory, emotional, and world data—“moonstone cabochon dust speck, the last fragment of the great lens.” No mixed metaphors; vehicles stay arboreal/optical. Filter verbs are voice-motivated (“she half-remembered”). Minor paraphrase loop in “leaves now rose in spirals, their runes rearranging into new sentences” could trim, but artifact never touches closure. Final line recharges “mossy delight” without syntactic monotony.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—floating grove whose fallen leaves must be remembered into counter-weight—feels inevitable yet wholly fresh. Folklore is inverted: prophecy becomes dialogue, not warning. Miniature monuments literalize memory craft; mirrored sky offers sustainable archive without dystopian twist. Risky lyric structure paid off in conceptual repricing. Transformation test fails if any component swapped; specificity anchors universals.</comment>
