<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrator’s ache and need for apology are embodied through the compass ritual; micro-choices (tracing lace, exhaling) visibly shift interior temperature. Kaede’s three-year silence and slow finger-raise show credible flaw and cost. The mother-image dissolve and final bonsai pruning crystallize the arc without tidy redemption. Voice convergence at the end is intentional, not slip.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the teal needle’s pulse reweights all prior regret under Accumulative/Textural lens. Each lace instruction tightens pattern density; the droplet’s refusal of gravity is the conceptual cost. Causality is lyric but legible: because the narrator breathes sorrow into lace, the bonsai keeps the hue and the path home is foreclosed. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 5.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Black sand, salt-slick driftwood, and diesel breeze are selective, POV-filtered, and guide the ritual’s pacing. The miniature pine functions as micro-setting that absorbs the final cost, charging the closure image. Weather (rain dripping from needles) narrows perception during knot-work, mirroring interior tightening. Environment never stalls momentum; every detail returns as ritual ingredient.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—diffuse cerulean regret—signaled in paragraph 3 and escalates through each lace fold. The second instruction’s knot visibly slows the compass needle, forcing a trade-off between holding regret and moving forward. Final exhale forecloses the option to speak the apology aloud; cost is the permanent transfer of color to bonsai. One meaningful tightening suffices; no reversal needed for lyric design.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from pattern: pruning as apology—cutting to let light in—arrives via bonsai image without sermon. The sea-forgiving-sky color reconfigures the abstract “unspoken apology” into a living needle, offering conceptual repricing. No thematic echo sentence; final image is non-literal yet legible. Ambiguity remains—who truly forgives—inviting reflection rather than moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person voice carries bonsai-tutor cadence: slow sap, minute leaf fall, stanza of silence. Perceptual signature is horticultural—every noticed thing is trimmed, bent, rooted. Syntax lengthens then contracts with ritual breath, mirroring lace pleats. No head-hopping; Kaede’s interior accessed only via reflected glow and finger memory, staying within narrator’s sensory bounds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but patterned: metaphoric vines serve the ritual logic, never overwrite. Rhythm modulates from tidal hiss to piano rain to final stillness; no template cadence. Information dual-loads—lace threadbare arabesque carries both tactile and symbolic weight. One mixed metaphor (“counting heartbeats the world had forgotten”) is minor, does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Ghost-ship compass repurposed as memory sextant feels fresh; lace-as-instruction-manual is stranger still, yet grounded in bonsai tutor’s occupation. Color of unspoken apologies rendered as seawater deciding to forgive sky synthesizes abstract and sensory. Risky lyric structure pays off in final teal pulse. Could not swap compass or lace for generic talisman without collapsing ritual logic.</comment>
