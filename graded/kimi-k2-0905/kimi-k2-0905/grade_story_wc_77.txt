<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The interiority is vivid and embodied—"clutched the opera cloak clasp… the only thing that still held heat" shows need through action. The whispering advisor gives a second, contradictory impulse in-scene, satisfying the 9+ test. The final kneel and gift of the clasp crystallizes a credible renunciation with visible cost. Minor slip: the advisor’s voice never acquires physical consequence, so the relationship crucible stays one-sided.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the mirror-fear child accepts the paradoxical note, the clasp falls, and the funhouse collapses into salt—undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain holds: because the protagonist skewers the photo strip, the bleed-corridor opens; because the clasp is surrendered, reflection is forgiven. Orientation is taught early via condensation-slick mirrors and strobing bulbs, waiving any penalty. One hairline slip: "dream dictionary" mechanics arrive late yet still shape the final tactic, barely keeping the lens coherent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is micro-specific: the mildewed-velvet curtain "tongue," candied-apple/copper stink, fun-house bulbs pulsing like "dying fireflies." Each sensory pick pressures choice—warped plywood corridors funnel movement toward the photo booth. The opera-clasp recurs as handled object, charging the final image when it snaps open and falls. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions or floating rooms.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—"trick fear into revealing its weakness"—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightens when the protagonist must literally hand over the clasp. One meaningful deepening: pinning the cursed photo strip opens the bleed-corridor, foreclosing retreat. Cost is visible on-page: the funhouse collapses, the advisor falls silent, and the protagonist exits with only self-carried light. Pressure stays coherent under Causal lens; no coincidence resolves the turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: mirrors as self-forgiveness, fear as a gray child needing comfort rather than conquest. The final image—leaving the clasp "for the next dreamer"—reweights earlier cursed photographs into an act of communal mercy. No moralizing statement; resonance arises from salt dissolving under calliope music. Minor abstraction in "the thing that kills you is already saved" survives because it is dramatized by the clasp transfer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person voice carries a macabre poetic texture—"resuscitation sirens fading… like a half-remembered lullaby"—sustained across clauses. Perceptual signature is consistent: narrator notices heat, metallic smells, reflective surfaces, all filtered through post-flat-line disorientation. No head-hopping; advisor remains interior voice. Rhythm modulates: longer hallucinatory sentences contract into the stark final beat, mirroring cardiac steadying.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language rarely repeats without payoff. "Roadkill can look jeweled beneath headlights" compresses attraction/repulsion in one stroke. No synonym loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or action. One mixed vehicle—"mirrors arranged to make me look long enough"—skirts abstraction but arrives before the climax, leaving the final salt-image unblurred.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Combines carnival-horror tropes with near-death lyricism in a way that feels inevitable: funhouse as after-life weigh station, photo-booth as confession box. The paradoxical note and bleeding strips transform standard ghost-mirror scares into self-forgiveness ritual. Specific detail—ambulance blanket turned opera clasp—anchors freshness. Risk in second-person address to fear ("I offered it the paradoxical note") pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
