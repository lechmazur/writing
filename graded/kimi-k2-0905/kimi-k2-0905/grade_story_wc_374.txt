<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>The skeptic’s sensory weather-tasting and grandmother’s ring ground her; her shift from observer to weather-bearer is visible when the ring brands her palm. Contradictory tastes—ozone-lavender, spring-rain-winter-snow—embody inner conflict in real time. The final acceptance is earned: she pockets the seed and feels her own microclimate form, a cost of no longer being able to stand outside the weather. Voice stays coherent and particular; no diagnostic self-labeling.

<comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the compass turns from seeking to becoming, the seed tastes of all seasons, and her palm bears a brand—cost is felt. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory taste, forest-election result, and aurora shimmer layers density until the final convergence cyclone reweights the stake. No orientation debt; who-where-when anchored by line 3. Causality is internal but coherent: tasting → meeting → merging → bearing weather. One minor ellipsis—how the woman waited—is allowed under lyric accumulation.

<comment>Lavender bluff, pollen-election forests, and aurora are not backdrop: the bluff’s eastern slope is the only path the compass permits, forest results decide winter’s tone, and the aurora’s light writes the final stories. Micro-setting of compass-ring-against-lips and branded palm constrain the merge. Sensory hierarchy is POV-loyal: metallic-electro-honeyed-bitter tastes drive every beat. Spatial choreography clean; no impossible positions. Weather affects action—rain falls only on the woman—establishing rule consistency.

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—“why do some carry weather?”—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightens when convergence offers only two options: remain observer or become weather. The final merge cyclone narrows options: she tastes her own atmosphere forming, foreclosing outsider status. Cost is visible: branded palm, seed that must be planted, lifelong resistance “melting.” Agency is renunciation/acceptance rather than external action, valid under accumulative lens. No coincidence; forest election outcome is ambient, not resolution.

<question>5</question><<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme—weather as shared human atmosphere—emerges from tasting, elections, and convergence, never stated. Subtext lives in gesture: silver hair moving like clouds, ring glowing only at merge. Final image of seed and waking to “small weather systems” reweights earlier skepticism without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: what happens when weather-bearers unite is hinted, not resolved. No thematic echo; no final-paragraph thesis. Particulars (lavender, ozone, tin) carry universal weight.

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to skeptic’s perceptions; perceptual signature is gustatory-olfactory-auroral. Syntax lengthens during aurora description, shortens at brand moment, mirroring breath. No head-hopping; woman’s interior is guessed only through taste. Diction within POV lexicon—“terrestrially cosmic,” “futuristic nostalgia”—reads as taught pattern paid off in final light show. Dialogue minimal, natural: “I’ve been waiting” carries storm-weight without exposition. No register drift; no filter-verb stacks.

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Rhythm varies: long sensory sentences accumulate, then short beats (“Watch.” “Plant this…”). Information density high: one sentence often does scent + emotional shift + world rule. No paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. Figurative language is controlled—only two metaphors per beat max, never consecutive. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image. Proofing clean; pronoun reference clear despite two women. No scaffold sentences; no synonym churn. Closure sentence is crisp, uncluttered.

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</question>
<comment>Weather-bearer cosmology feels fresh yet inevitable: internal meteorology as literalized gift. Forest elections and taste-forecasting are specific inventions, not trope swaps. Risk—lyric accumulation instead of causal plot—pays off in resonant closure. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped: lavender, tin ring, auroral bluff are integral. No echo of famous scenes. Concept commits fully; no safety-hedging. Slight deduction for near-archetype of mystic mentor woman, but her microclimate rain keeps her from abstraction.
