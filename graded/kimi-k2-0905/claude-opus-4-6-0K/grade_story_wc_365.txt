<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s sensory-mapper identity is vivid, embodied, and drives every beat; the shard-fed redirection is a credible, costly micro-choice. Interior contradiction is present—yearning vs terror—yet the father’s sudden appearance compresses relational pressure into a single beat, so the “crucible” test is only partially met. Still, the earned renunciation of safety to pursue the revealed coordinate lands with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the bay goes dark, the shard cools, and she commits to a new map—cost is the solitude and the unknown truth. Causal lens holds: because she floods the shard with her archive, the collision bends, therefore she gains the coordinate. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity at end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The corroded bay’s ghost frequencies and thermal strata are filtered through her cartographer’s bias, constraining her tactical choice of which “texture” to feed the shard. The shard itself acts as micro-setting, its warming/cooling pacing the beats. Environment directly shapes the final image—dark, empty machines versus the live map she now begins.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—find the withheld truth—tightens when convergence threatens annihilation; her redirect forecloses the safe return to ignorance. One meaningful escalation: the second frequency presses in, she sacrifices her archive, options narrow to “follow the coordinate or not.” Cost is legible: she empties years of embodied memory into the shard, leaving her professionally and emotionally stripped.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the price of mapping the unmapable: knowledge literally excavates the self. The green shard’s reprise—once a mystery, now a conduit that devours her archive—reweights its meaning without exposition. Final image of the fresh sheet implies the next cartography will redraw her identity; no moralizing statement intrudes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Elara’s perceptual system—textures as topography, temperatures as color. Syntax lengthens during sensory overload, then fractures into short pulses under crisis, teaching the pattern early. No head-hopping; diction remains within her professional lexicon. Distinct rhythmic signature carries through the final “fresh sheet” line.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative layering is justified by her synesthetic vocation. One mixed metaphor—“river finding a new channel” beside “fabric slip”—but it does not touch the closure beat. No loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts are clean. High information density: each sentence advances map, stakes, or world rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sensory cartography as inter-dimensional navigation feels fresh and specific; the shard’s demand for lived data turns a familiar multiverse trope into embodied sacrifice. The father’s palm-pressed coordinate reconfigures the orphan-search arc into a cartographer’s quest—inevitable yet non-obvious. Risky compression of parallel bay into one sensory flash pays off; no derivative echo.</comment>
