<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sable’s calling as gilded-leaf calligrapher and her “wilt” near lies solidify interior stakes early; the moment she identifies the postal plate and chooses Vault 7 her motive tightens into action. The closing plateau—accepting an unfinishable sentence—earns emotional cost because the search beats have shown how fiercely she demands completion. Interior contradiction (needs truth vs. tolerates fragment) is left more asserted than embodied in-scene, trimming bandwidth for 9+ band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: accepting the incomplete sentence crystallizes her stance with felt cost (“holding the empty jar”). Causal chain—map fragments → plate → Vault 7 → mother’s truncated words—holds cleanly; no teleporting props. Orientation is clear by 120 words; single-scene default honored; tightening occurs once in Vault with no late reversals. Cost appears on-page, satisfying 9+ test, though the earlier checkpoint beat is mild.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Glass-canopied Veridian is sketched via humidity, botanical towers, and oxygen temples, each detail filtering through Sable’s vocation (“gilded-leaf,” leaf respiration). Spatial tracking stays coherent through sublevel descent; environment directly supplies the Vault that catalyzes closure, meeting the 9+ tool/setting constraint. Selective sensory strokes (faint luminescence, cold hands) mirror internal thinning without over-cataloguing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—recovering the last, unfinished truth—signals inside first third and narrows to a single irreversible discovery in Vault 7. Pressure escalates by informational tightening rather than external peril: each fragment re-weights feasibility until the sealed jar forces a choice between demanding completion or accepting fragment. Visible cost (empty jar, tarnished gold earlier) registers on-page; could be sharper still for 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of “candor in small moments” emerges through action—tarnish when lies intrude, final embrace of fragmentary honesty—rather than statement. Subtext operates in the hush of the jar and in gold remaining bright only when she stops inventing final words. Final image of gilding the silence itself reweights the premise without sermon, offering plausible ambiguity about whether embellishing silence betrays or honors truth.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person stays tight to Sable’s perceptual filter—botanical vocabulary, sensory dip when dishonesty nears—producing a distinct narrative texture. Syntax lengthens in calmer studio beats, compresses in Vault search; rhythm mirrors attention. No dialogue, so evaluation focuses on internal voice: free-indirect diction (“cartographic pigment”) remains within her professional lexicon without showing off. No head-hopping; distance control stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, high-density: sentences double-duty (exposition embedded in motion). Figurative choices stay vegetal/gilded, reinforcing worldview; no mixed metaphors near closure. Minimal scaffolding—no paraphrase loops, no filler filter verbs—maintains momentum through 800-word span.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Merging “lost conversations” archive with pneumatic Victorian leftovers inside a closed bio-dome feels fresh and internally coherent. The wilt-toward-lies trait literalizes thematic pressure without over-explaining. Risky quiet ending that valorizes fragment over fulfillment is fully committed to and pays off emotional logic, meriting bonus.</comment>
