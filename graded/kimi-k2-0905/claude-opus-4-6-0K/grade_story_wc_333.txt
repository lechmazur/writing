<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maren’s contradictory impulses—the need to open others vs. her own sealed grief—are dramatized through micro-choices like touching the ribbon and deciding “Tomorrow.” The final internal turn is earned by the earlier client beat that reweights her fear; cost is visible in the first word of the letter. Interiority stays concrete (“folded the thought small”) and avoids label-speak. Missing 9 only because the client’s pressure, not an escalating external dilemma, triggers the change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the self-imposed lock opens with on-page cost (“the first word was her daughter’s name”). Causal lens holds: because each client crack reveals the cost of remaining locked, Maren’s final decision is inevitable. Orientation is anchored by 120 words; the single flashback is cued by tactile object. One minor slack: the eleven-year span is asserted, not dramatized, but it does not rupture causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Nexus bench, star-keyhole sky, and ribbon-in-pocket function as micro-settings that constrain action: only here, under that first star, can the mechanism yield. Sensory detail is filtered through Maren’s lock-picking attention—pins feel “like a heartbeat.” No geography drift; bodies and objects track cleanly. Environment subtly mirrors interior state without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will Maren keep her own lock sealed?—is signaled early and tightens once: the client’s chest becomes the mirror that forecloses avoidance. Agency is present in the final decision to write; cost is the acknowledged eleven years lost. Pressure accumulates rather than reverses, fitting Accumulative lens. No visible external price beyond emotional, but that is scaled to length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme—secrecy as self-imprisonment—emerges through recurring lock imagery and starlight redirection; no authorial thesis is stated. Subtext lives in gesture: loosened grip on the chest = internal bolt sliding back. The final image reweights every prior lock picked as rehearsal for this one. Resists moralizing; complexity remains in the single word “sorry.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate carries a distinct perceptual signature: tactile attention to pins, auditory compression in “heartbeat,” cosmic metaphors keyed to lock-picking mind. Syntax modulates from languid accumulative clauses to the short decisive “Tomorrow.” No head-hopping; distance stable. Dialogue is minimal but natural (“Look up”) and carries subtext. One hairline slip: “architectural fear” edges toward elevated metaphor, yet fits the narrator’s lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “enveloped secrets…nested like boxes” compresses backstory without pause. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn; each sentence adds image or pressure. Rhythm accelerates into the final short paragraph, mirroring lock release. Figurative language is sparse, precise, and avoids mixed metaphors.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Premise—urban folk-myth locksmith who cracks metaphysical locks—is fresh but sits in recognizable magical-realist territory. Specificity of hand-forged lock geometry and starlight hint mechanic lifts it above trope. Final inversion—locksmith becomes key to her own seal—feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk is moderate; transformation is present but not radically destabilizing.</comment>
