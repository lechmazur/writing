<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s obsessive return to the garden is viscerally embodied (“she felt it in the way the roots rearranged overnight”) and her final renunciation of the camera carries a palpable cost. The interior contradiction—craving knowledge yet surrendering to un-recordable time—plays out in concrete micro-choices. Her profession as maze-maker mostly stays off-stage; one beat of application to the hyperbolic discovery would have pushed to 9+. Closure choice is earned and irreversible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The causal spine is clear: each faded photo → deeper entanglement → halo fragment → collapse of temporal boundary → camera set down. The final image of root-threaded Elara in the restored print supplies a visible, conceptual cost that reweights everything. Accumulative pattern (progressively paler photos) tightens alongside causal beats. Lens holds without wobble; closure lands with undeniable price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Environment is not backdrop but tactical opponent: saddle-curved canopy warps distance and forces hours-long traverses; the halo-bearing bridge supplies the crucial tool/setting fusion that unlocks hyperbolic collapse. Sensory hierarchy is POV-tilted toward professional pattern recognition (“grain of historical moments”). Micro-setting (her sternum hum) charges the climax. Spatial choreography stays coherent despite folding geometry.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will she keep documenting or surrender to unbounded time?”—tightens exactly once when the restored photo reveals her root-entwined future self, making continued photography cognitively unbearable. Hyperbolic garden and retrocognitive intrusion escalate by compressing option space rather than external danger; agency is expressed through the final relinquishment of the camera. Cost is legible: she trades verifiable present for atemporal merger.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of recursive time vs. human record emerges through image decay rather than exposition; the garden’s consumption of memory reframes maze-making as arrogant spatial ordering against vegetal patience. Final image of “a time that had no edges, only roots” offers non-verbal conceptual repricing. No moralizing; ambiguity persists—she is both victor and casualty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited adheres to Elara’s architect-trained perception, filtering wonder through geometric vocabulary (“saddle-curved surfaces”). Syntax flexes from precise clauses to elongated lyric coils that mirror hyperbolic dilation. No head-hop; halo’s “hum in her sternum” keeps interiority embodied. Register stays consistent, elevated yet believable for a designer who sculpts yew into labyrinths.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful: figurative layering supports rather than stalls beats. “Pigment lifting from paper like breath leaving a body” performs double duty—visual and mortal. Occasional adjective clusters (“gauze-white shapes, the trees reduced to whispers of contrast”) risk overwriting but accrue to thematic fade. No loops, scaffolds, or mixed metaphors near closure; final sentence lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Combines living architecture, memory-eating photography, and retrocognition into an inevitable synthesis: the garden as anti-maze that dissolves walls of chronology. Hyperbolic botanical geometry anchors speculative concept in tangible mechanism. The faded-photo device repurposes a universal trope into personal erasure. Stakes feel fresh because expertise (hedge-maze designer) becomes the very trap she once built for others.</comment>
