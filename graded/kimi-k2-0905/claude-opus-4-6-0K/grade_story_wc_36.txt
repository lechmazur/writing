<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Maren’s keeper-guilt and need to “harvest failure” are vivid, embodied in trembling fingers and the weight of the pack; the micro-choice to play the flute crystallizes her contradictory impulses in scene. The final renunciation of guardianship bears visible cost—she arranges the last marker knowing she may not return as the same person. Interiority stays concrete and avoids therapy-speak, but the eleven-year backstory is delivered in a single expository lump rather than being dramatized or braided through present tension, muting the arc’s early stakes. Still, the stance shift from preserving to releasing is earned and irreversible, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Earned Stasis: Maren forecloses the path of keeper-as-curator by playing the flute and planting the inward-pointing marker, accepting that failure is the seed she must carry. Causality holds under a Hybrid lens—playing the artifact causes the loom-vision, which reconfigures meaning; the driftwood trail is an accumulative pattern that frames the return possibility. Orientation is anchored by word 70 (granite ledge, valley look-back) so no penalty applies. Cost is legible in the final image: “carrying failure like a seed—cracked open,” a conceptual price that reweights the premise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The canyon’s echo-density and “avalanchingly quiet” hush are not backdrop but active constraint—only this resonance lets the flute open the loom. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: Maren notices relic humidity specs, then the gold’s self-luminance, then moss-filmed alternate canyons. Spatial choreography is clean across the climb, ledge pause, and throat-of-basalt summit. The Thunder-Echo Range as micro-setting constrains the final choice and charges the closing marker placement, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—atonement through use of the relic—tightens once: from preservation to dangerous play. Agency drives escalation; no external antagonist needed. The single meaningful turn (play the flute) narrows options irreversibly and exposes living worlds she can now never unknow. Cost is visible—she commits to an unknown return-path—though the pressure curve is a single spike rather than a rising staircase, keeping it just shy of the 8.8 band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: stewardship dies when artifacts are embalmed rather than lived; failure is the seed of future knowledge. The flute’s shift from museum piece to shuttle re-prices the concept of guardianship on the page. Final image of “failure like a seed—cracked open, finally, and ready to grow” offers a resonant non-literal answer. No moralizing or thesis sentence intrudes; meaning is carried by object and action alone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited sustains a precise, tactile perceptual signature—“avalanchingly quiet,” “cupped water” echoes, gold leaf that “responded to proximity rather than light.” Syntax lengthens under awe, shortens under exertion, mirroring breath. No dialogue appears; evaluation focuses on narrative voice, which is coherent and pressure-responsive. Occasional Latinate elevation (“empirical precision”) is justified by ex-keeper mindset and does not drift out of POV lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual information without scaffold. Mixed metaphors are avoided; “architecture of sound” extends the loom shuttle image consistently. One minor paraphrase loop (“not ended… Not concluded… Ended with fire”) is deliberate anaphora, not artifact. Rhythm breathes with climb exertion then tightens at the summit, culminating in a clean, charged final line that re-energizes “seed” and “failure.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fusion of prehistoric artifact, echo-geology, and post-catastrophe guilt feels singular; nothing reads like a prompt checklist. The notion that silence itself carries mass and can be “harvested” for inter-world travel is a fresh inflection on portal fantasy. Risky lyric compression is taught early (“silence gathered weight”) and pays off in the loom-vision without breaking causality. Transformation test fails—story collapses if the Thunder-Echo Range or the reed flute is swapped out.</comment>
