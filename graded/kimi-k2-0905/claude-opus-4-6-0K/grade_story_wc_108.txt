<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority is visceral and embodied—fear as physical memory (“every flinch at heights was a child’s memory of being carried from a window”)—and the final refusal to hide behind a stunt double’s mask is earned through the decrypted cast and shell. Contradictory impulses (terror vs need to feel real) play out in real time on the page. Micro-choice of fitting the shell into the cast hollow crystallizes identity shift with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the decision to appear publicly as Lena Kovic reweights the entire premise—proof beats violence. Causal chain intact: betrayal → decryption → public unmasking. Cost is legible in the final image—“shaking hands and all.” Accumulative lens holds: every recurrent object (shell, cast) accrues evidentiary mass until the stance crystallizes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ruined library’s rusted skeleton and star-punctured roof act as both literal workspace for decryption and metaphoric “open text” of her life; detail is selective, tactile, POV-filtered. Micro-setting of child’s cast constrains the final tactical choice—only that plaster can carry the proof. Spatial choreography clean; no orientation drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—proof vs erasure—tightens once when decryption yields Lena Kovic’s name, foreclosing anonymity. Agency drives escalation: she chooses evidence over retaliation. Felt price: the trembling certainty that will be visible on-camera. No coincidence; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without thesis: vulnerability as evidentiary power. Shell/cast reweight from keepsakes to legal weapons; final image of shaking hands before cameras offers non-literal answer—fear is the signature of truth. No moralizing; complexity intact—Gerard’s betrayal remains architecturally loving.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person lingers inside Mara/Lena’s perceptual bias—stars as punctuation, rusted shelves as lace—syntax tightens under pressure (“She was shaking. She was certain.”). No head-hop; psychic distance contracts cleanly at climax. Distinct rhythmic signature sustained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high information density—“books swollen and returned to pulp” does world + emotional decay in five words. Metaphors precise, no mixed vehicles. Sentence variety propels the decrypting beat without overwriting. Clean grammar and tense throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stunt-double-with-phobias is fresh angle; using a child’s cast as cipher key is specific and non-obvious. Betrayal framed as architectural, not villainous, complicates sentiment. Final stance—public shakiness equals strength—reverses genre expectation of violent revenge. Risk taken and paid off.</comment>
