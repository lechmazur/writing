<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vael’s contradictory drive—yearning for belonging while refusing to ask for it—pulses in every micro-choice (pressing the tag, withholding her name, weaving strangers into her rib-cage). The final stance, “waiting to be woven in return,” costs her the last of her outsider aloofness; the reed child literally pulls Korin to her, proving the sculpture beats her silence. Interiority never drifts into label-speak; instead, “luminescent ache” is felt through the arbor’s warmth shifting against her back. One minor slip: Korin’s interior rationale (“tolerance is not kinship”) is ventriloquised without textual cue, nudging perfect score down a hair.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each reed figure thickens the pattern until the arbor’s glow reweights “loneliness” into “lamp lit for approaching feet.” Closure—Charged Poise—lands when Vael stands inside the circle she invented, cost legible in the shift from solitary sculptor to host who “waits to be woven.” Orientation is taught by deliberate estrangement (“no name anyone could pronounce”) and pays off as the tag becomes pronounceable invitation. Zero causality breaks; even the tag’s six-settlement spread is left as motivated ellipsis that later tightens into single scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The arbor’s slow pulse literally warms Vael’s back, constraining when and how she sculpts; the crater’s violet-gold palette times the afternoon beat. Marsh reeds double as material and metaphor—remembering water even dry—so environment dictates both tool and symbol. Spatial choreography is pristine: perimeter → arbor → circles of reed people, all tracked without drift. Only the grandmother’s “arms wide enough to hold weather” edges toward hyperbole, keeping it just sub-9.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will anyone answer her silent invitation?”—tightens exactly once when Korin touches the grandmother’s hand; from that moment Vael’s tactics shift from dispersing tags to teaching strangers to weave. Pressure stays accumulative: each new sculptor adds density, not external opposition. Cost is felt when her private orchard becomes communal workspace; the final image shows her reed-self still outside the interlocked circles, a visible forfeiture of absolute solitude. Could wish for one earlier micro-loss (a broken figure, a depleted reed patch) to push into 9+ band.</question>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Kinship as intentional craft emerges without once saying “family is what you make it”; the theme accrues through reed ligaments and the arbor’s dark glow. Final reconfiguration—community as lamp expecting footsteps—reverbs back through every unnamed sculpture, re-pricing anonymity as hospitality. Subtext in Korin’s fingertip on the grandmother’s palm says “I choose this exile too” louder than any plea. Avoids pat moral by leaving Vael still waiting, theme suspended in charged poise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person hovers at Vael’s shoulder, filtering every spectrometer-shift of crystalline light through her bone-deep edge-need. Syntax lengthens and softens during the arbor passages, then clips when strangers appear, mirroring threat/exhilaration of company. Zero head-hop; even Korin’s first line arrives as external speech Vael must interpret. Voice never explains its own metaphors, trusting reader to feel “spectrum that hurt the chest.”</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is deliberate: long anapestic sweeps for crater grandeur, then tight iambs when fingers knot reed. No filter-verb stacks, no mixed metaphors; “glass-bright silence” is precise. Information density high—one sentence often layers world, emotion, and metaphor (“catching light and splitting it…”). A single paraphrase loop (“reed into rib cage, reed into reaching hand”) is pattern-taught, justified as ritual cadence, so no deduction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Transforms orphaned-misfit trope into literal sculpture practice; street-art tag made of plant fibre is fresh. Obsidian arbor as dark photosynthetic heart feels inevitable yet unborrowed. Risk—using lyric accumulation instead of plot reversals—pays off when communal lamp-image reconfigures all prior solitude. Could not swap reeds for clay or arbor for cave without collapsing metaphoric circuitry.</comment>
