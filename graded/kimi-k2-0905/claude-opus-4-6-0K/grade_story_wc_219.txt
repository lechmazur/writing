<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sera’s interior contradiction—clinically cataloguing homecoming while her body still floods with ache—plays out in concrete micro-choices (same boots, same satchel, amber placed on sill). The final beat of deliberate belief lands as earned renunciation of her earlier reductionism, cost visible in the trembling fly-shadow.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory return layers density until the fly’s shadow reweights the premise. Closure is a Charged Poise— Options collapse into one luminous yes; cost is the irreversible widening of solitude now that sky has spoken. Orientation anchored by word 80; no ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Rain-limed limestone, ivy-throttled statues, and the amber’s golden eye on the floor are filtered through Sera’s scientific gaze, turning into tools that pressure her stance. The tower itself—sold telescope, absent mentor—supplies the final constraint that crystallizes belief.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—whether homecoming can survive demystification—tightens when sensory data confirm the hormone script yet something “exceeds the data.” One deepening suffices; no external antagonist needed. Felt cost is the ache she now must carry knowingly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the failure of reductionism to exhaust wonder; the fly preserved without consent becomes the silent argument that presence outlasts explanation. Final reconfiguration—belief chosen despite mechanism—lands without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Sera’s perceptual signature—oxytocin, cortisol, spatial memory—creating a rhythmic pulse of clause-stacking that mimics data acquisition. No head-hop; diction never exceeds her lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences do double duty (e.g., “ivy latticed the lower windows” seeds both decay and later pattern of convergence). Zero loops or mixed metaphor; high information density with breath control at climax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusing alien first-contact with a neurochemical pilgrimage to an abandoned weather tower feels fresh; the fly amber as forty-million-year proof of love-without-permission re-energizes a familiar memento. Risk is present but stops just short of redefining the genre.</comment>
