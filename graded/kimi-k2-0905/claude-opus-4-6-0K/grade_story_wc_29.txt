<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Maren’s insomnia-driven edge and “brilliant but unproven” backstory give her a sharp, specific interior voice; the recursive signal discovery feels born of her obsessive traits. The decision to hijack the campus channel is a credible micro-choice that crystallizes her value hierarchy. No second character on page, so relationship/status bullets N/A. The final “fragile, gritty edge of hope” is an embodied, costed stasis that forecloses quiet surrender.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: discovery → pattern fear → faction trap → broadcast intervention. Anchors (who/where/when) land by line 3 and re-anchor after time jump to 2 a.m. Closure is Earned Stasis: she stays awake, phone already ringing, cost = future backlash legible. One minor causality fuzz: how she boosts sub-sonics to audibility is hand-waved, not breaking but not proven.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Burnt-coffee/ozone opener and ventilation-fluttered charts give tactile, POV-filtered immediacy. Basement booth geography is lean but coherent; the charts function as micro-setting that literally guide her final broadcast coordinates. Radio station tools (mic, channel selector) are handled, not catalogued. Final image of “starlight filtered through smoke” re-uses ozone/burn motif, charging the closing beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—human attention architecture vs. cosmic manipulation—signalled in para 1 and escalates through faction tightening. One meaningful turn: her broadcast refuses both departmental exits, inventing a third path with visible social cost (phone/email pouncing). Cost is felt immediately; no off-stage rescue. Could be sharper if we saw one listener’s concrete reaction rather than summary.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of knowledge-as-weapon emerges organically from signal anatomy and academic self-destruction; no narrator thesis. Subtext ripples in “cosmic tricksters”—a metaphor that accrues dread without literalising aliens. Final image re-prices hope as smoky starlight: costly, uncertain, still visible. Avoids moral binaries; both faculty factions remain somewhat right yet exploited.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Maren’s perceptual filter: burnt coffee = sky wrongness, charts = living map. Diction—“cataloging exactly where humanity was looking”—carries scientific precision without drifting into academic whitepaper. Rhythm modulates: long nested sentences mirror recursive signal, then short beats under broadcast pressure. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets N/A; voice cohesion survives peak stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density: astronomical jargon is accurate, concise, character-necessary. Only one paraphrase loop (“signals were intelligent, yes. But they were not friendly”) is justified by punch placement. Metaphors stay consistent (voice under scream, starlight through smoke). No filter-verb clusters or register drift. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with paragraph breaks; opening and closing lines bookend with sensory specificity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Freshens the “first contact” trope by weaponising metadata in sub-20 Hz blind spots—an angle rarely explored. Academic civil-war setting keeps stakes human-scale while cosmic scope looms. “Cosmic tricksters” re-energises an old trope via specific mentor callback and tactical evidence. Risky 2 a.m. campus broadcast gambit pays off and feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
