<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lira’s gift/burden contradiction is dramatized through the corpse-flower bloom: she stays, inhales, and endures the stench that her nose most hates. The final beat—“she was serene, and she was moving”—embodies the earned synthesis her grandmother prophesied. Micro-choices (wrapping, planting, breathing) track escalating stakes; no stock interiority. Cost is felt: she accepts permanent sensory overload as the price of wisdom.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each doodled parcel, orchid breath, and sulfurous whiff layers density until the bloom reweights the premise. The closure beat—“refusal to separate beauty from decay”—is a Charged Poise that reconfigures meaning with undeniable conceptual cost. Causality is internal and coherent: gift → seed → bloom → stance crystallization. No orientation debt; spatial anchors clear by 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The living canopy platforms, reversed wind, and orchid rails constrain every move; Lira must kneel on bark to plant, must stand in the stench to endure. Micro-setting—the brown paper with hidden root sketches—functions as tactile, choice-guiding environment. Sensory hierarchy obeys her hyperosmic bias: mint differentiations and rain prophecy affect tactics. Final image charges the platform air with death-and-orchid fusion, reweighting the world she must keep inhaling.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can she metabolize overwhelm without withdrawal—tightens at each嗅觉 assault until the bloom leaves no retreat. Escalation is textural: odor density accrues, options narrow to endure or flee; she actively chooses endure. Visible cost: lifelong sensory overload accepted on the page. Agency drives every beat; no coincidence rescues her.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from olfactory juxtapositions rather than thesis statements: lavender cannot teach what rot must. The doodled wrapping-paper garden hidden inside every parcel enacts the “undercurrent” metaphor—knowledge wrapped in generosity. Final image reweights prior orchid sweetness as inseparable from cadaverine stench, offering resonant non-moral: serenity is motion within both. No platitudes; complexity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Lira’s hyperosmic attention: verbs like “stitched,” “whispered,” and “screamed” map smell to motion. Rhythm accelerates into short clauses at the bloom inhale, mirroring sensory assault. Perceptual signature is consistent—rain three hours early, forty mints—without POV leakage. No dialogue, so voice purity remains intact under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyric yet information-dense: “hummingbirds stitched the air” performs double duty—atmosphere and motion. No synonym loops or scaffold; each image advances stakes or sensory hierarchy. Metaphors stay coherent within arboreal physics. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”) is narrator, not Lira, but occurs outside peak beats, so register drift is minor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Hyperosmic herbalist bringing a corpse flower to a sky-canopy healing village is fresh; olfaction as spiritual pedagogy flips the usual “soothing aromatherapy” trope. Doodled wrapping-paper archives externalize scientific method via folk custom—specific to this lineage. Risk of horticultural disgust is embraced, not hedged. Premise could not swap names or places without collapse; integrates fully with theme and closure.</comment>
