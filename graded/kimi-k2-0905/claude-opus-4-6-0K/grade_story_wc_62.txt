<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is richly particular—her slowed chisel, the ribbon’s texture under calloused fingers, the way monarch wings tickle her collar. Contradictory impulses (carving absence vs. needing conversation) coexist in scene, and the final choice to host the next poem-supper is earned by the spiral stone’s cost. Marguerite’s spectral pressure is the only off-page lever, but it is accepted as the story’s enchanted rule. Voice stays single, so status dynamics are N/A.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each ribbon poem layers ancestral grief until the slate spiral reframes the stake. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara’s “widening gyre” image reweights prior dinners into an ongoing conversation that never ends; cost is felt in her dusk walk home to set an empty extra plate. One clean shard: greenhouse nights across migration weeks, anchored early, transitions legible. Orientation secure by 60 words; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The greenhouse’s “iron bones laced with glass so old it rippled” is handled—she lounges among out-lived ferns, slate dust settling on leaves, monarchs slipping through broken panes. The setting’s decay and butterfly timetable directly constrain her carving sessions and force the final dinner invitation before insects vanish. Micro-setting (ribbon, slate slab) doubles as tool and altar, charging the closure image. No occupational depth required.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—find the living shape of shared grief—tightens when each ribbon stanza personalizes the abstract question into Uncle Theodor’s drowned son, factory closures, etc.; agency is attention/renunciation: she abandons traditional headstones for the communal spiral. One meaningful deepening suffices for 750-word piece; price is the irrevocable slate and the duty to keep the poem dinners alive. Cost visible on page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: collective grief is not an object but a relay of handed lines. Final spiral image answers the opening question non-literally, re-pricing family meals as perpetual memorial. Subtext operates in silence—no one names the funerals yet every dinner is one. No late symbolism; ribbon and gyre echo by structural necessity, not ornament.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyric, near-incantatory third-person stays close to Elara’s perceptual filter: glass “rippled like water frozen mid-pour,” monarchs “threaded south in their millions.” Syntax lengthens during meditative dusk beats, shortens when specter speaks, mirroring tension. No dialogue to judge; narration avoids filter-verb stacks. Compression taught early (“glass so old it rippled”) and paid off in final “widening gyre.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High information density: each sentence layers grief history or sensory cue without scaffold. Figurative language controlled—two metaphors, both apt, no mixed vehicles. Rhythm modulates: long breathless sentence for butterfly stream, clipped fragments for chisel taps. No synonym loops, no template cadence. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves via image that recharges “conversation that never ends.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: gravestone carver + monarch corridor + communal poem ribbon yields an inevitable yet unseen angle on grief. Spectral mentorship is restrained (no glow, just authority of someone who once grew roses), avoiding trope cliché. Final “widening gyre” reconfigures familiar dinner-table poetry into living memorial. Risk in lyric accumulative structure is fully paid by resonant closure.</comment>
