<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren’s interiority is vivid—her decision to “decide the hurt was worth walking into” crystallizes motive. The crocodile-tooth ritual and micro-choice to cradle Elara’s confession show embodied cost. One slip: “modestly fearless” is asserted, not dramatized in-scene, keeping her shy of 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the gorge’s chord reweights grief and laughter in one audible image, cost paid by Maren’s imperfect harp and Elara’s broken laugh. Causal chain—wrong notes → loosen confessions → reintegrate laughter—holds without gaps. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Echo gorge is not backdrop but acoustic instrument: its stone throat literally bends sound to enable the healing act. Micro-setting of the warped harp and crocodile tooth likewise constrain tactics. Final sunrise strike on wet stone recharges the gorge as both crucible and mirror—meets 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—retrieve Elara’s lost laughter—tightens when Maren isolates the confession “I was laughing when he fell.” One meaningful deepening: laughter is not erased but re-integrated, foreclosing guilt-alone as option. Cost is audible in the “devastating and beautiful” chord; could be sharper if Maren’s physical price were legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—joy and sorrow coexist without causal guilt—emerges through acoustic alchemy rather than statement. Final image of Elara’s “broken, astonished laugh” offers non-literal answer to how healing can sound. No moralizing; ambiguity remains whether the laugh will hold, keeping it from 9+ perfection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Maren’s perceptual filter: “the hush of a hidden sunrise that pooled gold along the rim” is sensuous yet goal-driven. Rhythm modulates—long breathless cadence down the gorge, staccato when confessions scatter. No head-hop; compressed diction taught early and paid off in final chord.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lines carry triple duty: sensory, metaphoric, causal—“echo gorge held sound the way a dying man holds breath” anchors world-rule and stakes. Few filter verbs; no loops. One overwrought phrase—“air itself tasted of remorse”—slightly dilutes immediacy, preventing 9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>“Lost soul collector” who heals via deliberately detuned harp in an acoustic gorge feels fresh; the wrong-note harmonics reversing echo-guilt is a specific, non-obvious synthesis. Familiar grief-recovery arc is re-weighted by sonic metaphysics. Risk stays integrated; no gimmickry.</comment>
