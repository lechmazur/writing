<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Maren’s grief is embodied in oil-stained fingers and crane-folding micro-choices; the contradiction between polishing memory and letting it fly is alive in scene. The final act of hanging the lantern—an earned renunciation—pays the cost of perpetual mourning. Yet the interiority occasionally drifts into lyrical self-diagnosis (“grief would not end, but it would take flight”) that short-circuits the sharper contradiction earlier shown. Still, the micro-choice hierarchy stays legible and stakes feel scaled to 800 words.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of polish → projection → fold → hang tightens the emotional cadence; closure is a Charged Poise—the lantern burning as both tether and release—whose conceptual cost (nightly re-mined grief) is unmistakable. Orientation is taught immediately through basilica/garden spatial anchors. No因果 turns are required under this lens; the single deepening beat (Severance) reweights the stake by making dream-gems flare, narrowing options to eternal repetition. All set-ups (lantern core, obsidian paste, jasmine steam) return recharged in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Floating glass basilica and thermal jasmine are not backdrop: refracted grief-light and altitude-tinted tea constrain Maren’s ritual timing and supply the obsidian paste that polishes memory. The garden’s lattice floor literally channels the descending shadow, turning spatial rule into emotional apparatus. Micro-setting (lantern hollow core, paper cranes) functions as setting-as-tool, charging the final hanging image. Missing only a stronger olfactory echo in the closure beat to hit 9+.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—extracting vs. releasing Luma—tightens once when Severance activates the gem and flight becomes literal. Agency is present: Maren chooses to fold cranes and hang the lantern, trading private mining for public ascent. Cost is legible (perpetual night labour), but the beat is singular; no second tightening or material loss alters tactics. Sufficient for 800-word lyric arc under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-light vs memory-as-burden emerges from iterated concrete acts—polishing, folding, projecting—never from statement. Final Charged Poise reconfigures meaning: the same light that resurrects Luma also chains Maren to nightly repetition, refusing sentimental closure. Ambiguity lingers without confusion. Almost no abstraction leaks in; the single line about “luminous, tormenting moment” borders on echoing the prompt’s tone tag, trimming the last 0.1.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyric third-person hovers at mid-psychic distance, consistent and patterned: clause stacks mimic breath-steamed glass, taught by line 1 and held to final “trembled as if remembering how to breathe.” No dialogue, so voice purity rests on metaphoric control and rhythmic variation; both sustain without monotony. One minor register lift (“conceptual repricing” not in Maren’s diction) is swallowed by overall coherence. Perceptual signature—light refracted through grieving craft—remains unmistakable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences do multiple jobs: “Thermal jasmine grew… producing a brew that tasted of altitude and longing” fuses sensory detail, world-rule, and emotional state. Figurative language is dense but patterned, never crowding causality. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; only two adjacent “grew/producing” could compress further. Final third is clean, allowing 9-band eligibility.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dream-record lanterns, severing shadows, and origami grief-chemistry synthesize into a non-obvious ritual that feels inevitable in hindsight. Specificity of obsidian paste, lamp-oil stains, and steam-steeped leaves anchors the lyric concept. Risk in upward-setting sun pays off by reversing light’s moral vector. Not quite pushing formal boundaries enough for the highest bonus, but fresh inflections abound.</comment>
