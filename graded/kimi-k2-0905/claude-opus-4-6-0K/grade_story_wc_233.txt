<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s disenchantment and dream-compulsion are embodied in metallic taste and bruised sternum; the final refusal to rule is earned through the grotto revelation. micro-choice chain—dream residue → council defiance → ascent → hand-clasp renunciation—keeps interior contradiction alive. Maren’s silently commanding presence supplies external pressure without stealing focalization. Cap at 8.9 only because Maren’s “softly commanding” trait stays label-level; no on-page beat shows it altering tactics.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: queen kneels inside power instead of wielding it—cost is the forfeited throne, felt in the open-palm image. Accumulative lens holds: bleeding threads → firefly absorption pattern reweights the premise from wound to seam. Orientation anchored by word 60 (Vethara Ridge); single transition from ember to cobalt grotto is legible. No causality breaks; starlight hemorrhage is consistent dream-logic, not late rule-patch.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ember grotto’s retained sunset heat and cobalt grotto’s lapis-in-glass walls are tactile, POV-filtered, and constrain the final revelation. Environment literally enables the firefly ascent that reconfigures meaning. Spatial choreography clean: ridge ascent, rope anchor, lip of stone—bodies track. “Clouds below like a second sea” charges the closing image of mutual yearning.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understand dream or lose self—tightens when council threat makes exile real. One meaningful deepening: silver threads stop scorching when fireflies absorb them, crystallizing her renunciation. Cost is visible—she abandons throne, kneels in starlight lace. Agency sits with her; coincidence (firefly timing) complicates rather than resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme—power as permeability, not dominion—emerges from grotto image of sky-earth seam. No moralizing; final line “letting it pass through her open hands” reconfigures crown-symbol without stating thesis. Recurring wound/seam motif shifts meaning cleanly. Ambiguity remains: kingdom’s fate untold, but cost is undeniable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elara; perceptual signature vivid—“basalt shoulders,” “lacy wreckage of heaven.” Rhythm accelerates at starfall, breathes during shared exhale. No dialogue, so voice purity maintained. Filter verbs sparing and motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies: long spiral descent, then terse “Maren inhaled sharply.” Figurative density peaks at starfall but pattern-taught and paid off. Zero paraphrase loops; each image advances stake or atmosphere. Opening line anchors voice; final line crystallizes closure without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Bleeding starlight absorbed by fireflies feels myth-fresh yet生物具体. Royal abdication trope is re-angled through geological-metaphysical seam rather than romance or politics. Risk taken: quiet renunciation instead of battle, but coherence maintained. Slight deduction for familiar “climb to enlightenment” spine.</comment>
