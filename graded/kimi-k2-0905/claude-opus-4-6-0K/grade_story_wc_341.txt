<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marina’s interior contradiction—scientist vs. emotional cartographer—remains embodied in every beat; the final “Joy” classification is earned by her sustained attention to absence. Micro-choices (raising the telescope, logging cloud emotion) visibly cost her remaining time and safety, fulfilling Earned Stasis. The only bar to 9+ is that the mother’s absence is asserted more than dramatized, muting the cost of that specific loss.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the drifting gondola steadily compresses options until the cloud-split releases a single shaft that reweights the whole premise. Closure is a Charged Poise: Marina keeps logging, now fluent, while descent continues—cost is the irreversible loss of tether and the unspoken probability of death. Causality remains intact: severance → drift → emotional taxonomy → final illumination.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sky, telescope, and brass warmth constrain every action; the sepia starlight and 14,200-ft altitude are not backdrop but survival variables. The telescope’s scratched barrel literally focuses the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is flawless—cable gap, spiral, west-northwest bearing all track.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove emptiness remembers—tightens as oxygen and altitude run down. The unnamed “contained detonation” cloud supplies one visible escalation that forces her to coin “Joy,” foreclosing earlier detachment. Cost is legible: she surrenders rescue time to keep cataloguing. A second reversal would be needed for 9+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from pattern: every logged absence (mother, tether, cloud gap) accrues mass until the final light redefines absence as presence. No explicit thesis—resonance is in the act of naming. The emotional taxonomy shifts from private quirk to survival tool, reconfiguring grief into witness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Marina’s perceptual filter—brass eyepiece stuck “like a joint swollen with age” is hers alone. Syntax lengthens during drift, then fractures into short log entries under dawn pressure, mirroring breath. No head-hop; diction never exceeds meteorologist lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm breathes with altitude—long cirrus sentences drift, then snap-crack with the tether. No loops or scaffold; every image pulls double duty (spiraling cable = grief). One mixed metaphor—“cloud split along invisible seams”—is forgiven because it pays off literally in the next clause.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Emotional cloud taxonomy feels inevitable yet unseen in fiction; the severed gondola turns a standard survival setup into a meditation on metric vs. felt knowledge. Brass telescope as inherited emotional barometer is fresh. Risk—quiet ending without rescue—heightens coherence rather than gimmickry.</comment>
