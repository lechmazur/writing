<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Maret’s interiority is concrete—her curved spine, silver-stained hands, the way she “reads the copper like scripture.” The final sealing gesture crystallizes her life-long obsession with a visible cost: the warm copper under her palm confirms she has burned another year of solitude into the map. No contradictory impulse is staged in scene, only recalled, so the 9+ quick test isn’t quite met, but the earned stasis is palpable.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the instant the flash-paper vanishes, the orchard’s pulse is permanently transmuted into copper geography, foreclosing Maret’s chance to leave. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each discarded item adds density until the pattern ruptures into light. Orientation is secured by line 5 (“crater held the orchard”). Cost is legible in the final image: starlight trapped, body frozen, future paths narrowed to one etched map.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The crater’s mineral walls that “will not let starlight leave” directly enable the climax; the basin’s cold forces Maret’s stillness, aligning her heartbeat with the roots. Micro-setting—the copper plate warmed by absorbed starlight—charges the closure. Every sensory detail (indigo bowl sky, breath that “hung”) is filtered through her alchemical attention, never touristic. Spatial choreography is immaculate: knees press frozen earth, hand flattens plate, wind resumes outside rim.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translate the orchard’s heartbeat or surrender to permanent exile—tightens once: the pattern must be perfect before the paper burns. No reversals, but pressure intensifies as temperature drops past language; failure means the map and years of solitude evaporate unseen. Agency is renunciation: she kneels, waits, seals, accepting the cost of immobility. Under Accumulative lens, the deepening of cold and collected starlight reweights the stake; price is the warmth she feels leaving her body into the copper.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the recurring equation of stillness with preservation: what refuses to flow (starlight, breath, heartbeat) becomes navigable. The final image reweights the premise—maps are not discovered but burned into being by loss. No moral is stated; the orchard’s dead roots and Maret’s stained hands argue that preservation consumes the preserver. Subtext whispers in silence: the world exhales, she does not.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains alchemical distance yet lets diction bend to her perception—“safekept starlight,” “rhythm she had been listening for.” Syntax lengthens during pattern-building, then snaps into the short ignition beat. No dialogue, so voice carries all cadence; the paragraph cut test passes—every block advances cold, light, or pattern. No head-hop, no filter-verb clutter; perceptual signature is exact: she notices quartz, frost-black seeds, not generic “debris.”</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “stars sharpened themselves against it like pins pressed through velvet” does image-double-duty, rendering both sky and piercing intent. No scaffold loops; each sentence adds temperature, light, or tactile data. Figurative language peaks only at the burn beat, then recedes, preventing saturation. One mixed metaphor risk—“bowl of indigo” beside “pins through velvet”—but the sensory hierarchy (visual → tactile) stays coherent and supports momentum.</comment>

<comment>Flash-paper alchemy that traps starlight to etch heartbeat-maps is a fresh synthesis of photography, cartography, and solitude. The orchard-in-crater biome feels inevitable, not quirky; mineral walls trapping photons supplies internal logic. Risk—quiet lyric climax—pays off by reconfiguring stillness as violent inscription. Could not swap copper plate for parchment without breaking physics and metaphor; specificity anchors universals of longing.</comment>
