<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lena’s interior contradiction—scientist who filters life vs. woman swept into tactile ruin—is concrete and embodied; the micro-choice to photograph dust trails instead of spectra crystallizes the shift. The butterfly-scale moment enacts the core change, but the ex-husband label and “eleven years” backstory are too neat, edging toward diagnostic shorthand rather than lived memory. Emotional progression feels credible: slow sediment of silence mirrored in river silt, refusal of grand epiphany. The renunciation of her filter is earned, visible, and carries quiet cost—she will return to stars carrying greenhouse humility—yet the absence of any second on-page character keeps relational crucible and status dynamics inactive, capping the high band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: a Conceptual Repricing where “humility was not smallness” reweights the entire premise under Accumulative/Textural lens; the tarp-flap light sweep is Charged Poise with felt cost. Causality is interior but traceable—dust reading replaces data reading because the flood physically breaks her telescope-proxy (greenhouse). One shard only, no teleport or reset. Orientation anchored by 80 words, no penalty. The lens is held without wobble; no artifact obscures the final image, satisfying 9+ quick test, but the slight over-tidiness of the “gradual change” italicized note keeps it just below exceptional.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Greenhouse-as-micro-setting is fully exploited: broken glass under knees constrains posture, rusted tools limit rescue options, open roof admits weather that supplies the dust medium itself. Sensory hierarchy obeys ex-astrophysicist—light diffraction, particle counts—but is re-filtered through slug trails and jasmine fan prints, integrating science eye with ruin eye. The monarch wing dust becomes the resonant object that charges the final image, meeting 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is flawless; no anachronism; tarps, silt, and river smell braid through every beat instead of stalling momentum.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can she relinquish intellectual control and accept slow, unmodelled change?—is signaled in paragraph two and tightened when she swaps spectrograms for dust photographs. The tightening is internal, but agency is visible: she caps her pen and sits on the planter, an earned renunciation of prior stance. External pressure remains low-grade (greenhouse chores, botany dept need); cost is conceptual not visceral, limiting high-band entry. Under Accumulative lens, one meaningful intensification suffices; butterfly dust reweights options, but no credible resource loss alters later tactics, holding the score sub-8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges without pronouncement: decay as revelation, not loss. Subtext operates in silence—she sweeps instead of speaking—and in objects: butterfly scales equal stellar collapse. Final image of tarp-flapping light answers the thematic question non-literally, reconfiguring her hierarchy of significance. No moral sermon; ambiguity lingers—she may relapse into models at the telescope, but the cost of that relapse is now visible, satisfying the 9+ quick test. Minor deduction for the italicized “gradual change” note that faintly echoes prompt language.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; no head-hop. Perceptual signature is sharp—neutron-star metaphors persist yet yield to jasmine and slug detail, marking authentic scientist-eye. Filter-verb count is low; metaphor strings are purposeful, taught early, paid off. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets N/A. Syntax modulates: longer reflective sentences breathe, then compress into short climatic fragments at butterfly dust beat. Voice-driven fragments (“decay was not destruction; it was revelation”) are earned, not gimmick. No register drift; tense stable; reliable narration stays intact.</question>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings avoid monotony. Information density high—one sentence often layers glass shards, slug trails, and conceptual turn. No paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors; tarps, silt, and spectral orange stay physically coherent. Minor scaffold: “she told herself she was being practical” could compress, but it is single instance and does not touch closure. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line is image-only, recharging light motif. Proofing clean. Metaphor count stays below density penalty threshold; final third artifact-free.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Premise—astrophysicist heals through flood-ruined greenhouse dust—offers fresh synthesis of science-and-ruin tropes. Monarch-wing-as-diffraction-grating is specific, non-obvious, and thematically inevitable in hindsight. Risk is quiet—no structural gimmick—but stakes feel large because collapse/ healing parallels are earned, not asserted. Transformation test passes: swap botanist for astronomer and the arc collapses. No close echoes of famous scenes. Deduction for slight safety in emotional register—stays lyrical, never raw—but specificity and conceptual integrity remain high.</comment>
