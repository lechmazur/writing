<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren’s obsessive vocation and filial obligation are viscerally embodied—she cuts ivy, palms a trembling wall, chooses to follow the dream-sound deeper. The final beat crystallizes a cost-laden fork: seal the discovery or be consumed by it. One decimal off the 9+ gate only because the mother’s interiority is inferred, not dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: Maren straps the diaries and film to her back, literally bearing the legacy that might “brand her with the same obsession,” then walks into the living dark. Causal chain intact—ivy breached → diary found → choice made—each beat tightening her options. The echo-map negative and trembling wall supply undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The ivy-veined corridor, ash-snow lecture hall, and tuning-rod micro-setting constrain every move; the cold, trembling wall literally channels her final decision. Sensory hierarchy is cartographer-precise: sound first, smell of char, plaster under boots. Could hit 9.0 only if the fireplace-as-archive were seeded one beat earlier.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—inherit the dangerous proof or bury it—tightens the moment she lifts the half-burned diaries. Each acoustic probe raises the psychic tariff: ordinary echo → neural waveform → trembling wall. Cost is legible, but a single additional external obstacle (ivy regrowth, collapsing floor) would have pushed the pressure into the 9 band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The emergent theme—knowledge itself as parasitic inheritance—never needs naming; it accrues through ash-laced pages, mirrored waveforms, and the final image of Maren choosing to “listen for what walls dream about” while they literally tremble. The negative strip reweights the premise: architecture that thinks is no longer metaphor. No sermonizing, only crystallized dread.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays glued to Maren’s ear-biased perception; diction is lean, faintly lyrical, never drifts into academic jargon the POV wouldn’t carry. Syntax flexes with tension—short clauses when she taps, longer spiral sentences when sound returns. Only a hairline slip: “sensitively perceptive” feels like an external label jammed into an otherwise seamless interior.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Zero loops, zero filler; every sentence advances cartography, atmosphere, or filial pressure. Figurative control is surgical—“ivy exhaled cold air,” “echo spiraled away in layered whispers.” Information density peaks when ash, handwriting, and waveform negative stack into one tactile breath. Closure line is uncluttered yet sonic: “whatever the walls were dreaming.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: Gothic climate-collapse meets neuro-architectural sci-fi filtered through acoustic archaeology. The notion that ruins dream in human-like neural oscillations is non-obvious and fully committed to. Risk of maternal-obsession trope is subverted by the negative-strip reveal; inheritance becomes intellectual contagion rather than sentimental closure.</comment>
