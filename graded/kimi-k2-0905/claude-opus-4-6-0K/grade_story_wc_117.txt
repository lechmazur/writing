<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—protective withholding versus the need to offer the curl—surface in the gesture of opening her palm; Jonah’s first spoken sentence is credibly triggered by the shared eclipse beat. Interiority stays concrete, avoiding label-speak. The micro-choice to pass the kalimba note-by-note visibly alters their status dyad and forecloses his silence at felt cost to both. Only the “mellow therapist” tag drifts toward occupational shorthand, keeping it just outside the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the curl reclaimed while Jonah’s three-word question reweights “ordinary magic” with undeniable conceptual cost—his voice bought at the price of her private relic. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (light drop, coyote yip, kalimba note) tightens the stakes until the final shared note crystallizes the new configuration. Orientation is anchored by ~100 words; no ambiguity at exit. Persistent constraint—Jonah’s drum heartbeat—carries the price forward under a legible eclipse clock.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sage-ridge granite and juniper root-dream are filtered through Elara’s sensory priorities—scent returning with warmth, star-wrong sky—guiding the choice to offer the curl. The micro-setting of the blanket and shared kalimba constrains the turn: no retreat once totality hits. Final image of valley bird-call echoing kalimba timbre recharges the place with the new link. Only the ranger-sign text risks overt lyricism, but it is brief enough to preserve specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will Jonah speak?—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens through each eclipse cue: thinning light, temperature drop, coyote yip. The kalimba exchange is the single meaningful escalation that narrows options from silence to syllable. Cost is legible: Elara’s private relic becomes shared currency, drum heartbeat replaces prior muteness. No reversal beyond the necessary one; coincidence (eclipse timing) complicates rather than resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>“Ordinary magic” emerges via the curl’s re-pricing rather than assertion; the theme crystallizes when Jonah’s rusty voice names it without naming it. Subtext operates in thumb-pressure on drum skin and the angle of a tilted head. Final image refuses moralizing—the bird phrase “almost like a kalimba” lets resonance linger. Ambiguity is purposeful: wonder is sustained, not solved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Elara’s perceptual signature—late-afternoon hair color, sailor-reads-wind simile—without head-hop. Rhythm modulates: longer cadence for reflective beats, staccato for eclipse dark. Kalimba note “hung…like a firefly” is precise, not purple. Dialogue limited to three rusty words, yet diction and silence carry subtext; no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, pressure, or character. Figurative language is sparse and accurate—watercolor left in rain, mineral-time dreaming. Strong verbs (furled, flared, yipped) replace modifiers. Opening and closing lines frame voice and re-weight motif without exposition. No artifact appears in final third; clarity under eclipse pressure remains intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Eclipse-as-therapy could feel gimmicky, yet the kalimba/curl synthesis and sensory anchoring transform the trope into specific lived moment. Risk: withholding a child’s first words until totality—earned by prior drum-hum signals and therapist patience. Fresh inflection: the curl as acoustic bridge. Conceptual integrity holds; no retreat into safe sentimentality.</comment>
