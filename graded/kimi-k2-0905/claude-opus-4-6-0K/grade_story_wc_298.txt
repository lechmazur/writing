<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Maren’s interiority is vivid (“amber glow, turning femurs into gilded columns”) and her contradictory impulses—reckless hope vs. maternal terror—are alive in the moment she touches the fruit. The sacrifice is credible: her own wild certainty is the exact coin traded away, foreshadowed by the repeated intrusions of roots into bone. Micro-choices (touching fruit, sinking card, slow ascent) track the value hierarchy cleanly. The only slack is a slight over-tidiness in the closing emotional arithmetic; the “patient, ordinary mother” coda feels one degree too resolved for 700 words of gothic pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the absorbed tarot figure reweights Maren’s world-rule—she exits “a different woman,” heavier, the corridor now literal and metaphorical path foreclosed. Causal chain holds: because she seeks the orchard, because she speaks the name, therefore the card sinks and the price anchors. Orientation is clean by line 4; no lens ambiguity. The single tightening beat (basin ritual) is sufficient for this length, but the cost could be even sharper—an externalized gesture or object loss—to push into 9-band.</comment>

<comment>Catacomb orchard is not backdrop but tactical resource: the skull-laced roots literally drink the consecrated dead and physically constrain movement; the black basin is the only allowable site of exchange. Sensory economy is fierce—“air tasted of loam and quiet centuries” compresses epoch and breath. Micro-setting (the lantern’s amber turning bone to architecture) recharges the final image as Maren climbs into “ordinary light,” reversing the glow. Spatial choreography is pristine; no impossible positions or floating props.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—daughter’s hollowed-out want vs. mother’s reckless certainty—tightens once, decisively, at the basin. Agency is renunciation rather than defeat: Maren chooses the trammel, narrowing her own future to widen Lise’s. Cost is legible (“heaviness where lightness had been”) and shapes the exit gait. Escalation is situational, not causal-multi-turn, but the pressure canopy of roots and centuries is coherent enough to force stance crystallization.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of fecundity: trees fed by the dead produce unharvested fruit, while the living daughter is barren of desire. Subtext operates in silence—the orchard never speaks, yet its economy is unmistakable. Final image reweights “ordinary light” as the newly scarce commodity for Maren. Avoids sermon; the only near-misstep is “holes in the soul,” but the phrase is immediately particularized through Lise’s medical futility.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate maintains tight psychic distance; perception is filtered through Maren’s idealist sensorium (“roots snaked between bones” reads as her willing metaphor). No head-hop; lantern, fruit, card are handled in corporeal time. Diction dips toward the poetic but stays within her plausible register of wonder. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for descent, clipped fragments at the sink moment, then steady climb-out cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is mostly clean; metaphors are organic and non-contradictory. One scaffold loop—“stopped dreaming, stopped wanting, stopped filling space”—is tolerable because it mirrors medical emptiness. No filter-verb clusters; strong verbs (“snaked,” “scooped,” “hardened”) drive momentum. Opening and closing lines are aural and functional. Minor density spike at “amber glow, turning femurs into gilded columns” but the image is earned and pattern-taught.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The consecrated-orchard-over-ossuary is a fresh synthesis of reliquary and agriculture; it could feel contrived yet grows from monk logistics and root hunger. Tarot-as-currency sidesteps cliché by being half-burned and already used, a spent relic rather than mystic MacGuffin. Transformation test passes: swap orchard for generic cave and the emotional barter collapses. Risk—mother barters her own metaphysical DNA—pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
