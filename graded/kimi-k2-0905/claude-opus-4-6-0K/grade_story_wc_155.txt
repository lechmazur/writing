<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Luma’s grief-lock and re-awakening are embodied in concrete micro-moments (counting months, thumb on pigment, satchel decision). The internal contradiction—clenched hands vs pulsing fragment—drives the beat chain. Final renunciation of the counter carries visible emotional cost, earning the arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: fragment discovery → memory cascade → laughter reset, each beat layering luminous density until the closing cadence shift reweights the stake. Orientation anchored by 80 words; no causality breaks. Closure is a Charged Poise: “zero months… counting up” crystallizes options with felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fog-as-memory and calcified stumps function as micro-setting that constrains movement and filters perception; the orchard’s ruined geometry literally trips her into the plot. Phosphorescent pigment specifics recur to enable the final decision. Final image of fragment pulsing in satchel charges the last line.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will she laugh again?—tightens once via fragment-triggered memory network; no reversals needed. Escalation is textural: each recalled mural increases emotional luminosity until laughter becomes inevitable. Cost is legible: reopening grief to “count up” instead of down.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges quietly: light can archive joy inside obliterating fog. No moralizing; final image reconfigures the premise without statement. Recurrent motif of recording light shifts from loss to futurity, reweighting prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is precise—bruise-pressing grief, “phosphorescent gold” tasting like cider—maintaining lyric rhythm without purple drift. Compression (“seven months felt simultaneous with seven minutes”) is pattern-taught early and paid off. No head-hop; psychic distance tightens credibly under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings diversify. High information density—“walls remembered what people forgot” does double duty. Zero loops, scaffolds, or mixed metaphors; figurative language never obscures causality in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>“Exposed film” fresco technique re-imagines memorial art as living archive; not a trope catalogue. Grief recovery via literal broken wall shard feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risky lyric accumulative structure pays off in resonant final image.</comment>
