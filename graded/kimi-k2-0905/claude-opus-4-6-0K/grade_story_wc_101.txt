<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Maren’s guarded stewardship and refusal to know the donors is concrete and contradictory in scene; the final silent re-circulation of the child’s drawing shows earned renunciation with cost. Interiority stays specific to her vigilance—cold weight of bell, burn in shoulders—without label-speak. The community remains a collective chorus, but her micro-choice to place the drawing back in the pillar crystallizes a hierarchy of values on the page. No single relationship is tested under pressure, so relationship-crucible criteria are waived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the drawing’s anonymous return reweights the rule of silence, making the before/after legible. Causal chain—bell rings → food shared → declaration → drawing appears → drawing re-hidden—holds under Accumulative lens; each beat deepens the pattern rather than pivots plot. Orientation anchored by word 60 with terra-cotta arbor, ridge, midnight. Cost is felt when Maren forecloses personal gratitude to keep the circuit alive.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Terra-cotta arbor’s fired arches function as micro-setting: they release stored heat, enabling the midnight gathering and anchoring the child’s final image. Chalky soil, switchback ruts, hollow pillar constrain how food moves and money hides. Sensory selection stays inside Maren’s body under stress—shoulders burn, bell cold—rather than catalogue. The pillar’s hollow and the bell’s timbre return in the closing image, charging the final silence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keep communal survival and anonymity intact—tightens when Maren’s declaration publicly locks her into never knowing the donor. One meaningful deepening: the child’s drawing converts anonymous cash into a visible moral claim, narrowing her options to re-hide or keep. Pressure stays accumulative; no reversal, but the stakes gain moral weight. Cost is legible: she forfeits personal connection to protect the circuit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of invisible solidarity emerges from the silent food run, the envelopes, the unanswered drawing—no character lectures us on it. Subtext lives in gestures: Yelena and Tarik look at the pillar, not each other. Final image of the drawing placed back reconfigures meaning without moral tag. Only minor echo: Maren’s “Let that be the kind of people we are” skirts close to thematic statement, but the next sentence buries it in communal silence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person hovers at Maren’s shoulder, perceptual filter tight: she feels ruts, hears patrols, reads the orange crayon as “too young to be subtle.” Syntax lengthens in calmer moments, compresses during climb—rhythm mirrors load. No dialogue to test voice distinction; narrative idiom stays consistent, understated, resisting lyrical inflation. Final sentence returns to bell’s “thin and clear” cadence, echoing opening without mechanical repetition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, high-density: single sentences carry sensory data, world rule, and emotional tilt. No synonym loops or scaffold; metaphors (“skeleton of memory”) are sparse and earned. One filter-verb cluster early (“she had learned…”) is brief and justified as summary. Closing cadence slows to match the “enormous silence,” propulsion complete.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Exile survival via anonymous micro-donations is fresh angle on sanctions trope; child’s drawing as counter-gift reweights anonymity into generational trust. Terra-cotta arbor imported across borders becomes living infrastructure, not symbol. Story commits fully to silence-as-praxis; no late twist undercuts it. Risk is quiet, but specificity—orange crayon, hollow pillar—prevents generic anywhere.</comment>
