<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Maren’s contradictory impulses—erasing her gift yet carrying charcoal for three years—collide in the cave when the sketchbook line “Mom’s hands never stop making people real” forces the decisive redraw; embodied cost (fingers blacken again) crystallizes the arc. Interiority is character-specific, never label-heavy. Only micro-slip: the epiphany sentence “suppressed creativity does not protect grief; it embalms it” flirts with thesis-speak yet is immediately enfleshed by the on-page drawing act, so causality holds. Closure earns the 9-band test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens declared by crystal/echo pattern; closure lands via Charged Poise—charcoal hits paper, sound captured “longer than seemed possible,” reweighting the premise that memory equals imprisonment. Orientation is anchored within 120 words (who, cave, three-year absence). One meaningful tightening: from “could not bear to see them” to uncorking tears that “release not just pressure but fragrance.” Persistent constraint (broken lock) shapes access. Cost is legible in final image. Hairline slip: “permanent dawn” is static descriptor, not causal, but does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Cave functions as micro-setting that constrains acoustics, emotional pressure, and the final act; crystals “hold sound” recharges the echo motif at closure. Sensory triage—headlamp split into “pale violets and golds,” humidity-cracked dial—mirrors Maren’s widening perception. Spatial choreography is clean: column “Bishop,” alcove, floor sit. One excess: “auroral” twice; second use slightly dilutes selective economy, but setting still charges the ending, satisfying 9-gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will she draw again—signaled in paragraph 2; pressure escalates through tactile ache, dream crosshatch, and the discovered sketchbook line that tightens options to “draw or stay embalmed.” Protagonist agency drives the escalation; no off-stage rescue. Visible price: charcoal stain returns, foreclosing purity of forgetting. Could edge 9.0 with crisper articulation of what is irretrievably lost by drawing again; cost is felt but not named.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of creation as continuation, not betrayal, emerges from concrete particulars—echo, charcoal, daughter’s caption—never abstract lecture. Final image reweights “auroral sorrow” into generative dawn without moralizing. Subtext in handling broken lock suggests memory itself is forced open, not politely unlocked. Ambiguity remains: is she healed or merely recommitted? Complexity honored.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is consistent: mnemonic artist sees “bone structures,” notices “contour,” filters world through graphic language. Rhythm modulates—long reflective coils tighten into staccato beats (“She pulled it free.”) under peak stress. No head-hopping; third-person hovers at intimate distance. Distinct syntactic music sustains pressure without obscurity. Elision (“three years like a river dries”) is pattern-taught and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often triples as action, backstory, metaphor (“She dreamed in crosshatch and contour.”). Zero loops, zero mixed metaphors. Figurative language spikes in final paragraph yet stays coherent: “bottle uncorked releases… fragrance” aligns with subterranean air. Read-aloud rhythm breathes precisely with emotional crests. Copy is clean; only nit—“resin to survive the moisture” could trim “the moisture” to “humidity” for cadence—does not mar closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fusion of maternal grief with spelunking mnemonic artist feels novel; crystal cave as echo-chamber of memory is fresh synthesis. Risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure pays off. Transformation test fails if names swapped, because particulars (charcoal fingers, Bishop column, reversed birthday lock) are irreplaceable. No close echoes of canonical scenes. Minor proximity: “throat that has swallowed every sound” recalls ubiquitous “cave as womb/tomb,” but repurposed through artist’s acoustic obsession, so originality sustains.</comment>
