<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The scarred firefighter’s interior contradiction—professional precision versus parental failure—is rendered through concrete micro-choices (cradling the cracked box, feeling the grafted skin tighten). The final beat—closing the box against her sternum while the planets kiss—earns a credible, scaled-to-length renunciation: keep translating pain, accept that the path home is still open. Interiority stays character-particular; no therapeutic self-labeling. One hairline slip: “everything soft in herself” flirts with abstraction but is immediately grounded by the next clause.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: density of teeth–planets–ridge re-weights the stake from personal relic to universal currency of loss. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—the heartbeat pressing into the crack makes the cost of her bargain tactile and converts prior imagery into charged poise. Causality holds: each reflective block is cued by present stimuli (moonlight on graft, planetary alignment) and alters stance (decides to write again). Orientation is anchored by word 80; no debt applied.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The ridge, porcelain box, and grafted skin function as micro-settings that constrain choice: the climb’s grooves dictate pace; the box’s crack dictates how she grips; the scar dictates how moonlight hits her. Planetary alignment evolves from backdrop to clock to mirror, tightening final cadence. Sensory selection is POV-filtered—she notices slope stability, ember scars, not tourist vistas. Environment recharges the ending image without overt symbolism. One notch shy of 9 only because altitude’s physical cost on lungs could be one beat sharper.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she keep translating pain or surrender the task—tightens once: the planetary echo of the earlier ridge visit forces the decision to “write another letter.” Pressure accrues through pattern break: the box that once held childhood now holds only silence, and the conjunction that last saw Maia seven returns to demand a next move. Cost is legible—heartbeat pressing into the fracture—yet the external world offers no new obstacle beyond memory, keeping escalation just under the 8.8 gate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the particular physics of fire and parenting: fire reveals what can’t burn, parenthood reveals what can’t be refunded. Subtext operates in the silence after the letters, the crack that admits moonlight, the planets that outlast any single generation. Final image reframes “bargained innocence” as currency still in circulation—Maia awake, considering reply—without moral tag. One abstract clause (“translate pain into a universal language”) is earned by the prior concrete orchestration of teeth, planets, scar.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited sustains a perceptual signature attuned to geological and anatomical topography: “hands could read a slope the way a surgeon reads tissue.” Syntax lengthens under reflection, shortens under climb, mirroring breath. No head-hop; psychic distance shifts are intentional. Free indirect style cleanly slips in/out without filter-verb clutter. Risky phrase “hard softness” is voice-motivated, repeated once at closure with earned authority.</comment>

<comment>Rhythm modulates naturally; figurative language is selective, never more than one image per beat, avoiding purple overload. High information density—each sentence layers firecraft, parenthood, celestial mechanics. Zero loops, scaffold, or synonym churn. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; closing line resolves by image that recharges teeth/planets motif. One minor simultaneity hiccup: “She sat… and opened the box by moonlight” implies instantaneous transition; a micro-beat of retrieval would sharpen sequence.</comment>

<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Firefighter-parent guilt is familiar territory, but the conjunction of lost milk-teeth with a once-in-twenty-year planetary alignment feels inevitable, not grafted. The porcelain reliquary transforms from sentimental prop to narrative accelerant. Risk-taking lies in the accumulative structure—reflection-heavy, plot-light—yet pressure holds. Could nudge higher if the planetary clock had triggered a sharper external constraint (e.g., oxygen running low as planets set).</comment>
