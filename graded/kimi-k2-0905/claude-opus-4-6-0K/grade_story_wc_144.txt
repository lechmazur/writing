<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara’s tactile expertise and refusal of pity are crisply embodied; the welding-flash backstory is seeded exactly where it tilts her present risk. Interior contradiction shows when she chooses to help despite no personal gain—her silence after the ship departs confirms the cost. Yet the moment she “feels” the drone is right is reported, not dramatized, muting the highest-stakes beat. Secondary pressure from Maren is thin; their parting handshake is courteous rather than relationship-altering.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: broken drone → fountain test → calibration fix → maiden voyage. Closure is Earned Stasis: she foregoes spectacle, accepts invisible labor, cost legible in the folding cane and returning mist. Orientation locked by line 50; no teleporting props. Single meaningful tightening at the fountain beats the ship’s deadline. Causality never breaks, but the drone’s first spiral is off-page; showing it would sharpen stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Mist-fountain-rail triad functions as micro-setting that materially refracts light for the repair; depot geography stays coherent in a single tracking shot. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elara’s ears and fingertips: cascading water, humming servo, clanking anchor. Timbers, velvet case, jeweler’s pick supply tactile specificity without inventory bloat. The fountain’s monument backstory is the only static paragraph; trimming it would keep atmosphere mobile.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—ship sails blind unless drone fixed—signaled in first 150 words and tightened by the literal anchor chain. Protagonist agency is absolute: each servo turn is her choice under a live clock. No reversal, but a deepening calibration crisis escalates via sensory translation. Visible price is her forfeited applause; the harbor horn confirms the world’s indifference.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of invisible craftsmanship emerges through the fountain’s broken-journey metaphor and Elara’s unseen calibration; no character lectures us. Subtext in the final “mist closed behind her” quietly equates artisan and depot: both remain, unsung, essential. Ambiguity is productive—reader must decide if her life is diminished or dignified. The hummingbird’s flawless figure-eight is the only overt symbol, but it is earned by labor, not authorial sticker.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited hugs Elara’s tactile cognition: “vibrations through her fingertips,” “click that told her.” Syntax is controlled, rhythmic, never drifts into explaining what she already knows. Dialogue is sparse, indirect, professional; Maren’s careful voice contrasts with Elara’s interior certainty. No head-hop, no filter-verb clutter; perceptual signature is consistent and propulsive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, vivid, musical: “pooled in the hollows between timber sleepers,” “magnetic calm.” No looped phrases, no mixed metaphors. One scaffold spot—“She had learned another way”—could compress, but it doesn’t stall momentum. Strong verbs (clank, hum, fold) carry motion; adjectives are scarce and precise.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Blind engineer repairing optic drone via water refraction is fresh; the depot-as-liminal-shrine angle deepens it. Tropes of wounded artisan and ticking clock are respected but inverted through haptic genius. Transformation test passes: swap Elara’s blindness or fountain for generic lab and logic collapses. Risk is moderate; a sharper societal bite (e.g., exploitative captain) could push higher.</comment>
