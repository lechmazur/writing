<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maren’s grief-fused purpose is palpable; the moment she “sank to her knees among the blowers and wept” crystallizes earned change. Interiority stays concrete—grief as “a single burning wire” rather than label-speak. Micro-choices (pulling the cord, lowering hands) visibly enact the hierarchy: daughter’s laughter > ritual. No contradictory impulse in scene keeps it just under 9 threshold.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands with unmistakable cost: ritual ends, mother collapses, laughter’s return reweights every prior Tuesday. Accumulative lens holds: repeated blower drones intensify until the hourglass grain drops and the tunnel echo releases meaning. Only minor waver: single paragraph of backstory at 30% nudges the 20% BRR line but is anchored to cord-touch and tilts present stance, so no deduction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tunnel as concrete throat, idle blower crescent, softened rubber grip—selective sensory triad anchors and constrains every move. Spatial choreography is clean: engines add voice in sequence, Maren walks the arc, echo returns to kitchen. Micro-setting (Stihl grip molded to Rosie’s hand) charges the final collapse. Environment actively digests sound and reconfigures stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will sound resurrect laughter?—is signaled in para 1 and tightens when “the last grain slips.” Blower throttle + lullaby is the single meaningful intensification that forecloses failure; silence after idling engines is the felt price. Agency stays causal under Accumulative track: ritual accretion, not outside luck, drives the reversal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of tending the unspoken emerges through blower-symphony praxis rather than statement. Final laughter-bird image reconfigures prior silence without moralizing. Subtext in “mournfully eager” colors every beat; no echoing thesis line weakens resonance. Complexity remains: ritual ends, mother must now “learn how to simply live,” a resonant reconfiguration with cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited clings tightly to Maren’s perceptual bias—softened rubber, off-key wind, fossil-exhalation. Syntax grows ragged under pressure (“macerate the melody, chewing each note”) yet stays legible. No head-hop; psychic distance compresses naturally at pull-cord instant. Dialogue absent by design; narrative voice sustains distinct texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene: long languid clauses build drone, abrupt sentence fragments at grain-drop accelerate. Figurative language is selective—three metaphors across 700 words—avoiding density clutter. No synonym loops or paraphrase recurrence. Occasional elevated diction (“macerate,” “conceptual pulp”) fits lyric register without register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Leaf-blower symphony as emotional prosthetic is fresh, specific, and inevitable in hindsight; removal would collapse the story. Transformation of disused train tunnel into sonic digestive organ reframes familiar grief narrative. Risk in blending industrial noise with parental lullaby pays off through earned acoustic climax. No derivative premise penalty; lived detail and acoustic logic individualize the concept.</comment>
