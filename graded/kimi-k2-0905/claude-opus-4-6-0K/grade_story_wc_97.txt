<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elara’s grief-as-key impulse is vivid, but interiority drifts into lyrical summary (“she did not grieve in straight lines”) rather than a micro-choice that changes options. The final endurance—playing past nightfall—reads as poetic stasis, yet the causal cost is only asserted, not dramatized on the body or keys. Strategic creativity is declared, not weaponized under pressure; no visible mistake or trade-off complicates her ascent. The mother-map is motive, but Elara’s present-tense agency remains largely observational until the closing chord.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: film-reel compass pattern → tidal arbor → new composition builds density toward Charged Poise. Orientation is taught early through surreal image, waiving spatial debt. Closure lands as resonant reconfiguration—music threading into night—yet cost is atmospheric, not corporeal or irreversible; no constraint survives the final bar. Causality is poetic rather than tactical, acceptable under lyric accumulative mode.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>“Cathedral of latticed wood and flowering vine” anchors the impossible garden; salt-jasmine air and slow cloud-tide filter through pianist perception. Micro-setting—the weathered upright piano—constrains posture and sound, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is stable; no floating props. Environment mirrors internal lift but never materially resists or wounds her, capping at 8.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: wrest back authorship of time/sound after station silenced her. Pressure tightens through metronomic daylight drain—“until the horizon invited night”—but no external antagonist or resource loss complicates play. Escalation is cadence-based, not option-narrowing; she never risks injury, exile, or broken key. Cost is aesthetic (bruised-steel sky) rather than tangible, keeping tension lyrical but mid-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of time-as-mutable-score emerges via flickering compasses and frozen clock, never stated. Final unplanned encore reweights the seized 7:14 moment into living duration without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: has she escaped or merely extended the measure? Subtext is carried by vine-wrapped piano and salt air, not exposition. Avoids tidy thesis; resonance is felt.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person lyric maintains pianist’s timbral attention—note-hold, dissolution, chord-threading. Syntax stretches into tidal cadence without losing clarity; no filter-verb clutter. Diction stays within poetic musician lexicon. Distinct perceptual signature carries through final nocturne.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm breathes with cloud-tide; sentence length varies naturally. Figurative language is dense but patterned early, earning its lushness. No mixed metaphors or scaffold loops. Information density high—“she planned her grief the way she planned her improvisations”—does double duty. Only hairline slip: “time itself had decided there was nothing left worth measuring” edges toward personification cliché, but fits lyric register.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Floating garden accessed via splice-hidden compasses feels fresh, yet grows organically from pianist’s metronomic worldview. Risk-taking—surreal elevation without sci-fi exposition—pays off in Charged Poise. Transformation test fails: replace pianist with poet and piano with ink, arc survives, but specificity of sound-time linkage saves it. Fresh inflection: using film-splice compass as cartographic metronome.</comment>
