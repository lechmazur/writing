<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s vocation and methods are vivid, but Maren remains a vessel rather than a person; her only micro-choice is the scream that reverts to one voice. Interiority is strong for Elias, yet the possession logic stays abstract—no embodied contradiction shown in Maren under pressure. Closure cost is earned through Elias’s ritual labor, not Maren’s agency, so the arc is lopsided.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: grey circle pulses, scream singularizes, corridors fall into earned silence—visible cost under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality holds: each looped question layers pressure until the anti-shadow stillness unmakes the entity’s logic. Orientation is fixed by word 60; no lens ambiguity at end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The hexagonal anchor, palette, and ash-wine grey are not backdrop—they constrain movement and supply the final image. Silence as décor is tactile, stripped to stone and breath; the muffled tear-sound underwater compresses space. Environment charges the last beat when the circle’s anti-shadow darkens, reweighting the chamber’s breath-held geometry.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—stop possession before completion—is signaled early and tightened by each recursive question that dissolves the entity’s premise. Agency is Elias’s ritual attention; cost is the grey circle’s extinguishing pulse that forecloses the entity’s logic. One visible trade-off: Maren’s restored voice against the hollowed-out chamber.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through praxis: ownership of souls is interrogated by recursive rhetoric until the assumption collapses. Final silence is not peace but examined stillness—conceptual repricing without moralizing. Subtext in the anti-shadow and brown-only eyes reconfigures holiness from emptiness to examined presence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited clings to Elias’s perceptual filter: “threshold of perception,” “negative space where violet should be.” Syntax lengthens during looping, then fractures into pulse and dark—rhythm mirrors tension. No head-hopping; Maren’s voice is heard, not interiorized, preserving distance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “decorated the space with silence” does double duty. No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent (anti-shadow, load-bearing walls). Sentence variety breathes with loop-layering cadence; final paragraph quietens to single-clause calm, ear-tested.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Possession exorcised via philosophical recursion and loop pedal is fresh; ash-wine grey as single-color sacrament reconfigures ritual. Risk—treating metaphysics as acoustics—pays off when silence becomes tactile. No derivative scaffolding; the synthesis feels specific and inevitable.</comment>
