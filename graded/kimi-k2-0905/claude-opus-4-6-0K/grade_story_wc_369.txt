<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maren’s quiet persistence and embodied ritual (climbing, sighting, logging) give her a spare but credible crucible; the final notebook entry is a micro-choice that locks her stance. Interiority stays concrete—she notices warmth, pitch, knee-ache—never drifting into therapy-speak. The flaw is passivity: she observes and records but never risks a visible forfeiture; the trees’ “listening back” is registered, not answered with new action, so the cost feels observational rather than personal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: nightly walks + logged anomalies accrete until the moonlit sextant flash crystallizes pattern. Closure is a Charged Poise—options re-weighted, not changed outright; the cost is conceptual (lifelong patrol accepted) and legible. The missing Decisive Change keeps it below 8.8, but the ending image of her descending into “breathing dark” re-prices the premise with felt fatigue.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setting is lived-in: mortar crumbs under fingernails, ivy tugged, tower stairs counted. The broken sextant and warm wall-stones are micro-settings that constrain method; moonlit oak canopy supplies the final image that re-weights the quest. Spatial anchors arrive by line 4, weather by line 7; no orientation debt. Sensory economy fits a solitary caretaker’s gaze—touch and sound prioritized over vista.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—map sorrow before it drowns her—signals early. Escalation is textural: each nightwalk adds data, each wall-hum adds density; the moonlit convergence is the single tightening that makes trees answer back. Cost is visible only as accumulated knee-ache and surrendered evenings; no live option is foreclosed, keeping it under 8.5. Agency is attention, not intervention—coherent but low-temperature.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the impossibility of finished grief-work; labyrinth and trees stand for perpetual testimony. Subtext lives in objects: cracked mirrors = fractured knowing, oaks = silent absolution. The final line reframes prior 846 entries into a single, unending ritual—an earned, quiet insight without moral tag. Ambiguity lingers: is “listening back” comfort or deeper haunting? Plausible counter-readings hold.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Maren’s perceptual filter—selective attention to cracks, ivy, moon-split light. Syntax is spare, slightly clipped, reflecting a caretaker’s pragmatic mind; occasional lyric surge (“memory folding over itself”) is motivated by nocturnal awe. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. Rhythm modulates: long sentence for nightwalk catalog, fragment for pin-drop—pattern taught and paid off.</answer>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Prose is almost loop-free; only “the way one understands weather” edges toward abstraction but is saved by specificity of “accumulation of seasons.” High density: one sentence often carries sensory data, emotional state, and world rule. Metaphors stay physically coherent—roots as listeners, moonlight as grout—no mixed vehicles. Final line lands cleanly with cadence shift to monosyllables: “She descended… breathing dark.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</question><comment>The “quantified sorrow via broken sextant” premise is fresh, yet the night-watch trope nods to familiar lone-caretaker stories. Oaks-as-witnesses gives a sharp eco-poetic tilt; sextant mirrors healing transiently is a lovely, non-obvious mechanic. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulative structure—but execution stays coherent. Could travel with names changed, but Maren’s tool-kit and bodily ritual are particular enough to leave a trace.</comment>
