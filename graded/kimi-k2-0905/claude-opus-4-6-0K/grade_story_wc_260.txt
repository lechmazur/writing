<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sable’s contradictory impulses—fury at betrayal versus her ingrained reflex to protect—stay alive in scene; the trembling hand, the slow turning of the jar, the deliberate re-reading of the letter all physicalize the split. Her choice to write a new, uncorrupt report is a micro-act that forecloses the easier path of wholesale cynicism or self-erasure, and the cost (she will now labor alone, forever doubted) is legible in the final sentence. Interiority avoids diagnostic labels, instead grounding emotion in workshop smells, starlight, scarred skin. The chameleon tail reprise works as an earned externalization of her own partial regeneration, tightening the arc. Missing a second character keeps the cruciple purely internal; still, the self-to-self pressure sustains.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: Sable’s new notebook is the decisive pivot from borrowed certainty to self-witnessed data, carrying social cost (ostracism, funding loss). Causal linkage holds: because Maren forged data, Sable’s life is dissolved → therefore she strips illusions → therefore she rebuilds on her own evidence. Orientation is anchored within 120 words: hillside workshop, night, open rafters, letter of fraud. One minor cumulative beat could be trimmed (the second “belief that…” sentence), but momentum never stalls. Lens is Causal; every beat tightens options until only solo testimony remains.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The glass-and-starlight workshop functions as micro-setting: jars of skins, resin-capped tail tip, mist that literally wets the page while she works. Starlight through rafters is reused at closure to charge the final image—“quietly vivid in the dark”—so environment constrains visibility and mood. Spatial choreography stays clean: bench, shelves, notebook drawer are tracked without teleport. Sensory economy favors touch (resin shimmer, scarred forearm) over sightseeing. Weather (mist) is not decorative—it breathes through the walls like doubt, forcing her to stay inside and confront the letter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—integrity of her life’s work—arrives with the letter beat 1. Escalation is iterative: each shed layer (denial, innocence, borrowed authority) narrows her future to solitary testimony. The tightening is protagonist-driven: she could quit, forgive, or falsify, but instead chooses the path that guarantees perpetual suspicion. Cost is visible: she positions herself as permanent outcast, starting a ledger no external body will trust. No coincidence mars causality; mist thickens but does not rescue. One meaningful deepening suffices for 700-word scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The theme of partial regeneration emerges organically from the chameleon image and her scarred arm; no character verbalizes “growth after amputation.” Subtext resides in silence: the absent Maren, the animals who will never know they were used. The final image—Sable writing under indifferent stars—reweights the premise: stewardship is not redeemed by institutions but by continued witness. Ambiguity is preserved; we do not know if any species will be saved, only that denial of complicity is no longer possible. No moralizing sentence closes the piece.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Sable; no head-hop. Perceptual signature is scientific-meets-lyric: “biological remnants,” “pigment cells catch and shimmer,” matching a wildlife handler who thinks in taxonomy yet feels in metaphor. Syntax lengthens under reflection, fragments under shock: “She understood she had a choice.” Filter verbs are minimal; when used (“she realized”) they precede an internal pivot that alters tactics. Dialogue is absent, so voice purity rests on narration; it sustains. No corporate register drift; “grant money funneled” is the tersest economic phrase and fits NGO context.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is varied; paragraph lengths visually mimic breath—short when she panics, longer during stripping of illusions. Mixed metaphors are avoided; mist “like breath through parted lips” is single, coherent image. No synonym churn; “shed skins / molted feathers” serves taxonomy precision. One scaffold sentence could compress: “She had believed that compassion was sufficient armor. That trusting others was not weakness but professional grace. That the natural world rewarded honest stewardship.” Repetition is purposeful, patterned like a litany she must dismantle, so allowed. Closing line lands cleanly without artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fraud-in-science is familiar territory; freshness comes from the wildlife-rehab angle and the chameleon tail as literal fragment of self. Choosing calibration notebooks over revenge or whistle-blower theatrics is a quieter, riskier resolution. Risk is taken but not maximal—structure is traditional single-scene arc, voice lyric but not formally experimental. Specific detail (Brookesia micra, resin block) counters template feel. Premise is recognizable; transformation is in the understated refusal to become either cynic or martyr.</comment>
