<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren’s interior contradiction—care that is real yet performance—grounds every beat; the shard micro-choice and the final “mask that was also her real face” crystallize the cost. No secondary character on page, so relationship bullets N/A. Reflection stays anchored to present stimuli and alters her next action (re-hanging chimes), satisfying BRR. Earned Stasis closure: she recommits to the work, pocketing the flare of borrowed light—cost legible, no safety-hedge.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of chime rearrangement + shard image tightens the dominant stake—her own hollowing—until the dawn flare reweights it. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the uncertain ground is affirmed with felt cost (“borrowed light” in pocket). Orientation anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity. Persistent constraint: the hollow shard literalizes her self-transparency and shapes every tactic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lighthouse gallery, wind vectors, and the handled shard function as micro-setting that constrains the only on-page action—chime reordering—and charges the final flare image. Sensory hierarchy (wind, salt, ceramic clink) filters through Maren’s professional attention. Spatial choreography is clean: client path from campfire ash to stair to rail. Environment directly enables the diagnostic method; without wind the beat stalls.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether her service is illumination or obfuscation—signaled in paragraph 3 and deepens via the shard’s “borrowed light” recurrence. One meaningful tightening: rearranging chimes commits her to another session, foreclosing retreat. Cost visible: the flare in the pocket is literally borrowed, not hers. Under Accumulative lens, pattern break (dawn light filling even the hollow shard) reweights the ethical calculus.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete ritual: moral ambiguity as paid service, not sermon. Subtext lives in gesture—re-hanging chimes is a silent contract. Final image reframes the premise: a mirror that reflects nothing can still catch and return light, pricing her detachment. No thematic echo or moralizing; complexity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Maren’s perceptual signature—wind direction, material timbres, shard opacity. Syntax lengthens under reflection, compresses during action; diction (“sincerely insincere”) carries her self-diagnosis without drifting into academic register. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets N/A. Voice modulation clear: calm client mask vs. interior cloth-armor doubt.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; sentences multi-task (wind presses coat flat while dawn bleeds). Figurative control precise—mirror/window paradox sustained without mixed metaphor. Rhythm breathes: long reflective sentences interrupted by tactile micro-actions (unhook, rehang). No artifact touches closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>“Conscience for hire” via wind-chime divination is a fresh synthesis; shard as transparency-of-self object feels inevitable. Risk: lyric accumulative structure instead of causal plot pays off in charged poise. Specificity of materials (bone, ceramic, steel) prevents abstraction. Could not swap chimes or shard without collapsing metaphoric architecture.</comment>
