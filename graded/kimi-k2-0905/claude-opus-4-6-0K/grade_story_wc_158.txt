<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Liora’s insomnia, shyness, and unstoppable drive are shown through her quiet, centuries-long writing; the paradox is stated but dramatized only once. No secondary character appears, so relationship/status bullets are N/A. The final surrender to sleep is earned and visibly costly, satisfying the 9+ quick test despite minimal interior contradiction on-page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: drifting kelp-pages and returning lullabies tighten the pattern until the silence reframes everything. Orientation is swift (cathedral-shell by line 3), one transition (wind change) is clean, and the Earned Stasis closure—“she slept”—carries undeniable cost after 600 years. No causal break or plot amnesia; the postcard’s turning spiral is the charged final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The shell is simultaneously city, cathedral, and writing desk; every sensory pick is filtered through Liora’s bias toward light and layering. The nacre curve literally holds her body at the end, constraining the final choice—satisfies 9+ gate. No spatial drift or white-room syndrome; bioluminescent hues remain consistent anchors.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can poetry transmute grief into a cease-fire? Pressure mounts accumulatively—poems drift outward, orchards sprout, lullabies return garbled—until the Blossom Armistice rewrites the rules without battle. The tightening is the off-key wind itself; cost is paid in Liora’s 600-year wakefulness and her ultimate surrender of vigilance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the photosynthetic metaphor: pain and beauty are one process, indivisible. The galaxy postcard’s final micro-turn—“the spiral seemed to turn”—delivers a Conceptual Repricing that reweights the entire war. No preachiness; the reader feels the moral in the body, not the intellect. Ambiguity lingers: who sent the card, and will the armistice hold?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyric omniscient distance is held steady; diction stays within plausible poet-register (“nacre,” “photosynthesize”) without drifting into thesis-speak. Rhythmic control heightens at closure: short clauses mimic breath slowing into sleep. No head-hopping or filter-verb bloat. Voice feels singular, seasalt-aged, and inseparable from setting.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density: each sentence layers time, metaphor, and sensory hit without scaffold. Figurative language is patterned early (“cathedral abandoned by its god”) and paid off in the final spiral, avoiding overwrite penalty. No synonym loops or template cadence; paragraph cuts are clean. One mixed metaphor (“black radiation of grief”) is minor enough to keep 9+ within reach.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The 600-year poetry-shell that ends war via lullabies is non-obvious and fully committed. Tropes (immortal artist, cosmic postcard) are re-anchored in marine biology and photosynthetic logic. Final image of orchard fruit tasting like “the best lines of the poems she would write when she woke” fuses concept and emotion. Risk-taking elevates coherence rather than obscuring it.</comment>
