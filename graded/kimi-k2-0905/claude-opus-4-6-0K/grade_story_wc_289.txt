<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Maren’s interior contradiction—gifted weaver of other hearts yet word-empty herself—grounds every beat; the spiral nest catalyzes a credible, embodied shift from carrier to self-author. Micro-choice (kneeling, weeping, writing in rain-soaked notebook) externalizes the reversal with visible cost. Occasional “hollowed”/“keeper of secrets” leans toward label-speak, but the embodied payoff in the closing image keeps it above 8.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of reflected light, water, paper strips, and nest twigs layers until a pattern-break (her own first words) reweights the stakes. Closure is a Charged Poise—writing beside the pond—where cost is unmistakable (“carrying the secrets lightly”). No orientation debt; anchors clear by 50 words. One causal micro-gap: installation title “Rejoinder” is revealed late, but the thematic logic is already taught by visual pattern, so no deduction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lotus temple, pond, post-storm channels, and boardwalk are tactile, spatially tracked, and filter through Maren’s drained-alert perception. The spiral nest functions as micro-setting that physically constrains her final stance. Weather residue (dripping eaves, soaked sandals) keeps time alive. No object or environmental detail charges the absolute last line, so stays just under 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—retrieve her own voice—signaled early; pressure escalates via accumulative confrontation with publicized love fragments that mirror her ghosts. One clear tightening: reading the strips forces the recognition that she has been the nest all along; this narrows her options to either keep absorbing or begin externalizing her own material. Cost is felt in the quiet weeping and the first self-authored words; no external antagonist needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete recursion: scattered twigs/paper become shelter, paralleling her career of salvaging broken longings. Final image reframes the same act as self-sustenance without stating a moral. Subtle irony—public art unintentionally exposes her private wound—adds depth. Almost no abstract commentary; the single “thread connecting all things” line is earned by the spiral’s physical logic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person intimate maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature favors shimmer, weave, and refracted light, matching her letter-maker sensibility. Syntax modulates: longer, ribbon-like clauses in openings tighten into fragmentary notations as she writes her own lines. No dialogue, so no voice contamination. Prose rhythm mirrors the widening spiral, teaching the pattern early and paying off in the hushed final cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High-density lines (“lotus blossoms floated fat and glistening”) do double duty—image plus metaphoric load. Few filter verbs; metaphors stay coherent (stone prayer, lantern of silence). One minor scaffold: “She had come here because… / She had written… / She had become…” triple opener slows momentum slightly but is purposeful exposition. No loops or mixed vehicles near closure; final paragraph is crisp, image-driven.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Love-letter ghostwriter as emptied vessel is fresh; pairing with bird-nest installation made of published confessions creates elegant conceptual rhyme. Post-rain lotus venue is familiar but justified by thematic mirror. Risk lies in quiet, reflective arc—no external drama—yet coherence and specificity make inevitability feel earned. Could edge higher with one more idiosyncratic biographical shard.</comment>
