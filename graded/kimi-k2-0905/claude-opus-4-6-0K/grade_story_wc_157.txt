<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is sharp—his rogue charisma, mantis stillness, and refusal to flee all feel idiosyncratic and consistent. The “stand guard” credo is dramatized in the final seed-planting, so the renunciation lands with cost. Micro-choices (feeding notice to compost, whispering the encoded word) show hierarchy of values. Slight reserve: we’re told his charm more than shown it in dialogue, and the 47-member chorus stays offstage, muting relationship crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal chain is tight: tax → cipher → gardens → analyst → counter-spore. Closure is a clean Earned Stasis: Elias plants the seed, accepting inevitable crackdown, cost legible in the whispered word. Orientation locked by line 3. One minor scaffold: “They can tax a thought, but they cannot tax a season” is thematic summary rather than causal turn, slightly softens the final beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Greenhouse humidity, moth-wing rustle, and barcode-stamped paper give tactile immediacy; gourd-seed micro-setting constrains the cipher mechanics and reappears in the final image. City lights warping through glass mirror the bending of surveillance reality. Bureau seal and seed placement rules are learned through action, never dumped. No weather or geographic drift; spatial choreography holds.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—ownership of thought—signals day-one and escalates via analyst overlap. Mid-story tightening: Kritt’s data dive narrows Elias’s options, forcing the spore gambit. Cost is conceptual but felt: Bureau “trying to arrest a garden” shows the absurd price of resistance. Agency stays with Elias; no coincidences rescue.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through seed grammar and tax code: language = property = rebellion. Final image of one seed whispered reweights “growth” from metaphor to actionable sedition, avoiding moralizing. No thematic echo lines in final paragraph. Subtext resides in mantis stillness and seed placement—never explained.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person tight stays locked to Elias; perceptual signature filters every detail through rogue-scholar lexicon (Sumerian poetry, dead tongues). Prose rhythm modulates: long lyrical sentences for teaching scenes, staccato for emergency meeting. No head-hopping. Filter verbs minimal; free indirect clean. Dialogue sparse but when used (“They mean exactly what they look like—growth”) carries subtext and status swagger.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentence variety and propulsion high; no paraphrase loops or template cadence. Figurative language is selective—mantis metaphor recurs with payoff. Opening line hooks voice and concept; final line seeds resonance without overwriting. Minor register lift in “cognitive tax delinquencies” but fits bureaucratic satire. Clean grammar, tense stable, pronoun tracking flawless.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Silent rebellion via living cryptography feels fresh; seed-syntax as untaxable language is an elegant conceptual flip. Bureau vs garden scale mismatch creates absurdistimage that lingers. Risk-taking (horticulture as insurrection) is fully committed, not gimmicky. Could swap names but seed-cipher mechanics are too specific to transplant intact—high transformation.</comment>
