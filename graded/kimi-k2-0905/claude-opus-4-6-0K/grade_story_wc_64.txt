<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marguerite’s quiet, meticulous nature is vividly embodied in every micro-gesture—chess against herself, tweezers on frayed thread—so her interior contradiction (blithe gardener / grave-keeper of secrets) stays concrete. The final resolve to carry the tapestry to the archivist is fully earned: her refusal to seek revenge is foreshadowed by the repeated line “Precision was a form of respect,” and the cost is felt when she presses her palm to the cold sovereign case, accepting the burden of accurate stories. Only the absence of a second on-page character keeps the score from the 9-band; no relationship crucible is available to test her stance under live pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the decoded sentence re-weights every prior beat and the decision to go public is taken with visible cost (“the velveteen gloom…pressed close”). Causal linkage holds throughout—each sovereign, chess clock tick, and thread color tightens options until the final image of her humming rising through the silo mouth reconfigures meaning. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity at exit.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The cobalt silo’s open roof, star column, and rusted nail function as micro-setting that literally frames every action; the cold metal wall she leans against is returned at closure to charge the final image. Thread colors, the brass key, and the photograph’s ghost-like fade are handled in motion, never catalogued. Spatial choreography is immaculate—bodies and objects track cleanly from chess board to tapestry to case.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—accurate naming of historical crime—signals early and tightens once: the northeastern corner’s sentence forecloses the option to stay silent. Cost is legible in the suffocating gloom and the decision to shoulder public risk. No external antagonist appears, but the encoded border itself supplies escalating resistance; one meaningful deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—history as a living garden that must be tended even when the soil is loss—emerges through concrete particulars (roses on children’s plots, threads as ledger). The final reconfiguration invites reflection on who gets a marked grave versus an accurate story, avoiding moralizing. Ambiguity lingers in the indifferent stars, complicating the blithe song.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains tight psychic distance; perceptual signature is saturated with textile and horticultural idiom (“warp from weft,” “wilted flowers”). Syntax modulates from long, looping sentences during reflection to clipped fragments when the decoded sentence lands. No dialogue appears; therefore voice distinction between speakers is not tested. Register stays within Marguerite’s plausible lexicon throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “starlight pooling,” “velveteen gloom,” and “uncharted echoes” each do double duty for atmosphere and theme. No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors; every sentence advances image, motive, or pressure. Rhythm accelerates during the untangling beat and exhales with the final hymn, mirroring her pulse. Clean grammar, precise punctuation, zero scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The woven-cipher tapestry as colonial ledger feels fresh and grows inevitably from the premise; the combination of chess clock, blithe gardener, and decommissioned missile silo is idiosyncratic yet coherent. Risk lies in the quiet ending, but the Conceptual Repricing of “making something gentle grow in a place shaped by loss” justifies the choice. No close echoes of famous scenes; transformation test passes.</comment>
