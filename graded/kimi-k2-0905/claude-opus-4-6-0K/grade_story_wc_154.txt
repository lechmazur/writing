<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lena’s wartime past and coral talisman are concretely anchored; the moment she presses the coral against the cast is a micro-choice that fuses her translator identity with surrogate-parent stake. Interiority stays specific—"old vertigo," "labyrinth of grooves"—and the final decision to stay is earned by the decoded plea. Slight reserve: the broken-arm origin never feeds back into Lena’s choice, so the cost feels one-sided.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each decoded line on the cast thickens thematic density until the final "Tell Lena: stay" reweights Lena’s prior detachment into custodial commitment. Orientation is cleanly anchored within 120 wds; the garden, twilight, and operating-room clock are lucid. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise—with visible cost: she forfeits exit, remains in weeping atrium. No causal break or loophole.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Mist-clad atrium functions as micro-setting: condensation drips echo the hospital’s emotional pressure and mirror glass ceiling weeps in closure image. Glass-mist, stone bench, and reef fragment are tactile, lived-in, filtered through Lena’s translator habit of "reading" surfaces. Spatial choreography is tight—bench → glass ceiling → OR two floors up—guiding her final stillness. Environment plus coral jointly constrain the last image, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will Lena keep running or attach?—is signaled early and tightens with each smudged line she deciphers; the final "Tell Lena: stay" forecloses exit. No external antagonist needed; pressure is situational and textual, accumulating through language failure and surrogate bond. One meaningful deepening suffices and carries felt cost: she trades perpetual flight for guardianship. Escalation is coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme—translation as surrogate parenting and as self-rescue—emerges through coral/cast mirroring rather than statement. Subtext operates in silence: the anaesthetized child above, the weeping glass, the unspoken adoption. Final image of reef on plaster reweights earlier motif so the break literally becomes "doorway." No moralizing, only charged poise; ambiguity about parenthood lingers honestly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited clings to Lena’s perceptual bias—"labyrinth of grooves," "old vertigo"—with rhythmic, controlled cadence that breathes under pressure. No head-hopping; diction stays within her reflective but field-worn lexicon. Filter verbs serve voice ("she felt") without dulling immediacy. Distinct texture and lyric compression taught early remain legible at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and syntax; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is selective—"mist pooled like something alive"—and never clutters high-pressure beats. High information density: exposition folded into action ("decoding smudged writing" reveals stakes, past, and theme). Zero scaffolding; opening and final lines are precise and propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fusing conflict-zone translation with paediatric ward is fresh; coral fragment as brain/memory externalization is specific, not ornamental. Child’s cast as palimpsest of trauma and plea transforms standard hospital drama into linguistic thriller without thriller tropes. Risk resides in quietude—no melodrama—yet coherence holds. Concept feels inevitable once revealed, satisfying transformation test.</comment>
