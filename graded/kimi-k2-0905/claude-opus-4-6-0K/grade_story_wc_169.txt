<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maren’s interior contradiction—rational mathematician building fragile, tide-fated art—drives every micro-choice; the gauge press-in is a credible renunciation that costs her the artifact and completes her arc. No other characters appear, so bullets for status/secondary pressure are N/A. Reflection is anchored to present tactile cues and alters her next move, satisfying BRR. The only softness is a touch of diagnostic self-labeling (“logical dreamer”) in paragraph 1, not repeated at climax.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: embedding the gauge reframes all prior timelines as navigable drafts, not escapable worlds, with the sea’s erasure as visible cost. Causal chain holds—each bead choice flows into the final relinquishment—under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern accretion → curve → release. Orientation clear by line 4; no lens ambiguity. The 3,200-ft callback charges the image with inherited possibility rather than sentimental souvenir.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Tide-polished grotto functions as micro-setting that literally dissolves the art, constraining Maren’s decision to abandon the gauge; the curvature of wall stone dictates the branching pattern she must follow. Sensory triangulation (salt scent, wet reflection, brass chill) is filtered through her physics worldview. Spatial choreography tracked as waterline rises; no impossible positions. The environment evolves in lockstep with escalation, qualifying for 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to keep the gauge as talisman or surrender it to collaborative erosion—tightens once when tide imminent. Escalation is density/cadence shift: beads complete → water creeps → final press-in forecloses retrieval option. Cost is legible future loss of control over pattern; agency remains hers. Coincidence absent; no antagonist needed at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges via reweighted metaphor: trial balloons become tidal beads—test drafts that must be released, not hoarded. Subtext resides in mother’s rice-paper questions now literally dissolved into salt water, answering “hope compounds only if relinquished.” No moralizing sentence; final image of lantern still rising offers resonant non-literal answer. Ambiguity persists: which timeline receives the message? Complexity embraced.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature—mathematical metaphors, geologic time, wave-interference syntax—remains consistent and distinct. No dialogue, so those bullets N/A. Compression taught early (“surfaces that caught light like the inside of a pearl”) and paid off in final luminous spray. No head-hopping; psychic distance stable. Register stays within physicist-poet lexicon; no filter-verb clutter. Rhythm mirrors tide breath—long sentences swell, then fragment at release.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Zero loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; each figurative image (pearl, wave node, paper lantern) is singular and purposeful. High info density—single sentences layer geology, memory, and math. Sentence opening variety avoids monotony. Peak beat (“She pressed it into the wet stone and let go”) is clean, unadorned, letting act carry weight. Minor −0.2 for two adjectival stacks (“salt water pooled in shallow basins”) not strictly needed but not closure-touching.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Freshest synthesis: altitude gauge as both scientific instrument and Buddhist prayer wheel. Risk of letting the sea destroy the art is bold yet coherent; no gimmick. Specificity—rice-paper questions, 3,200-ft marker, interference-pattern bead tree—anchors universals. Could not swap gauge for compass or seashell without breaking causal logic. Transformation test passed.</comment>
