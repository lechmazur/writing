<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Harmon’s interior contradiction—stoic grief turned quiet agrarian insurgency—is vivid and embodied; his seed-and-language ritual is a character-specific gestural vocabulary. The micro-choice to follow a whimbrel’s call, not merely note it, crystallizes values under pressure. Missing is a final beat where his own body registers the cost of refusal to stop; the ending gifts the sprout-life but withholds the toll on him, blunting scale-matching cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/lyric lens: each cross-ecosystem ferrying beat thickens texture until “narrow vastness” re-weights the stakes. Closure lands as Charged Poise: battlefield greening is visible, jetty still blooming, sea still coming—options reconfigured, cost felt in the unended labor. Persistent constraint (dead reef, cracked road) shapes every tactic; no beat resets prior effort. Orientation and causality are clean; seed-pod reveal at ~80 words anchors who/where/when.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Jetty, battlefield, and satchel function as micro-settings that constrain movement and supply material—each seed-scatter is a spatial negotiation. Twilight’s violet glow on salt-stunted vines mirrors interior bruised-light mood without overt symbol. Sensory hierarchy obeys coachman’s habit of noticing road-surface and bird-call first, scent of kelp second—professional filter intact. Only twitch: “bones still surfaced after heavy rain” is evocative but never re-touched to guide later action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—revive dead ground—tightens once: when the soil finally accepts jetty-born amendments, foreclosing the option to abandon. Cost is conceptual acreage reclaimed, yet Harmon’s body pays no new limit (knees, breath, satchel fray) at climax, so price is felt more in land than in man. Bird-call mechanics complicate and enable; coincidence merely guides, never rescues. One meaningful deepening satisfies short-form threshold.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges as reciprocal repair across wounded geographies: tongue-death vs reef-death vs soil-memory-death, all counter-sculpted by persistent micro-gifting. Subtext whispers that treaties outlive speakers if material practice continues; no character sermonizes. Final image of milkweed preparing to split answers the question “what survives language?” with silent diaspora—resonant, unsummarized. Complexity kept: reef stays dead, war bones stay restless, gardener stays mortal and aging.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric adheres to Harmon’s perceptual palette: road-ruts, seed husks, descending bird intervals. Syntax alternates between freighted nominal stacks (“calcium-locked and bitter”) and terse parataxis mirroring coach schedule rhythm. No head-hop; dead-language lexicon stays inside plausible autodidact coachman lore, never erupts into academic register. Compression taught early (“narrow corridor of life jutting into a vastness of gray water”) and paid off in final cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; paragraph cuts land on image pivots, not filler. High density: one sentence often carries seed name, soil chemistry, extinct language, and emotional tint. One scaffold spotted: “for years... for years” anaphora is acceptable as incantatory, but slightly templates. Mixed metaphors avoided; purslane mats and phosphorus algae stay physically coherent. No artifact touches closure line “as though the ancient agreement... had never been broken.”</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fusion of dead-language prayer with shoreline foraging feels non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Risk of lyrical eco-myth is taken without hedging; no eco-catharsis clichés (whales breaching, etc.). Specificity of whimbrel call interval matching temple hymn pitch pattern is the kind of verifiable freshness that resists swapping. Transformation test fails if moved to Iowa cornfield—salt, tide, and battlefield bones are integral. Bold, coherent vision sustained.</comment>
