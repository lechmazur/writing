<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Eamon’s solitary grief and methodical search feel lived-in; the brass-tag gesture at the end shows embodied cost. Interiority stays concrete, never slipping into label-speak. The vow-to-search linkage is clean, so the final collapse reads earned. No contradictory impulses on stage, so the 9+ gate stays just open.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the lanterns’ silent “hum” dissolves the sound/color boundary, paying off Margery’s quest and Eamon’s vow with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain—tag memory → vow → low-tide entry → book discovery—holds without ellipsis gaps. Orientation anchors by line 4; no debt. Lens stays accumulative/textural and lands charged.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Pier, half-submerged hull, and drowned library are filtered through Eamon’s lamplighter eye; every detail does double duty, mirroring grief or guiding motion. Sky-lantern glow becomes the literal color-sound synapse at closure, so environment charges final image. Spatial choreography is flawless; no impossible moves. Micro-setting (brass tag) also constrains the closing beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—find the color of sound—tightens once when lantern light “hums,” forcing the perceptual break that fulfills the vow. No reversals needed under accumulative lens; the single deepening is decisive. Cost is felt in the weeping final image. Agency is observational but still forecloses future searching, so option narrows.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the fusion of light and sound via particularized grief; no moralizing statements. The brass tag and lantern glow reweight from souvenir to proof, giving conceptual repricing without abstraction. Ambiguity lingers—does he “hear” or only see?—inviting reflection. Final image of tears in a named color offers non-literal answer to the central question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-limited clings to Eamon’s perceptual bias: lamplighter’s eye for glow, salt-stained textures, synesthetic echo. Syntax lengthens and quiets under grief, mirroring the meteor hush. No head-hop; psychic distance stable. Diction stays within his coastal working-man lexicon until the final luminous coinage, a justified lift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and rhythm; no template cadence or filter-verb stacks. Figurative language is selective—jaw-unwilling hull, lantern ribs—never clogging high-pressure beats. High density: each line advances atmosphere, memory, or action. Zero loops, typos, or mixed metaphors; closure image remains crystal.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Synesthetic color-sound via drowned ship library feels fresh, anchored in specific maritime detail rather than gimmick. Brass tag as keepsake-turned-bookmark reconfigures souvenir logic. Risk taken with quiet observational climax, but accumulated glow pays off. Not quite 9+ because premise edges familiar grief-archive territory, albeit elevated.</comment>
