<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lena’s interiority is concrete—her smell-loss grief anchors every beat; the final “it was enough” is an earned renunciation with visible cost. Micro-choices (polishing, pouching the screw) reveal shifting values under pressure. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, only recalled, so the 9+ bar is missed by a hair.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Lena accepts surrogate perception in lieu of scent, felt cost in the trembling-hand beat. Causal chain intact—screw discovery → story told → pouch gift → stance shift. Accumulative lens holds: fog, drip, and screw images layer until meaning reweights. No orientation debt; transitions clean.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Copper basin, canal fog, and clamp screw function as micro-setting that constrain choice and charge the final image. Selective sensory detail (patina, drip vibration) filters through Lena’s damaged perception. Fog evolves from external blanket to metaphor for occluded views, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recovering connection—signaled early; escalation occurs via pattern break: first successful “reading” of an object births a client’s origin story, tightening her new purpose. Cost is legible when she surrenders the relic she longs to keep. No visible constraint that alters later tactics; hence stops short of 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of finding miracles in plain residue emerges through dramatized particulars, never stated. Subtext pulses in silent screw hand-off and fog-weep simile. Final image reweights prior scent-loss without moralizing. Minor dock for thematic echo phrase “ordinary miracles,” but resonance dominates.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature filters world through tactile precision and anosmic absence. Rhythm modulates—long fog-draped sentences contract to clipped “It was enough.” No dialogue to test. Free indirect melts cleanly into italics-free thought.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Strong sentence variety, high information density; figurative language is selective, never suffocates beats. One paraphrase loop (“water…water…”) in drip description costs −0.2. No mixed metaphors or scaffold. Read-aloud rhythm supports hush cadence; closure image remains lucid.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Scent-loss aromatherapist + water clocks births fresh conceit; midwife screw as mnemonic seed is specific and non-obvious. Transformation test passes—plot hinges on anosmic perceptual pivot. Risk lies in quiet lyric arc; earns +0.3. Slight deduction for familiar fog-as-veil trope without further twist.</comment>
