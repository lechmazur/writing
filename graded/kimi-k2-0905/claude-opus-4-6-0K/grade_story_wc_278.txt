<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Maren’s contradictory impulses—desire to erase ancestral guilt vs. fear of confronting it—surface in the amber moment; the renunciation of “tether no more ghosts” carries inherited cost visible in the drained dissonance. Interiority stays concrete via constellation arms, fly in resin, spectrograph tears. The micro-choice to feed letters into the Loom (risking resurgence of the cry) crystallizes values. Flaw: tattooist past is ornamental, never weaponized under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the counter-wave cancellation costs Maren her role as keeper and the laboratory’s raison d’être; silence is legible, irreversible. Causal chain—cry parsed → letters read → amber deployed → frequencies cancel—holds without gaps. Orientation anchored by word 78 (“basement of a building”). Minor elasticity: “time folded” is taught metaphorically, not ruled, so lens stays Accumulative/Textural to the end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Laboratory constraints—haunted Loom, ghost tape, antique escritoire—directly shape the possible tactic (spectrograph the letters). Amber micro-setting recharges final image. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: inked constellations tingle against cold metal, resin warms under palm. No spatial drift; objects track cleanly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—quiet the inherited cry—signaled paragraph 3. Single deepening: apology translated into counter-frequency forecloses option to keep listening; price is the laboratory’s silence and keeper identity. Pressure stays coherent under Accumulative lens; no reversal needed. Could sharpen tangible cost earlier (e.g., Loom devours part of her tattoo ink as fuel) to reach 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of witnessing vs. erasure emerges through spectral recordings, unsent letters, fly trapped in amber—no declarative statement. Final meteor hush image reweights grandmother’s maxim: preservation can mean letting go. Ambiguity lingers—silence may be peace or amnesia—without confusion. Only deduction: tattooist motif unused thematically.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Lyric third-person hovers close to Maren’s perceptions; perceptual signature in star-mapped skin, resin warmth, firmware whispers. Syntax lengthens during discovery, collapses into short clauses at cancellation (“Silence filled…”). No head-hopping; dead engineer stays off-page legend. Filter verbs (“she understood”) minimal and motive-driven. Dialogue absent—appropriate for solitary descent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose alternates between propulsive compression and lyrical flare without overcrowding high-pressure beats. Mixed metaphors avoided; “meteor hush” recurs with earned variation. No loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“escritoire,” “phonemic clusters”) fits archivist POV. One paraphrase loop (“each one failing, each one folded”) tolerated because it mirrors obsessive letter ritual.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fusing haunted firmware, baby-cry parsing, and inherited apology letters yields a fresh emotional spectrogram rarely seen. Conceptual risk—time folding as felt elasticity, not sci-fi rule—heightens meaning without obscuring stakes. Fly-in-amber reconfigured from souvenir to cancelation totem feels inevitable in hindsight. Tattooist angle remains untapped, preventing 9.5.</comment>
