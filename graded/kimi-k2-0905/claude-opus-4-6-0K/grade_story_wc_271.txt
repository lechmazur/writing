<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Nasreen’s interior contradiction—planting life while carrying annihilation—is rendered in embodied micro-choices (shears frozen mid-cut, lemon-oil pearl). The photograph’s weight against her ribs keeps past trauma live in present muscle tension, earning the final steady-handed renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens: each sensory layer (salt wind, lemon oil, wren song) tightens the stake of staying present. Closure lands as Charged Poise—she finishes the cut, garden awake, fog thinning—cost felt in the lingering jacket-square of trauma that still presses.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The cliff-perched arboretum functions as micro-setting: windbreak saplings she planted now shelter her back while she prunes, the lighthouse husk below mirroring her own outlived purpose. Monterey cypress and lemon oil supply immediate tactile anchors that constrain and enable the final stillness.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can she stay grounded when sound triggers freeze—is signaled in paragraph four and deepens through sensory accretion. Helicopter beat forces the single tightening; option to flee is foreclosed by the pearl method, price paid in visible breath-lock and shears suspended.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: survival is not erasure but simultaneous holding of annihilation and growth. Final image—steady hands moving to next tree—offers non-literal answer: optimism is anchored exactly because the photograph remains crumpled in pocket, not despite it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains precise perceptual signature: horticultural lexicon, salt-taste soil, therapist phrase “somatic markers” filtered through her skepticism. Rhythm modulates—long reflective sentences interrupted by clause-free cuts “She breathes. She finds it: the pearl.”—mirroring freeze/release cycle without head-hop.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances pressure or texture. Figurative control disciplined—“pearl of stillness” coined once and re-earned through lemon oil scent. High density: “roar of the sea...landed in her chest like concussion” compresses environment, physiology, memory in ten words.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fusing drone-survivor trauma with coastal gardening yields fresh angle on resilience trope. Specificity—grafting pear onto quince, cyclamen in brine-soil—transforms familiar PTSD narrative into irreducible lived algorithm. Risk of lyric freeze-frame paid off as structural refrain rather than ornament.</comment>
