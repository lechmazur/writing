<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Liora’s contradictory need to empty herself of others’ silence and regain her own voice is concrete; the final seated surrender under the aurora embodies an earned, visible cost. Reflection never eclipses present choice: aligning the astrolabe, lowering it, sitting—each micro-action tilts her stance. Flaw: the “rest” epiphany edges toward label-speak (“not the rest of surrender…”) and could carry more embodied contradiction at the instant of decision.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative-textural lens: sediment of silence builds until the aurora rinse lifts it, yielding a resonant reconfiguration—her emptied interior now “canvas.” Causality holds: star-path navigation → arch → astrolabe → light-flood → release. Closure beat situates cost on-page: “emptiness inside her felt…ready.” No orientation drift; anchors (who/where/when) land by line 4. Minor loop: “light above” / “colored light above” in same graf slightly dulls the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Environment doubles as tool: the aurora-lit arch literally funnels light into her chest, forcing the creative purge. Selective sensory triage—meteor scent of lavender-smoke linen, brass warming in palms—keeps scope lyric yet tactile. Spatial choreography stays coherent across the single continuous scene. The arch’s rule-set (light as purgative conduit) remains consistent and charges the final image, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—liberate her own creativity—signaled line 1 and tightened once: silence sediment must exit before new work enters. Escalation is density-based, not reversals: each absorbed unspoken thickens the block; aurora rinse thins it. Protagonist agency drives the last beat—she chooses to sit and let light work. Cost visible: “spaces…trembling with potential” shows forfeiture of immediate output for future fertility.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of creative fallowness emerges through sensorial pattern—sediment, calcification, field lying fallow—rather than thesis. Final “canvas” reweights earlier “calcified” metaphor without moralizing. Subtext resides in gesture: sitting in light is both submission and sowing. Ambiguity lingers—she may still fail to paint—keeping complexity alive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: sky “exhalations of sleeping gods,” astrolabe “blackened brass,” attention filtered through painterly synaesthesia. Rhythm modulates—long lyrical cadence under aurora, shorter clauses at decision (“She lowered…sat”). No dialogue, so voice coherence rests in controlled lyric distance; it holds. Compression (“time unmeasured, uncounted”) taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong information density: one sentence often paints + reveals emotion (“accumulated silence…calcified around her imagination”). Metaphors stay physical and consistent (sediment, calcify, field, canvas). Minor scaffold: “light above…colored light above” could trim. No filter-verb stacks; prop tracked throughout. Final graf starts with three “she” openers—slight drumbeat but does not touch closure clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Familiar “artist unblocked by mystical nature” arc is refreshed via astral navigation geography and aurora-as-loofa conceit. Astrolabe heirloom plus meteor-tracking map gives tactile specificity. Risk taken in quiet, interior resolution—no triumphal painting—yet cost is felt. Not radically novel, but synthesis feels personal rather than template.</comment>
