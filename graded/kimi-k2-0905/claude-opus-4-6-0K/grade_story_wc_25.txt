<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maren’s ear-centered identity is concrete and embodied; her decision to whisper acceptance is the earned micro-choice that forecloses her old solitary life. The contradictory pull between safety and trust is kept alive in-scene. Cost is legible: she commits to an unseen rebuild with no exit guaranteed. Voice stays specific, never drifting into label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: maps → key → corridor → whispered yes, each step tightening options. Closure is a Charged Poise—she steps into collaboration with the literal storm overhead as audible constraint. Cost is felt in the final line: “It carried perfectly” implies she’s now audible to every ear in the maze, including those she once evaded. No teleporting props; all objects are tracked.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Container walls groan at a pitch she uses as compass; the aurora hums in her teeth—environment actively shapes navigation. The origami map is handled, flipped, creased, guiding each turn; its changing folds mirror the shifting corridors. Micro-setting (rust thickness, grating underfoot) constrains speed and stealth. Final image of vibrating metal recharges the opening “listen” motif.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she risk her solitary craft for an unknown alliance—is signaled by line 3. Mid-story tightening occurs when the key fails every lock, forcing her to decide whether to keep going on trust alone. Whispered acceptance narrows future options: she can no longer remain invisible. Cost is visible: she exposes her presence to a stranger in a power-out maze.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme—listening as subversive agency—emerges through routed action, never exposition. The whisper/shout binary reweights at closure: her quiet assent travels farther than any shouted refusal could. No moralizing; the aurora-lit tuning-fork image supplies conceptual repricing. Ambiguity remains: rebuild for whom, at what risk?—invites reflection without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Maren’s perceptual grid: every descriptor is something she can hear, feel, or weld. Syntax lengthens during aurora flare to mimic vibration, then clips to a whisper. No head-hopping; the stranger’s motives remain opaque because Maren’s ears can’t parse them. Distinctive diction—“toe-catch,” “corrugated canyons”—anchors voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances position, sound, or stakes. Figurative control is tight: “aurora-lit tuning fork” is the only metaphor cluster, deployed at climax where it pays off. No filter-verb stacks; verbs are strong (“groaned,” “threading,” “pressing”). Opening and closing lines book-end with sonic imagery, creating cadence symmetry.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The ear-navigator in a shipping-container maze during a geomagnetic storm is a fresh synthesis; no genre template matches it. Origami maps that show corridors “that don’t exist yet” introduce ontological instability without breaking causality. Whisper-as-power inverts the usual shout-to-survive trope. Specificity of welding jargon and footfall acoustics prevents abstraction.</comment>
