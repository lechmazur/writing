<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s exile-born purpose—“beauty in the difficult”—is embodied in the tactile ritual of the worry-stone and the chess-letter gambit; the interior contradiction between loyalty to her former pupils and the need to expose their House is felt but never baldly declared. The four-year ellipsis is the only beat where micro-choice is off-page; otherwise every motion (mapping anomalies, placing letters, pressing the dent) manifests her precision. Cost is legible: she forfeits any chance of personal pardon by weaponizing the very pedagogy that once secured her place. Closure leaves her in charged poise—powerless to force play yet culpable if violence follows—so the renunciation is earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the letters constitute a “quiet move” that crystallizes risk for both sides; the cost—permanent exposure, no retreat—is visible in the final line “the old covenant waited to be read aloud again.” Causal chain holds: because she translated silence → exile → mapped nexus → mailed coordinates; each step narrows options. Orientation is anchored by word 80 (“basalt outcrop where the field lines converged”); no debt. One reflective block (<20%) is cued by the stone’s dent and tilts present stance. Lens is Causal; escalation is a single tightening—letters gone before moon shows—sufficient for 700-word range.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The nexus is not backdrop; magnetic anomalies literally supply the hiding place for the pre-Covenant text and dictate the courier’s route (“a traveler would pass this outcrop tomorrow”). Twilight color progression mirrors emotional turn from bruise to hopeful amber, but filter is character-anchored (“color of a bruise healing into amber” seen by Elara, not author cam). The worry-stone functions as micro-setting: its dent tracks elapsed exile and pins the letters against the wind in the final beat. Sensory selection favors iron-taste and violet light—POV-specific, never catalogue.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can the buried covenant re-enter the world—faces one decisive tightening: once the letters leave her hand, Elara’s agency collapses into wait-and-see; the price (irreversible exposure) is paid on-page. No reversals needed; the “before the next phase” moon-clock supplies escalating deadline. Internal/external stakes interlock: her love for the daughters versus the larger territorial justice. Pressure is coherent under Causal lens; coincidence absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—systems of power hide inside patterns that appear natural—emerges through the land’s magnetic memory rather than editorial. Subtext resides in the chess problems: what seems a pedagogical gift is a Trojan map. Final image reweights silence from weakness to weapon without moralizing. Beauty is discovered in difficulty, but the cost is danger to former pupils, complicating any easy triumph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Free-indirect prose carries a geologist’s precision fused with chess-player patterning: “Iron in the basalt held the memory…” Rhythm modulates—long sentence for exile history, staccato coda for letters. No dialogue; therefore no voice convergence. Perceptual signature is consistent: magnetic fields, violet spectrum, dent as timepiece. Psychic distance tightens predictably to the final beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences perform double duty: “She had spent her exile years not in bitterness but in careful work” advances both motive and montage. Metaphors are sparse, land-based, and coherent—“magnetic wind,” “compass holds north.” No loops, no filter-stack, no scaffold. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line cadence resolves on image that recharges worry-stone and covenant motifs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fantasy trope of “ancient text will save the realm” is inverted: the mentor weaponizes pedagogy itself, embedding coordinates in chess problems. Magnetic geology as archival medium feels fresh yet plausible within invented world. Synthesis of chess, geomagnetism, and suppressed treaty creates an idiosyncratic constellation hard to transplant unchanged. Risk—no on-page confrontation—pays off via lyric Charged Poise ending.</comment>
