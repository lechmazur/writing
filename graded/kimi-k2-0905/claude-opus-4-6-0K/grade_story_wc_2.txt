<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Maren’s interior contradiction—precision vs. improvisation—drives every gear-click; the pivot from “meticulous life” to pocketing the compass without a plan is embodied in ash-smudged fingers and a single, unmapped breath. Cost is felt: she forfeits her identity as repairer-of-the-past and accepts being the maker-of-something-unknown. No secondary character on page, so relationship bullets skipped; the lone-POV crucible holds.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Decisive Change: the needle abandons north and points down, foreclosing the surface world. Causal chain intact—each clock breadcrumb mechanically necessitates the next; no teleporting props. Orientation anchored by word 110 (“caverns beneath the old naval academy”). One shard transition (workshop → greenhouse → workshop) taught early and paid off in the final descent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Subterranean waterfall’s humidity dictates rust-reading tactics; later the same water’s roar masks the click of the assembled compass, literally drowning her old certitude. Greenhouse ash supplies both the hiding medium and the tactile proof of arson, charging the final image. Micro-setting (compass pivot) constrains the macro move downward. Spatial choreography clean—no impossible planter-to-tunnel distances.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will Maren keep restoring the past or risk forging the unknown?—tightens when the compass needle locks “down,” obliterating retreat. Escalation is Accumulative: each fire-scarred clock increases pattern density until improvisation becomes the only surviving tactic. Felt price: she abandons her life’s methodology on the bench beside the final gear.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-declaratively: broken instruments refuse restoration and demand re-creation. The ash-to-needle trajectory reweights “broken” from defect to blueprint. No thesis line; final image of following a non-cardinal direction offers resonant, non-moral answer. Micro-motif of carbon residue carries from clocks to admiral’s papers to Maren’s fingerprints, accruing rather than decorating.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Maren’s perceptual filter—“mathematics of failed machinery” diction persists even in lyric lifts. Waterfall’s white noise rendered as “patient thunder” shows rhythmic control without purple drift. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets skipped. Free indirect cleanly handles “She was learning to befriend uncertainty…” without filter-verb clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Zero loops; sentences vary in length and opening strategy. Information-dense: one line does description, metaphor, and causal cue (“ash from documents, she realized, papers someone had burned here deliberately”). Figurative vehicles (rust as storytelling, leaves as slow cyclones) stay internally coherent. No scaffold; each paragraph advances knowledge or reconfigures option space.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: maritime espionage told through horological forensics. Compass rose reappears not as nostalgic relic but as living bearing that subverts cardinal geography. Risk taken—static objects propel plot—pays off because causality remains mechanical, not magical. Could not swap clocks for generic devices without collapsing logic.</comment>
