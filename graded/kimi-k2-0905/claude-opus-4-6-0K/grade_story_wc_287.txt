<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Maren’s interiority is concrete—her finger on the gauge tooth, the tactile planting of mirrors—yet the “wistfully pragmatic” label is asserted more than dramatized in micro-choices. The final stance crystallizes under pressure, but the emotional contradiction between hope and resignation could be sharpened on the page rather than summarized. Still, her hierarchy of values (light for others over blossoms for herself) is legible and paid for.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the scattered mirrors reconfigure the alley’s darkness with visible cost—she forfeits the last bloom and her private ritual becomes public gift. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each mirrored shard tightens the pattern until the final image reweights meaning. Causality is intact; no teleporting props or retroactive fixes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Harbor, fire-escape, alley, and rose-root micro-settings all constrain angle and reflection; the mirror placement is physically grounded and charges the final image. Sensory selection favors touch and glint over panoramic vistas, keeping economy tight. One decimal off perfect only because the alley’s prior “light never reached” is slightly softened by the ease of moonlit penetration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—light versus loss—signals early and tightens once: the petal falls, mirrors rise, foreclosing her hope of keeping the last bloom. The cost is felt in the forfeited blossom and the exposed gift. Escalation is single-cycle but sufficient for 750 words; no reversal, yet pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through mirrored light as communal care; no explicit thesis. The final image reweights the rosebush from private memorial to public lantern, offering resonant ambiguity about what gardens can be. Avoids sentimentality by keeping the act small, the cost real.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Maren’s perceptual filter—moon as cupped palm, rhythm of oars in her joints—without head-hop. Syntax lengthens during reflection, shortens during mirror placement, mirroring tidal cadence. One notch off only for two near-abstract phrases (“tender and immense,” “tidal time”) that slightly over-tell.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or action. Figurative language is sparse, patterned, and paid off—moon-blade, cupped palm, scattered seeds of light—without cluttering the climax. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with the oar-beat cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Familiar grief-garden trope is refreshed by the mirror-in-soil conceit and the lock-bit heirloom as precision-metaphor. Synthesis feels inevitable: key-cutting and light-bending both require exact angle. Risk is quiet but sufficient; no gimmick, just specific transformation.</comment>
