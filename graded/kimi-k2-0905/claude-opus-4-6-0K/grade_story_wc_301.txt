<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Maren’s contradictory need for raw sensation yet fear of its cost is embodied in every beat (crunching glass, tasting green air). The micro-choice to copy graffiti into the logbook marries her scientific self to the river’s non-apology, making the final line earned. Cost is visible: she forfeits the shield of numbness and accepts serrated aliveness. Voice remains particular; no diagnostic clichés intrude.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each object (ivy, bellows, iris, graffiti) adds density until the final reconfiguration—“I am learning to be the river again”—reprices the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation is anchored by 120 words; transitions are legible within the single shard. Closure lands as Charged Poise: options narrow to motion southward, carrying the burden of unapologetic becoming.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The station’s ivy curtain forces her to part it with both hands—setting constrains action. Bellows reprise at close, charging the final image with “still trying to breathe.” Limestone bed, shattered porcelain, yellow iris all filter through her chronicler’s gaze, guiding the choice to follow the water. Micro-setting (journal, taped lungs) functions as extension of body and stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—permission to feel without self-condemnation—tightens when graffiti reframes forgiveness as return-to-motion. One deepening suffices: silt-raised iris proves damage can flower, foreclosing the option to retreat into numbness. Cost is legible in the “painfully alive” air she chooses to keep breathing. No external antagonist needed; internal contradiction supplies pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: river as non-apologetic process, iris as damage-made-beauty, bellows as severed lungs still breathing. Final line offers resonant conceptual repricing without moralizing. No thematic echo violations; graffiti wisdom is discovered, not preached. Ambiguity remains—she may yet drown in rawness—but the stance is crystallized.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is consistent: scientific taxonomy collides with synesthetic texture (“colors throb,” “air tasted green”). Rhythm modulates—long cadence for exposition, clipped fragments for sensation peaks. No head-hopping; single POV holds. Diction stays within lexicon of field-scientist turned self-witness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence performs dual work (e.g., “ivy had taken the station the way rivers take valleys” fuses setting, metaphor, foreshadowing). Figurative control precise; no mixed metaphors. Information density high—every sensory detail also advances interior stake. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with escalating pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Familiar recovery arc is re-angled through river chronicler’s data-logic grafted onto graffiti koan. Accordion bellows as severed lungs feels fresh and inevitable. Risk taken: lyrical accumulative structure rather than causal plot; pays off in charged poise closure. Specificity of map-grid plus flood-silt botany anchors universals.</comment>
