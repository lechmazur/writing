<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is vivid—“the space where an apology waits unspoken” is character-specific—but the emotional turn “fierce tenderness of someone who writes fury because love is too frightening” drifts into diagnostic abstraction. The renunciation (delivering all letters by hand) is earned by the moonlit shard beat, so the arc lands with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the shard’s healing under moonlight reweights the premise and sends Lira toward Cael; cost is the swallowed earliest/angriest letter. Causal lens holds throughout—every beat is a therefore-link from Maren’s instruction to the gargoyle mouth to the opened channels at the end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mangrove canopy, black water, and aerial roots are selective, pressure-filtered, and the gargoyle shard functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean: pole, boat, roots, moonbeam gap track without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she send the letters—tightens when condensation writes Cael’s unspoken messages back to her; the moment forecloses the option of perpetual silence. Cost is legible: the earliest/angriest letter is literally fed to stone, a non-reversible surrender of pride.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: brokenness healed by being held in the right light. No moralizing; the final image of thirteen more hand-delivered letters extends the shard’s logic without spelling a lesson.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyric-accretive voice (“Spanish moss made of sound”) is taught early and paid off at the end when spirits sing “almost like her sister’s laugh.” No head-hopping; psychic distance stays tight to Lira.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density—each sentence layers metaphor, action, and emotional cue. No loops or scaffold; figurative layering is purposeful, not purple. One micro-slip: “fierce tenderness that almost buckled her knees” edges toward cliché but is absorbed by surrounding originality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: mangrove gothic + epistolary ghost-condensation + moon-healing gargoyle shard. The swamp-cathedral juxtaposition feels inevitable in hindsight; risk deepens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Maren only seeds the quest; she makes no on-page choice that alters tactics. Setup only, no development or closure participation—cap 4.6 applies.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Handled in three beats—discovery, moon-healing, swallowing the letter—and directly shapes the closure image; without the shard the letter has no conduit and the story logic collapses.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Unsent letters are the invisible antagonist; the concept governs every interior beat and is finally externalized via condensation and the shard-mouth. Removing it deletes the central conflict.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Moon-healing enables the shard to become a functional postal throat; the trait is signaled early and its single use is decisive—without it the crack stays open and the metaphor fails.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Evoke is the hinge beat: condensation letters appear only after Lira holds the healed shard toward the spirits’ song. The action redefines her options from silence to reply.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Condensation-messaging is the only channel Cael can speak through; mechanics are taught early (beading moisture) and deliver the “Come home” command that ends the stalemate.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Labyrinth physically traps then releases Lira; spirits’ song cues the condensation. Removing the singing canopy would break the message mechanism and the spatial opening at the end.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>“Before the moon finds you” sets a soft clock; moonrise heals the shard and triggers the message window, forcing the decision now—not later—so time actively narrows options.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lira’s desire to locate the pre-decision instant drives her to pick the earliest, angriest letter; the motivation is dramatized in the beat where she folds it into stone, accepting the cost of that raw moment.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fierce tenderness saturates every beat—from her shaking hands to the shard “remembering its original shape”—and modulates into the final hopeful push toward Cael’s door, charging the closure image.</comment>
