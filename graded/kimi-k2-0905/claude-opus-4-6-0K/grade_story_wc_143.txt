<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s “purposefully curious” tag is shown more than told—her decision to haul a 70-year-old camera up a mountain at 3 a.m. proves it. Interiority is concrete (“the ache of loving something precisely because it was leaving”) and her micro-choice to seal the canisters under rushing mirror-light costs her the very darkness she mourns. Still, we get no contradictory impulse in-scene; she never hesitates or contemplates abandoning the ritual, so the arc is pure resolve rather than tested character. Competence dominates struggle—no visible mistake or flaw compounds—and that flattens the crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The closure is a textbook Charged Poise: shutter clicks, mirrors ignite, darkness is foreclosed, and the grain-of-sand image reweights the entire premise with undeniable conceptual cost—earned because every beat proceeded from her fixed intention. Causal linkage is clean: because the Accord deadline is immutable, therefore she climbs, exposes, and deposits messages; no off-stage shortcuts. Orientation locked by line 4; only one minor lens wobble (mid-story lyric pause) but pattern is paid off at final image, so waiver holds. The persistent constraint—engineered daylight—shapes every tactic and survives the ending, satisfying the 9+ cost test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The summit is rendered through cold basalt under boot, windless hush, and the visible grid of lunar mines—selective, urgent, and filtered by a professional eye. The Hasselblad and the grain-of-sand vial function as micro-setting: both are handled, re-examined, and finally abandoned, charging the last image. Spatial choreography is flawless—switchback, hut, tripod, cairn—no impossible moves. One minor gap: we never feel altitude (breath, cold, dizziness) so the mountain never threatens; that keeps it under 9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve evidence of natural darkness—announced paragraph one and tightens exactly once when orbital mirrors snap on, collapsing her option to record another night. The reversal is external, not from her agency, yet the story lets her answer with the sealed canisters, so a micro-renunciation keeps closure active. Cost is legible (she descends into eternal light) but the beat of defeat happens *to* her; she doesn’t adapt tactics under fire, only continues the planned ritual. Enough for the band, not the razor-edge 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme—mourning the eradication of unknowing—emerges through mirrored light, chemical clocks, and the hourglass relic; no character sermonizes. The final image (grain glowing in perpetual day) reweights the premise without moralizing, delivering a conceptual repricing. Ambiguity is preserved: reader must decide whether her archive is futile or prophetic. A hair shy of 9 because the middle paragraph’s lyrical pause on “dawnlit melancholy” veers toward naming the theme it has already shown.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited holds tight to Elara’s perceptual tilt—geologic time in “basalt that had been cooling since before anyone thought to name it,” camera-era nostalgia, lunar grids visible to her eye alone. Syntax lengthens and quiets to mimic held breath, then fractures into short clauses at 0547 when gold slashes the ridge—rhythmic control under pressure. Not a single filter verb cluster; diction stays within her educated but non-acoustic lexicon until one poetic coinage (“dawnlit melancholy”) that reads earned. No dialogue, so no voice contamination; prose *is* character.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry triple duty (action, metaphor, back-story) without congestion; opening line anchors era, terrain, and camera relic in twenty-one words. Metaphors are coherent—the sky “split,” light “flung”—and disappear before they clutter. One paraphrase loop: “measuring their vigil one gravity-pulled moment at a time” echoes the earlier gravity-patience pairing; minor, but it nicks the 9-band. Otherwise zero scaffold, zero register drift, high-density lyric clarity that breathes with the exposure timer.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Combines lunar orbital mirrors, antique Hasselblad, and a 1923 hourglass grain—synthesis feels inevitable yet unseen before. The speculative frame abolishes night for profit, but the emotional engine is private grief for darkness—fresh angle on eco-loss. Risky long exposure of six minutes in flash fiction is fully justified by on-page timing and closure. Transformation test fails only if you swap the camera or the relic; both are irreplaceable, proving organic invention rather than ornament.</comment>
