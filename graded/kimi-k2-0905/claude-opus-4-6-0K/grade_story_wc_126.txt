<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren’s lonely refusal to finish her score is embodied in tactile micro-choices (rosin, bow, fire); the final smile is earned by the causal chain that lets silence keep its shape. Interior contradiction—yearning for resolution yet cherishing incompleteness—drives every beat. No second character on page, so relationship/status bullets skipped; head-count waiver applies. Persistent constraint (unhealable hush) costs her audience forever, visible in the dropped apple only she hears.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of subtracted sound → partial phrases → acceptance. Orientation anchored by word 30 (“greenhouse had sunk”). Closure = Earned Stasis: she stops mid-phrase, smiles, and the silence is left sovereign—a legible before/after with felt cost (permanent solitude). Causality intact: because the rainforest burned, insects vanished, she cannot fake closure. No teleporting props; bowl and violin tracked throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Greenhouse glass, salt film, and tidal breath are filtered through Maren’s acoustic bias; every surface density bends pitch, constraining her playing choices. Shipwreck ribs function as boundary markers that literalize the hush. Micro-setting (mendicant’s bowl) recharges final image when notes fall into it like coins. Spatial choreography holds as she moves from bench to fire to wreck-side; no floating rooms.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: whether to finish the score and defeat silence. Mid-story deepening: she realizes false cadence = dishonesty; option narrows to letting silence co-exist. Agency visible when she intentionally stops mid-phrase and smiles—cost is permanent audience of none. Pressure escalates via accrual of missing species and unfinished bars; no coincidence required.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges: beauty resides in deliberate incompleteness. Motif of unfinished—score, orchard, harbor—accumulates then crystallizes in final smile without moralizing. Subtext in apple’s unheard fall: value exists even when only the performer perceives it. No thematic echo or final-paragraph thesis statement; resonance is imaged, not asserted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited clings to Maren’s acoustic synesthesia; diction—“temperature of the air it rode”—is character-specific. Rhythm breathes with bow strokes and fire crackle; no template cadence. No dialogue, so bullets skipped. Psychic distance tightens under violin phrase, then widens to tidal breath; shift is purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sentences vary from long tidal flows to fragmentary note-list; no two openings repeat. High density: “apple, small and imperfect, dropped...” does four jobs (image, sound, cycle, closure cue). Zero paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors. Register stays within Maren’s artistic lexicon; no corporate intrusion. Final line is spare, earning “magnificent simplicity.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Acoustic ecology collapse told through a violinist who refuses cathartic cadenze—fresh angle on climate grief. Sunk greenhouse + shipwreck fence is an image set not seen elsewhere. Inevitability: only this character in this half-drowned orchard could reach the insight that silence itself becomes material. Risk of unresolved ending heightens coherence rather than gimmick.</comment>
