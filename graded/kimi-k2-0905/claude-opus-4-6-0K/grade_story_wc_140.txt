<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren’s interiority is textured through concrete archaeologist-like habits—pressing shreds to walls, memorizing faded stamps—so her “filtering reality differently” feels lived-in. The poison-label fixation crystallizes her values with a single micro-choice: she envies its honesty while living inside bureaucracy’s lie. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, however; her passivity toward the bureaucratic erasure keeps motivation static rather than intensifying. Earned stasis is credible, but the absence of a visible cost-versus-choice beat caps the score just below the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The closure is a Charged Poise: Maren layers the wrongful death certificate onto her wall-map, making erased lives visible without regaining her own name—a conceptual cost legible on the final line. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each added fragment increases density until the map itself becomes the resonant reconfiguration. Causality is present but subordinate; the tightening comes from pattern accretion, not because/therefore turns. Orientation is clean—container, port, tide-time anchored by word 80; no lens ambiguity at payoff.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The port’s mutable container architecture directly shapes tactics: high tide pushes residents upward, low tide grants access to new evidence, so spatial choreography is story logic. Weathered steel walls, leaking roof, and salt smell are filtered through a mind that reads them as “library of vanished lives,” fusing sensory detail with thematic stake. The filing-cabinet container found at ebb functions as both setting and plot device, supplying the climax object. No static backdrop; every environmental cue either constrains movement or offers archival opportunity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—visibility of erased identities—threads every beat and escalates as each new fragment is pinned. The find of hundreds of mis-filed death certificates is the single decisive intensification: it widens the scope from personal to collective erasure while confirming Maren’s obsession is not delusion. Agency remains observational (listening, collecting) rather than confrontational, so cost is conceptual not visceral, but the tide-governed access pattern keeps pressure coherent. Under Accumulative lens, this deepening is sufficient; a sharper personal trade-off would have punched into 9-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: erasure is systemic, memory is collage, identity is what can be mapped when no authority acknowledges you. The final image of the death-certificate layer reweights earlier fragments into a collective ghost-map, answering the implicit question “what remains?” with quiet visual force. No moralizing, only the uncanny symmetry between Maren’s clerical error and the crate of duplicates. Ambiguity lingers: visibility does not equal resurrection, so complexity is preserved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person lingers inside Maren’s perceptual syntax—verbs like “filters,” “presses,” “memorizes” keep psychic distance tight. Rhythm echoes tidal rise/fall through periodic sentence cadences that lengthen in calmer moments, compress when containers flood. No dialogue appears, so evaluation rests on narration’s idiom, which remains consistent and freighted with port-specific diction—“longshoremen,” “cargo manifests,” “customs stamps.” Filter-verb density is low; sensory verbs anchor us to Maren’s body without diluting immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Language is dense yet propulsive: “bureaucracy had already digested her identity and excreted nothing” performs three jobs—metaphor, visceral disgust, systemic critique—in one punch. No stacked metaphors jar; each figure extends the port’s organic/mechanical fusion. Clause variety is high; openings avoid templates. One scaffold trace—“She layers… She takes… She steps”—is brief and supports ritual cadence rather than redundancy. Proofing is clean; only a single comma splice mid-story nudges the score a hair below 9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The container-labyrinth as living archive feels fresh; the clerical-error genocide via filing-cabinet crate is an electrifying synthesis of banality and atrocity. Tropes of statelessness and ghost identities are re-anchored in maritime logistics, making the material logistics of forgetting newly visible. Tide-as-structure converts natural cycle into archival access rule, satisfying conceptual integrity. Risk—static protagonist, observational arc—pays off because the accrual form turns passivity into aesthetic stance.</comment>
