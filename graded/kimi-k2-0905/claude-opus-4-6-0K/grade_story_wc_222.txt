<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Maren’s contradictory impulses—terror/delight, measured abandon—are alive in scene and culminate in the cost-laden choice to write her own scroll; the “chivalrous thief” trait, however, is only backstory flashback, never tested under present pressure, so interior complexity peaks while external ethical identity stays off-stage.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the obsidian wall thins and the corkscrew passage reweights the world-rule; causality holds because the sundial→chess notation→D5 replacement chain is on-page and irreversible, giving Maren’s step-through a felt price—the archive’s defensive stasis is foreclosed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Violet aurora light that makes “shadows move like living things” is filtered through Maren’s thief-attention, constrains her perception, and charges the final image; the spire’s crystalline walls, ice steps, and hollow chess pieces are tactile, trackable, and directly enable the vault-opening act.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“seal or open the archive”—is signaled early; the single escalation beat (placing her scroll inside the knight on D5) narrows options from guardian to gambler, produces the harmonic surge, and forces the irreversible passage; cost is legible in the spire’s defensive song and the revealed sky-risk.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of knowledge as living, playful wager emerges through the chess-sacrifice image rather than exposition; the final “spire wondered” reconfigures archive from stasis to inquiry, delivering resonant ambiguity without moral tag—yet the brief “apprentice of wonder” label in last paragraph nicks subtext −0.3.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Maren’s perceptual signature—“the way a thief knows a locked door”—with rhythmic intensification under violet light; no head-hop, diction within her diction, and syntactic contraction mirror stress, though one filter-verb cluster (“she realized… she read… she thought”) slightly dulls immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, most sentences double-duty; metaphor engine (“arterial violet,” “icebound spire”) stays coherent, no mixed vehicles; one paraphrase loop (“she descended… she retrieved… she sat… she wrote… she sealed… she descended… she placed”) creates template cadence −0.4, but artifact never touches closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Frozen archive encoded in ivory chess secrets feels non-obvious and inevitable; the “sacredly playful” epistemology reframes library into living game, while sky-wrong cosmological hinge risks bold lore-shift yet pays off in passage-opening CR; transformation test fails if pieces are generic, but specificity of swap-mechanic keeps it fresh.</comment>
