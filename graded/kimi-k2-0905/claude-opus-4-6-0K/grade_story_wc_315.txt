<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Maren’s calm, pattern-seeking interiority is vivid and embodied (“let your hands remember”), but the story never risks letting her flaw or irrationality surface; she stays flawlessly competent, muting internal contradiction and thus the highest band. The “watcher’s burden” is asserted, not dramatized as a personal wound or paradox, so the final renunciation carries authority yet little felt cost to her identity. Micro-choices are precise (transmit key, logbook symbols) and keep agency alive throughout.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the headset stays on, the silence now weighted with ongoing duty, a visible cost under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Static→voice→silence pattern tightens stakes once, then crystallizes rather than resolves, satisfying the 9+ cost test. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no causal or seam artifacts mar the ascent. The piece could edge into 9+ with one tangible constraint that haunts Maren past this night.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The arbor-as-observatory is economically sketched yet tactile: legs dangling over cloud-sea, radio hiss like seashell breath. Sensory selection is filtered through Maren’s professional priorities—frequency, elevation, trust—so every environmental detail constrains her next utterance. Only the parachute hardware lacks tactile specificity; we never feel the buckle’s shape under gloved fingers, muting the micro-setting’s power to charge the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Single dominant stake—Tomas’s survival via Maren’s voice—tightens once when buckle failure forces manual release. The escalation is textural: static clears, silence acquires lethal stakes, then reweights into the “soundless echo” she must carry onward. Agency is purely attentional, yet it forecloses any path that abandons the headset, so cost is legible. A sharper physical consequence for Maren (shaking hands, raw throat) would push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the price of perfect listening: you become the static you once monitored. Subtext lives in silences—radio hush, unspoken memory of prior rescues—never in commentary. The final logbook symbol performs a quiet CR, reweighting silence from absence to burden. One overt line—“the watcher’s burden was not something you set down”—leans toward thesis; shave it and the resonance would sing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is crystalline: precise metaphors (“cathedral of branches,” “silver sea”) yet clipped radio diction under stress. Rhythm modulates from languid nocturnal cadence to staccato commands without register drift. Compression (“This was the watcher’s burden”) is taught early and paid off in the charged poise. No head-hop, no filter-verb clutter, every sentence does double duty—voice stays organic to Maren’s technician-poet mind.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentence variety and information density are exemplary; no loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line crystallizes the new silence. One minor over-write: “tiny architecture of lines that encoded not just data but context, emotion, the texture...” could lose two abstract nouns without loss. Otherwise propulsion is flawless under pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The premise fuses arborist sky-cathedral with radio-signal rescue in a way that feels inevitable yet unseen before; trope transformation is complete. Specificity of invented shorthand symbols and the “soundless echo” motif prevent generic swap-out. Risk is modest—single POV, linear arc—but execution is fearless and the final reconfiguration fresh. Not quite a 9+ because the emotional calculus is familiar rescue protocol, not a morally twisted variant.</comment>
