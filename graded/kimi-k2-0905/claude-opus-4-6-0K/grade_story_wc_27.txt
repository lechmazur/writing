<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Maren’s barefoot climb and trembling certainty embody awkward confidence; her need to “discover meaning” drives the beat sequence, but the final vow feels slightly abstract—cost is asserted (“a promise she finally believed”) rather than dramatized on her body or choice in this scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration: the hum converts private awe into communal mandate under Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality holds—opera glasses → Argument → stones → vow—yet the closing cost is still more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Repair-bay carcass, jammed roof edge, and basalt circle texture every beat; the open sky slot literally channels her gaze and dictates timing. The stones’ unbreakability constrains prior builders and now enables her ritual—setting actively shapes tactics and image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“reignite a stalled rebellion”—is signaled early; pressure deepens through accreted stillness and internalized hum, narrowing options to one: share the stones. Agency is present yet soft; the tightening is lyrical, not tactical, sufficient at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: cyclical endurance > linear victory. Binary stars, un-scarable stone, and lull-as-inhalation reconfigure “defeat” into pause without moralizing. The reweighting is felt in the final promise, not declared.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person hovered close to Maren’s marrow; perceptual signature filters cosmos through heirloom glass and theater heritage. Cadence swells with the hum, contracts in “barefoot and shaking and sure”—rhythm tracks interior crescendo without slipping register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentence texture varies from hydraulic-lift consonants to hushing sibilance; no loops or filler stacks. Metaphors (“ribcage of some vast mechanical beast”) stay physical and informative, never overwrought. Final line breathes, giving clean cadence closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Stalled rebellion + prehistoric stone circle + vintage opera glasses fuses space-opera with mythic archaeology, avoiding stock phrasing. The Argument as cosmic metaphor for persistent dissent feels inevitable yet fresh; risk is present but leans lyric rather than structural.</comment>
