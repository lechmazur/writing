<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maret’s interior contradiction—healer vs insurgent—is vivid and embodied; her micro-choice to seize the amber from the priest crystallizes a hierarchy of values with palpable cost. The telpathy-with-plants trait is not just label: it enables the kite-tail decoding that rewrites the ritual. Pell’s moment of shared inheritance lands as visible generational change. Only the absence of a second on-page character keeps the score from 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because the lichen decode the ribbon, therefore Maret can rewrite the ritual; because she dissolves the amber, the destiny becomes communal. Closure is a decisive conceptual re-pricing: the embryonic material dissolves into every spring, reweighting power from hierarchy to shared genome. Cost is legible in the elders’ startled hands and the crowd’s murmur. Orientation anchors who/where by line 3; no lens ambiguity at end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The volcanic hot-spring complex is not backdrop; its geothermal chemistry enables the amber-softening sequence and the lichen linguists. Micro-setting of the ribbon pinned across the kitchen wall becomes the crucible for translating root-language. Spatial choreography stays clean as Maret steps forward across mineral pools. Setting constrains the final choice: only the central spring’s temperature can dissolve the amber without cracking.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“evolve tradition with intent”—is signaled in para 3 and tightens when Maret realizes the embryo was meant for everyone. One meaningful escalation: the decoded script flips the ritual from imposed destiny to shared inheritance, narrowing her options to public confrontation. Cost is felt in the crowd’s insurgent fear and the luminous threads now irreversibly loose. Agency is hers: she physically takes the amber and speaks the forbidden words.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without thesis statement: tradition as living seed, not cage. The sulfur lilies’ dawn whisper reconfigures from mystical ornament to communal rejoicing at the end. Final image—futures branching like root systems—offers a non-literal answer to “what is destiny?” No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in how the valley will navigate unscripted futures.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: slow mineral-rich sentences mirror lichen tempo; short adrenal clauses when Maret steps forward. Diction stays within geothermal/arboreal lexicon without forced elevation. Filter verbs (“she felt”) are minimal and voice-motivated. No head-hopping; single POV holds. Rhythm accelerates across the dissolution beat, then widens into root-system cadence at close.</answer>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Zero loops; high density—every sentence advances knowledge or image. Opening line anchors voice and stakes simultaneously. Mixed metaphors avoided; “veins of crystal” and “root systems” stay within geological/botanical logic. Final line crystallizes earlier motif without redundant summary. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with steam-veiled pauses and final luminous spread.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The insurgent-granny-with-plant-telepathy trope is reanimated through geothermal biotech and amber epigenics, not quaint magic. Kite-tail as Rosetta stone for pre-edit ritual code is fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Conceptual risk—dissolve the McGuffin instead of steal it—pays off by rewriting the valley’s biological social contract. Specificity of root-language decoded by lichen colonies feels non-exportable to another story.</comment>
