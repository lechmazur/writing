<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Maren’s vocation and inherited gift are cleanly sketched, but interior contradiction is summarized (“she would do it carefully”) rather than dramatized in a visible micro-choice under pressure. No embodied emotion surfaces when the glacier exhales; she registers the miracle with reporter neutrality. The final resolve is declared, not earned by a prior scene beat that costs her anything on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: dream fragments layer evidence until Maren’s self-generated dream crystallizes mission. Closure lands as Charged Poise—she walks away “carrying forty-three whispered names,” a resonant reconfiguration that forecloses retreat with felt conceptual cost. One scaffold clause (“She would expose the truth…”) over-outlines intent and blunts immediacy, keeping the score sub-9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Shrine breathes, candles tilt, ice refracts starlight—selective sensory triad anchors otherworldly antenna logic. The melted snow globe becomes micro-setting whose warped village reframes contamination evidence, charging the final stare through its scarred dome. Spatial choreography stays clean across kneel/stand/exit beats.</comment>

<question>4</question><question>7.4</question><comment>Dominant stake—“find the pure shape of what happened”—tightens as dream cameos sequentially prove sabotage, narrowing her option to act. Pressure escalates by density of new dream data rather than causal reversal; coincidence (own dream apparition) complicates but does not resolve. Final stance crystallizes with conceptual cost yet no tangible price is withdrawn from her on the page, capping high-band entry.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—truth as fragile artifact that must be salvaged intact—emerges through recurring glass imagery (globe, animals, lenses) rather than statement. Subtext in Dag’s glass menagerie smuggles ecological guilt without exposition. Final image of “borrowed starlight” reweights prior candle motif, offering resonant CR: purity is borrowed, never owned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person POV stays tight to Maren’s perceptual filter, lexicon nautical and tactile. Rhythm swells and contracts with dream sequences, then returns to clipped reportage. No head-hop; psychic distance cleanly widens for glacier exhalation, then narrows to fingertip on warped glass. Filter verbs minimal and purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</question><comment>Prose is vivid yet disciplined: “blue-white ice… borrowed starlight” condenses atmosphere without purple. Occasional modifiers (“cold and distant luminance”) slightly overlap, minor loop. Dream insertions accelerate cadence and breath, mirroring data rush. No mixed metaphors; final line lands clean with glass-and-light echo.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Melding Sami ice-shrine spiritual tech with dream-forensics feels fresh; ghost-whispering via crowd-scene cameos is inventive compression. Premise transforms eco-thriller tropes into lyric ghost-salvage. Risk-taking lies in primarily accumulative structure; reward is sustained mystery without exposition dump, though dependent on familiar “corporate cover-up” scaffold.</comment>
