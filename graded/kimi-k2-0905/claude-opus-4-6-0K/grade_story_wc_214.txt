<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Maren’s interiority is vivid, embodied, and consistent; the moment she “feels…what it might mean to burn so brightly” crystallizes her contradictory impulse to stay yet surrender. The final stance—remaining to sweep—carries visible cost: she forfeits escape for attentive fragility. No second character, so relationship/status bullets skipped; micro-choices (climb, trace, sweep) cleanly reveal hierarchy of values. Reflection stays anchored to present stimuli; passivity is thematic, not flaw.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Maren renounces departure, foreclosing transfer path while cost (perpetual solitude, maintenance labor) is felt in the final sweep. Lens = Accumulative/Textural; cadence shift from cosmic awe to grounded duty reweights stakes. Orientation clear by line 6; no teleporting or soft resets. Persistent constraint—“yellow lantern glass” aging but intact—shapes nightly ritual and final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Basalt ridge, volcanic dust, and lantern glass are tactile, selective, and mirrored in Maren’s erosion/glow. Micro-setting (glass pane) literally casts the closing gold meridian, charging final image. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and sight filtered through janitor familiarity. Spatial choreography clean; no tourist catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake = remain attentive versus flee; signaled early. Pressure tightens when empathy with meteors crystallizes her choice to keep sweeping; no external reversals needed. Cost legible: lifelong maintenance of abandoned tech. One deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—“softness as strength”—emerges from nightly tracing, ledger marginalia, and final sweep, never stated. Bolide light reweights prior dust imagery without overt symbolism. Resonant ambiguity: reader must decide if her life is radiant confinement or consecrated witness. Final image offers non-literal answer; no moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person intimate carries janitor’s perceptual signature: torque specs as sutras, dust as prayer shawl. Rhythm modulates—long contemplative sentences contract into clipped log entries—mirroring attention shifts. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets skipped. Lens distance stable; diction stays within Maren’s lexicon; no filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; sentences multitask (dust = gray prayer shawl). Metaphors organic, never stacked in high-pressure beats. Zero loops, paraphrase, or register drift. Minor flourish (“colors no chart could hold”) justified by lyric mode taught early. Read-aloud rhythm varies; paragraph cuts tight.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Familiar trope—lonely caretaker of obsolete science—is refreshed through janitor POV, meteor empathy, and yellow-glass meridian. Specificity of ledger marginalia as “first new phenomenological astronomy” feels inevitable, not gimmicky. Risk-taking in quiet, accumulative structure heightens resonance without obscuring closure. Could not swap setting or object without collapsing final image.</comment>
