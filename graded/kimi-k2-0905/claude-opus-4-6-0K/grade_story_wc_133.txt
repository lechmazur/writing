<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maren’s insomnia is made tactile in her trembling hands and hyper-lucid perception; the choice to surrender the amber brooch crystallizes her need to externalise private grief. Interiority stays concrete (“pressed against her ribs like a second heartbeat”), though the final beat leans slightly toward self-diagnosis (“wakefulness felt… like vigil”). Still, contradictory impulses (keep vs. release the heirloom) collide on-stage, and renunciation costs her the last portable piece of her mother, so the arc earns its quiet stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: rain-trail pattern, war detritus, and personal relics accrete until Maren’s gift reweights them into art. Anchors (who/where/when) are legible by line 5; the single transition off-island is clean. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the unfinished painting and submerged causeway foreclose return, the brooch left behind is visible cost. One minor scaffold (“She would not sleep tonight either”) repeats the insomnia cue already shown, else this would clear 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Salt-cracked stones, dark rain-gutters and regimental clouds are filtered through a painter’s eye, guiding her brush choices and pacing. The tidal clock constrains every action; the island’s miniature amphitheater of rusted cores literally funnels her to the offering site. Amber trapped insect vs. ruined desalination tech provides a micro-setting contrast that charges the final image. Environment is not backdrop; it dictates when she can leave, thus satisfying the 9+ constraint test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: transmute private survival into shareable meaning before the tide erases access. Pressure heightens as water darkens the stones—she must finish or abandon the painting. No antagonist is needed; the tightening is temporal and existential. Cost is felt: the brooch is gone, the painting is “incomplete,” footprints erased—options narrow to vigil alone.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from juxtaposing two technologies of preservation—amber and filtration membranes—both obsolete yet beautiful. No character states the moral; the final image of Maren holding an “incomplete” record of complete loss reconfigures value. Subtext resides in silence: no letter she can read, no witness except the retreating tide. The ambiguity between punishment and calling in her insomnia lingers without sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited sustains painterly perception: colour, pigment, line, shadow. Syntax lengthens during contemplation, then fractures when the tide rushes—“brushwork was loose, almost desperate”—mirroring pulse. No head-hopping; the fisherman’s idiom is brief, wry, distinct. Filter verbs (“she felt”) are minimal and voice-motivated, keeping immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry triple duty (image, emotion, world fact) with natural rhythmic variation. One paraphrase loop appears: “couldn’t sleep… wakefulness felt… inability to look away” within four lines—minor but noticeable. Metaphors stay coherent (island as bruise, channels as veins). No mixed registers; technical terms (desalination cores) are accurate and motivated. Closing paragraph lands cleanly without figurative muddle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Post-war tidal memorial accessed only by lunar desiccation is fresh; using painterly taxonomy instead of soldierly frames the ruin through aesthetic salvage. Convergence of junked water-tech and personal relics forms a standing-stone circle that rewilds the battlefield into ritual. Risk: a sleep-starved artist as seer could tip into cliché, but her unfinished canvas and forfeited amber avoid redemptive triumph. Synthesis feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
