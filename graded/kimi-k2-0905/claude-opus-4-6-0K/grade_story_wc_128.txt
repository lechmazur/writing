<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren’s core trait—curiosity—activates the plot and sustains it, but her interiority stays in elegant summary rather than scene-level contradiction; the single beat of choice (mailing the envelope) is courteous, not costly. Emotional embodiment is vivid in the opening paragraph, then drifts to editorial paraphrase (“cautious exuberance she always carried”). No genuine flaw or status tension surfaces on-stage; she glides above risk rather than being reshaped by it. Dinah functions as facilitator, not crucible, so relationship pressure remains theoretical.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final image of Maren listening to the horn while counting the once-invisible names reconfigures her attention and the port’s moral ledger. Causal chain is slim—one forwarded envelope snowballs into an exhibit—but sufficient for the lyric-accumulative lens. The 1952 photo functions as the persistent constraint, reprised under glass. Cost is conceptual (recognition almost missed) rather than personal, keeping the stake modest but legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Environment is selective and POV-filtered: salt air, iron chair, returns cart, harbor horn—each reappears to reinforce the motif of overlooked labor. The outdoor library’s spatial logic is stable and frames the inciting discovery. Weather (breeze turning pages) mirrors the uncovering of erased names without overt symbolism. No single object constrains a tactical choice, capping entry below 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restoring erased names—surfaces early and tightens once: Maren shifts from private curiosity to public exhibit. Pressure stays polite; no external resistance or resource limit complicates the project. The port’s institutional silence is declared, not dramatized, so escalation is informational rather than risky. Closure gains conceptual cost, but mid-story escalation is gentle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of salvaging invisible labor emerges through concrete artifacts—ledger gaps, brass plaques, locket photo—never through thesis statements. The final image of Maren counting names inside the ship’s horn blast offers resonant non-verbal payoff. Subtextual irony: a modern broker rectifies the very omission her profession once perpetuated. No moralizing paragraph intrudes; meaning stays embodied.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person POV stays close to Maren with consistent perceptual signature—“glance at a manifest and spot a discrepancy the way a hawk spots a field mouse.” Syntax lengthens under reflective mood, then tightens during the envelope discovery, mirroring attention shifts. No head-hopping; Dinah’s interior is implied through gesture. Distinct maritime diction throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyrical yet propulsive, with rhythmic variation that supports the orchestral cadence of the piece. Occasional elevated phrases (“cautious exuberance,” “residue of music”) flirt with register drift but remain within Maren’s cultivated lexicon. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; each image advances atmosphere or stakes. Final paragraph’s page-turning breeze elegantly callbacks the opening without repetition.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The premise—misdirected envelope ignites archival recovery—feels fresh yet inevitable, avoiding overt sentimentality. Maritime setting and gendered labor angle lend specificity that resists generic uplift narratives. Risk is moderate: quiet hymn to recognition rather than plotted confrontation, but coherence of vision sells the choice. Could edge higher with a single irreversible cost on Maren herself.</comment>
