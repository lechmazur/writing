<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction is present—ex-spy turned accidental oracle—but agency is mostly passive observation of fortunes coming true; final micro-choice (embedding microdot in new fortune) is elegant but light on felt cost. Embodied emotion is sparse; we’re told “she smiled” and “sat for a long time,” not shown visceral weight. Backstory reflection is anchored and tilts present stance, satisfying BRR. Character reads as singular, not stereotype, yet lacks a moment where flaw or struggle visibly complicates the final act.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the reopened canister and renewed release reweight her life’s work from covert utility to open-ended gift, cost visible in the microdot’s transfer. Accumulative lens holds: pattern of prophetic fortunes + bottled messages tightens toward final crystallization. Orientation is clear by 120 words. No causal reversal is required under this lens; the deepening of meaning suffices. One scaffold loop: “She sealed the bottles. She set them in the current.” otherwise propulsion is clean.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lighthouse, tide charts, and microdot tools function as micro-setting that constrain method; bottle currents act as environmental gate dictating reach. Sensory selection favors sound and touch (“crumpled paper,” “beam across dark water”) over visual cliché. Geography remains stable; ferry terminal, Burton marina, Point Robinson are named only when they matter. Final image of beam illuminating “nothing it could keep” recharges motif—setting charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: whether her words still carry weight now that agency and stipend are gone. Tightening occurs when she realizes fortunes come true without her intent—knowledge that narrows her stance from resigned exile to deliberate participant. Cost is conceptual (legacy exposure via microdots) rather than visceral; price is legible but muted. No antagonist needed; situational pressure of unintended prophecy suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: truth wants to be known, secrecy reinvents itself as generosity. Subtext resides in the microdot nesting inside a benevolent fortune—covert past folded into hopeful future. Final image offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. Ambiguity is purposeful: is she still directing flow or surrendering to it? No thematic echo violations.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person hovers at a lyric distance that matches contemplative exile; diction (“basalt fist,” “cellophane cracked open by strangers”) is controlled and particular. Rhythm modulates: longer accumulative sentences build pattern, then short declaratives release it. No dialogue, so voice evaluation is prose-only; perceptual signature is consistent—Mei-Ling notices circulation charts the way she once tracked dead-drops. No head-hop or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentence variety strong; scaffolding minimal except one paraphrase loop noted in Q2. Metaphors are spare and coherent (“submarine composites looked like constellations”). Information density high: each sentence advances image or concept. No filter-verb clusters. Closing line cadence mirrors opening ascent, earning echo without monotony.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Synthesis of espionage ink tech and accidental prophecy feels inevitable yet non-obvious; transformation test passes—story collapses without fortune-cookie spycraft. Risk in blending covert specs with mystical causality heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specific detail (Szechuan Dragon line, Jiangxi dam) anchors freshness. Final reconfiguration reframes spy’s tradecraft as lighthouse keeper’s gift—fresh inflection earned.</comment>
