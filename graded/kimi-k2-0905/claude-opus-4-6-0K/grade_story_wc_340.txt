<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Lenne’s interiority is textured—grief “frozen solid,” the fist-memory—but her one on-page micro-choice (lifts goggles, reads) is the only beat where contradictory impulses could collide. The rest is reflective reception; no second option is ever risked or refused, so the “enormous warmth” is asserted, not dramatized. Still, the embodied metaphor chain (“roots in frozen ground”) keeps her particular. meets 9+ test half-way; capped by lack of visible renunciation cost on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the mother’s encryption method flips Lenne’s knowledge from suicide to vanishing, reframing the ascent itself as maternal invitation. Cost is legible—“she had been reassigned” severs her old life; the diary’s ice-locked legibility is the persistent constraint. Causal linkage holds under Accumulative/Textural lens: each floor adds light-density that pays off in the prismatic reveal. One hairline slip: orientation anchor (“who, where”) is delayed until ~word 70, but the frost-glass image teaches the disorientation that later charges closure, so Orientation Test waived.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ice is never backdrop; it is the decryption engine—spectra sliding “like living things” literally enable reading. Elevator glass, frost-laced pipe, prismatic refraction form a micro-setting triad that constrains the final action. Spatial choreography is immaculate: bundle, goggles, diary, light angles all track. Falls 0.1 short of 9 because ice’s thermal danger (cold as cost) is described but never felt on Lenne’s skin to alter her tempo.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“did my mother jump or leave a trail?”—is signaled by line 4 and tightens once: cipher becomes legible, erasing suicide option. Agency is receptive (reading) rather than active, so the tightening is intellectual, not tactical; nevertheless the foreclosure is irreversible and carries the felt social cost of losing her assigned servant identity. Meets 8-band; misses 8.8 because no secondary obstacle (Keeper, physical risk) pushes back during the ascent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme—“joy persists beneath anguish like roots in permafrost”—emerges entirely through the decryption sequence; no character moralizes it. The diary’s catalog of small joys (cook singing, infant fist) reweights Lenne’s frozen grief without sermon. Final image of lantern-in-dark is earned, but the line is given to the narrator, slightly blunting subtext; hence 0.1 off 8.5.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is cool, tactile, light-obsessed—“spectra slid across the interior like living things.” Syntax lengthens under wonder, shortens under shock; no filter-verb clusters. Distinct rhythm but not ostentatiously poetic; stays within servant’s plausible lexicon. Meets 9+ quick test; no slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Figurative language is selective—three sustained metaphors (frozen grief, living spectra, lantern) rather than sprawl. One near-loop: “frozen solid inside her the way water froze inside the walls” could compress, but it occurs early and does not touch closure. High density, clean mechanics, read-aloud rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Mother’s sunlight-dependent cipher feels fresh, yet “airship captain vanished into sky” trope is familiar; the ice-encryption specificity transforms it enough. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulative structure instead of action plot—but coherence stays high. Could push higher if the vanishing method left a stranger physical trace.</comment>
