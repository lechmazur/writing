<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren’s “kindly methodical” trait is embodied in every micro-choice; the ache triggered by tape fragments gives visceral motive. Interior contradiction—yearning to be seen yet fearing mis-labeling—drives the final risk. The notebook gesture is credible renunciation with felt cost. Missing only a second on-page character to test status shift, so capped just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of found objects tightens until notebook hand-off crystallizes meaning. Closure is Charged Poise—options reweighted, cost legible in her frozen ceiling wait. Causality intact: each tape find deepens emotional stake, notebook choice forces visibility gamble. No orientation debt; transitions clean.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Library’s crawl-spaces, pipe chase, and bruised dawn light constrain every move; the boiler crate micro-setting enables the cache beat. Sensory hierarchy filtered through Maren’s stealth priorities—dust, iron, adhesive scent—guides action. Final “blue remained” image recharges opening outage. Meets 9+ gate: setting charges closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she risk visibility?—tightens once when notebook is left; no reversal needed under Accumulative lens. Escalation comes via density of found fragments and memory ache; final gesture narrows options to被发现 or exile. Cost visible in her breath-held ceiling wait. Slight reserve because Odette’s reaction remains off-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of tender custodianship vs. self-erasure emerges through taped voices and surreptitious reshelving—never stated. Final image reweights “belonging” without moralizing. Subtext in notebook line: “These belong to your building” quietly claims reciprocal belonging. Avoids tidy closure, invites counter-reading of gift as trespass.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature—mechanical smells, ceiling-angle vision—distinctly Maren. Syntax mirrors her methodical care: long controlled sentences, tactile verbs. No dialogue, so voice cohesion rests on interior diction and stays pure. Final hush repetition cadence is intentional pattern payoff.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density: each sentence moves (action, memory, atmosphere). Figurative language sparse and precise—“cathedral of pure silence,” “blue so deep it felt almost audible”—no mixed metaphors. Rhythm breathes with escalation: shorter clauses as she climbs, then stillness. One paraphrase loop (“visible to those who need you” echoed) keeps it from 9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fusion of homeless archivist + reel-to-reel nerves inside a library wall is fresh synthesis; not a trope re-skinned. Specifics—oxide tack, tissue nest, junction elevation—make the concept irreplicable. Risk of quiet ending paid off via Charged Poise. Minor deduction for echoing “hidden tenant” motif seen elsewhere, but transformation here is specific.</comment>
