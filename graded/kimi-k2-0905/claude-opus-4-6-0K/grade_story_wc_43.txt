<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Maren’s “decisively kind” trait is shown through immediate action—no hesitation at thresholds—and her hymn-choice is tied to her prior nine years of method, giving her credibility. Felix’s back-story and vinyl fragment anchor his want for a last breath of the past, and the micro-choice to press the shards together on his chest crystallizes both characters’ stakes. Interiority stays concrete; no diagnostic self-talk. The only hairline slip: the phrase “quiet ministry” flirts with label-speak, but the next sentence re-embodies it in practice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the broken record becomes “whole enough,” the room quiets, the light stays—an unmistakable before/after reconfiguration with felt cost (Felix’s last breath). Causal chain: Maren’s tracking of the second shard → Phuong’s arrival → joined fragments → final song; each step narrows options to “say goodbye rightly.” Orientation anchored by word 50; no teleporting props. Lens holds Accumulative/Textural: density of mundane images accumulates until the final stillness reweights them.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The alpine hospice is evoked in three swift strokes—“radiant haven above the clouds,” “sun lingered hours past its natural setting,” “clouds below…burned gold”—then cedes focus to the micro-setting of Room 12. Selective sensory detail (vinyl grooves catching glow, morphine drips as metronomes) keeps economy tight. The window light functions as both literal source and symbolic charge for the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography clean: guitar, stool, quilt, two vinyl shards track without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—deliver a “flawless goodbye”—is signaled in para 1 and tightened when blood work confirms ≤3 days. Middle beat: Maren’s off-page search for the second shard converts abstract hope into concrete possibility; joining the fragments visibly forecloses the option to “maybe later.” Cost is legible: Felix’s last breath immediately after the reconstituted label. No external antagonist needed; internal pressure of time and organ failure suffices. One meaningful deepening is enough at 750 words.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through particulars: mundane song fragments become the vehicle for mortal farewell, proving “the small things were what people mourned most fiercely.” The vinyl shard reweights from broken nostalgia to whole-enough closure without a moral spelled out. Final line—“the light stayed anyway”—offers a non-literal answer: what has been loved remains perceptible after the lover departs. No thematic echo sentence; resonance is imaged, not asserted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays latched to Maren’s perceptual filter: “she had learned,” “she believed,” “she sang about…”—no head-hop. Syntax mirrors her musical ear—cadenced repetition, soft consonants—without drumbeat monotony. Free indirect slips in cleanly: “Hymning the mundane was her method.” Dialogue is minimal but natural (“I brought someone. And something.”) and advances plot. No filter-verb stacks; immediacy intact.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: long breath-like sentences for alpine vistas, clipped fragments for clinical detail. Information density high—“morphine drips ticked like metronomes” does three jobs. Zero paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors. One near-purple phrase—“light poured through his window like something holy”—is earned by prior secular setup and pays off in the final sacral stillness. No scaffolding, no synonym churn; pronouns clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Familiar hospice trope is refreshed by the vinyl-shard reunification ritual and the reversal that hope is smelled backward, not forward. Specific 1978 record-shop meet-cue and Coltrane label lift the love story out of generic flashback. Risk is taken in quiet accretion rather than twist, but accretion lands a charged poise. Transformation test fails if swapped to cassette or photo, proving the vinyl’s groove is integral.</comment>
