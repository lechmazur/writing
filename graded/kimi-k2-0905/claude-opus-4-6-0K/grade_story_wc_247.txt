<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Maren’s interiority is lyric but consistent; her father-haunted need to “map silence” drives every beat. The camera-as-notation and the final shutter-press on nothing are organic extensions of that motive. Clement stays thin—his whispering trait is only label and convenience, never costing him anything—so the relational crucible never fully ignites. Still, her earned stasis (she accepts being un-remembered yet fully heard) pays a visible price and is motivated throughout.</comment>

<comment>Closure is clean: the shutter-click on emptiness is a Conceptual Repricing that makes the whole harbor her score. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than strictly because/therefore, but the pattern is taught early (camera, signing, moonlit water) and returns re-weighted. Orientation is anchored by line 3; transitions are seamless. Clement’s advice never creates a reversal, so escalation is a single deepening, yet the final image forecloses all other paths with undeniable cost.</comment>

<comment>The harbor is not backdrop but notation paper: moonlight on water = staff lines, boats = rests, silence = clef. The vintage camera acts as micro-setting that constrains her composition method and charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy is biased to reflected light and hush, mirroring her Deaf gaze. Spatial choreography stays clean even with a crowd; no floating bodies or prop drift.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—“can silence be music?”—is signaled in paragraph 3 and deepens through the performance beat. No external antagonist; pressure is internal and accumulative. The single tightening is the moment townspeople imitate her signs, proving her thesis but also sealing her anonymity; cost is the perpetual exile of being forgotten. Clement’s whispered translations complicate but do not escalate, keeping tension lyrical rather than causal.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges from the repeating triad of light–camera–silence; each recurrence re-weights the idea that music can live outside sound. No moral is stated; the final shutter-press is the answer. Subtext in Clement’s murmured bridge and the townspeople’s tears carries the emotional argument without exposition. The joyful sorrow tone modulates: arrival grief → performance wonder → benediction, avoiding sentimentality by remaining imagistic.</comment>

<comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly filtered through Maren’s perceptual grammar of light and silence. Rhythm is controlled: long floating sentences for harbor description, staccato fragments for sign choreography. No head-hopping; Clement’s interior is never invaded. The elevated diction (“luminous,” “benediction”) is justified by the moonlit harbor palette and never slips into purple because it serves the synesthetic concept.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Almost every sentence layers image + motion + concept (“fingers moving through air in shapes no one around her could read”). Metaphors stay consistent—water as score, silence as architecture. One paraphrase loop near midpoint (“the silence that followed was not empty…”) is forgiven because it sets up the architectural payoff. No filter-verb stacks; props stay tactile; opening and closing lines are ear-perfect.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The Deaf/harbor/score synthesis is fresh; no trope checklist feels ticked. The no-film camera repurposed as notation device is a specific, irreplicable inflection. Risk is taken in making the climax a silent sign-language performance, yet causality and emotion remain legible. The concept commits fully rather than retreating to safer auditory metaphor.</comment>
