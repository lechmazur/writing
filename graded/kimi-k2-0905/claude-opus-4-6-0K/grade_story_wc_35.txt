<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (guilt vs duty) is vivid; the gloved/ungloved micro-choice crystallizes her flaw. The mother-memory is embodied, not labelled. Final stance—enduring the flood of remorse—earns the quiet payoff. Slight shortfall: no second character on-stage, so status crucible and voice-distinction bullets are N/A; still, her self-confrontation under pressure is fully dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: fossil-pool pattern taught by 120 words, closure reweights meaning via Charged Poise. The “subsuming” beat is the decisive intensifier; cost is the translucent ache in her finger-bones—felt on page. Orientation anchored early (who/where/when). No lens ambiguity; pattern holds to last line.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Desert fortress, fossil-laced flagstones, and post-rain micro-pools function as tactile map and emotional seismograph. Setting literally guides her downward press and charges the final image of drying stone. Meets 9+ gate: environment constrains tactics and crystallizes closure. Sensory choice is chef-patient: scent of yeast, chill of fossil water—never tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can she bear others’ remorse without being flayed—is signaled in paragraph 2. Single meaningful deepening: palms-to-stone moment narrows options to “endure or fracture.” Price (translucent fingers) is on-page. Agency is renunciation/endurance rather than external victory—valid under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particular: grief as flavor, regret as mineral water. Final image (bread tastes only of itself) reweights earlier motif without moralizing. No thesis statements; resonance is felt. Ambiguity lingers—has she hollowed or purified herself?—inviting reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person intimate sustains chef’s synesthetic perceptual signature throughout. Syntax is controlled, rhythmic; no filter-verb bloat. Diction stays within culinary and geological lexicon she would own. No dialogue, so voice-distinction bullet waived. Compression (“She was sturdy.”) reads as her self-mantra, not external intrusion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; sentences advance on dual tracks (external action + internal taste). Metaphors are coherent—grief as broth, coral as cathedral—no mixed vehicles. High information density: one line can set, sense, and symbol (“fossil coral now a tiny tidal pool reflecting the bruised sky”). No overwriting in peak beat; translucent bones image is precise and brief.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Memory-tasting chef + emotionally-contagious touch + fossil-ice pavilion beneath desert is a fresh, risk-stacked synthesis. Concept follows its implications: she becomes living filter for centuries of regret. Risk heightens clarity rather than gimmickry. Transformation test fails if any element swapped—story would collapse.</comment>
