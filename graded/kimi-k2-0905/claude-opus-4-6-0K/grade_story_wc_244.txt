<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Maren’s contradictory need for invisibility yet aching for reciprocity is dramatized through micro-choices—hiding in the ivy station, pocketing the moon rock, finally stepping into the gravel. The “desperately jocular” trait is embodied, not labeled, and her surrender carries visible cost. Interiority stays specific, though one beat of overt self-diagnosis (“she had been searching for the cure…”) slightly over-articulates what the imagery already shows.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Earned Stasis: Maren’s quiet “All right” forecloses the ghost-life path with unmistakable emotional cost. Causal chain holds—rumor → Petra → invitation → surrender—under a Situational lens. Orientation is anchored by word 86; no debt applied. Moon-rock motif recurs and reweights meaning at the end, satisfying the persistent-constraint test for 9+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ivy-swallowed station is more than backdrop; its green throat imagery and functioning outlet enable her hideout and mirror her swallowed state. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (peppermint-tea smell on clipboards). The moon chip acts as micro-setting that finally charges the closure image when held to the light. Spatial logic is clean; no credibility strain.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reciprocity vs erasure—tightens once Petra turns the rumor into an unrefusable dinner invitation, narrowing Maren’s options from absolute withdrawal to social surrender. Cost is felt on-page in the gravel step and ivy swallowing the door behind her. No reversal inflation; one meaningful tightening suffices for 700 words.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the moon-rock gift and the thank-you banner: gifts demand reception, and perpetual giving without receiving is another form of isolation. Final image of “a table being set” offers resonant, non-literal answer—reciprocity as unavoidable orbit. No sermonizing; insight stays implicit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains tight psychic distance; diction (“green throat mid-swallow,” “operational advantage rather than pathology”) is character-specific and rhythmic. Peppermint-tea smell and tarp jokes create a distinct perceptual signature. Compressed lyric passages are taught early and pay off in the final cadence; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; sentences double-load information (“Relief workers…knew her only through intermediaries…”). No filter-verb stacks, no mixed metaphors. One paraphrase loop (“she told herself…she told herself”) is minor. Final ivy image is clean, unmuddled, and charges closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The invisible-logistician conceit is fresh, and the “polite anarchy” of reciprocity-as-blackmail flips the disaster-hero trope. Moon rock as unreturnable gift is an original compressive object. Rumor-chain arrival risks coincidence but is framed as situational pressure, not deus ex machina. Could swap out Velden without damage, keeping score just sub-9.</comment>
