<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Maren’s methodically playful nature is shown through named cracks and hummed melodies, and her interior shift from certainty to wonder is embodied in the choice to seal the coin back into the wall; the cost—abandoning her expert stance—lands cleanly. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene, only summarized, keeping her from the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: sealing the coin renounces certainty and reweights the entire premise; the cost is visible in her setting down the trowel and walking away from expertise. The accumulative/textural lens holds throughout—each echo strips familiarity until the mural’s motion crystallizes the new stance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The parabolic dishes and recursive mural are evoked with sensory economy; the garden’s acoustic geometry constrains how questions travel and return, directly shaping the final stance. Environment charges the closure image—no other setting could produce this echo-loop of self-recognition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Pressure tightens once: the coin’s question strips Maren’s accumulated certainties, forcing a public stance—she must speak a new question into the dishes. The cost is legible (she forfeits expert identity), but escalation is single-tier; no secondary tightening keeps it below 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The nested awakenings theme emerges through recursive images (coin eyes, mural rings, echoed voice) without explicit statement; the final image of another pair of eyes opening reweights all prior layers. No moral is asserted—meaning stays implicit, resonant, and charged with cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person prose carries a hushed, precise cadence that mirrors Maren’s restorer gaze; perceptual signature is consistent—tools ranked by millimeters, cracks named. Syntax tightens under pressure: short clauses mimic echo-stripping, then expand into luminous mural motion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and rhythm; figurative language is sparse and purposeful—no mixed metaphors or loops. Information density is high: one sentence often paints, sounds, and hints interior state. A single scaffolding phrase—“she realized”—is unnecessary but brief.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The sound-wave garden that grows echoes instead of flowers is a fresh conceptual engine; the hobo nickel’s recursive eyes literalize the theme inside an object that also triggers plot. Risk: nested realities could feel gimmicky, yet each layer is grounded in Maren’s tactile gestures, making the invention inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
