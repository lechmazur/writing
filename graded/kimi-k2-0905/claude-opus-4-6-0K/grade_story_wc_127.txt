<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction is staged cleanly through the blotter choice; the final decision to lace future vials with the catalyst is both earned and costs her prior professional detachment. One hairline slip: “affectionate detachment” is named rather than shown in body.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the rule-set of her trade is recalibrated on-page (“she would reformulate”) with visible cost—the loss of her own partitioned safety. Accumulative lens holds: pattern of half-truths thickens until the final cadence reweights it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Amber grotto’s mineral conductivity is the enabling constraint that lets static-sight and catalyst work; the blotter petal micro-setting charges the final image. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no world-rule drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether she will keep her empathic partition—tightens once via the catalyst beat; cost is legible in the tears she allows while still noting salinity. A hairline gap: no external client pressure visible at climax keeps it shy of 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Half-truth commerce emerges through concrete vial list and final reformulation; theme reweights without sermon. Resonant reconfiguration: the closing “half truth that leaned a little closer to whole” answers the question obliquely yet unmistakably.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is consistent—chemist’s precision, static-tasting synesthesia, amber dusk as conductance. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences under influence, then tight closure. No head-hop or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High-density lines carry three jobs—image, metaphor, world-rule—without scaffold; no mixed metaphors or synonym loops. “Thick and slow and warm” repetition is pattern-taught early and paid off in closing cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Emotion-dealer who senses via static electricity is fresh; synthesis with amber grotto conductor and catalyst blotter feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk—lyric interior monologue—heightens empathy without obscuring stakes.</comment>
