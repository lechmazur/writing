<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Maren’s obsessive attention is shown through concrete micro-choices (auction bid, phone call) and embodied ritual (touching the scorched patch). The final decision to expose the lie costs her the safety of corporate anonymity, fulfilling the closure cost test. Interiority stays specific to her perceptual lens; no diagnostic self-labeling. Could edge higher if the story dramatized one moment where her “bright attention” actually endangers her earlier, compounding the final risk.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: 7411 anomaly → draft message → falsified log → phone call, each link narrowing Maren’s options. Closure is a decisive change with social cost: the archive’s breath-release image signals truth will surface, ending her complicity. Orientation is clean within 120 words; no lens ambiguity. One hairline slip: the journalist is introduced off-page; a single prior breadcrumb would remove the faint convenience feel.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The humming archive, cubicle corkboard, and singed patch function as micro-settings that constrain action: only Maren’s badge can reach deep logs; only the patch’s melted edge can focus her resolve. Sensory selection mirrors her tunnel-vision—fluorescent hum, frozen hands—keeping pressure tight. Spatial choreography stays coherent as she queries, copies, calls. Patch reappears at closure, reweighted from souvenir to catalyst, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncover why 7411 haunts—tightens when the draft reveals lethal cover-up, forcing Maren to choose complicity or exposure. Escalation is causal: each 7411 sighting shrinks her moral wiggle-room until silence becomes impossible. Cost is legible: she forfeits corporate protection the instant the journalist answers. Could use one intermediate obstacle (security flag, boss ping) to raise pressure another notch before the call.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—memory versus engineered forgetting—emerges through pattern: deleted profiles, overwritten logs, yearly birthday posts to void. Final image of the archive “exhaling” reweights earlier humming as organism complicit in silence now forced to speak. No moralizing; irony is that the keeper must breach her own cathedral. Subtext in the half-melted patch implies corporate heat warps both metal and truth.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays latched to Maren’s detail-drunk perception: pixel coordinates, character counts, licensing disputes. Syntax lengthens under obsession (“recurring like a heartbeat…”) then fractures into two-word revelation (“Her hands went cold”). No head-hops; psychic distance tightens exactly as stakes peak. One clause drifts toward corporate brochure (“standard compliance template”) but is absorbed by context.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with pressure: long accumulative sentences for archive immensity, staccato revelations for beats. Information density high—each sentence advances knowledge or image. Zero paraphrase loops; no mixed metaphors. “Songs she could no longer name” risks slight abstraction but is anchored by licensing-scrub context. Clean copy, strong verbs, no scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fusing corporate data-mining with private grief over a space-disaster cover-up feels fresh; no recent analogues. Recurring number motif grows from metadata glitch to death warrant, transforming cold data into moral imperative. Specificity of heat-shield bonus and memorial-page zero-views keeps the concept grounded. Risk is moderate; could push further by letting Maren tamper with live data, but current restraint suits length.</comment>
