<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Maren’s interiority is vivid—her dislike of “carnival” labels, her synesthetic psychometry, her spatial imagination all act in scene. The contradiction between voyeuristic gift and empathetic duty crystallizes when she threads the film and adds her own letter, paying visible cost. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible not tested; single-POV depth is strong. Micro-choice hierarchy (add letter, seal canister) legibly enacts renunciation with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the screen’s ghost-light reweights “unused love” from private ache to transferable archive; cost is the irreversible exposure of Estelle’s secrecy and Maren’s surrender of her detachment. Causal chain intact—found letter → psychometry → film → viewing → letter added; each because/therefore tightens options. No orientation drift; anchors (who/where/when) taught by line 4. Persistent constraint: booth as confessional womb; final image carries its after-glow as price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Projection booth functions as micro-setting: heat, grime, sprocket rhythm constrain Maren’s body and pacing. Filmstrip as tool-as-setting governs the final gesture; its label “UNSENT” charges the closure. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV—cellulose scent, carbon-arc heat, mechanical heartbeat—never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography tracked cleanly from banister to shelf to projector to screen.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“to find where unused love is stored”—signaled in paragraph 4; tightening occurs when Maren realizes the love is stored in the film itself, foreclosing her observer stance. One meaningful escalation beat: threading the film commits her to steward the love, with visible cost (her own letter relinquished). No external antagonist; pressure is internal/situational, coherent under Accumulative lens. Cost legible: she exits into “ghost of light,” bearing the archive’s after-glow.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from premise inversion: unexpressed love becomes artifact, not absence. Subtext carried by object-handling—rubber band crumbles, film breathes—avoids thesis statements. Final image reweights prior motifs (letters, light, silence) without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect: reader forced to inventory their own “unused love,” proving resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Maren “listens to objects,” “walks halls without moving,” notices “cataracts of grime on lenses.” Syntax mirrors spatial mind—layered clauses like film splice. No head-hopping; POV distance stable. Rhythm modulates: long sentences for psychometry waves, staccato for projector clatter. No dialogue, so voice purity uninterrupted.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</question>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings rotate; no template cadence detected. Density high—each sentence advances image or motive. Metaphors consistent (cellulose cathedral, mechanical heartbeat) without mixed logic. Zero paraphrase loops; no filter-verb stacks. Minor elevated diction (“psychometry,” “silver halide”) justified by POV intellect. Final line crisp, image-driven.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</question>
<comment>Premise—psychometric archivist of orphaned love letters—feels fresh yet inevitable. Synthesis of extinct cinema tech + emotional archaeology yields specific charge. Risk in quiet, non-dialogue lyricism paid off by Charged Poise ending. No recognizable pop-culture echo; transformation test passed—plot would collapse without exact film-strip mechanic.</comment>
