<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Maren’s scarred body, pillbox habit, and final choice to “carry the cipher key and her scarred body” embody contradictory impulses—self-erasure vs. re-entry—under pressure. The burn scars tighten in the cold, anchoring Varna trauma in every physical move; the micro-choice to sweep the snow smooth externalizes the decision to stop hiding without therapeutic label-speak. Interiority stays concrete and particular; no epiphany is declared, only enacted. Earned Stasis closure is fully motivated: she forecloses the safe exile path she spent two years building.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration: the act of erasing the snow-code crystallizes a before/after—she was touchable, is still climbing, and now chooses to re-enter the game. Causal lens holds: because Dmitri left the snow message, therefore she decodes, therefore she destroys it and commits. Cost is legible in the final image—scars ache, mist curls, apartment remains unfurnished; no reset. One continuous scene, orientation anchored by word 60; no ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Granite lip, thawing crocuses, and snow-shadow depth are filtered through Maren’s recon gaze; every detail doubles as tactical data or somatic memory. The pillbox operates as micro-setting, constraining the final choice—its compass rose literally orients her toward the coordinates. Weather is not backdrop; the thaw clock forces decoding speed and self-destruction. Spatial choreography is clean: switchback, summit, bluff edge track without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“come in from her own exile”—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightens when the cipher forces a binary: erase message (stay dead) or keep it (return). Protagonist agency drives the escalation: her decoding, memorizing, and sweeping the snow constitute the decisive turn that forecloses anonymity. Cost is visible—scars pull, bedsheet-covered apartment is abandoned. One meaningful tightening suffices; no external antagonist needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of “building something that can bear the weight of what happened” emerges through the snow-message metaphor—information that self-destructs yet endures inside her. No explicit thesis is stated; the final image of pale light through mist reweights earlier “silver hush” from concealment to tentative reopening. Subtext operates in the half-buried stones and the covered mirror—objects speak instead of narrator. Ambiguity lingers: Dmitri alive, network still burned, cost unmeasured.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-close distance remains steady; perceptual signature is espionage-tactile—depth of boot print, spacing of stones, ache of scar tissue. Syntax lengthens during decoding to mimic analytical precision, then shortens at decision: “She memorized.” No head-hopping; free indirect stays clean. Diction stays within Maren’s professional lexicon; no corporate register drift. Dialogue absent by design—voice carries via interior action.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is sparse, selective—“mist lay like a silver hush” appears once and frames tone. High information density: “burn scars pulled tight beneath her jacket” simultaneously shows cold, pain, backstory, and stakes. No scaffold, no mixed metaphors, no filter-verb stacks; final paragraph breathes without slack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>“Codes in accumulated snow” as self-erasing dead drop is fresh, grounded, and inevitable once taught. Espionage tropes—burned spy, pillbox, handler—are re-embodied through scar tissue and meteorological clock rather than gadgetry. Emotional specificity: exile as self-constructed architecture of bedsheets and unfurnished apartments. Risk taken in quiet, accumulative structure pays off in resonant final image.</comment>
