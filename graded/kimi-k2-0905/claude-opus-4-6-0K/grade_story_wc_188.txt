<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Luma’s interior contradiction—simultaneously broke and alight with artisan pride—surfaces in her tactile handling of the rag knot and the mosaic, embodying the “serious playfulness” brief. The final renunciation (free display) is earned by the tile message and the felt cost of scarcity, visible when she inventories “leftover powder, salvaged casings.” Chant and flame craft give her a perceptual signature distinct from generic wanderers. Slight drift into interpretive summary when she “laughs…recognizing a dare” keeps this just shy of 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the mosaic’s imperative reweights the sky from given to made, and Luma’s choice to burn for free carries undeniable social cost under Accumulative lens. Causality holds: because the note exists, therefore she reframes vocation; because war dried festivals, therefore she refuses the gravity of despair. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 4 and remain stable. One micro-turn—silence to chapel voice—suffices for this length; no escalation cap triggered.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The fortress’s crumbling/jasmine architecture constrains her path and supplies the phosphor light she times her read against; environment directly shapes tactics. Body-as-setting appears through calloused fire-spinning hands and boot-rhythm against flagstones. Selective sensory hierarchy—smell of jasmine, green lichen glow—mirrors internal refusal to succumb to grief. Spatial choreography remains clean across causeway → chapel → dome ascent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—wonder vs. despair—signaled in paragraph 3; pressure tightens when message reframes her scarcity into obligation to burn. Agency: she decides on free display, paying with limited resources; cost is material and social (no fee, possible ridicule). Escalation is Accumulative: tile discovery deepens meaning rather than flips plot. Coincidence absent; no reversals required at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: war-starved festivals, mosaic dare, kerosene rag—never from abstract sermon. Final image of her carrying “the fire out…like a sentence she intended to finish” offers non-literal answer to hopelessness without moral tag. Subtext operates in the act of reading floor-tiles rather than declaring meaning. Serious playfulness remains coherent yet modulated under night-wide stakes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: fireworks artisan who sees fuses, wind vectors, chrysanthemum bursts in negative space. Rhythm flexes—long lyrical cadence for approach, staccato for inventory, chant echo for return—under control. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk zero. POV distance stable; knowledge stays character-bound (she cannot know predecessor’s life, only tiles).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Read-aloud ear confirms varied sentence music; no template cadence clusters. Figurative language sparse—only two metaphors, both load-bearing (“fortress bloomed,” “sky…something holy”). No mixed metaphors or synonym loops detected. Information density high: one sentence often advances scene, character, and atmosphere simultaneously (“She set down her pack…test ignition points”).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fusion of post-war shell, fireworks craft, and tile-graffiti feels non-obvious yet inevitable; transformation test passed—swap florist for pyrotechnist and logic collapses. Fresh angle on defiance-of-despair trope via artisanal spectacle. Risk of lyric accumulative structure is embraced and repaid by resonant closure image. No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
