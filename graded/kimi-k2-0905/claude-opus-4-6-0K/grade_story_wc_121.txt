<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid—hovering bones, fractured selves folding like wings—and every rune-press is a micro-choice that exposes a value hierarchy. The final grounded step lands as earned renunciation: she trades weightless omnipotence for mortal heaviness, and the cost (lost tablet, lost futures) is legible. Momentary drift into abstract self-diagnosis (“conquered it not by solving…”) slightly blurs the embodied arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: because she presses the timestamps in the quantum window, timelines collapse and gravity regains jurisdiction. The tablet’s disintegration and her first footfall deliver unmistakable Decisive Change with felt cost. Orientation is secured early by concrete anchors (viaduct, moss-light, hovering height). Lens stays causal throughout; no ambiguity at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The viaduct’s bioluminescent moss functions as both clock and conduit—its flare intensifies with each rune-press, directly shaping pacing and stakes. Rain-drop puddle becomes the literal portal, constraining the timing of every action. Spatial choreography is clean; bodies, distances and object states track without drift. Environment is not backdrop—it is the mechanism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—retrieve an intact self from infinite splintering—is signaled in the first paragraph and tightened with each rune. Escalation is causal: pressing runes progressively collapses live options until only one corridor remains. The price (surrender of flight, eternal cycles, tablet itself) is visible on the final beat. Pressure peaks exactly at the ripple threshold; no off-stage resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme of wholeness-through-loss emerges from action: collapsing timelines literalizes the cost of integration. The final image—dawn dimming the moss—reconfigures “darkening brightness” from menace to honest illumination without moralizing. No thematic thesis is spoken; meaning is imaged. Ambiguity lingers: eternity still waits on the horizon, refusing tidy comfort.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person maintains tight psychic distance, filtering cosmic events through Maren’s body and perception. Syntax lengthens under existential weight, then fractures into staccato rune-press beats, mirroring timeline collapse. No head-hop; knowledge stays strictly bounded to what she can sense. Voice is distinctive, consistent, and pressure-responsive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; sentences carry dual duty—image and causality. Mixed metaphors (“light climbing curtains like fire”) are brief and purposeful, registering as sensory overload rather than muddle. No loops or scaffold; each paragraph advances situation, knowledge, or emotional charge. Clause rhythms accelerate through the seventh rune, then settle into grounded cadence, supporting closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The labyrinth-that-learns procedural twist feels inevitable in hindsight, reframing self-help tropes into ontological engineering. Timestamps-as-runes and rain-drop portal fuse mythic and quantum registers without gimmickry. Risk-taking (hovering protagonist, collapsing selves) sharpens stakes rather than obscuring them. Specificity of moss-lit viaduct anchors the conceit in memorable topography.</comment>
