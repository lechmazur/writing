<comment>The tuner’s cryptic patience is shown through embodied action (returning Maren’s shoe with tea) rather than label, and her final silent departure renounces thanks, a credible micro-cost. Yet she never faces an internal contradiction or trade-off; the same calm competence carries the day without visible struggle, so the arc flattens. Townsfolk reactions supply brief status pressure, but no relationship on the page forces her to recalibrate motives. Meets baseline for earned renunciation, but lacks the contradictory impulse required for 9-band.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each sonic strike layers resonance until the silence itself “collapses,” a clear Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost (the tuner’s unpaid labor and anonymity). Causality stays internal to the metaphorical register—sound maps, footfall cadence, river shift—without logical breaks. Orientation is anchored by the archway faces at ~100 words, well inside the 120-word guardrail. Closure beat (“the collapse came—not to Vareth, but to the silence”) reweights stakes on the page; cost is legible in her unthanked exit.</comment>

<comment>The archway’s shifting expressions function as micro-setting that constrains interpretation of time/tone and recurs in the closure image, satisfying 9+ gate. Cobblestone resonance, silent bell, and drifting river are filtered through communal perception rather than tourist catalog. Sensory choice skews auditory/tactile, matching the sound-revival concept. Spatial choreography stays clean across group footfall sequence; no floating rooms.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—reversing the town’s silence—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens through each sonic layering; the final bell-ring forecloses the option of permanent ghost-town status. Escalation is textural (density of resonance) rather than causal reversal; under Accumulative lens this is sufficient, but only one meaningful deepening occurs. Visible cost is present (tuner’s anonymity, townsfolk’s vulnerability to ridicule), yet no tactical constraint alters her method. Enough for 7-band, but lacks the persistent price or option foreclosure needed for 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges implicitly: communal memory can be re-tuned like a bell, but the restorer must remain unheard. Subtext lives in gesture (barefoot Maren weeping) and the tuner’s refusal of credit. Final image collapses silence rather than stating moral, satisfying resonance test. No thematic echo or final maxim pollutes the close.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains consistent distance and perceptual signature—stone faces “blank patience of centuries,” silence “pooling like rainwater.” Syntax lengthens in calm passages, compresses at strikes (“Windows rattled. Dust shook.”), supporting pressure. No head-hopping; interior access stays communal/observational. Dialogue sparse, idiomatically appropriate (“What does the bell call you…”).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean: no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Sentence rhythms vary from metronomic footfall clauses to single-beat fragments that mimic strikes. Information density high—each paragraph advances sonic map or communal response. Figurative language is sparse and coherent; no overwritten peaks obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses magical acoustics with dying-town revival—familiar bones, but execution is specific: footsteps as tuning mechanism, river persuaded rather than summoned. Risk is moderate (sound as civic engineering) yet coherence holds. Would not work unchanged if elements swapped; the fork’s blackness and footfall cadence are integral. No close echoes of canonical scenes.</comment>
