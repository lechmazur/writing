<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—curiosity without affect—remains vivid and embodied; the flicker at the end is earned because the baseball-to-labyrinth causality forces her to sit and listen. The “delicately robust” body note is shown once, not used to constrain later action, so the full cost isn’t yet legible on the page. Still, the stripped-wiring premise makes every micro-choice character-particular, and the final stance crystallizes with visible stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mara’s choice to sit and listen reconfigures the emotional rule-set with undeniable conceptual cost—the first synapse of empathy being rebuilt. Causality holds under the Causal lens: baseball → newspapers → labyrinth → Farrah → flicker, each link tightening options. The persistent constraint is the procedure itself, shaping every tactic; cost is legible in the final image of shared breathing across the cavern.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The bioluminescent lake is not postcard scenery: its warm water and color-shifting tunnels literally branch the choice-set, while the baseball’s silver ink catches the glow to cue memory. Spatial choreography is clean—stone edge, ankle-deep water, narrowing tunnel, wall-sit encounter—anchoring the two-character crucible. Environment charges the final image: the organisms’ pointless light reframes Mara’s “so what” into the first glimmer of shared witness.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recovering empathy—tightens once: seven tunnels collapse into one when she steps into the lake, and again when sitting forecloses flight. Pressure is causal and visible: the procedure’s emotional void versus the labyrinth’s forced confrontation. Cost is on-page: the flicker of feeling itself is the first painful installment of a debt she had surgically erased.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: empathy not as moral imperative but as evolutionary accident—organisms producing light for no one until someone sees. The baseball’s dated signature reweights time itself as a reversible loop, making conscience a traveler that arrives before guilt. Final image reframes prior cruelty as unpaid energy debt now beginning to accrue interest.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains tight psychic distance; perceptual signature is clinical, almost autopsy-like—“delicately robust,” “jaded wonder”—mirroring the surgical flatness. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for cavern awe, staccato beats (“She chose the third tunnel. Not for any reason.”) for affective null. No head-hopping; every filter verb serves the voice.</comment>

<comment>Prose is lean yet luminous: “trembling, underwater glow that pulsed like breathing” packs sensory triad without metaphor pile-up. Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances knowledge or stakes. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line breathes with the organisms, recharging the motif.</comment>

<comment>Time-travel baseball as conscience-bomb is a fresh synthesis; the labyrinth as neurological rehab ward subverts both sci-fi and redemption tropes. Risk—stripping protagonist of all feeling—could collapse into cold gimmick, but specificity of black-site skillset and bioluminescent setting makes the concept inevitable in hindsight. Emotional truth outweighs surface novelty: empathy as invasive surgery on the self.</comment>
