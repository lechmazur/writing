<comment>Maren’s embodied amnesia and the throat-song epiphany are concrete and particular; the swaddling micro-choice is visible cost. Interior contradiction (keeper who keeps nothing) stays active in scene. The closing renunciation—“she would not remember this tomorrow”—earns its stoic acceptance via prior causality and the visible price of cyclical memory loss. Voice and action remain coherent under pressure; no diagnostic label-speak.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: mirrored orchard → mica refraction → root-borne song → dawn-child glow. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) taught by line 3; pattern pays off at closure when layered light reweights meaning. Closure is Charged Poise: dawn unspools, Maren lifts child, cost is the eternal return of forgetting. Persistent constraint—memory rot—shapes the final image and future tactics.</comment>

<comment>The greenhouse’s iron ribs, silver bark, and mica window constrain every beat: warmth test, song conduit, light-splitting climax. Dew-soaked linen and phosphorescent moss are tactile tools, not postcard flora. Spatial choreography stays clean: palm on mica → kneeling by roots → lifting child to window. Environment mirrors internal flicker yet never stalls momentum.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—rekindle realm or perish in endless night—signaled in first 100 words. One meaningful tightening: song infection through roots collapses abstract hope into visible dawn-color returning to the child. Cost is legible: Maren’s certain future amnesia. Agency stays interior (sing, swaddle) yet alters world; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from iterated image-pattern: swaddling cloth → wrapped dawn → world re-swaddled in beginning. “Bound release” tonally modulates from tight linen to open sky without moralizing. Final image answers the thematic question—can a world forget and still begin?—with non-literal, resonant yes. No abstract thesis statements; meaning grows from particular sensory particulars.</comment>

<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains consistent perceptual signature: temperature of mica, rhythm of arrhythmic moss, throat that remembers what mind cannot. Syntax breathes with song cadence; no head-hopping. Filter verbs (“she felt”) serve psychic distance shifts at emotional crests. Diction stays within plausible lexicon of an orchard-keeper yet achieves textured musicality.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Rhythm varies from long horticultural vistas to staccato “stay.” Information density high: dew-linen does double duty as care and catalyst. No mixed metaphors; mirror-world optics remain internally consistent. Minor scaffold: “each village had contributed...” sentence could trim, but artifact never obscures causality or dulls final glow.</comment>

<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: memory-loss as photosynthesis, dawn as swaddled infant, song as mycelial contagion. Premise commits fully to anti-mirror world logic without retreat. Risk—lyric repetition of forgetting—heightens coherence rather than gimmick. Transformation test fails if any element swapped; specificity is inseparable from emotional arc.</comment>
