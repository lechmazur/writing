<comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied—“everything burned at a frequency too high for sound.” The micro-choice to write after four years of silence is earned by the envelope reveal, with cost scaled to length. No contradictory impulses staged simultaneously; the turn is singular, not clashing. Still, the moment of mask-slip is summarized, not dramatized, keeping it just shy of 9.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: she writes an unpublishable poem, accepting perpetual censorship—felt cost legible in “the poem would never be published. She knew this...in her blood.” Accumulative lens holds: envelope discovery → pattern break → stance crystallization. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by word 88. One caveat: causality is interior and lyric, not externalized, but the lens is taught and honored through the final image.</comment>

<comment>Observatory-as-body: cracked telescope, iron grating, thin air constrain breath and thought. Storm below literally limits escape and mirrors internal lightning. Micro-setting (darkroom timer) is handled twice, reweighted when she stops resetting it. Environment charges the final image—“lightning painted the clouds in scripture”—meeting 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“cartography of scars” vs. state silence—signaled early. Tightening occurs when the envelope forces the choice: remain silent or write. Agency is renunciation: she writes knowing publication is impossible; price is permanent erasure. Cost is visible, but because the ministry never re-enters the scene, external pressure is memory rather than live threat, capping at 8.4.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through pattern: scars as maps, silence as nation, storm as scripture. No moralizing; final image reweights prior material—“each scar pointed...toward morning.” Subtext operates in object handling (timer abandoned, envelope opened). Ambiguity lingers: is “morning” futurity or simply the next blank day? Complexity preserved without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is consistent and lyric: “air so thin it could rarefy thought,” “lightning stitched the clouds like surgical thread.” Syntax lengthens under awe, contracts at the end—“she wrote on.” No head-hopping; single POV stable. Compression taught early (“mouth drawn shut by strangers”) and paid off. Distinct rhythmic control under pressure meets 9+ bar.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High density: “altitude strips oxygen, until only essential things survived.” No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Mixed metaphors are deliberate and coherent (lightning as surgical thread, scripture). One strained phrase—“furiously tranquil center”—is self-contradictory by intent, not accident. No artifacts touch the closure beat; read-aloud rhythm modulates naturally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Censored poet in decommissioned observatory mapping scars via storm-light is fresh synthesis. Trope of state censorship is transformed through embodied meteorology and timer-as-ritual. Risk of lyric overload is taken and held without clarity collapse. Could not swap setting or object without breaking pattern; specificity anchors universals.</comment>
