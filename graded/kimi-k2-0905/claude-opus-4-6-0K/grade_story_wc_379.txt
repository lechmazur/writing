<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marguerite’s “listening heals” creed is stated early and pays off in her refusal to force the mailbox, but her interiority stays general—no contradictory impulse is dramatized in scene. The final acceptance of the locket is passive; she does not choose under visible pressure, so the cost feels intellectual rather than visceral. No micro-choice on the page tightens or forecloses a path; the emotional shift is narrated, not embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: neighborhood fragments layer until the stranger’s arrival reweights the mailbox’s meaning. Closure is a quiet CR—grief is released by being witnessed—yet the price (the woman’s tears, Marguerite’s tacit guardianship) is only implicitly transferred to the locket in the window; the moment itself lacks a palpable sting. Causality is loose but coherent under the lyric mosaic; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dawn courtyard is vividly sketched through selective sensory detail (bruised orange light, jasmine trellis, iron scent of mailbox) and filters via Marguerite’s curator gaze. The mailbox acts as micro-setting that constrains her choice not to pry; the locket later charges the window display, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography remains clean; weather and demolition noise serve as causal foil to stillness.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can silence be transformed without violation—is signaled early and deepens as neighborhood voices accrete. Yet escalation is atmospheric, not tactical; no option is visibly foreclosed for Marguerite. The construction din introduces pressure but does not force a new tactic; the woman’s appearance is coincident, not earned reversal. Cost is conceptual, not dramatized on Marguerite.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme—unspoken grief released through communal witness—emerges via recurrent mailbox/locket pairing rather than statement. Final window card reweights the objects without moralizing, achieving resonant ambiguity. Subtext in courtyard gossip scenes carries implication effectively. No thematic echo or tidy maxim intrudes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Marguerite’s perceptual filter: jeweler metaphor, scent of rust, catalog of discarded lives. Syntax modulates with longer cadences for dawn stillness, shorter fragments for construction intrusion. No head-hopping; psychic distance stable. Dialogue minimal but differentiated (Tomasz’s ceramic finch, Dina’s postal diction).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is textured yet disciplined: strong verbs (“bolted,” “calcified”), selective metaphor, no synonym loops. One mixed metaphor (“eye of a sandstorm … bruised orange light”) is minor. Information density high; each sentence advances image or premise. No scaffold or filter-verb stacks; rhythm breathes with scene shifts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The locked-mailbox-as-absence motif is familiar, but the curator-listener angle and neighborhood oral mosaic refresh it. Specificity of Krakow letters, ceramic finch, and dawn courtyard keeps the concept anchored; removal would collapse the texture. Risk is moderate—quiet lyric rather than twist—but coherence justifies the choice.</comment>
