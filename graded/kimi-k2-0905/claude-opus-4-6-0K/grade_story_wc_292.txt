<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren’s contradictory mix of archival precision and impulsive grave-robbing is dramatized in the moment she pries the copper nail—interior contradiction made flesh. The micro-choice to read the journals aloud in the empty station converts inherited guilt into public reclamation, paying off the earlier coffin theft with visible cost: she must now shoulder the appeal. Interiority stays concrete, map-librarian-specific (“water-warped and swollen,” “capitalized letters into coordinates”) and avoids stock epiphany language. The only drag is a trace of diagnostic self-explanation (“Now she understood”) that briefly abstracts the beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A single causal chain—arrival → discovery → decipher → appeal—tightens across one night in one location; every beat grows because/therefore links. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Maren commits to a public appeal that will expose her family to fresh scrutiny; the cost is legible in the final image of her reading coded stanzas aloud while the jet stream erases old charts. The copper nail bookmark literalizes the irreversible step; no off-stage shortcuts or soft resets. Orientation is clean by 75 words; journals as cipher-teaching object is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The weather station’s dripping radomes and ozone-tasting air constrain every action—mugs left behind, spray misting the journals—so setting actively damages the evidence Maren needs. Tools (cracked porthole, plastic sheeting) become salvage instruments, charging the final image when she seals the journals. Spatial choreography is tight: rescue boat timetable, lower lab reachable only after wind shift, roof instruments she’ll never read. Micro-setting (copper nail as bookmark) reweights the closure, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—clear Astrid’s name—signals early and intensifies once: after deciphering, reversal becomes legally possible but socially dangerous. The single tightening beat (“she would file the appeal”) forecloses silence forever; price is the family’s reopened shame. Agency is entirely Maren’s—no rescuers, no off-stage luck. Pressure stays causal under the Causal lens; the shifted jet stream literalizes irreversible change mirrored in her decision.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges silently from the parallel between rewritten weather maps and rewritten family history—both made useless overnight. The copper nail and coded stanzas reprice exile from permanent disgrace to reversible bureaucratic glitch. No explicit moral; final image of unheard weather data transmits the cost of truth. Subtext operates in gesture (nail as bookmark, not symbol) and silence (no reply from dead grandmother).</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Maren’s map-librarian perceptual filter: bathymetric poetry, coordinate capital letters, ozone tasting of “wet paper.” Syntax tightens under pressure—“pulse loud in her ears” compresses to short declaratives during decoding. No head-hop; psychic distance contracts smoothly from outside observation to interior cipher-work. Voice is distinct without forced lyricism; no register drift into academese.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or synonym loops. Information is double-loaded: “journals…not weather logs…older—salvaged, she realized, from the wreck” advances plot, world, and character realization in one line. Metaphors stay physically coherent (“cluster of pale fungi,” “salt spray,” “spongey dread”). Minor scaffold: “she realized” is a filter verb but occurs only once and is justified by POV distance shift. Closure line breathes cleanly without purple uplift.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fusing wartime cipher-poetry, climate-science station, and modern archive appeals yields a fresh triangulation of “reversible exile.” The copper nail as both grave-robbery evidence and bookmark transforms a gothic prop into bureaucratic tool—specific to this story. Risk: quiet ending, no body count, yet stakes feel large because personal honor and national history intersect. The concept of bathymetric poetry hiding resistance data is non-obvious and inevitable once revealed.</comment>
