<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Wren’s compulsive orderliness is viscerally shown through seed-sorting ritual and micro-monuments; the final surrender to self-planting is credible because the text has tethered her identity to imposed precision. Interiority is concrete (“shell must feel when the shoot pushes through”), but emotional contradiction is muted—no moment where orderliness actively blocks her next step—so the change feels gently inevitable rather than wrenching. Still, the embodied cost (root-threaded fingers, moonstone eyes) lands on-page, satisfying the arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of fallen leaves + tiny monuments accretes until the speck reframes perception. Orientation is swift—who/where/when clear by line 3. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: “leaves fell toward her like children running home” crystallizes her new receptor state and carries undeniable conceptual cost (she forfeits pure observer status). One minor loop: “She had spent eleven seasons…” paragraph re-states prior info without new pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setting is economically distilled: suspended arbor, cloud-roots, ash air; every descriptor attached to Wren’s seed-handling or monument-building. The workbench’s “thin, precious layer of earth” becomes micro-setting that literally seeds the climax. Spatial logic holds—leaves fall sideways, she catches them mid-air—supporting the fantastical frame. Only the wider cosmology (how she eats, sleeps) is absent, but at this length the omissions are acceptable.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode leaf-message—stated early. Mid-story introduction of moonstone speck supplies the single meaningful intensification, re-weighting the pattern recognition task into self-recognition. Because escalation is one-step and coincidental (speck simply appears), pressure plateaus rather than tightens further. Still, her final act of “planting herself” is active and irreversible, meeting the cost requirement for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of interpretive devotion versus self-inclusion emerges organically through tangible acts—sorting, charting, monument-building—never abstract assertion. Final image reconfigures earlier material: monuments built for “forgotten things” now include her own body, re-weighting the ethic of caretaking. Folklore functions as lived reality rather than moral lesson. Ambiguity survives: is she now arbor-root or still human sorter? Complexity intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays pinned to Wren’s sensory filter; perceptual signature is tactile-acoustic (“faint hum each seed made,” “opalescent patience that moonstone always carried”). Syntax is textured but controlled—no congested metaphor stacks. Rhythm modulates: longer cadences for reflection, abrupt fragments (“Something.”) at recognition beats. No dialogue, so no voice-split risk; narrative idiom remains internally consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet limpid; most sentences perform double duty (advance plot + render atmosphere). Figurative layers occasionally neighbor each other (“pale moss like old women in green shawls”) but stop short of overwrought clutter. One paraphrase loop: “Each autumn she charted… Each autumn she came close…” Otherwise, cadences breathe, paragraph cuts are purposeful, opening and closing lines carry framing force. Clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Skyborne arbor where leaves deliver sideways script is fresh, yet grounded in botanic detail and ritual labor that keeps it from pure whimsy. Moonstone speck as decoding key is a precise, non-obvious pivot. Micro-monument habit recontextualized into self-sacrifice offers an inventive closure image. The synthesis feels particular to this piece; swap seeds or speck and the emotional math collapses, passing the transformation test.</comment>
