<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Maren’s interior contradiction—grief as soluble equation versus lived ache—grounds every beat. The glass-eye handling, whispered variables, and final ladder-climb all manifest the same hierarchy: knowledge before feeling, yet feeling wins. Micro-choices (kneeling, placing eyes, gathering them back) track a credible shift from proof-seeking to practice-acceptance. Earned Stasis lands with visible cost: she climbs out still motherless, but now breathing around the stone.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory fragment (drip, chipped orbit, copper taste) layers density until the final “equation was not finished” crystallizes Charged Poise. Closure reweights the premise—no answer, only iterative sitting—with undeniable conceptual cost. No orientation debt; cavern, night, and solitary actor are anchored by line 3. Pattern taught early (grief = equation) pays off in the last line’s refusal of solution.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cavern orchard, mosaic stepping-stone, and glass eyes are not backdrop but apparatus: the dripping water feeds the trees that yield the copper taste that informs her data set. Every object constrains the ritual—eyes must sit on exact chips, lichen supplies the glow. Spatial choreography is flawless; ladder, sinkhole, stalactite distances remain consistent. Final image of “roots in limestone” literalizes the setting as her own ribcage.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“solve disappearance with math”—tightens into “endure unsolvability” through one accumulative deepening rather than causal reversals. Each numbered variable adds weight until the glass-eye glow signals the limit of the method; the cost is the perpetual return, the open equation. No fake escalation, no antagonist needed; the cave itself is the pressure. Closure forecloses the fantasy of QED but not the ritual, trading certainty for practice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: the human need for pattern collides with the impossibility of closure when a body is never found. Subtext resides in the eyes made for an un-mounted fox—sight given to the dead that still cannot see for her. Final reprise of “equation was not finished” conceptually reweights every prior chipped fragment: meaning is iterative, not conclusive. No moralizing; resonance lingers in the chest-stone image.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains tight psychic distance; diction (“dovetail these incompatible values”) mirrors Maren’s quantifier mind. Syntax lengthens during hypothesizing, then fractures into shorter units under the eyes’ glow, aligning breath with beat. No head-hop, no filter-verb bloat. Perceptual signature—mineral counts, orbital diagrams—stays consistent and character-specific.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is high-density yet musical: “roots threading through limestone like veins through a body that refused to die” performs three jobs—geology, corporeal metaphor, emotional persistence—without purple bloat. Zero loops, zero scaffold. Sentence rhythm modulates from languid descriptive coils to the clipped final clause “Neither was she,” mirroring her ascent. No mixed metaphors, no register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fusion of subterranean orchard, taxidermy eyes, and emotional calculus is highly specific; no trope catalog provides that recipe. The “mathematics of emotion” premise risks abstraction yet is grounded in tactile ritual and copper-taste fruit. Risk-taking—quiet ending, no corpse, no villain—heightens coherence rather than gimmickry. Transformation test fails: swap any single component and the entire crystalline lattice collapses.</comment>
