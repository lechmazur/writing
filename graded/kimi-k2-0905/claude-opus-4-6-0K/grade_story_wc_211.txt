<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mordecai’s interior contradiction—scholarly detachment vs. the involuntary grief that leaks through dead syllables—is dramatized in the moment he lifts the wax shaving; the micro-choice to chant “proto-Elamite” embodies the cost (prophecy he must now carry). The rosemary memory, though reflective, is anchored to a concrete cue and tilts his present stance toward immersion, earning the renunciation of pure observation. Still, the final beat is a decision to write, not an irreversible action with visible price; the cost remains conceptual, capping the arc just below the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the prophecy’s date-stamped flood reweights every prior archival act, and the cost is legible in the line “hoping someone alive would think to read it.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of grief-pattern tightens into prediction—without causality breaks. Orientation is clean within 120 words; the rooftop orchard, foghorn silence, and Mordecai’s vocation are anchored. One hairline slip: the flood prophecy is revealed in summary rather than dramatized beat, keeping the score just under 9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The hydroponic apple trees 72 floors up, wax shaving curved “like a dark fingernail,” and rosemary oil stinging child-eyes are selective, POV-filtered details that constrain the method (immersion via sensory trauma). The dome of pearl-gray fog physically presses the glass, charging the final image as Mordecai writes beneath it. Micro-setting—the shaving in his hand—literally reweights the world-rule: grief phonemes become prediction. One tiny lapse: “six dead civilizations” is a tourist-list flourish that momentarily breaks economy.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can emotion be archived without being consumed by it?—tightens when the accidental prophecy forecloses passive scholarship; the only remaining option is to warn in a language no one speaks. Pressure escalates via density: each dead syllable adds existential mass until the final image of writing under fog. The cost is conceptual but undeniable—he now carries knowledge of an unpreventable flood. A crisper material loss (ink, blood, tenure) would have pushed the band higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: preservation is complicity—archiving grief literally births future grief. The rosemary sprig’s return reconfigures childhood memory as methodological origin, paying off the immersion thesis. Final image reweights the entire concept: language is not a vault but a pipeline that leaks prophecy. No moralizing, only the felt cost of knowledge that cannot be shared in time.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is scholar-poet, noticing “cuneiform-adjacent script” and “velvet disquiet.” Syntax lengthens under contemplation then fractures into shorter units at the prophecy reveal, mirroring cognitive strain. No head-hopping or register drift; dead-language terms are POV-plausible. One clause—“institutions that no longer existed”—edges toward editorial wink, barely audible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with beats: long horticultural sentences slow to the staccato “He set down his stylus.” Figurative language is sparse, high-yield—“foghorn…pressed…like a living thing.” Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or knowledge. A single mixed echo—“velvet disquiet” appears twice within 40 words—ticks the repetition box without dulling closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Emotional-archiving-as-prophecy is a fresh synthesis of linguistics and cli-fi, grounded in the specific 1903 Cornish wax shaving. The rooftop orchard monument to impermanence is an image not seen before, yet inevitable here. Risk—using extinct phonemes as plot engine—pays off because the story commits fully; no safety-hedging glossary or footnote. Transformation test fails if Mordecai becomes a generic archivist; his oath-scribe vocation is irreplaceable.</comment>
