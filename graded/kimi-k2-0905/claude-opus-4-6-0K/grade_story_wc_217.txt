<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Maren’s quietly stubborn vocation—finding language for “the grace that fracture reveals”—drives every beat: she pockets the broken feather, chooses to sit with the boy’s grief, and rewrites her poem mid-scene. The boy’s single micro-choice (coiling the string) mirrors hers, so the relationship alters both without tidy repair. Interiority stays concrete (“she had never believed in that kind of easy mending”) and the final endurance costs her the old poem-image, a visible forfeiture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Maren abandons the “woven dawns” metaphor and accepts the hush beside the boy—cost is the forfeited poem and the kite’s loss remains unfixed. Causal chain: snapped kite string → child’s cry → Maren offers feather → mutual tending → poem reconceived; each step narrows options under the Accumulative lens. Orientation anchored by word 80; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The cobalt lagoon’s bruised after-rain light and wet stones under bare feet constrain pacing and posture; the feather’s broken barbs and the kite’s snapped thread act as micro-settings that directly shape the final image. Selective sensory triage—visual bruise-light, tactile stone-cold, auditory child-cry—mirrors Maren’s narrowed attention. Environment, body, and tool jointly charge the closing “string of the horizon” image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—find precise language for beauty in fracture—tightens when the kite failure forces an immediate test: comfort the boy or keep writing. The feather’s re-presentation becomes the single deepening that reweights her stake, trading poem for shared witness. Cost is the relinquished “woven dawns” draft, felt on-page. No reversal, but one meaningful tightening suffices for 700-word Accumulative arc.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through contiguous images of broken flight—feather, kite—culminating in the unsentimental insight that beauty persists in un-mended stillness. No explicit thesis; the boy’s “It’s still pretty” reframes the entire notebook project without moralizing. Ambiguity remains: the kite stays lost, the poem unfinished, yet meaning has repriced. Final image reweights all prior fracture-objects with quiet cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Maren’s perceptual filter: bruised light, tidal wrack, spaces between raindrops—diction never drifts into editorial gloss. Rhythm modulates from long lyrical cadences to the clipped final paragraph, mirroring her shift from observation to shared stillness. No head-hop; boy’s interior accessed only through audible breathing and finger-touch. Patterned elision (“the lagoon…always spoke in a voice she almost understood”) is taught early and paid off at close.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty: “She pressed the feather's broken tip against the page and used it to draw a line beneath her latest attempt” advances action, reveals tool use, and signals poem failure. Figurative control stays precise—no mixed metaphors—and scaffold is minimal. One paraphrase loop (“jerked and climbed, jerked and climbed”) is purposeful mimicry of kite motion, not artifact. Closure beat is clean, uncluttered.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The “broken-is-beautiful” conceit risks cliché, but the kite-string snap externalizes it in a fresh, time-locked instant, and the drake feather repurposes a familiar nature object as stylus and teaching relic. Synthesis feels inevitable: shoreline poet + post-storm lagoon + fractured flight equals un-mended grace. No derivative templates or pop-culture echoes; specificity of cobalt light and bronze barb tips anchors universality.</comment>
