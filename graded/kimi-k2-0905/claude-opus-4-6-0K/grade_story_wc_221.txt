<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren’s interior contradiction—grief for the Array versus relief at her “blessing”—is embodied in the cold glass, the slowed pulse of stars, and the micro-choice to linger until her cells desynchronize. The charcoal session externalizes her hierarchy of values: exile-status is accepted cost for continued access to temporal truth. Final transmission is earned renunciation of pariah-shame, paid for by weeks of bodily drift. Voice stays individual; no therapy-speak flattens the beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the sketch re-maps the sky, the compass rose re-weights her exile into vocation, and the sent message forecloses lingering in guilt. Causal chain: residual field → cellular drift → grandmother’s ritual → emergent compass → channel opened; each beat tightens options. Orientation anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity. Cost is legible: “fractions of a second slower” now weaponized as credential.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The deck itself—curved transparisteel, slowed star-pulse, dormant console—functions as micro-setting that constrains her only viable action: look, draw, transmit. Temporal gradient is tactile (“cold glass”) and later causal (her out-of-sync cells justify trust from Cygnus). Grandmother’s compass applique is recalled object-as-setting that charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: astronomer notices color-temperature, not tourist spectacle.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she remain frozen in shame or re-enter forbidden inquiry—tightens once: the charcoal reveals a heading she cannot un-see, foreclosing passive exile. No external antagonist needed; ethical stigma supplies coherent pressure. Agency is crystallized in the single line “I am ready to look again,” forfeiting anonymity. Cost is visible: she trades crew-approval for temporal solitude and professional risk.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges: time as oceanic rather than linear demands navigational courage instead of moral absolutes. Subtext operates in silence that “echoes” and in the grandmother’s folk-practice out-scientizing institutional ethics. No final moralizing; the sent sketch is the non-literal answer. Ambiguity lingers: will the collective exploit or save her? Complexity maintained.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited sustains astronomer’s perceptual signature—stars move “imperceptibly slower,” Vela’s remnant is “dense cluster,” ethics are “cognitive rights.” Syntax lengthens and contracts with dilation field, mirroring stretch. No head-hopping; psychic distance clean. Register shift to intimate familial idiom (“true north”) is earned by ritual beat. Dialogue absent by design; voice remains distinct under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: long clause mimics dilation, then clipped “She transmitted her sketch” propels closure. Metaphors are coherent—time as ocean, silence as echo—without mixed vehicles. No synonym loops; “temporally stretched” recurs only when causally active. Information density high: one sentence slips grandmother, colony seasons, and ritual origin. Minor scaffold: two adjacent “had been” in paragraph 3, but does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: grandmother’s low-tech star-mapping collides with relativistic astrophysics to produce ethical navigation. Temporal-pariah status repurposed as credential inverts standard persecution plot. Risk of lyric ellipsis (no antagonist, no dialogue) pays off through charged image. Could not swap compass rose or dilation field without collapsing logic; specifics are irreplaceable.</comment>
