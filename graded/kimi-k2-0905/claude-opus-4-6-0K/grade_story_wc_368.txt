<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sable’s interior contradiction—caution vs. the donor heart’s urgency—is embodied in every beat; the moment she presses her palm to the merged pulse, we see cost made flesh. No stock labels, only sensory, dye-master perception. The shift from observer to writer is credible because the morpho-wing trials earn it. secondary pressure (Oku) is minimal but sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each dawn’s light trial layers density until the wing’s vanishing act reweights the premise. Causality is interior but coherent—because she tracks light, therefore she sees the transparency that redefines Ren’s magnetism. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the blank page is the decisive cost, felt on the page. No orientation debt; transitions within the single scene are fluid.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Floating basalt slabs, cedar cloud-soak, morpho scales—every detail is filtered through Sable’s color-discipline, never tourist catalog. The tea house micro-setting constrains her movements and supplies the wing as experimental tool; environment thus governs choice. Spatial choreography is clean: wing-pin → window → journal → blank page. Atmosphere of valley-mist wonder is maintained without purple drift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—why some people magnetize stories—tightens through each light trial; the wing’s transparency is the meaningful escalation that forecloses her observer stance. Cost is conceptual but legible: she forfeits lifelong caution to write feeling. No coincidence; pressure is purely accumulative-textural. One deepening suffices for 740-word frame.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the morpho’s architecture-as-honesty: visibility through vanishing, story-magnetism through unforced structure. No moral stated; the blank page is the resonant non-literal answer. Subtext in Oku’s silent refill and the child’s mis-mailed drawing deepens the question without resolving it. Complexity—some are angled correctly—avoids pat sociology.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Sable’s dye-master eye: “color the way others read faces.” Syntax grows shorter under dawn pressure—“blue dissolved entirely into transparency”—mirroring the beat. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero; perceptual signature remains consistent. Register never exceeds her artisan lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>High information density: each sentence advances light-tracking, interior shift, or setting charge. Figurative control disciplined—no mixed metaphors, no filler filters. Minor scaffold: “she began, by tracking sun trails…” could lose the comma. Final line earns its lift without syntactic drumbeat. Read-aloud rhythm modulates with valley-mist breathing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Freshest synthesis: dye-master epistemology + donor-heart phenomenology + structural-color poetics. Risk of iridescence-as-theme is high, but piece avoids gimmick by grounding every insight in tactile experiment. The vanishing wing reprices “magnetize stories” without cliché. Proximity check: no echo of famous morpho scenes; specificity is earned.</comment>
