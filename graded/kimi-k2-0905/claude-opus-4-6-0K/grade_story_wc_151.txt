<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maren’s interiority is precise—her hesitation to speak her original name, the “window unsticking” moment—and her micro-choice to cross out the pseudonym is embodied and costly. The contradictory impulse between vanishing and being seen is held in scene, not summarized. Lumen remains a cipher, but that serves the stake: authenticity between two mask-makers. The arc lands in credible renunciation with felt social cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The causal spine holds: cracked cipher → coordinates → dawn meeting → chalk “beginning” → on-page name swap. Orientation is anchored by word 50; the arcade, dawn, and object states track cleanly. The closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost: the true name on paper that can never be recalled. Lens is causal throughout; no late ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The golden arcade is more than postcard: its derelict holograms mirror Maren’s obsolete identities, and the chalk mark on tile repurposes the childhood code into adult risk. Light angles (honey, rust) evolve with emotional exposure. The clipboard’s “absorbent” ebony surface becomes a micro-setting that literalizes her capacity to swallow light—until she refuses to.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—authenticity versus erasure—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when she must decide whether to mail her birth name. The chalk symbol is the single meaningful turn that forecloses retreat; once the mark is drawn, mailing the letter becomes inevitable. Cost is legible: irrevocable self-exposure to a stranger who may also be a fabrication.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The theme of slow trust versus instant disappearance emerges through the surface-mail conceit and the chalk code—children’s ephemera made durable. No moral is stated; the final image of two fabricators standing in dawn light reweights “real” as a shared performance that still burns. The aftereffect is a hush: identity as collaborative artefact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person close clings to Maren’s perceptual filter: she notices light absorption, ad copy, the texture of extinct paper. Syntax lengthens under emotion (“something crack open… not painfully”). No head-hop; Lumen’s voice arrives only as reported sound. Register stays within her plausible lexicon—no academic overreach.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “cathedral of forgotten tomorrows” marries grandeur with obsolescence, then tightens to “window unsticking.” No loops or paraphrase; each sentence advances stakes or texture. Metaphors stay coherent (glass→honey→rust). Final line cadence mirrors inhale/exhale of decision. Zero artifact in last third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The fusion of derelict futurism with hopscotch cryptography feels non-obvious yet inevitable. Surface-mail as erotic slow burn for identity-forgers is fresh; chalk code reframes children’s play as espionage. Risk is taken—two ciphers meeting with no guaranteed truth—yet clarity holds. Transformation test fails: swap names or setting and the emotional engine collapses.</comment>
