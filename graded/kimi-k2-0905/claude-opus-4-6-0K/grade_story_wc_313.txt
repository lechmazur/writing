<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Marta’s contradictory impulse—repressing vs reclaiming memory—is dramatized through the tactile photo and the decision to display it; the moment costs her the safety of forgetting and redefines her publicly. Elias’s “precisely humane” label is shown when he catalogs artifacts in an official report that could embarrass the dam authority, a visible risk. Both characters’ micro-choices (phone call, corkboard pinning, addendum filing) tighten the same stake. Interiority stays concrete; no stock labels. Closure choice is earned and irreversible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the chime sings again but now encodes communal memory; cost is the town’s looming re-submergence and Marta’s exposure of her mother’s image. Causal chain holds—silence→phone call→overlook→photos→gathering→addendum→chime—each step narrows options. Orientation secure within 120 words. One transition (kitchen→ridge) is clean. Lens stays Accumulatively Textural: pattern of recovered objects reweights meaning. Persistent constraint visible: water will rise again, stories now must live in air.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Copper wind-chime, mason-jar photos, and algae-streaked steeple recur as tactile objects that constrain choice (display vs conceal). Midnight ridgeway asphalt “like a blade” and “mirrored hush” atmosphere are filtered through Marta’s body. Spatial choreography clean: porch→kitchen→truck→overlook→corkboard. Weather (drought, first November gust) affects action. Setting subtly guides the public gathering decision via overlook sight-lines. Final image recharged by chime’s return. No credibility slips.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will the town’s memory survive re-submergence?—is signaled on page 1. Tightening occurs when Marta decides to pin the photo: personal secrecy foreclosed, communal witnessing enabled. Cost is social vulnerability and irreversible public identification. Escalation is Accumulative: each recovered artifact (chime silence, photos, label, steeple) increases density until the gathering crystallizes the new stance. No false coincidence; water’s return is external deadline, not savior.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of communal memory versus erasure emerges through objects (chime, bottle label, photos) rather than statement. Subtext in Elias’s quiet “Come see before full dark” implies complicity against erasure. Final image reweights silence from mourning to collective song—non-literal answer without moralizing. Complexity intact: water will still win, but meaning has shifted to human custody. No thematic echo clichés.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate stays anchored to Marta’s perceptual filter: “her breath caught,” “she let it sing.” Rhythm modulates—long reflective sentences on ridge, staccato phone beats. Diction within POV lexicon; no filter-verb stacks. Distinct hush cadence sustained, taught by opener, paid off in final line. Dialogue sparse, indirect, goal-driven. No head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. High density: “algae-streaked and resolute” does double descriptive and moral work. Figurative language sparse and purposeful—“water seeping through a crack in a wall” mirrors memory return. Zero paraphrase loops. Copy clean. Final line earns rhythmic resonance. No artifacts touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Drowned-town trope is refreshed through Accumulative/Textural recovery of specific artifacts (Harlan Blue label, Polaroids in mason jar). Sapphire liqueur and copper chime provide concrete sensory anchors not seen in generic flood stories. Choice to catalog stories in an official levee report is fresh institutional twist. Risk-taking in quiet lyric closure succeeds. Transformation test fails if swapped—details are irreplaceable.</comment>
