<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sable’s interior contradiction—needing sonic calm yet courting human turbulence—drives every micro-choice; the storm-glass clearing tracks visible emotional cost, earning her quiet renunciation at the end. Motives stay anchored in her vocation, not exposition. No secondary relationship pressure on-page, so that bullet is waived without penalty.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the vial’s perfect clearness reweights earlier prism light and audible hush, crystallizing Sable’s earned stance with undeniable felt cost. Accumulative lens holds—pattern of sensory density and cadence shift, not causal chain. Orientation anchored by word 40; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Copper receiver, storm-glass, and prism light serve as micro-setting that actively constrain Sable’s calibration tactics and charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy filters through her professional ear; spatial choreography remains coherent inside the gondola. Environment directly shapes the tactic of humming to marry terrace frequency.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will the crossing quiet these hearts—tightens once when foggy vial forces Sable to slow the car and hum; the clear vial signals foreclosed option to intervene further. Escalation is textural density under Accumulative lens; cost legible in her solitary return. No external reversals required at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of transit-as-transformation emerges through refracted light and shifting silence rather than statement; final image of “vaulting hush” reweights earlier train-whistle disruption without moralizing. Subtext resides in passenger gestures and vial state. Avoids tidy thesis while retaining coherent emotional aftereffect.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains tight psychic distance; perceptual signature rooted in sonic attention and crystalline imagery. Prose rhythm modulates—long refracted sentences for drift, single clause beats at disembarkation—without drumbeat monotony. No dialogue to test, yet voice remains distinct and consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Figurative language is selective—silver nerves, blade through silk—never clouds causality; no mixed metaphors or filler loops. High information density: sentence pairs carry atmosphere + action. Final line “silence finally teaching her” crystallizes without overwriting. Meets 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fusing meteorological barometer with emotional forecast refreshes the storm-glass trope; prism terrace drawn with specific sensory mechanics rather than generic sky-cable. Risky lyric structure pays off in resonant closure. Concept feels inevitable yet non-obvious, fully committed to its premise.</comment>
