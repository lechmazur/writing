<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Maren’s interior contradiction—professional curator of other people’s narratives who cannot script her own absolution—remains vivid; embodied grief in the jasmine hit and ugly cry feels earned. Micro-choice to hum the unread score beside the bottle crystallizes hierarchy of values. Cost of forever-missed goodbye lands, though apology speech slightly over-articulates what the gesture already shows.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure qualifies as Charged Poise: aroma-triggered memory reweights the scandal-cleaner myth she lives by, foreclosing perpetual deferral of grief. Causal chain intact—bottle → memory → named apology → walking the soon-gone orchard. One transition (outside after archive) is cleanly managed. Stakes and lens stable under Accumulative/Textural design; final cadence shift ("both too late and just in time") supplies undeniable cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Sensory triangulation—dust-sweet paper, jasmine ghost, rough bark—filters through Maren’s professional habit of "reading" atmospheres. Archive and orchard function as micro-settings that constrain options: silence of impending demolition forces the apology now. Spatial choreography clear; perfume bottle tracked across beats. Environment does not yet fully charge the final image, capping entry to high band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—deliver overdue apology before place vanishes—presses continuously; ticking orchard removal tightens the cadence. Single meaningful deepening occurs when scent memory strips her narrative armor, narrowing future avoidance. Cost legible: she forfeits the comfort of unfinished guilt. Escalation remains accumulative rather than causal-turn heavy, adequate for this lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of "imperfect miracles" emerges through pattern: strategic counter-narratives can soften but never erase loss. Subtext in humming an unreadable score implies acceptance of partial connection—she can’t perfect the melody yet still finishes it with presence. Final reprise of orchard silence reweights earlier marketing metaphors without moralizing. Complexity retained: apology changes her, not history.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited sustains perceptual signature—synesthetic blending of scent, sound, and PR jargon. Rhythm modulates from long reflective sentences to staccato apology, mirroring rising emotional rawness. No head-hop; filter verbs serve voice ("she understood professionally"). Distinct diction holds under pressure, though one clause ("raw, ethereal grit") momentarily explains its own effect.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose shows high density: archive dust, red-pencil annotations, and orchard hush interlace without padding. Figurative language stays purposeful—"magnetism of story" suits her profession—but occasional surplus metaphor ("silence gathers before a blade falls") risks overwriting. Sentence variety and paragraph cuts propel momentum; no paraphrase loops detected. Clean mechanics, one pronoun ambiguity ("its" referring to orchard vs. land) quickly clarified.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Ghost-cleaner conceit refreshes familiar grief-atonement arc; pairing with obsolete sheet-music archive supplies fresh cultural substrate. Synthesis feels particular: reputation management jargon reframed as spiritual physics. Could swap mother-loss premise into another profession with effort, indicating partial template underbelly. Risk in lyric compression pays off; closing cadence memorable yet not wholly unprecedented.</comment>
