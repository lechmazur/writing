<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Maren’s interior contradiction—her need to mark impermanence yet leave no trace—is rendered in embodied, knot-by-knot action. The renunciation at dawn (undoing every knot) carries visible cost: the grotto will erase her, yet the moth wing’s tremor has already re-weighted her stance. No stock labels; every emotional beat is filtered through tactile attention to moss, rope, light. Character arc = Earned Stasis, fully paid for.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each descriptive layer tightens the central stake (honoring erasure) until the moth-wing turn re-prices the concept of memory itself. Closure is Charged Poise—the slow revolution of the wing in darkness—undeniable conceptual cost: the monument is the act of forgetting. Orientation anchored by 80 words; no causality breaks; knots and vial deploy without teleport. One meaningful tightening only, but it’s lethal and final.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cloud-borne grotto is not backdrop; its cold updraft literally animates the moth wing that delivers the closure image. Micro-setting (body pressed into moss, limestone sucking heat) constrains how long Maren can stay and therefore when she must dismantle. Sensory hierarchy obeys her esorealist filter: mist > sound > color. Environment, tool (rope), and body together charge the final image; no description dead-ends.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—"interrupt the interrupted cadence" of lost histories—signaled in second paragraph and deepened by each knot name. No external antagonist needed; pressure is situational: the butterfly may never arrive, the grove will vanish. One tightening only (wing moves at 03:00), but it forecloses the option of permanence and reweights all prior labor. Cost legible: she will carry the dismantled frame back down, complicit in the erasure she mourns.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges entirely through ritual action: building to dismantle, remembering to forget. Subtext resides in the knot lexicon and the moth-wing relic—objects that say more than any manifesto. Final image answers the thematic question non-literally: history is honored only when released to spin in darkness. No moralizing, only reconfiguration; reader left in Charged Poise equal to Maren’s.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person intimate carries a hushed, percussive cadence that mirrors rope on wood; syntax lengthens under reverent attention then shortens at dawn when she undoes her work. Perceptual signature is idiosyncratic—"blushing stillness," "color of a healing bruise"—yet stays within Maren’s esoreal lexicon. No head-hop, no filter-verb fat; compression like "stories broken off before their resolution" teaches the pattern early and pays off in the wing’s rotation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is deliberate but varied; no template cadence or synonym loops. Metaphors are sparse, precise, and physically coherent (cathedral-window wing). High information density: one sentence often performs scene work + emotional filtering + thematic resonance. Zero scaffolding; even abstract notions like "interrupted cadence" are immediately grounded in knot-tying motion. No artifact touches the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Concept of "esoteric realist" who builds anti-monuments feels fresh, and the monarch’s doomed flight path grounds it in urgent present. Synthesis of knot-language as vocabulary of grief is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risk taken in refusing butterfly sighting pays off via wing-animation turn. Slight proximity to eco-elegy trope keeps it from 9+ band, but transformation through Maren’s specific practice is strong.</comment>
