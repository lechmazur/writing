<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—scholarly hunger versus vertigo at occult inheritance—hovers but never hardens into an on-page choice that costs her something concrete; the hand-over of the seal is ceremonial, not crucible. Mrs. Voss’s motives remain elegantly opaque, yet the story sells the generational relay as emotional payment, so the arc lands just inside Earned Stasis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the obsidian seal’s weight reconfigures Elara’s future while the building’s “truth” keeps murmuring—cost is felt in the sudden legibility of every wall. Causal lattice holds: sugar request → weekly lessons → meteor-rooftop interrogation → inheritance, each step tightening her obligation to listen. No orientation drift; limestone grammar is taught early and pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Limestone, cornices, cracked mortar, night-blooming jasmine, rusted vents—every tactile anchor is filtered through Elara’s architectural ear and finally weaponized when the rooftop garden becomes the lectern for her oral exam. The obsidian seal satisfies the micro-setting/tool gate by constraining her acceptance of the keeper role in the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“can she read the Harwood’s real tongue?”—tightens when Mrs. Voss’s interrogation forces Elara to voice the cornerstone secret, trading passive curiosity for active custodianship. Price is conceptual but legible: she inherits a forty-year vigil with no off-ramp shown. One decisive turn suffices for this length; causality, not coincidence, drives it.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—built surfaces lie, but time carves testimony—emerges through architectural necrolinguistics rather than exposition. Final image of “truth murmuring underneath” reweights every prior facade without declaring a moral. Subtext in Mrs. Voss’s flour-dusted wrists and spectral quietness hints at her own buried costs, inviting counter-readings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person close stays locked to Elara’s synesthetic perception of stone syntax; no head-hop. Diction—“cornices spoke in flourishes,” “lintels in measured declarations”—is poetic yet filtered through a scholar’s lexicon. Rhythm breathes with chamomile steam and meteor glare, then contracts into the obsidian’s surprising warmth, mirroring her intake of breath at inheritance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty: “the cracked mortar… murmured something she desperately needed to understand” seeds plot, desire, and atmosphere in one stroke. No paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors; figurative layer is architecturally consistent. A single template run—“the… the… the…” in the opening—skates by because it teaches the cadence of façade-lecture.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>“Dead language tutor who teaches architrave Gothic” is a fresh synthesis; the concept could slide into gimmickry but is grounded in tactile rubbings and cornerstone scratches. The inherited obsidian seal literalizes the trope of “reading between the lines” without winking. Risk feels organic, not performative, because the emotional relay remains centered on female mentorship and custodial burden.</comment>
