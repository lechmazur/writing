<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maren’s vocation and lifelong habit of “pressing her face close to things others dismissed” give her a clear, consistent motive, and her decision to spend borrowed time recklessly is a credible escalation. Interiority is evocative (“the silence… was the most beautiful thing she had ever failed to draw”) yet stays anchored to her perceptual world. The micro-choice to hum the missing note is decisive and reveals her hierarchy of values. No secondary character appears, so relationship/status tests are N/A; the earned cost (three hours of future life gone) is present but abstract, keeping the score just below the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The story lands a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the lattice cracks, the echoes achieve wholeness, and Maren’s future is three hours poorer—cost is explicit. Causality holds under the inferred Accumulative/Textural lens: each beat adds density to the mystery until the cadence’s completion reweights meaning. Orientation is secured by word 80 (“narrowboat,” “rooftop canal system,” “city’s thousand towers”). No lens ambiguity or telegraphing flaws.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The elevated canal lattice, infinity-loop junction, and bone-frequency cage are tactile, specific, and directly constrain Maren’s final action. Sensory selection skews to sound and touch, matching her illustrator-aural attention. Micro-setting (pendant, canal water) functions as environmental pressure. One proper-noun economy slip—“Tower of Doves” named once then never reused—barely dents clarity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—uncage the echoes before the giant stirs—is signaled early and tightens when the lattice’s stress point demands her personal payment. Agency is present: she elects to spend future time and hum the resolution note. Cost is legible (three future hours gone), though not viscerally felt. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length; no reversal is required.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: art as completion of withheld life, the price of perfect attention. The empty space she now sketches reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext resides in the pendant’s cooled heartbeat and the “failed” drawing of silence. No final-paragraph thesis statement; resonance is earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Maren’s perceptual filter; diction (“calcified resonance,” “moonlight moths”) reflects an illustrator’s precision. Rhythm swells then thins with the cadence release. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets are N/A. One lyric elision—“she pressed the pendant and felt time thicken”—is taught by immediate sensory payoff.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; figurative language is selective, never clogging high-pressure beats. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Information density is high: “echoes in their larval state, coiled like luminous seahorses” does triple descriptive, world, and emotional work. A single adverbial hedge (“almost resolved”) is negligible.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The premise—“echoes are living creatures caged by a sleeping giant’s bone-frequency lattice”—is non-obvious and executed with internal consistency. Risk-taking (sound as life, time-debt as tactile honey) heightens stakes without losing clarity. Transformation test fails if Maren is swapped out; her illustrator’s gaze is integral. No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
