<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maren’s interior contradiction—licensed mediator vs. raft-daughter—drives every beat; the stone-chip touch anchors memory without exposition. One micro-choice after another (collaborating with taggers, mapping coral text) externalizes the paradox. Closure keeps the cost legible: she pockets the stone rough-side-out, signaling the path she’s now barred from. Only missing a second on-page character to test status shifts under live pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: Authority deadline → graffiti counter-charter → dawn filing. Orientation locked by line 4; no spatial drift. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the legal voice is won, yet the developer threat persists—cost felt in “sharper lawyers” line. One transition (night-before to dawn) is crisp, taught by lantern fade.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Floating carnival is never catalogued; instead, junction platform sway, clashing musics, and lantern-draped stalls arrive as sensory pressure. Micro-setting (stone chip in palm) constrains the final choice—rough/smooth orientation literally steadies her. Spatial choreography across tethered pontoons stays coherent; distance felt in “drift closer.” Missing weather/environmental consequence in climax, keeping it below 9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—save the rafts from privatization—announced in first 150 words and tightened once: Authority wants her to soothe, community wants her to fight, she invents covert graffiti campaign that forecloses neutrality. Every beat narrows options until dawn petition leaves her publicly branded mediator for the resistance. Cost visible: future developers “sharper,” her own safety unspoken but implied.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme—cultural memory vs. commodification—emerges through layered murals, not thesis: coral text becomes living charter. Final image of stone “rough side out” reweights earlier luck-token into commitment scar. No moralizing; irony left alive (“revitalization” still coming). Could use one more graffiti image that backfires to expose internal cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Narrative voice fuses bureaucratic precision with carnivale synesthesia: “culture shock absorber,” “competing prayers.” Rhythm accelerates under pressure—long sentence for dawn fleet, then clipped “Privatization would still come.” No filter-verb stacks; metaphors stay physical (lantern-draped stalls, coral text). Interior diction never exceeds Maren’s lived lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet buoyant: every sentence carries setting + emotion + forward push (“music clashing like competing prayers” does triple duty). No paraphrase loops; varied sentence openings. One mixed metaphor risk—“kaleidoscope of light across harbor waters”—but salvaged by tactile follow-up. Clean mechanics, zero scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>“Licensed culture-shock absorber” grafts bureaucratic title onto floating carnival; graffiti-as-legal-code weaponizes artwork already endemic to the milieu. Concept feels inevitable yet unseen before. Risk in mosaic counter-charter pays off: legislative document grown from coral pattern reconfigures reader’s idea of public art. Could not swap raft city for any generic locale without collapsing plot mechanics.</comment>
