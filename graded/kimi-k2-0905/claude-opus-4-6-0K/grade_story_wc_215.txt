<comment>Maren’s vow of silence is dramatized through the embodied ritual of opening the stained-glass box; the moment she lifts the lid is the first micro-choice that alters her stance toward the dead. Contradictory impulses—hunger to speak vs. need to protect the covenant—co-exist inside a single beat, not in summary. The cost is on-page: Elara’s dissolution into colored light makes the refusal to speak irreversible, an Earned Stasis that feels final because the visual price is immediate.</comment>

<comment>The story teaches its Accumulative/Textural lens early: silence as dense, luminous honey-comb that must not break. Escalation is a density increase—ghost crowds outside, color pooling inside—until the final image reweights the covenant from burden to communion. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the box on the hive ledge radiates spectral color, showing Maren will keep carrying the unsaid forever; the cost is the visible loss of Elara’s form into that light.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The dead wax cathedrals and heat-shimmer ghost-forms are tactile, selective, and POV-filtered; Maren notices collapse geometry, not tourist catalog. The stained-glass box is micro-setting that literally channels light and ghost, constraining the final choice: opening it releases the spectral transaction. Spatial choreography holds: Maren retrieves box → stands among supers → sets box on hive ledge; no impossible positions.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—preserve the covenant of silence—faces one tightening: if she opens the box, the ghosts may demand speech. The visible price is paid on-page: Elara dissolves into the beam, proving the covenant can survive only if Maren keeps the words inside. Agency is renunciation; the tightening forecloses the option of ever speaking to her sister.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the repeated image of light passing through colored glass and through translucent ghosts: silence refracted into visible love. The final re-pricing occurs when the same light that reveals the ghost also takes it away, making silence the only medium in which love can persist untarnished. No character articulates a thesis; meaning is silently reweighted by the image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric, compressed, pattern-taught: “silence had weight,” “honey crystallizing,” all repeated motifs paid off when the lid opens and color spills. Syntax mirrors Maren’s slowed perception—long vowel sounds, gentle caesuras—then tightens into shorter units as the ghost approaches. No head-hopping; perception stays strictly within Maren’s sensorium.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Every sentence carries two jobs: description + covenant pressure (“wax cathedrals slowly collapsing in the heat” marries setting decay with inner creed). No synonym loops or scaffold; metaphors stay inside beekeeping physics. High information density without overwriting: 740 words carry eleven years of grief and an entire world’s haunting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of bee-apocalypse + visible ghosts + vow of silence feels inevitable and fresh; removing any layer collapses the logic. The stained-glass box as portable reliquary for unspoken words is a specific, non-obvious invention that charges the final image. Risk—the lyric, non-causal structure—heightens coherence rather than obscuring it.</comment>
