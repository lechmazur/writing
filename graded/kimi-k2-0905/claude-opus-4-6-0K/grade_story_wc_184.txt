<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s “warmly methodical” nature is shown through tactile, character-specific beats (photographing artifacts, rebraiding the cord strand-by-strand). Interiority stays concrete; the moment she recognizes the altered braid pattern is a credible micro-choice that scales to her larger value hierarchy. No contradiction between internal and external behavior; her flaws (over-caution, archival detachment) are visible but not punished, creating earned irony. The final renunciation—quiet presentation rather than spectacle—feels inevitable from earlier cues.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: impossible door → discovery of altered cord → decision to rebraid → presentation to faculty. Orientation (who/where/when) is anchored by line 3; wall mural fade later pays off the impossibility. Closure is a Decisive Change with conceptual cost: the university’s founding myth is rewritten back to unity, and Elara accepts the invisible risk of institutional pushback. No teleporting props; the seal and cord track cleanly through the door and out again.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clock-tower mechanism room is rendered through micro-setting: gear-tooth gauges, pendulum rods, the cold stone floor Elara sits on. Sensory hierarchy obeys archival discipline—visual measurements, tactile silk fragility—never tourist catalog. The impossible door’s iron bands and vanished mural are re-mentioned at closure, reweighting the space as historically unstable. Spatial choreography clean; no floating rooms.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Dominant stake: restore the true founding narrative vs. leave the lie intact. One meaningful tightening: realizing the cord’s rebraid encodes separation, not unity, collapses her safe archival distance into ethical obligation. Cost is legible—she risks professional ridicule by presenting relics that “shouldn’t exist.” Agency is continuous; each photograph and braid crossing narrows options until the final quiet act.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: absence itself is a curated story. The re-braided cord literalizes how narratives are twisted. No moralizing; the final faculty meeting is reported in one crisp sentence, letting the restored artifact speak. Ambiguity lingers: who re-braided the cord remains unknown, keeping the theme complex.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Elara’s archival perceptual signature: “cataloging of gear-tooth wear patterns,” “symbolic language she had studied.” No filter-verb stacks; syntax grows shorter under pressure (“Strand by strand…”). Diction stays within her plausible lexicon; “warmly methodical” is reused only once, never slogan. Final image—“documentation was thorough”—is a quiet, voice-perfect cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances story or atmosphere. Figurative language is sparse and accurate: cord “coiled like a sleeping creature.” No register drift; technical terms gear-tooth, counterweight are accurate and POV-motivated. Opening line anchors voice and impossible premise in one stroke. Final line offers a crisp, propulsive release.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: magical door as archival discovery space; absence treated as curatable artifact. Risk taken—impossible architecture—pays off by making historical revision literal. Specific detail (Tri-Faculty Cord braid crossings) prevents trope drift. Not 9+ because the institutional-restoration plot is familiar at core, though executed at high level.</comment>
