<comment>Maren's quiet, methodical obsession feels lived-in; the embodied cold and the way she “runs her thumb across a cluster of half-hitches” show interiority without label-speak. The flaw—she has no contradictory impulse onstage—keeps her just short of full contradiction. Her renunciation of warmth and ease is visible in the accumulating snow burying her boot prints, paying cost without exposition. Still, the moment of highest pressure is a realization, not a visible trade-off, so the 9+ gate stays closed.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each knot thickens the pattern of loss until the final image of white erasure reweights the stake. Orientation is clean (who/where/when by line 3); closure is a Charged Poise—rope still speaking under snow—whose conceptual cost is undeniable. No因果 turning point is required; the tightening is density-driven. The -0.1 comes from the slightly early fulgurite intro (before rope pattern is taught), a micro-timing twitch that keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<comment>The dock’s amber grain, the snow erasing footprints, and the hemp vertebrae together form a micro-setting that literally constrains her finger-work and charges the final burial image. Sensory hierarchy is collector-specific: texture first, temperature second, visual last. Weather is not backdrop but active collaborator—snow covers her traces as she uncovers theirs. This is textbook environment-as-crucible, earning the 9+ gate.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—preserve the weavers’ language—tightens when the seventh sequence maps to herring migration; knowledge gained narrows future options because dismissal is now impossible. Cost is atmospheric rather than bodily: every copied knot costs heat, visibility, and societal irrelevance. Escalation is micro but sufficient under Accumulative lens. A sharper tangible loss (a numb finger dropping the pencil?) would have pushed it higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: preservation as transient lightning that must keep striking. The rope’s “quiet insistence that tomorrow deserved a chance” is never restated—only enacted. Final image of snow erasing footprints while knots still speak is a Conceptual Repricing that reweights preservation as both futile and noble. No moral is declared; the after-effect lingers as chilled gratitude.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is precise collector-vision: seeds as “compressed theses,” knots as “vertebrae.” Rhythm modulates—long contemplative sentences contract into short “She copied….” Free indirect style stays clean; no head-hop. Register never drifts into academic even when handling “spawning cycles.” A hairline slip: “oceanic hush” is elegant but momentarily authorial; keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is immaculate: no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Information density high—one sentence often does three jobs (e.g., “Now it lay under a thin crust of snow…”). Syntax breathes with cold; paragraph cuts are surgical. Opening and final lines serve as tonal bookends that recharge motif. This is elite-venue sentence work.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The knot-as-text concept feels inevitable yet fresh; no recent fiction treats maritime cordage as living palimpsest. Transformation test passed—swap rope for generic artifact and story collapses. Risk is quiet rather than pyrotechnic, but coherence is total. Dock, seed-lore, and fulgurite synthesize into a singular stance; earns the high-band without gimmick.</comment>
