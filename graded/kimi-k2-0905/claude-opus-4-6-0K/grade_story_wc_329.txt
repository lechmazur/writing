<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Maren’s interior contradiction—clinging to beauty yet ready to torch its cage—stays embodied: her heartbeat is literally weaponized. The locust shell micro-choice (“tucked into her coat pocket pressed against her ribs like a second heart”) externalizes the break-free arc and foreshadows the final stance. No diagnostic self-talk; even the epiphany is rendered as physical pulse synced to tree roots. The only bar to 9.0: we never glimpse why eleven years of failure suddenly tip now; the emotional calculus is credible but not fully foreclosed on the page.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the city’s stunned silence is the cost, the orchard’s unchecked spread the irreversible reconfiguration. Causal chain is tight: hum → orchard → statue block → pulse signal → trees uproot → city forced to listen. Orientation anchors within 40 words; no teleporting props. Persistent constraint—Maren’s new role as pied-piper without a score—shapes the final image and future stakes. Cost is legible in the toppled stone and her own exile from anonymity.</comment>

<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Silver-black bark, “fruit glowing like trapped sunsets,” and the concrete fracture’s rust deliver sensory economy; each detail later charges the climax (fruit hanging over intersections, roots buckling pavement). Micro-setting—the locust shell—constrains her decision to mimic its molt. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly across the bridge-to-orchard transition; no floating bodies. Only a hairline slip: “condemned transit hub” is named but never re-anchored when the orchard bursts through, so the city’s geography stays slightly vaporous.</comment>

<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—beauty must either stay guarded or be set loose—signals at line 3 and tightens when granite hands bar her first reach. Escalation is one continuous because/therefore squeeze: statue prohibition → heartbeat signal → trees uproot → city grid breached. The meaningful turn (roots surge) costs her safety and the statues’ existence; price is visible rubble and glowing fruit over traffic. Agency remains hers: the orchard moves only after she codes her pulse into its network.</comment>

<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of preservation: beauty kept behind stone dies, beauty uprooted and scuffed becomes immortal. No explicit thesis; the final image of “statues lay quiet among the roots, finally just stone” reweights the opening belief into lived cost. Locust shell and violin both recur with shifted meaning, constraining her tactics. The moral ambiguity—city disruption, possible chaos—is embraced rather than balanced, giving the resonance bite.</comment>

<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays interior to Maren; perceptual signature filters through musical metaphor (“notes carried into gears and exhaust”). Syntax flexes with pressure: long lyrical lines collapse into staccato fragments during statue confrontation. No head-hopping; violin and orchard receive agency but only via her perception. Register hovers in elevated but consistent lyric pitch—justified by the violinist POV—and repays the gamble in the final cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud ear is musical: sentence length mirrors bow strokes, paragraphs breathe where she pauses. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is dense yet coherent—“city had grown too chrome, too certain” compresses societal critique without mixed metaphor. One near-purple phrase, “trees…their fruit glowing like trapped sunsets,” survives because it later pays off in literal glow over intersections. Filter verbs minimal; strong verbs (“ruptured,” “buckled”) carry motion.</comment>

<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fusion of eco-fantasy with classical-music mysticism feels inevitable yet fresh; no prior orchard story uses heartbeat Morse to hack root network. Transformation test fails if Maren is swapped out—only a violinist could transduce pulse into audible root-code. Risk of enchanted orchard is offset by grime of rust, exhaust, cracked concrete—tarnish keeps wonder from whimsy. Final reprice: beauty is vandalism, a glowing invasion that wrecks commute routes—specific, non-obvious, memorable.</comment>
