<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren’s contradictory impulses—yearning for solitude yet crafting objects that demand community—are dramatized through the micro-choice to “carry her forty-eight glass worlds down the hill tomorrow.” The embodied grief (tight chest, cheeks taut) and the bookmark-as-evidence anchor her motivation without therapy-speak. The final renunciation of isolation is earned by the season’s audible thaw and the visible queue of fragile spheres. Cap at 8.7 because the father-engineer backstory is summarized, not staged, so the cost feels inherited rather than freshly compounded.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the decision to open the learning house lands on-page (“She resolves to unlock…”) with the conceptual cost that her private grief-studio must dissolve into communal noise. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each orb and meltwater pulse thickens the pattern until the final sentence crystallizes the new stance. No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 5. The father bookmark is the only soft因果link—it motivates but does not alter tactics in-scene—stopping just short of 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The dam’s dead gauges and drumming meltwater under the concrete are not backdrop but pressure: the pulse she “felt through her boots” mirrors her own unfreezing, charging the final image. The cracked window above the furnace seeds the later light-bending questions children will ask, so environment literally refracts meaning. Spatial choreography is flawless—pipe, annealing oven, console, bookmark tracked without drift. Tool-as-setting (the repurposed heating unit) constrains the glass cooldown and thus the timeline for tomorrow’s descent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she stay frozen in solitude or risk the community that might shatter her—tightens once: the word “abandon” becomes a bell tone and triggers the final resolve. No causal reversals are needed under Accumulative lens; the deepening is the river’s rising roar and the accumulating rows of spheres that make hiding untenable. Cost is legible: the studio’s privacy is forfeited. Missing the 8.8 band because the external ice-thaw does half the escalation work rather than a high-stakes human opposition.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the refracted light inside glass: knowledge wants to be bent, shared, possibly broken. The bookmark’s cracked leather quietly argues that technical silence is still a form of engineering failure. Final image of “the season doing its patient, irreversible work” reweights the premise—thaw is not gentle metaphor but ungovernable force that dissolves all dams, including her own. Avoids 9.0 only because the children remain off-page abstractions, blunting the moral stakes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: glasswork terminology fused with mock-epic diction (“staggering importance of hydration”) that collapses into quiet resolve by the end. Rhythm compresses under pressure—final paragraph drops theatrical narration for three plain “She resolves” anaphoras, mirroring the glass cooling into stillness. No head-hopping; free indirect style stays locked to Maren. Elision (father’s silence) is taught early and paid off when the bookmark is handled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry triple duty: sensory pulse, metaphoric echo, plot advance (“meltwater drumming…pulse she felt through her boots”). Zero paraphrase loops; each image appears once and reconfigures later (“ice…like a door finally opening” becomes the unlocked learning house). Figurative control survives peak beat—no mixed metaphors during the delicate inflation of Sphere 48. A single filter-verb triad (“she thought…she drank…she set”) keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Familiar grief-to-community arc is refreshed by glassblowers’ physics refracted through an abandoned hydro-dam: knowledge (light) literally needs a cracked control-room window to bend. Mock-heroic narration of mundane craft risks gimmick yet pays off when the voice strips away at the exact thaw-point. Risk distinction awarded (+0.3) for staging interior thaw inside a civil-engineering carcass. Not 9.0 because the learning-house finale is foreseeable once glass spheres for children are named.</comment>
