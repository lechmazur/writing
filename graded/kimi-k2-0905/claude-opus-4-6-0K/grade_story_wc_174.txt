<comment>Marcus’s interiority is concrete—his thumb on the drift-wood notches, the held-breath line he rules—showing urbane restraint under fire; serenity is dramatized by him volunteering to cede control, a micro-choice that costs him narrative authority and earns the closing image. No stock labels; silence is embodied, not diagnosed. The reversal lands because his prior stillness is legible as condescension to Jin, so the surrender feels earned, not performative.</comment>

<comment>Closure is Charged Poise: the decision to hand the stick to the bar audience crystallizes options—Marcus forfeits curatorial power and the group accepts possible chaos. Causal chain intact: argument → epiphany → visible plan → van door. Time/place anchored within 120 words; no lens drift. Cost is conceptual but undeniable—“the story won’t be ours to judge”—and persists as constraint.</comment>

<comment>Dome’s parabolic acoustics and moon-slits shape the hush that forces whispered stakes; radar pedestal becomes the stage where authority is physically relinquished. Drift-wood stick is micro-setting that carries literal notches of prior tellers, constraining who may speak. Harbor dark outside mirrors interior moral fog, but detail is filtered through Marcus’s calligraphic eye—selective, not touristic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—who controls narrative authorship—tightens when Marcus decides to yield the stick; option space narrows from debate to enacted surrender. Ethical pressure escalates under Situational lens: the dome’s echoing silence compels stance crystallization. Visible cost: they may stage a disaster, but that risk is accepted on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from material acts: transcribing accusations in luscious script visualizes exploitation, then the empty line of Marcus’s silence reframes the moral question as ownership of voice. Final image—stick slid into coat like a baton he will hand away—reweights prior aesthetics without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: liberation or voyeurism still possible, now democratized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person hovers at Marcus’s shoulder, diction calibrated to his measured cadence—“fluidity that had made his name”—without ventriloquizing other minds. Rhythm breathes with brush-stroke pauses; no template cadence. Perceptual signature is calligraphic: noticing weight of ink, tremor of line, silence as negative space. No head-hop; distance stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but aerated—“slashes of coastal moonlight,” “mineral-tasting” quiet—each image advances mood and stakes. No mixed metaphors or scaffold loops; sentences vary in length to mimic held breath and release. Filter verbs absent. Opening and closing lines bookend the electromagnetic metaphor cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Puppet-show-as-ethical-crucible flips familiar artist-guilt trope by weaponizing calligraphy itself as both indictment and gift. Story-stick lineage literalizes oral debt; reversing the flow is non-obvious. Specificity of decommissioned radar dome repurposed as ethics lab freshes the frame. Risk earns +0.3: surrendering narrative control could implode the show, but story leans in.</comment>
