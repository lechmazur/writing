<comment>Maren’s helix-thinking and entangled grief are vividly embodied; the tremoring hands, chaotic apartment, and final kneeling weep feel earned. Interior contradiction is alive—she both clings to and fears the memories she excavates. The only bar to 9.0: the mother’s face arrives as gift, not final cost; the closure beat is catharsis more than renunciation, so the emotional price feels slightly under-taxed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Causal chain is clean: self-experiment → entanglement → canyon trial → cracked-mirror sorter → un-entanglement + recovered face. Each beat advances knowledge or narrows option. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: she gains her mother’s image but must now catalogue every borrowed grief—cost is legible in “careful, trembling work of excavation.” No orientation or telegraph issues.</comment>

<comment>Canyon architecture—silver strata, moonlit corridor, bone-dry riverbed—functions as pressure cooker: walls force proximity to echoing headset hum, mirror halves catch and split light. The broken periscope mirror evolves from talisman to optical gate; its diagonal crack literally refracts the stakes. Micro-setting (mirror, headset, canyon throat) constrains the final calibration and charges the closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“stop drowning in foreign memories, reclaim my own”—tightens once: the cracked-mirror trial forecloses the option to simply delete data. Escalation is single-curve but sufficient: entanglement intensifies → single experiment risks permanent overload → success imposes lifelong curatorial burden. Cost is visible in final kneel and the phrase “careful, trembling work,” satisfying 8.8+ gate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory-as-sediment emerges through action, not statement; the canyon strata mirror neural layers. Final image reweights premise: salvaging discarded dreams is not heroic archive but trembling responsibility—conceptual cost is undeniable. No moralizing, only charged poise. The whispered name “Ren” and pine resin return as irreducible human traces, deepening moral weight without tidy takeaway.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Maren’s helix perception: syntax spirals, verbs coil, light refracts. Diction—“electrochemical mortar,” “picosecond”—belongs to an engineer who salvages submarine mirrors. Rhythm accelerates under headset hum, then fractures with mirror split, mirroring cognitive cleaving. No POV leakage or register drift; voice remains character-specific at peak stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “silver breathed,” “coiled rungs of a helix,” “quaking thing” all multitask atmosphere + physiology. No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors; each figurative stroke advances either mirror optics or emotional pressure. Minor micro-scaffold in second paragraph’s career thumbnail, but it compresses backstory efficiently. Closure sentence lands with crystalline cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Neural-plasticity-as-memory-entanglement is fresh sci-fi angle; cracked periscope as beam-splitter is elegant, specific, and thematically apt. Canyon-as-helix externalizes cognition without overt allegory. Risk—lyric engineering monologue—pays off by making technical device feel mythic. Story would collapse if any element swapped; synthesis feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
