<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Maren’s refusal to use her sight is embodied (filing meaningless texts nightly), the stone encounter triggers contradictory impulses—fear of vision vs hunger for home—and the final choice to look into the stone costs her eleven years of numbness. Interiority is character-specific mercury-glass rather than therapy-speak. Micro-choice hierarchy is visible: keep safety of gibberish or risk memory by continuing to translate; she pays by surrendering defensive amnesia.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Maren’s silver eyes “flare” as she accepts resonance with the mountain’s lost home-sentence, paying with the protective ignorance she clung to since her mother’s death. Causal chain intact: buried sight → stone texture cues memory → translating rekindles ability → chooses to teach, foreclosing isolation. Orientation and transitions clear in single-scene descent; lens held as causal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The sixty-first-level iron air and feather-directional glyphs tactilely steer her recognition; environment is not backdrop but password to her gift. Micro-setting of the stone’s texture reverses her exile in one palpable stroke. Mountain architecture functions as a linguistic sentence that finally “speaks,” constraining her final decision to stay and teach.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can she bear to see again—tightens when the stone’s texture revives pre-mountain memory, forcing the choice to keep translating and risk re-experiencing loss. Agency drives escalation: each decoded glyph re-activates buried sight, narrowing safe ignorance. Cost legible: the safety of nightly nonsense is traded for communal light on level sixty-one.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Home emerges as relational geometry of light/stone/breath rather than place, reframing the mountain from prison to origin. Theme surfaces through pattern: directional feather grain mirrors time’s readable “barb,” making acceptance of vision not cure but return. No moralizing—final illumination simply re-weights every prior shelving task as syllable of belonging.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited sustains perceptual signature of tactile reflection—“silver eyes,” “rain puddle,” “feather barb”—without filter clutter. Syntax lengthens during lamplight translation to mimic spiraling corridors, then tightens at recognition. No dialogue, so voice contamination absent; prose is character-specific, stable, and rhythmic.</question>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies between long archaeological sentences and abrupt recognition beats; clauses carry dual labor (e.g., “the words meant nothing, and that was the mercy”). Occasional elevated diction (“linguistic sentence that said: you are not lost”) feels earned by archivist POV. No loops or paraphrase stacks; metaphors coherent (grammar-roots, conjugating oceans).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mercury-glass seer shelving dead languages inside a hollowed mountain-library is fresh synthesis. Linking feather texture to time’s directional legibility transforms a familiar “return home” arc into bibliogeological epiphany. The payoff feels inevitable yet non-obvious, fulfilling the transformation test. No derivative premise penalty warranted; specific civilization grammar-architecture is novel.</comment>
