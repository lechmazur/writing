<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Ego-dead Selu’s stillness vs Selu-2’s overflow is dramatized in the wrist-lock beat; the micro-choice to release, not defeat, crystallizes her first post-death want. Interiority stays concrete (“hairline fracture in the numbness”) and the final joint-custody stance costs her the fantasy of wholeness. Minor slip: “You can’t even cry” is borderline diagnostic label-speak, though the line’s sting justifies the risk.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: summons → jar as evidence → combat testimony → joint-custody renunciation. The canyon’s erasure at the end rewrites geography but not the earned emotional cost, satisfying the Closure Gate. One transition (ladder climb) is clean; orientation anchors within 120 words. The ruling itself is the Decisive Change with visible price—Selu accepts permanent split parenthood.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Floating dojo platform and shifting canyon are more than postcard: the unstable ground forces the “complementary opposites” sparring logic and charges the final oceanic image. The brain-in-jar micro-setting literally constrains the custody tactic—Selu lifts it to the light, catalyzing her recognition. Sensory selection stays urgent (salt air, compressed-bone canyon) and filtered through Selu’s anhedonic lens.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—who mothers Mira—tightens when the jar proves Selu’s emotional death. One meaningful escalation: Selu shifts from winning the fight to proposing joint custody, foreclosing sole claim. Cost is legible: she must forever share motherhood with the living reminder of her lost feeling. History’s rewrites complicate but do not resolve the conflict, keeping agency internal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of complementary brokenness emerges through the fight choreography and the final image of two incomplete women sharing one child. No moralizing; the ocean’s appearance reweights earlier canyon imagery into possibility without sermon. Subtext lives in gesture—wrist release, breathing salt—rather than assertion. The brain relic’s reprise at the end silently reprices identity as shared artifact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Selu’s perceptual signature: geology “looked like compressed bone,” air “tasted like salt and change.” Syntax lengthens under emotional thaw, mirroring the hairline fracture. No head-hopping; Selu-2’s interior is read off her tears and terror, not ventriloquized. Voice modulation from numb reportage to wanting breath is purposeful and coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; no loops or scaffold detected. Figurative language is selective (“smoke through a keyhole”) and never clogs the high-pressure custody fight. Strong verbs (“sliced through pretense”) replace modifiers. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge the arc cleanly. One near-miss: “conceptual repricing” risk in “stillness and the storm” leans aphoristic, but the line is earned by prior combat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Clone custody battle on a history-rewriting floating dojo is fresh, yet the emotional engine—two halves of one mother negotiating wholeness—grounds the concept. The complementary-opposites combat testimony flips the expected duel into collaborative admission of incompleteness. Brain-in-jar as legal exhibit weaponizes speculative tech for intimate stakes. Risk-taking (rewriting geography mid-scene) pays off by crystallizing the joint-custody reconfiguration.</comment>
