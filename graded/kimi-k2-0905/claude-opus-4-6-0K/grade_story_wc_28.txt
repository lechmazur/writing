<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elif’s contradiction—tender healer vs. law-breaker—drives every beat: she kneels instead of flees, renames instead of fights, and the micro-choice to give the soldier a false name crystallizes the interior split. Retrocognition is embodied cost: the boot-on-neck memory lingers in ribs, shaping the next rename. Earned stasis lands when she stays kneeling, carrying Davut’s hope as literal weight. Only slip: “warm coldness” is asserted twice rather than shown through vocal modulation.</question>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a charged poise: she remains kneeling, still endangered, but the regime’s filter has been conceptually breached by each paper slip now circulating in survivors’ pockets. Causal chain holds—tessera touch → cipher → rename → soldier bypassed—each because/therefore tightening risk. Orientation is clean within 60 words. Cost is unmistakable: “the knowing remained calcified inside her ribs,” a visceral price that persists after the soldier leaves.</question>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The single blue tessera functions as micro-setting: it constrains every tactic—cipher key, vision trigger, light-catcher that risks exposure. Plaza geography stays coherent: kneeling body, patrolled path, handed papers all tracked. Shattered sky mirrors cracked mosaic without overt symbolism. Smoke-fracture image is selective and POV-filtered. Meeting 9+ gate: object actively shapes final image—her thumb still on the shard as sky holds together “if you knew how to read it.”</question>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—survival via undetected renaming—is signaled in para 5. Tightening occurs when the soldier approaches: live option of discovery forces the spoken false name, foreclosing anonymity. Cost is immediate—she now exists in records under an alias she must sustain. Pressure stays causal under regime lens; coincidence only complicates. Persistent constraint: each future ration line will test the alias’s credibility, a price legible on the page.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inverse ethic: mercy outlawed becomes mercy weaponized; renaming—usually erasure—becomes life-giving. Final image reweights “aberrant” as necessary, not pejorative. No moral stated; resonance arises from the blue tessera surviving fire and regime alike, now encoded into paper identities. Ambiguity lingers: saved today, hunted tomorrow. Subtext in soldier beat—bird memory—quietly asks who else might still be renamed inside the uniform.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person intimate maintains tight psychic distance; retrocognition slip is signaled by “the world lurch sideways,” teaching the pattern early. Syntax compresses under pressure—“She gave him one of the false ones”—then lengthens for the evocative final cadence. Diction stays within Elif’s lexicon until the coined “aberrant mercy,” justified as her self-definition. No head-hop; soldier memory is brief sensory flash filtered through her gift. Rhythm modulates from lyrical opening to staccato confrontation and back, mirroring risk pulse.</question>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Information density high—“smoke frozen in fracture lines” does world, sight, and metaphor in five words. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances stake or texture. Metaphors stay coherent (glass, mosaic, cracked sky) without spillage. Minor micro-scaffold: “She studied his, and through the tessera’s residual pull she caught…” could trim to “Via the tessera she caught…,” but artifact does not touch closure. Read-aloud rhythm earns variance through sentence-length waves.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: retrocognition as insurgent tool, not spy gadget; renaming as battlefield, not bureaucracy. Combines historical trauma, speculative gift, and linguistic resistance in one gesture. The minaret tessera—religious artifact—recoded into secular survival cipher feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk in kneeling refusal avoids clichéd blaze-of-glory exit. Could edge 9+ if a singleRename recipient re-entered to manifest downstream consequence on-page.</comment>
