<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Seren’s patient listening and micro-choices (selecting the obsidian, reading the birds, the final exhale) embody a believable mastery balanced by decades of struggle. No contradictory impulse is dramatized on-page, so the internal conflict bullet is missed, and the “cost” is purely atmospheric rather than a concrete forfeiture. Still, the quiet renunciation of physical travel feels earned by the accumulated pattern of her listening. Voice remains distinct and occupation-specific throughout.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the pulse alignment re-maps the canyon inside her, foreclosing the need to move. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each skip layers resonance until the pattern breaks open meaning. No orientation debt; who/where/when are clear by line 20. Causality is internal but coherent: because she matches frequency, therefore she “arrives everywhere.” Cost is legible in the final inhalation of dust and the birds’ gyre—quiet, undeniable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Bone towers, echo-pools, and bird spirals are rendered through Seren’s acoustic priorities; every detail doubles as constraint or tool. The obsidian arrowhead micro-setting alters the final frequency and thus the outcome, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays clean; no impossible moves. Selective, sense-filtered description keeps momentum while reinforcing stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—“map every resonance to find the wandering pulse”—is signaled early and deepened when the obsidian skip produces the unheard tone. One meaningful tightening: the pulse momentarily amplifies, forcing a stance crystallization (she stays, yet possesses the space). No external antagonist or reversal, but under Accumulative lens the density increase is sufficient. Cost is atmospheric rather than tangible, capping entry into 8.8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: attention as cartography, stillness as conquest. The pulse’s silence reframes centuries of skimmer mortality without moralizing. Final image of dust resettling reweights prior layers into quiet irony—“she had not moved, and she had arrived everywhere.” No thematic echo or tidy thesis; ambiguity lingers, inviting reread.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited clings tightly to Seren’s perceptual filter: frequencies, mineral weights, thermal gyres. Syntax lengthens and shortens with sonic tension; no head-hopping. Diction stays within her lexicon—“echo-pool,” “constructive interference”—without academic drift. Rhythm mirrors the escalating drone then softens into the hushed closure, demonstrating voice as character under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or synonym churn detected. Mixed metaphors avoided—calcium towers, bird barometers, acoustic maps all cohere. One paraphrase loop (“never arriving, never dissipating”) is brief and thematic, not intrusive. High information density; each line advances atmosphere, tool-use, or interior calibration without scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The harmonic stone-skimmer profession feels invented yet inevitable, fusing archaeo-acoustics with mystic cartography. Obsidian arrowhead repurposed as tuning fork flint-knaps cliché into freshness. Risky stillness-as-closure succeeds because prior pattern teaches the reader how to value “arrival without motion.” No derivative echo; the synthesis is singular and memorable.</comment>
