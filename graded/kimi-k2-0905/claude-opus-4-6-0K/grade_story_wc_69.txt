<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Marguerite’s motivation—braiding difference into harmony—drives every beat; the “subtracting noise” method is dramatized through jaw-release micro-choices. The choir’s shared arc from contempt to clear tone is embodied, not declared. No interior contradiction or visible cost is shown *to her*, capping short of 9. All other characters register as differentiated voices rather than full individuals, acceptable at this length.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each added voice and silence thickens the texture until the final chord reweights the vanishing-arts stake with undeniable cost—“what we do here will not be preserved.” The rosette’s early placement and the maple-leaf coda create a charged poise that forecloses no-record without sentimentality. No因果 breaks; orientation anchored by word 50. Closure beat is the silent after-image, cost felt in the room’s “wiser” stillness.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Velvet library, autumn light, and carved rosette are not backdrop; their acoustic and visual properties enable the rehearsal and the metaphor of absorb-and-vanish. Micro-setting (teen stutter vanishing inside sound) constrains action. Final maple leaf charged with conceptual repricing. Missing 9+ only because no environmental detail physically impedes a choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—ephemeral harmony versus permanent record—tightens through the rosette speech and the no-recording rule. Escalation is textural: each added voice increases the cost of eventual silence. Brothers’ eye-contact micro-turn signals option narrowed. Cost is the unrecorded chord itself, felt on the page, but no further tactical loss is shown.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of vanishing emerges from the rosette, the unrecorded singing, and the final falling leaf—no editorial commentary required. Subtext lives in gesture: brothers forgive in a third-interval, not dialogue. Final image reweights “vanishing” as voluntary, beautiful expenditure. No moralizing; resonance lingers in the unamplified silence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric floats above twelve voices yet stays anchored to Marguerite’s tactile perception: “palms turning as if shaping clay.” Syntax lengthens and breathes with the held silence. No head-hopping; choral voices remain externally focalized. Distinct cadence taught early and sustained to the leaf-fall payoff.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Zero loops, no filter-stack, high informational yield: “notation so spare it seemed to denote absence more than sound” does triple duty. Metaphors are spare, mutually coherent, and advance the concept. Sentence rhythm modulates from stately openings to the short unhurried final clause. No artifact touches closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Familiar “community choir heals” premise is re-animated through vanishing-arts frame and subtraction pedagogy. Rosette as synecdoche for extinction feels fresh, not grafted. Risk taken in withholding any recording or confrontation; payoff is the charged silence. Could edge 9+ with one more irreplaceable detail tying rosette to Marguerite’s personal loss.</comment>
