<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Nadia’s archival obsession is lived-in—ink-stained fingers, night-after-night decryption—but her interiority stays external, observed rather than embodied. The retrocognitive hook gives her a visceral cost (shaking after each vision) yet the diary itself does all the emotional lifting; she risks consumption but we rarely feel her contradictory wants inside a beat. Thomas Hallam is sketched only through debris-arranging; that single staging reveals status and creed, but the relationship crucible is more concept than felt tension. Still, the final choice—to archive rather than broadcast—earns its sting because the diary’s silence is now her silence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the diary’s visions stop, Nadia’s promise to Ruth is kept, and the cost is the archival vow itself—she must carry erased memory without releasing it. Causal chain is tight: cipher broken → visions → lagoon coordinates → Thomas’s test → final acceptance. Dr. Yusuf’s early diagnosis (“you won’t be able to stop”) becomes a persistent constraint that shapes tactics and prefigures the Earned Stasis ending. Time-split on page 4 is the single meaningful escalation; no soft resets or lucky saves. The final image—zeppelin turning north while dunes erase footprints—crystallizes the irreversible trade-off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The zeppelin’s gondola “swollen with books” is tactile micro-setting; shelves tremble each time wind shifts, anchoring stakes inside a moving archive. Sahara coast is evoked through salt-crust lagoon, crescent dunes, and black water that behaves like volcanic glass—details that later constrain where Thomas can slide the tin. Spatial choreography survives the cable-basket descent: cable angle, dune ridge, plank across water all track. Weather is used once—dawn ascent—but precisely, setting the final tone of cold clarity. No encyclopedic dumps; each descriptor either pressures access or mirrors Nadia’s obsidian-still focus.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—recover Ruth’s hidden evidence—tightens when the diary forces retrocognitive immersion that could “consume” Nadia; every subsequent choice (descend alone, parley in debris) is filtered through that bodily price. Single meaningful deepening: Thomas’s across-laguna plank test removes the option of institutional hand-off; refusal to trust any state apparatus crystallizes the only path. Cost is visible: trembling body after each vision, and the final archival silence she must now inhabit. No coincidence; even the courier crate arrives through Hallam estate, so causality stays intact.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without slogan: archives as living wounds, history’s refusal to stay buried. The encrypted diary is both evidence and virus—truth literally possesses the archivist—so the cost of recovery is becoming host to silence. Final image of footprints erased by wind reweights the premise: preservation can itself be erasure if the world never sees it. No moralizing; the ambiguity (is she savior or complicit jailer?) lingers, paid for by her trembling vigil at the rail.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person close stays locked to Nadia’s perceptual filter: “foxed ink,” “salt crust like volcanic glass,” her synesthetic collapse inside Ruth’s cell. Debris-parley diction is Thomas’s only voice, conjured through shell-and-driftwood syntax that feels oral though never quoted. Rhythm modulates: long languid clauses for air-ship drift, then staccato fragments during retrocognitive jerks. No head-hop; even Ruth’s smile is framed as Nadia’s sensed projection. The final line’s cadence—solitary and burning—echoes the diary’s “furious, precise” hand, fusing archivist and author.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentence variety is musical, never algorithmic; participles open only when motion overlaps (“ascending back into the gondola, Nadia opened…”). Figurative control: zeppelin “like a thought refusing to land” teaches the story’s pattern—ideas that never settle—paid off when dunes erase footprints. No mixed metaphors; obsidian recurs as color, texture, and silent weight. Information density is high—each line advances setting, stakes, or body state. Zero paraphrase loops; no filter-verb stacks. Copy-clean except one possible typo: “salt crust” not “salt-crust,” but clarity intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Floating civil-rights archive is a fresh synthesis: steampunk zeppelin meets Black memory reclamation, avoiding retro-tech fetish. Retrocognitive diary as psychometric anchor flips the usual time-travel trope into archival ethics: the historian is invaded, not detached. Beach-debris parley feels inevitable once Thomas’s decades-long solitude is revealed; no prior story has used driftwood Scrabble to negotiate evidence transfer. The specific detail—“obsidian lagoon beneath the dunes”—grounds the surreal in geologic truth, making the impossible feel discovered rather than invented.</comment>
