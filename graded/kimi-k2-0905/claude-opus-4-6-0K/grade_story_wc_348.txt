<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Maren’s guilt and scientific drive braid convincingly; the decision to re-credit Jonas is earned through the foam insight and embodied handling of the chrysalis. Interiority stays concrete—foam “encoding” the break, the chrysalis “impossible lightness”—avoiding lab-coat clichés. The only limit: we get one micro-choice (to write the new paper) rather than a chain, so cost is more conceptual than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the new manuscript reframes the science and reinstates Jonas, cost paid by her reputation risk. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—foam patterns and chrysalis accrue meaning until they reweight the stake. Causality is clean: ravine observation → insight → decision, all on-page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Ravine’s braided channels and shifting foam are filtered through polymer-trained perception, guiding the epiphany. The chrysalis acts as micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is tight—crouch, stand, close hand—anchoring the turn.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—repairing Jonas’s erased credit—is signaled early and tightens when the foam insight reframes separation as data, making reinstatement the only tenable path. Single deepening suffices; cost is the professional risk she embraces in the last beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through materials—polymer memory, foam geometry, chrysalis shell—arguing that breaks carry identity rather than erase it. No moralizing; the final image of “impossible lightness” lets the reader feel the paradox of absence-as-presence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays snug to Maren’s perceptual lattice: aqueous acoustics, molecular metaphors, birch-filtered light. Syntax lengthens under reflection, shortens at decision—clean modulation without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet fluid—foam “braided, separated, braided again” mirrors syntactic movement. No loops or scaffold; figurative language stays physical and polymer-accurate. One hairline slip: “symphonically minded” leans label-adjacent, but context justifies.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fusing river hydraulics with self-healing polymer science feels fresh; the chrysalis trope is revived via lab-note labeling and molecular analogy. The insight that networks remember their separations reframes both grief and materials science in one stroke.</comment>
