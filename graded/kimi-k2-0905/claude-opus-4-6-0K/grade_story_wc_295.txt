<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s obsession with decoding dream-glyphs is vivid and embodied; the insomnia credential is a nice, specific stake in the flesh. Interior contradiction shows when she must choose between solitary work and validating Seda’s legacy, but the pivot from scholar to witness is declared more than dramatized. Gregor’s grief lands through gesture, yet his one seated beat keeps the relationship crucible thin. Still, the final co-author gesture is earned because her notebooks and Seda’s charts have been concretely fused on the desk.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The closure is a clean Charged Poise: the telegram fuses with the notebooks to reconfigure meaning, and the cost is legible in the crackling daylily and Gregor’s closed eyes. Accumulative lens holds: star-rubbing juxtaposition tightens pattern density until the glyph line becomes a bridge. Orientation is anchored by word 40 (“observatory sat at the summit”). No causal breaks; the grandmother’s telegram is the taught constraint that forecloses disbelief. Minor slack: the “understanding dawned” paragraph summarizes rather than enacts the click, keeping it just under 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dome motors, copper corrosion, and the brittle amber petals give tactile specificity; the mountain night cold is filtered through sleepless skin. The archive table becomes the micro-setting crucible where glyphs and star charts physically overlap, directly shaping the decoding choice. Sensory hierarchy skews visual but matches the astronomer’s gaze; no weather clichés. Environment constrains: only the midnight quiet permits the listening that produces the bridge line.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—prove the glyphs are real—locks in by paragraph 3. Tightening occurs when the telegram forces Elara to decide whether to keep working alone or to witness Seda’s truth aloud; that utterance is irrevocable social cost under the accumulative lens. Pressure is coherent: every added glyph match thickens the pattern until silence becomes untenable. Price is visible: the daylily cracks, Gregor’s body folds, and Elara’s name now shares authorship, shrinking her solitary claim.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: shared burden moves from abstract epigraph to literal star-script translation. The final decoded line reweights all prior notebook solitude without moralizing. Subtext lives in the telegram’s fused flower—grief literally pressed into evidence. Ambiguity remains: we feel the cost of being heard, yet the world may still ignore; the story refuses to reassure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays pinned to Elara’s perceptual bias—she notices corridors that dissolve into light, hears dome creaks as whispers. Syntax lengthens under wonder (“patient as a heartbeat”) and shortens at the reveal, mirroring pulse. No dialogue clutter; the single spoken line is sharp, goal-driven. Filter verbs are few and voice-motivated; free indirect style is clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is varied; paragraph lengths breathe from descriptor blocks to spare telegram staccato. Metaphors are selective and coherent—daylily veins as stained glass, star rhythms as heartbeat. No synonym loops or paraphrase stacks; information density remains high without purple swell. Line propulsion carries through the final “still speaking” heartbeat image unscaffolded.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fusion of lucid-dream ethnography with Mira-variable linguistics is fresh and specific; the premise could not swap settings without collapse. The telegram-daylily artifact reconfigures grief into data, a risk that pays off emotionally. Star-glyph equivalence grows inevitably from introduced pattern, not late gimmick. Specificity of copper dome, Cornish miners, Oaxaca farmers roots the universal in particulars.</comment>
