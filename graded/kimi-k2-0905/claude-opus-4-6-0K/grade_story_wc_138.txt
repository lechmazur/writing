<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Vaelen’s six-millennia exhaustion is viscerally embodied in “boredom had become his marrow”; the contradictory pull toward annihilation and the final renunciation carry cost. Interiority is specific, not therapeutic. Yet the beat-to-beat micro-choices are thin—only thumb-press and chain-removal—so the turn feels slightly under-cooked for 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Earned Stasis: he sets the fragment down, forever foreclosing the mutiny, cost registered in the storm’s unanswered howl. Causal chain holds: storm → flexing seams → choice → silence. Orientation is late (“six thousand years” arrives ~word 130) but disorientation is thematically purposeful and paid off, so no penalty applied. Still, one extra causal beat between urge and renunciation would tighten.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The prismatic escondite is not backdrop but instrument: its humming walls channel the storm’s magnetism that could power the shard, so environment directly shapes tactics. Sensory triage—color corridors, stone-weight silence—filters through Vaelen’s dimensional perception. Micro-setting (the amulet against his sternum) charges the final image. Meets 9+ gate: setting constrains the choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“what happens after goodbye?”—is signaled early and tightens when the storm offers a real shot at universal ending. One meaningful deepening: the realization that mortals’ courage is surrender, not knowledge, reweights the cost. Agency is legible—he physically removes the chain, magnetism unanswered. Price is felt, though not irrevocable (world continues, his sentence continues).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: immortality as refusal to surrender, not gift. Final image reconfigures “goodbye” from threshold to burden carried. Subtext in the fragment’s dying-pulse vein mirrors his own arrested decay. Ambiguity remains—he is still trapped—so resonance lingers. No moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet controlled: “refracted energy,” “silence weighed like stone” are precise, not purple. Syntax lengthens under contemplation, shortens at the renunciation—“He set the fragment down”—creating rhythmic closure. Perceptual signature is consistent: dimensional awareness colors every image. No head-hop or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High information density: one sentence often does three jobs (world, body, metaphor). No loops, no mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated diction (“spatial mutiny,” “conceptual repricing”) is justified by inhuman POV. Final line lands cleanly. Minor scaffold: “six thousand years, give or take a century” is conversational filler, but it’s within voice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Combines immortal ennui with dimensional mechanics in a way that feels inevitable, not patched. The inversion—“ending everything” as personal curiosity—gives fresh moral chill. Specific detail (black opal veined with dying heartbeat) keeps it from abstract SF template. Risk is present but not spectacle-driven; freshness is moderate, not groundbreaking.</comment>
