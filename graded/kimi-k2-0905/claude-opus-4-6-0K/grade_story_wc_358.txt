<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Mara’s interiority is lean but specific—her belief in “singular convergence” is shown through methodical sensor placement, not told. The micro-choice to photograph the frayed patch reveals a contradictory tenderness inside a data-driven investigator. The final beat—collecting sensors, letting fog close like a door—earns her renunciation with visible cost: she leaves the shrine untouched, accepting the limits of foresight. Still, her emotional range stays narrow; one more layered contradiction could push her to 9-band.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the fog-door image reweights every prior measurement, turning data into elegy. Causal chain holds—wind map → crane path → twist-lock → death → new protocol—without gaps. The patch nailed to steel persists as an unpaid cost, shaping tomorrow’s presentation. One sentence of explicit moral price could have been trimmed, but it doesn’t blunt the reconfiguration.</comment>

<comment>The container canyon is never static; wind amplification is measured, not described, so geometry actively narrows Mara’s choices. Salt-fog diesel haze mirrors the half-remembered photograph motif, fusing sensory detail with epistemic limits. The shrine micro-setting—the nailed patch against corrugated steel—constrains her exit and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless: every sensor drop is trackable.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prevent the next death—tightens when her map shows three lethal corridors, foreclosing “operator error” as alibi. Agency sits in every sensor placement; each reading incrementally raises the cost of ignorance. The final beat does not resolve grief but crystallizes her responsibility to refuse repetition. One more on-page obstacle (budget pushback hinted) could have escalated further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the moral translation of unrepeatable death into repeatable pattern; no character states it aloud. The patch’s return—frayed, nailed, then left—recharges the idea that systems can’t archive fragility. Final fog-door image offers conceptual repricing: data meets absence, foresight meets erasure. Avoids sentimentality yet leaves unmistakable aftershock.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person hovers at mid-distance, filtering every observation through Mara’s professional perceptual bias: wind is numbers, corridors are vectors. Syntax tightens under pressure—“wind accelerated by nearly forty percent”—then loosens into lyric final clause, mirroring shift from measurement to mourning. No head-hop, no filter-verb clutter. One stray “the way a diver waits” simile is the only near-generic cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies from clipped sensor logs to longer fugue-like fog imagery without losing propulsion. No loops, no scaffold; each paragraph advances map, stake, or cost. Technical diction stays inside Mara’s ken and never lectures. Only a single mixed qualifier (“hazy precision”) repeats once; otherwise line-level craft is immaculate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Investigator-as-wind-cartographer is fresh angle on industrial-death tale; convergence concept reframes accident from tragedy to latent design flaw. Risk-taking lies in quiet ending—no boardroom fight, only fog-as-door—yet it pays off. Could push higher if wind-pattern method itself contained an idiosyncratic Mara signature rather than standard sensors.</comment>
