<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maren’s reticence and grief are embodied in how she moves through the library’s acoustic trap; the notebooks and crystal handling show a scholar whose obsession is credibly rooted in loss. The final renunciation—she stays silent, lets the patterns grow—carries cost because the prior testimony scene proved speech physically wounds her. Interior contradiction is present but stays steady rather than intensifying; we never feel a new limit reached. Still, the endurance is earned and particular to her.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: Maren accepts that witness without words is enough, and the crystal’s expanding spectra reweight the premise—language is no longer in books but in light she must keep watching. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each month’s denser refraction pattern is the because/therefore engine that narrows her options to silent vigil. The 11-year clock and humidity variables anchor who-where-when within 120 words; no orientation debt. Cost is legible in the final image—“she did not need to speak”—echoing the earlier acoustic assault that made speech impossible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The library’s sonic reflectivity is not backdrop; it forces Maren to perfect silence and later mutes her testimony, directly shaping tactics. The crystal micro-setting acts as portable environment: its shifting spectra constrain her daily choices and charge the final image. Selective sensory detail—gray blade of light, rubble dust, warmth when the sun clears the roof—keeps density high. Spatial choreography is clean; we track her alcove, podium, rubble site without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: preserve a mode of meaning outside digitized language. Pressure escalates through the crystal’s monthly spectral growth—each new facet forecloses the possibility that pattern can be abandoned. No external antagonist after the riots, yet the expanding complexity functions as tightening agent. The final stance crystallizes options: she surrenders speech forever, paying the cost of permanent silence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: meaning can migrate from dead dictionaries into light itself if one pays the price of voice. The crystal’s fracturing spectra reconfigure the concept of “definition,” offering a non-literal answer. Subtext resides in gesture—thumb on spine, crystal to eye—never explained. Final image avoids moral; it simply reweights what counts as language.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Maren’s perceptual signature: light crawls “like something wounded,” spectra “fold back on themselves like sentences trying to remember grammar.” Syntax lengthens under emotional load, then fragments at climax—“she did not need to speak.” No dialogue, so no voice convergence risk. Patterned elision—“the building might say back”—is taught early and paid off when the room literally returns her words.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry triple duty: sensory, metaphoric, causal. No paraphrase loops; each notebook count, humidity variable, or spectral shift adds new information. Metaphors stay coherent—light as tree rings—without mixed vehicles. Rhythm modulates from long accumulative clauses to the staccato final line, mirroring the shift from observation to poise.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Post-language-riot library guarded by a scholar who reads meaning in chandelier refraction is fresh, not a trope patch. The notion that spectra can “grow” like grammar reweights both physics and linguistics without gimmickry. Risk—quiet ending, no antagonist—pays off because stakes are internal yet universal. Specificity of the seventeen notebooks and humidity logs makes the concept lived rather than abstract.</comment>
