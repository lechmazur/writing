<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Maren’s contradictory mask—wise yet feigning dotage—drives every micro-choice (needle-drops, naive questions) and the final risk of passing the chart; the cost of age/aching knees under the unwavering flame registers as bodily price for her espionage, earning her Earned Stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The causal chain is clean: overheard fragments → thread-knots → convergence under candle → red stitch of urgency → hand-off decision; closure lands as Decisive Change with felt cost (aching knees, city oblivious), lens held throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Cobalt dome, echoing silence, and eternal candle are returned in the final ascent; the candle’s absolute steady glow literally enables silver fluorescence on linen—setting as tool that constrains how evidence can be read—earning micro-setting payoff.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (stop coup) tightens when red thread locks date—twelve days—foreclosing any further research; cost is the bodily ache and solitary risk she accepts, escalation legible under causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of hidden female labor subverting masculine power emerges from events (embroidery as code, chambermaid relay); final image reweights candle’s myth from decorative lore to silent witness of plotted salvation, no moralizing stated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Close-third diction—“tangle of silver thread,” “cobalt… bruise against the sky”—bears Maren’s sly precision; rhythm modulates from languid stitching to taut final line, no head-hop, perceptual signature stable and distinct.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High-density lines do double duty—world, metaphor, interior—without scaffold; stacked metaphors stay coherent (“observatory like a bruise,” “dome a vast ear”), no loops, strong verbs anchor motion, final cadence breathes exactly where candle image reprises.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Embroidery-as-intelligence is fresh synthesis; candle myth repurposed from decorative prop to silent confederate; transformation test fails if swapped—stitching mechanics are integral—demonstrating specific angle on familiar spy trope with bold, quiet stakes.</comment>
