<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Maren’s interior contradiction—archivist of grief who refuses her own—is dramatized in the silent decision to surrender her pearl; the embodied shiver and “crack open in her chest” give visceral cost. Still, the turn is articulated in abstract summary (“she understood that she had been building walls”) rather than through a final micro-choice shown in real time, muting the stakes of renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the pearl lodged in the nautilus becomes a CR that revalues every collected hope; cost is legible in the empty satchel and the new recommendation “Recommend dissolution.” Causal lens holds throughout, but the shift from external inspection to internal surrender is slightly telescoped; one more beat of observable hesitation or bodily action would push it to 9+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Crystal glow, altitude, and the shell’s impossible presence are vivid, selective, and mirrored in Maren’s “frozen breath” perception; environment constrains the final act by providing the shelf-altar where the pearl crowns the spiral. Spatial choreography is clean; only the off-page exit keeps it from the 9-band gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—release her own grief—tightens once the shell’s confessions force a public/private mirror; the act of donating the pearl forecloses her collector identity with visible souvenir loss. Pressure escalates under causal logic, but the middle lacks an intermediate obstacle or temptation to test her resolve before the final beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of shared vulnerability emerges organically from the spiral of anonymous voices and the pearl’s transformation; no overt thesis is declared. Final image of the glowing pearl refracting etched truths offers a non-literal answer that reweights the premise without moralizing, meeting the 9- gate despite a hairline risk of sentimental glow.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is sharp—“quiet stars,” “frozen breath,” “resonant hush” all filter through Maren’s trained yet haunted gaze. Rhythm modulates from clinical inspector cadence to lyric elongation inside the crystal dark, supporting pressure without head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, high-density, and largely loop-free; metaphors are coherent and grounded. One mixed cluster (“latent radiance…refused to release it all at once”) and occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”-level phrasing) flirt with overwriting but do not obscure causality or dull the final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The nautilus-as-confessional is an ingenious repurposing that fuses natural object with emotional archive; pairing it with a cultivated pearl literalizes the theme of “irritation into luminosity.” Risk lies in the familiar post-apocalyptic inspector trope, but the specific shell-pearl ritual transforms it into a singular moment rather than checklist innovation.</comment>
