<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Maren’s vigilance and long tenure are credibly anchored; her calm inventiveness shows in the amber-rod reading and lock-turning beats. Interiority stays concrete—“fort held its breath,” “someone had remembered them”—without therapy-speak. The final smile is a micro-gesture that costs her anonymity; the eleven-year wait and overnight reroute make the renunciation legible. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene, so the 9+ quick test just misses.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the grid’s “fork” of light rewrites the social contract for the undercity; cost is felt in Maren’s imperceptible smile and lifelong risk. Causal chain—blackout → dial code → three locks → reroute—holds without teleport. Orientation is anchored by word 89 (“fort at twilight”), well under the 120-word ceiling. Persistent constraint (47 doors, eleven years) shapes every tactic; no retroactive knowledge leaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Phosphor-veins, half-painted sundial, and amber rod are specific, tactile, and filtered through Maren’s professional eye. The fort’s ridge position and undercity cable geography constrain the reroute plan; the sundial’s “unfinished art” camouflage directly enables the cipher read. Micro-setting (rod as light source) allows the courtyard action to continue in blackout. Environment charges the final image—“fort gleamed again at dawn”—reweighting whose light is whose.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—return light to the undercity—signaled in paragraph four. One meaningful tightening: blackout forces on-the-spot dial decode and lock adjustment, narrowing options from “wait” to “act tonight.” Price is implicit but legible: if caught, Maren loses eleven years of cover; the final smile acknowledges that perpetual risk. Escalation is accumulative/textural (years of small reroutes → single decisive flip) rather than causal reversal, coherent under chosen lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of systemic rewiring versus violent overthrow emerges through action—quiet lock turns, not explosives. Subtext lives in the half-painted dial: revolutions hide in what power overlooks. Final image of nameless streets waking to light invites reflection on invisible labor. No thesis statement; ambiguity lingers about Ministry retaliation, satisfying complexity requirement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Maren’s perceptual filter: “she knew exactly,” “she tilted it now.” Syntax is controlled and rhythmic—“fort held its breath,” “winking hush”—with compression that mirrors her alert calm. No head-hopping; diction stays within her guard-level lexicon. Distinctive touches (constellation quill, phosphor-veins) recur without self-conscious ornament.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; sentences open varied, no template cadence. Figurative language is spare—“lantern set upon the ridge”—and avoids purple clusters. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence adds new causal or imagistic information. One minor filter verb slip (“she watched from her post”) does not dull closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The “infrastructure rerouted by overlooked caretaker” angle feels fresh; dial-cipher as dead drop and bronze quill as star-map are specific inventions. Cradle of Sparks concept resists fireblood cliché, though name is slightly abstract. Transformation test holds: swap venue or object and the emotional logic collapses. Not quite risky enough for the bonus, but avoids every trope echo.</comment>
