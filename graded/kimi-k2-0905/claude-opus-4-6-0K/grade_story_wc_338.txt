<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lena’s interiority is concrete (“the familiar pull of things almost lost”) and her micro-choice to “not sensationalize” shows a hierarchy of values, but the causal chain from map tear to final renunciation is more accumulative than driven by visible internal contradiction; the cost is felt but not dramatized in a single irreversible act.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: her decision to leave the chapel “whispering” forecloses the path of exposure with felt conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—rain dissolving frescoes reweights the stake of preservation versus silence—taught by the opening image and paid off in the final line.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The rain-scoured vault is rendered through Lena’s conservator gaze: “softened the painted saints into ghosts” and the acoustics that “fold inward” constrain her choice to keep the place secret. Western-wall shelter versus eastern-wall loss becomes a tactile constraint that charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve versus reveal—tightens once when comparison of silent videos shows irreversible loss; her renunciation narrows options. Cost is legible in the final “tenderness” she finds in the tear itself, though escalation is single-note rather than cascading.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of “chosen silence” emerges through theBelgian’s abandoned footage and Lena’s parallel restraint; the final image reweights the map tear from damage to reverence without moralizing. Subtext resides in gestures of near-touch and the ellipsis of speech, creating lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature—map framer’s surgical vocabulary, limestone bloom, mineral bloom—remains consistent; rhythm breathes with damp acoustics and no head-hopping. Patterned elision (“she understood”) is taught early and paid off in the whispered exit.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High density—“decades of water seeping…softened the painted saints into ghosts” does three jobs in nine words. No loops or mixed metaphors; occasional elevated diction (“inconnu,” “conceptual repricing”) stays within conservator lexicon and does not obscure causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Freshens the “hidden chapel” trope through a conservator’s archival logic and the device of silent video comparison; the henge-to-vault descent feels inevitable yet not overtly mythic. Risk is moderate—quiet lyric rather than twist—but specificity of craft lends memorable angle.</comment>
