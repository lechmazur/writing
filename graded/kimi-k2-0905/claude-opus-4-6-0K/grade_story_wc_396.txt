<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren’s interior contradiction—willing to bear darkness yet uneasy with the title—surfaces early and drives the final refusal. The moment she palms the jagged crystal fragment, her calm intuition is embodied, not labelled. Haldr’s clenched fists and visible breath under the bare trees give him brief but credible pressure; his choice to take her shadow-lantern hand crystallizes a cost-laden shift in status. Only the slightest emotional abstraction in “the world tilted one degree closer to mercy” keeps this from 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: request → mirror-glimpse revelation → refusal → offer of shared sight. Orientation (who/where/when) anchors by the third sentence; no penalty. Closure is a Charged Poise: Maren’s refusal forecloses force and transfers moral weight to Haldr, cost felt in the ice groan and lighthouse sweep. The persistent constraint—she cannot keep both peace and innocence—locks the lens without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Ice floes “like old bones shifting” and breath curling above frozen apple trees fuse tactile sound, temperature, and sight into a single sensory sweep. The seventeen mottled mirrors act as micro-setting; their bronze frames and mottled glass constrain how knowledge is obtained and therefore shape the climax. Spatial choreography holds as Maren walks from cliff-edge orchard to stone building and back, Haldr’s position tracked. Setting directly charges the final image: the lighthouse beam arcs over the same ice that now bears the cost of choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—sanction force or find another path—is signaled in paragraph four and tightened when Maren sees the Southern mother rationing fish. The mirror visions function as because/therefore escalation: new knowledge narrows her options from sanction to refusal. Haldr’s agency is deferred yet still costs him his ready narrative of enemy cruelty. One micro-turn suffices; coincidence is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of empathy-as-action emerges through the accumulating mirror glimpses rather than exposition. The broken crystal fragment’s refracted light reweights incompleteness as clarity, giving the ending conceptual repricing without moralizing. Shadow-as-lantern image inverts the region’s fear into a tool for mercy, an inversion earned by early social context. No thematic statement is spoon-fed; resonance lingers in the final lighthouse sweep.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly bound to Maren’s perceptions: “ice floes ground... like old bones” is her metaphor, not an objective caption. Syntax lengthens during mirror-gaze, then clips at the refusal—“I will not sanction force”—mirroring decision pressure. No head-hop; Haldr’s interior is legible only through gesture and breath. Voice control under stress is exemplary.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “darkness pooled at her feet” performs atmosphere and stakes in one stroke. No synonym loops; “ice floes... ice shelf... ice bridge” are distinct referents. Mixed metaphors are avoided; mirror, crystal, and shadow maintain coherent through-line. Only a single near-scaffold clause—“she was trying to reconstitute the full picture”—slips into tell, but it is brief and does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The premise fuses Nordic ice-politics with psychopomp mirrors and a peacekeeper who weaponizes empathy rather than blades—an unobvious synthesis. Using salvaged vanity mirrors instead of a crystal ball reframes divination as fragmented collective sight, a fresh mechanical twist. Shadow-as-lantern risks cliché yet is grounded in social contempt for darkness, making the inversion feel inevitable. Specificity throughout (trembling hands rationing dried fish, empty nets) prevents abstraction; risk-taking sharpens rather than obscures stakes.</comment>
