<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cael’s “quiet enthusiasm” is dramatized through the embodied act of humming, coin-manipulation, and the jaw-bone conduit—never named as a mood. Interior contradiction surfaces when “stellar doubt” collides with her compulsive pattern-seeking, but the absence of a second character keeps relational pressure off-stage. The final sung note is a credible, foreclosed path with visible cost: she is now alone inside a newborn cosmos. Still, the absence of an on-page alternative choice (fold vs. stay) caps her arc just short of the 9-band gate.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the marble’s shudder and coin-stars reweight the premise—the contraction was never death but an ear waiting for a reply. Cost is legible: Cael is irrevocably alone, her body becomes tuning fork, and the old observatory is gone. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout: pattern of reversed causality → density of static → cadence shift to forward song. No causal turns are required under this lens; the final image crystallizes meaning with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The ambered observatory walls, vibrating cloth, and coins that melt into stars function as micro-setting that constrains and finally enables the closure act. Sensory triage under crisis is obeyed: Cael notices jaw-conducted vibration, thermal cloth texture, and the warming resin—never a tourist list. Spatial choreography is tight: cross-legged → ear to wall → coins slid → breath drawn → marble shudder. Environment literally becomes instrument; its specificity charges the final image, satisfying the 9-band gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will the universe listen?—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens when static resolves to a single tone. Cael’s agency is pure attention/alignment; the price is her irrevocable isolation inside a newborn cosmos. One meaningful deepening suffices: pattern-of-patterns becomes audible frequency. Cost is felt but not dramatized as tactical loss (no tool breaks, no time limit); hence capped below 8.5.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the accretion of reversed events, coins, and humming—never stated. Final image (coins → stars) reconfigures meaning: value is not currency but ignition. Ambiguity is purposeful: is the expansion Cael’s creation or the universe’s own echo? No moral is asserted; the reader carries the resonance. Slight deduction for “wavelength align with purpose” echoing prompt language mid-text, −0.1.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person close maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is Cael’s synesthetic jaw-bone listening and coin-pattern cognition. Rhythm modulates from long, ambered sentences to staccato bursts that mime static. Compression (“She drew a breath and sang…”) is taught by earlier coin-sliding pattern. No head-hopping; voice remains singular. Final crystalline line (“She was quietly enthusiastic…”) risks thematic echo but reads as earned recurrence, not intrusion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, high-density: “ambered long before Cael was born” fuses time, setting, and stakes in six words. No loops, no scaffold; figurative language is sparse and coherent. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing,” “stellar doubt”) stays within Cael’s plausible lexicon of last-observer mysticism. One mixed metaphor—“marble of potential” then “marble shuddered”—is allowed under lyric license and does not cloud causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The backwards-prophecy-as-cosmic-frequency is a non-obvious synthesis of time-reversed SETI and numismatic data-sorting. Coins-as-stars transformation feels inevitable yet unforeseeable. Risky second-person cosmos (“the universe… grew with her”) is justified by prior personification of contraction-as-listener. No close echoes of famous sf scenes; the piece owns its quiet, interior apotheosis.</comment>
