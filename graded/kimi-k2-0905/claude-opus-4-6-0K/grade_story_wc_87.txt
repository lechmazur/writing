<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Maren’s training-guilt split is embodied from the opening image of the salt-corroded compass through micro-choices in the cockpit; the psychic cost of her “miscalculation” is rendered as physical tension against tide and memory. The final refusal to open the compass until the pole count confirms her body-earned position crystallizes her arc with visible forfeit—she still swallows magnetic deviation, accepting imperfection as the new bearing. Interiority stays concrete (“bending what she felt to match what the numbers said”) without lapsing into therapeutic summary. Only a trace of safety-hedging in the phrase “close enough” keeps her from full moral ambiguity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The 800-word arc compresses a single causal chain: compass gift → Aleutian error → exile from instruments → re-navigation by poles → compass reopened on her own count. Each beat is therefore-linked, no off-stage shortcuts, and the closure reconfigures her epistemic rule-set: imperfect magnetic north accepted as the cost of reunion between “heart and action.” Reflection blocks are tethered to present sensory cues (tide push, pole #7714) and tilt tactics within the same beat. No orientation drift; spatial timeline stays tight from barnacle ramp to basalt stack.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Environment is not backdrop but antagonist: the ramp’s “dissolving concrete,” the current that “tried to push her south immediately,” and the numbered utility poles together form a shifting coordinate grid she must physically negotiate. Sea-spray cold, gull-laughter acoustics, and the brass weight of the compass under PFD are filtered through a cartographer’s selective attention—every sensation is a potential bearing. The poles act as micro-setting cum instrumentation, constraining her final steering decision without ever abstracting into mere symbol. One sentence of generic November skylight keeps it from 9+.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can she trust unaided perception after institutional betrayal?—is signaled inside 40 words and tightened by the single choice to resist GPS and count poles instead. The reversal occurs when tidal resistance verifies her manual reckoning, foreclosing the option of satellite crutch and forcing acceptance of magnetic error. Cost is visceral: eleven months of exile compressed into the ache of each paddle stroke. Could edge higher if a tangible object were permanently forfeited, but the psychic price is legibly paid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme—fidelity to embodied knowledge versus abstract system—emerges entirely through action: the moment she aligns her body with pole-line rather than algorithm. No character moralizes; father’s aphorism (“Never let the stars lie…”) functions as inherited rule-set that the finale rewrites into “Close enough,” a quiet conceptual repricing of perfectionism. The salt-corroded compass reappears as an image of honest imperfection rather than a tacked-on symbol. Final resonance lands as lived position statement, not maxim.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vocabulary of celestial navigation (“bathymetric,” “current correction,” “magnetic deviation”) stays inside a trained navigator’s lexicon without jargon spill. Sentence rhythm mimics paddle cadence—long reflective clauses interrupted by short corrective strokes (“She resisted.”). Free-indirect filters environmental data through occupational bias, sustaining psychic distance. Occasional lyric lift (“merrily melancholic”) risks slight authorial varnish but is earned by overall consistency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Zero scaffold loops; every clause adds new sensory, spatial, or causal data. Metaphors are spare and precise—“regret with teeth,” “swells building offshore”—and never clutter high-pressure beats. Opening line anchors voice, stakes, and place in twenty well-weighted words; final line releases the accrued tension through forward motion, not summary. Only a single adverbial tag (“immediately”) could be cut, a hairline blemish.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The “utility-pole navigation” conceit converts mundane infrastructure into human-scale sextant, a fresh inversion of tech-dependence narratives. Linking professional maritime disaster to intimate kayak penance avoids the standard redemption arc by accepting inherent deviation rather than achieving perfect absolution. Specificity of Oregon coast hydrology and numbered pole tags grounds the premise beyond generic wilderness therapy. Risk level is moderate; a bolder formal experiment could have pushed higher but might have broken the tight causal lens.</comment>
