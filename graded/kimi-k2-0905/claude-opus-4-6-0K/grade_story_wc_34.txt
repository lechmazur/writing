<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is concrete—her grandmother’s plate, the “stones in her chest”—and her micro-choice to sing the ghost’s story is embodied, costly, irrevocable. The contradiction between her lifelong anonymity and the public act of voicing another’s loneliness is dramatized, not labeled. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible absent; that keeps it shy of 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the wall’s face appears plain, the plate goes smooth—visible, irreversible cost under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The “silence that felt full” crystallizes stakes without exposition. Causality holds: because she sings, the code relents; the tightening is singular but sufficient.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The courtyard’s condensation-slick flagstones, the bolt plate’s warmth, the lightning-to-thunder interval—all constrain timing and tactile choice. The micro-setting (plate as tactile reader) charges the final image. A hairline slip: “floating above the clouds” is briefly disorienting before spatial rules are taught, but the payoff at descent waives penalty.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—mutual articulation of loneliness—tightens once: murals shift from encoded plea to open face. Agency is renunciation/transmission rather than battle; cost is the irrevocable act of singing, foreclosing her former anonymity. Under Accumulative lens, the cadence shift from desperate shimmer to “silence that felt full” reweights stakes with felt price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete reversal: art as code becomes art as face; loneliness is answered not by being fixed but by being witnessed. No moralizing—final image is lantern-flame, not lesson. The reprised “half hers, half something older” melody reweights earlier material with conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Lira’s perceptual filter: “driftingly alert” is both state and diction. Rhythm modulates—long fog-sentence vs. staccato “SING WHAT I CANNOT SAY”—without losing clarity. No dialogue, so voice contamination absent; compression is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm: varying sentence ingress, no template cadence. Figurative layers (“balcony of heaven,” “cathedral organ”) are sparse and concentrated in low-pressure beats; clarity never muddled. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image, stakes, or texture. High density: “flower press bolt plate” compresses tool, heirloom, decoder in four words.</comment>

<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise—ghost uploaded into graffiti—is fresh, yet grounded in tactile decoder plate and bodily song. Risk taken: quiet lyric escalation instead of showdown; coherence sustained. Slight echo of “code that weeps” trope, but specific alpine-flower lineage and lightning-thunder clock transform it. Without the plate-and-mural dyad the arc collapses, proving irreplaceability.</comment>
