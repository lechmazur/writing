<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Maren’s interior contradiction—believing only in repair, not transmutation—drives every micro-choice from gold-brushing to drowning herself. The scarred face, charm-touch reflex, and held-breath countdown embody cost without therapy-speak. Final swim is earned renunciation; uncertainty persists, paid for by earlier soldered grief. Closure keeps flaw intact, satisfying Earned Stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pockmark-to-frequency pattern taught early, density crests when gears find purpose, Charged Poise lands as platform sinks. Workshop geography and timeline anchored inside 120 words; acid sea rules stay consistent. Statue resonance forecloses retreat; “seconds of mask” is visible constraint pricing the unknown. Cost legible in final exhalation, no outline drift.</comment>

<comment>Copper pontoon hiss, vitriol glow, crucible splash—selective sensory triad filtered through scar-noticing bias. Acid viscosity constrains footwear, gear-cradle placement, and final immersion tempo; workshop’s “purposeless machinery” refigures into resonant organ at closure. Micro-setting (gear charm) literally pilots direction underwater. Environment commands tactics and recharges last image, clearing 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—decode statue or dissolve—tightens once gold pattern proves breathable seconds below. Each filled pockmark narrows options, eliminating retreat as sea glows. Escalation is textural accretion, not causal whirlpool, suiting lens. Price (acid inhalation risk) unmistakable on page, meeting high-band need.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Kintsugi reframed as memory-quilt emerges through action, not label: gold stitches link drowned cultures to maternal loss, reweighting oblivion into collaborative testimony. No moralizing sentence caps the piece; final constellation of scars offers non-literal answer about beauty of fracture. Subtext resonates without tidy thesis, satisfying complexity test.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person floats close behind Maren’s selective attention—scar maps, solder smoke, gear teeth—without leaking into unattainable knowledge. Syntax grows clipped as mask valve ticks, mirroring breath constriction; acid sea descriptions stay within vocational credulity. No head-hop; psychic distance contracts toward sensorium under pressure. Distinct perceptual signature sustained through charged poise.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Figurative layering is rationed: one dominant metaphor per beat (“wound refusing to close”) then propels action. Sentence rhythm modulates from long exhalations of description to hammer-blow fragments during descent. No synonym loops, no scaffold; “green froth that the current carried nowhere” packs dual job (color + futility). Closure line crystalline, untouched by artifice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Alchemic kintsugi merged with drowned gear-punk yields fresh synthesis; acid-sea workshop not recycled from canon. Risk—lyric accretion carrying plot—pays off via resonant reconfiguration rather than action set-piece. Specificity of pockmark cartography prevents abstraction. Concept feels inevitable yet non-obvious, fulfilling transformation test.</comment>
