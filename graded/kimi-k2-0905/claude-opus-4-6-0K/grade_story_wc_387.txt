<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Saya’s interior contradiction—content to mend nets yet compelled to decode firefly corridors—remains embodied in every beat: the whisk against her hip, the rice-paper charts folded into her coat. The final “knot between what exists and what is known” crystallizes her hierarchy of values at clear cost: solitude, labor, and the burden of witness. No causal break; the choice to keep climbing is earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Saya’s renunciation of recognition is legible in the last line, charged by the whisk’s pressure on her hip and the moonlit corridors she alone will chart. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each image layers density until the final hush reweights the premise with conceptual cost. No orientation debt; anchors clear within 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The parapet’s wet stone channels and the whisk’s splayed tines function as micro-setting, constraining Saya’s sight-lines and turning the tool into a literal frame that shapes the final image. Firefly “highways” evolve with the moon, integrating environment into choice. Environment thus charges the closing beat; specificity stays selective and POV-filtered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—the drive to witness and record hidden patterns—tightens once when moonlight shifts the corridors and Saya recommits to return alone. Pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens; no external antagonist needed. Cost is visible (ongoing labor, solitude) though not escalated to a new threshold tonight; the deepening is modest but sufficient for 750 words.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through concrete recurrence: nets, knots, moon paths, and the whisk all refract “hidden effort” without authorial exposition. The final image reweights the concept—knowledge itself as mending—leaving resonant ambiguity about whether the world notices its own repair. No moralizing; particulars carry the aftereffect.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is precise: brine-scented fingers, lunar signatures in standing water, whisk tines framing light. Rhythm modulates—long sensuous sentences in calm, crisp fragments under the breeze. No head-hopping; POV distance stable. Compression (“demure audacity”) is taught early and paid off in the descending stance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or paraphrase loops. Figurative language is sparse and patterned—“whispering stone,” “highways of light”—each recharged at closure. High density achieved: one clause often handles atmosphere, character, and causal cue simultaneously. Zero artifacts in final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: a net-mender who treats insect phototaxis as nautical charts, rendered through tactician’s patience rather than scientist’s jargon. Risk in quiet stakes—no disaster, only ongoing witness—heightens coherence. The premise would collapse if Saya’s trade or tool were swapped; specificity anchors novelty.</comment>
