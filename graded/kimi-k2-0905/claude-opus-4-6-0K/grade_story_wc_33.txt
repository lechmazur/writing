<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elias’s “respectfully rebellious” creed is shown, not told, through the daily border ritual and the bottle choice; his interiority is concrete (“he had started searching—not for justice…”). The micro-choice to uncork is the earned hinge. Missing higher band because the family’s pressured silence keeps them functional but not crucible-sharp; their interior stays opaque, so relationship-as-crucible bullet is only half-met.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the arcade’s “brittle hush” reconfigures Elias’s endless circuit into visible cost (“a promise…began at last to mend”). Causal lens holds—uncork therefore blind therefore passage—without late convenience. Orientation is anchored at word 25; no ambiguity. The bottle’s prior set-up and the twilight clock satisfy persistent-constraint test. Hairline slip: “midwifing their passage” is slightly outline-ish, keeping it under 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The cobalt arcade filters twilight into “deep blue,” then becomes tactical cover for column proximity; setting constrains motion. Micro-setting object—the dented mail box—grounds the beat. Drone “vultures” and violet burst evolve the space causally. Final image of arcade holding “brittle hush” charges closure, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“move the family unseen”—is signaled line 5. Bottle uncorking is the single tightening that forecloses retreat; cost is the now-exposed route and Elias’s smuggler status. Agency is his alone, under causal lens. Pressure stays coherent; no fake escalation cycles. Could be sharper if the quarter-mile blackout carried a personal wound, but visible price is adequate for 800-word scale.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete—absences speak, gaps deliver—never abstractly lectured. Final image of “promise…begin to mend” reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in gesture: handing sister’s letter in silence carries reunion history. Ambiguity lingers: will the drones re-map? Complexity retained, satisfying 9− threshold.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person-close diction is controlled, rhythmic, and filtered through Elias’s postal optic—“he listened” to absence, “linked” gaps. No head-hop; perceptual signature consistent. Compression like “absence spoke” is taught early, paid off at end. Minor cadence echo—“he thought it might…he thought it might”—almost hits template drum, but variation rescues it.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence lengths breathe with twilight slack then tighten in the fifteen-minute window. Density high—“glass cylinder…heavy, faintly humming”—performs three jobs: sensory, prop-state, foreshadow. No mixed metaphors; “vultures” fits POV lexicon. One scaffold spotted: “He had watched promises fracture like dry earth” followed by “he had started searching” could compress, but does not obscure causality at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: postal ghost rules + drone surveillance + weather-in-bottle EMP = specific speculative angle, not checklist. “Midwifing passage” trope is re-wrought for displacement context. Risk of violet tech is taken and paid. Could tip 9+ with one more irreversible physical consequence for Elias, but ingenuity is otherwise exemplary.</comment>
