<comment>The summoner’s interior contradiction—her need to silence meaning while wielding the very gift that births it—grounds every micro-fold of the crane wing. Embodied cost arrives when the paper blanks itself, externalizing the erasure she must carry alone. The single-wing metaphor of fractured flight is reweighted into earned stasis: she walks away preferring quiet to prophecy, irreversibly forfeiting her former identity as reader-of-doom. One decimal off 9.0 only because the renunciation beat is compressed into a single hush-line rather than a bodily tremor we can feel.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the final “smoothed hush” reweights every prior sound cue, and the paper’s blankness is visible cost. Causality is lyric-accumulative—each origami crease a measurable unit of attention that finally cancels the prophecy’s waveform. Orientation is taught by line 3 (“who, where, when” anchored in moonlit brook), waived by lyric pattern. No lens ambiguity; the ending image pays off the taught negative-space rule without contradiction.</comment>

<comment>Brook-as-notation and moonlight-as-molten-silver act as environmental instruments the protagonist literally plays; the water’s hush frequency constrains her folding tempo. Micro-setting—the rice-paper wing—functions as mutable terrain: its blank return reconfigures the valley’s acoustic future. Sensory hierarchy never drifts into tourist catalog; each sedge rustle is screened for encoded syllables. Missing 0.2 to 9.0 because temperature/weather is only implied, not weaponized against her skin.</comment>

<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prevent war born of child-laughter prophecy—is signaled in starling cipher and tightened each time a night-sound tries to reassemble the phrase. Agency is iterative attention-work rather than single decision, but each crease forecloses alternative readings until the counter-frequency propagates. Visible price: the owl’s sudden silence marks a living channel permanently muted. One beat shy of 9.0 because the prophecy itself remains off-page; we feel its absence more than its resisted weight.</comment>

<comment>Theme—listening as an ethical act of refusal—emerges through negative-space origami rather than thesis. The reweighted wing-blank offers conceptual repricing: meaning itself becomes the enemy she must un-weave, a stance with social cost (no future seers will read doom). Subtext in owl-quiet and blood-echo makes the argument without declaration. Docks 0.1 for “she understood now,” a rare interior label that briefly overlays the embodied epiphany.</comment>

<comment>Third-person lyric maintains perceptual signature: syntactic breath lengthens during “rests” between water-sounds, compresses at crease-moments. Diction stays within the summoner’s esoteric lexicon (“counter-resonance,” “terrestrially cosmic hymn”) without metastasizing into purple. No head-hop; cosmic scale is filtered through her knees-in-mud attention. Rhythm modulates like tide, teaching the reader to hear the hush before it erases prophecy.</comment>

<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—image + acoustics—without scaffold: “starlight passed through it, casting the shadow of every fold onto her palm like a map of invisible corridors.” No mixed metaphors; paper-map-corridor stays inside light-projection physics. Zero paraphrase loops; each new crease reveals a different acoustic liability. High-band gate met: no figurative muddle touches the final blank-wing beat.</comment>

<comment>Concept of “summoning meaning itself” flips genre expectation of demon-calling, then literalizes it through acoustical engineering. Oracular origami is fresh instrumentation; no close echoes in print. Risk-taking—entire climax is a negative act of listening—heightens stakes without gimmickry. Synthesis feels inevitable: of course a single wing can’t fly, so it must silence flight-paths of speech.</comment>
