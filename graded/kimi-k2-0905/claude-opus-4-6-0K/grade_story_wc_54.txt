<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maren’s curiosity and “functional creativity” are shown through embodied micro-choices—pocketing the sextant, sketching the hydro-loop—so the trait drives action rather than labels. Interiority stays concrete, but the emotional contradiction (hope vs. county-committee cynicism) is asserted more than dramatized in scene. The final “stoic wonder” stance is earned by prior causal chain, so the arc lands with visible cost: she forecloses leaving with the carnival and shoulders the terminal’s future. Still, no second character on page keeps relationship crucible and status pressure off-stage, capping depth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the saved file “Gate 11” crystallizes that the terminal’s flows—and Maren’s—have been re-routed toward hope, with the brass weight as felt cost. Causal linkage holds: sextant discovery → metaphor of measurement → sketching redirection → file naming; each beat narrows options from survey-only to committed vision. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no disorientation serves closure, so waiver applies. One tightening turn suffices under Accumulative lens; pattern taught early (confetti, ducts, flows) recurs in denser cadence at exit.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Environment, body, and tool triangulate: the drooping light strand, warm geothermal breath, and brass sextant constrain every tactical choice. Sensory hierarchy is filtered through engineer perception—load-bearing vectors, drainage angles—so detail never catalogs but pressures. The terminal’s “maze of intentions” is re-read as asset in the final image, satisfying 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is flawless; no impossible positions across the single continuous scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can dormant infrastructure be re-read as alive?—is signaled by word 50 and deepens when rainwater, heat, and power are re-imagined as blood on life-support. One meaningful tightening: the moment she re-labels the file “Gate 11,” foreclosing the option of forgetting; cost is the weight of responsibility now carried. Pressure escalates via accretion of usable waste, not external antagonist; pattern break is the shift from mapping to designing. Coincidence is absent; all turns stem from her agency and the sextant’s metaphor.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—resurrection through re-measurement—emerges from concrete re-routing of water, heat, light, not from thesis statements. Subtext lives in the unlit bulb and orphaned star coordinates: past voyages gone dark yet still demanding orientation. Final image reweights “maze of intentions” from failure to fertile substrate, a Conceptual Repricing with social cost: county committees await, funding may vanish. No moralizing sentence mars exit; resonance is carried by brass against ribs.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains tight psychic distance; perceptual signature is engineer—angles, flows, grout lines—never tourist catalog. Syntax lengthens when imagining hydro corridors, then compresses at file save, mirroring emotional crest. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk zero; register stays within intern lexicon. Brass sextant recurs as tactile metronome, rhythmically re-grounding each speculative flight.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—mapping drainage while revealing character hope—and avoid scaffold. Metaphors (“cathedral of transit,” “reef absorbs shipwrecks”) are sparse, taught early, paid off at closure without muddle. Zero paraphrase loops; no filter-verb stacks. Opening and closing lines book-end with light imagery, creating purposeful echo cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Adaptive-reuse of abandoned spaceport via hydro-loop sketch is fresh synthesis of cli-fi and quiet hope. Sextant-as-measurement-tool repurposed to measure terrestrial futures feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk—stoic wonder in decayed infrastructure—could have slid into TED-talk uplift, but voice keeps tactile doubt. No close echoes of canonical scenes; specificity anchors universals.</comment>
