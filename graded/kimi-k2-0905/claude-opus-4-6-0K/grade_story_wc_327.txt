<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The copper veins are an arresting externalization of absorbed stories, giving the teller a singular body-image that guides every tactile choice; interiority stays sensorial (“Each night the words poured through her… dissolved like frost”) rather than abstract. The final act—dragging diamond across bone to let birds route the resonance—converts private obsession into performative translation, a credible renunciation of speech that costs her the ordinary archive of narrative. Motive remains steady, but the absence of any second on-page figure keeps relationship/status bullets dark; the piece hangs on solo embodied stakes and meets that narrower bar.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the language migrates from tongue to mineral/copper, foreclosing recovery in audible form; cost is legible in the hum she will forever carry (“waiting for the next storyteller”). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—each added texture-tone layers density until cadence shifts in the final hush. Causality is internal but coherent: because she cannot keep dream-words at dawn, therefore she externalizes them into bone-echoes she can bodily host. Orientation is swift (entrance to canyon, dusk arrival) and the single transition (climb to ledge) is spatially clean.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Environment is not backdrop but instrument: femur surfaces determine timbre; corridor angles multiply syllables; swifts serve as acoustic valves. The towers, diamond, and her own copper vasculature form a closed micro-setting that literally constrains how the translation can occur—no substitution possible. Sensory field is selective (wind-scoured bone ridges, rasp of diamond, dusk air) and filtered through her tactile priorities.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rescue a language from erasure—declared early; pressure intensifies as each bone-drag trial risks failure until the birds lock the pattern and the canyon “speaks.” The tightening beat is the moment she commits the diamond’s flaw to bone, an irreversible tactic that spends the artifact’s mystery. Cost is the curse’s confirmation: she will never herself pronounce the saved tongue, only harbor its vibration.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme—translation as bodily sacrifice—emerges through image, not statement; the copper circuitry literalizes how stories scar their vessel. The closing hum reframes earlier dream-loss as necessary price, offering a charged poise rather than moral. Subtext whispers that preservation may demand self-erasure, an ambiguity left unsettled.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person tightly filtered through the teller yields consistent perceptual signature: textures are “read with fingertips,” sound folds geometrically, time is measured in bird-wheel angles. Syntax modulates from languid pre-dusk description to compressed procedural clauses during the drag-and-listen beat, mirroring intensified focus. No dialogue appears; voice sustains authority via lyrical precision without purple drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Figurative layering is dense but pattern-taught early (“copper veins… tributaries of a river”) and justified by the fantastic premise; payoff arrives when the metaphor becomes literal archive. No mixed metaphors obstruct clarity. Rhythm breathes—long sentences for looming towers, staccato prepositional phrases during diamond scoring. One paraphrase loop detected (“Each echo returned altered, carrying harmonics… like the ghost-words”) yet it tightens association, not padding. Generally propulsive, clean grammar, strong verbs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fusing linguistics, osteo-architecture, and bird choreography to render language-death is arresting and internally coherent; the risk pays off in a closure impossible without those elements. Premise flirts with abstraction but grounds every beat in sensory procedure. After-image lingers beyond plot summary, satisfying transformation test.</comment>
