<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sable’s interiority is textured—her perceptual signature is consistent, her illness-borne clarity and the pressure of the swallowed truth are embodied rather than labeled. The micro-choice to descend and speak is earned by the thermal-inversion image that literalizes her stasis. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene, so the beat stays just shy of 9+ territory. Still, the arc from frozen silence to costly speech is credible and character-particular.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds throughout: because she swallows the lie, air stagnates; therefore she must descend and speak. The oracle’s answer is both payoff and pivot, reweighting her options with a visible conceptual cost. Closure is a Decisive Change—she steps outside to let cold air verify her new stance—priced by the acknowledged risk to love. No holes in continuity; orientation is anchored within 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The weather station is evoked with ozone, clattering instruments, frost-rimmed windows—selective, sensory, lived-in. The botanical drawing and the oracle corner function as micro-settings that constrain choice: the smudged petal cues the swallowed truth; the oracle corner is the only place she can weigh it. Mountain cold and thermal inversion are not backdrop but physics that decide her next move. Meets 9+ gate: environment charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—clearing the staleness of a suppressed truth—is signaled early and tightens once through the oracle’s answer that reframes her paralysis as atmospheric inversion. Agency is intellectual yet costly: she decides to descend and speak, forfeiting the safety of silence. Cost is conceptual but felt: the risk that love may corrode. One meaningful turn suffices; no coincidence rescues her.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion metaphor: truth denied behaves like trapped air—weightless yet motion-killing. The final image of stepping into dawn cold reweights the gentian drawing and oracle answer into one resonant whole. No moralizing; the sorrow is atmospheric, not declared. Ambiguity remains: love may still fault, but breath returns—that suffices.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyric-technical, calibrated to an atmospheric scientist’s perceptual bias: barometric arrays, dew point, thermal inversion. Syntax breathes with altitude clarity; no filter-verb stacks. The compressed elision “muttering numbers…automated logs faithfully recorded” teaches the pattern early and pays off when she copies oracle numbers into the same logbook. Distinctive without drifting into purple.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, atmosphere, or causality. Figurative control is tight—thermal inversion as emotional stasis—never muddled. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges the inversion motif. High information density yet lyric cadence; no artifact touches closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fusing a fault-tolerant oracle with meteorological inversion as emotional physics is a non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk in lyric-scientific hybrid pays off: the story could not survive without this exact metaphoric engine. No stock gentian-as-innocence trope—the smudge reweights it into damage. Fresh angle on sister-betrayal via atmospheric science rather than kitchen-table confrontation.</comment>
