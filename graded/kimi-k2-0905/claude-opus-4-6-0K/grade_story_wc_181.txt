<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maren’s curator reflex—“preserve without possessing”—gives her a credible, vocation-deep motive that survives the surreal frame. The bathroom epiphany is an earned micro-choice: solitude as inheritance engine. Her trembling shift from lost to “tend” shows visible cost (the cameo left on the branch). Interiority stays concrete; only minor slip is the over-tidy “simply love wearing its most complicated face.”</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the cameo portrait layers her face into the matriarchal composite, re-weighting inheritance as custodianship, not ownership—cost is the relinquishing of personal image. Causal lens holds: each spiral (book → orchard → cameo question) unlocks the prior beat. Orientation anchored by word 100 (asteroid, airless, breathing). No plot amnesia; the outhouse feels inevitable, not contrived.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The impossible orchard is rendered through selective sense filters—“pale green skull fruit,” warm bark on cold stone—so setting constrains the metaphysical rule-set. Micro-setting of the outhouse becomes the crucible for knowledge transfer, charging the final image. Spatial choreography stays clean across zero-gravity and bathroom transition. One cap: we never feel the asteroid’s exterior beyond the grove, keeping it just shy of 9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“What did she know?”—tightens into “Will I keep or tend?” The whisper-question to the cameo is the single escalation that forecloses possession. Stakes remain personal, vis-à-vis generational time; no external antagonist needed. Cost is legible: she surrenders her likeness to the composite, a permanent addition to the living archive.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges as archival ethics versus genealogical entitlement—curatorship as love. Motif of layered faces/images accumulates meaning without meta-commentary. Final image of the cameo on the branch offers non-literal answer: inheritance is additive, not extractive. Avoids sermon; only hairline slip is the abstract “complicated face” tag.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person stays close to Maren’s perceptual bias—notice the cataloguer’s eye for dated margins and velvet boxes. Syntax flexes under wonder: long languid clauses for orchard, staccato for bathroom burst. No head-hop; unreliability not attempted. Dialogue absent, so voice purity remains intact.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from vine-long (“pistachio trees erupting…”) to shard-short (“The orchard blossomed on.”), matching reveal tempo. Figurative language is rationed; each metaphor (stone palms, geological strata) lands once and works. Zero loops or scaffold. Only micro-drift: “simply complicated” edges toward oxymoron tagline.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Combines cosmic pastoral, archival SF, and bathroom epiphany in a synthesis that feels inevitable yet uncatalogued. The nonlinear will-as-book and pistachio skull-fruit refract familiar generational trauma into fresh optics. Risk of astral orchard pays off by rooting it in curator practice. Transformation test fails if Maren isn’t a curator—freshness is specific.</comment>
