<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Maren’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her perceptual gift is shown through tactile rose-cutting and ambient listening, not labeled. The refusal to become her father’s “instrument” is a credible, cost-shaping stance. The only gap: we never see her wrestle with a live temptation to leave the dome; the pacifism is stated, not freshly tested under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a perfect Charged Poise: the final “it was enough” crystallizes her renunciation with felt cost—the world will keep breaking, her roses will keep growing. The Accumulative lens holds: each engraved virtue and re-handled sandbag scrap layers until the last line reweights the stakes. No causal gaps; orientation is anchored by word 50 (“glass-domed enclosure”).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The dome, knife, and scrap function as micro-setting; the scrap’s final return as moisture-bandage charges the closing image. Desert-rose botany is precise (caudex, cambium) and shapes the method. Spatial track is immaculate—no floating bodies. Smoke column serves as mirrored architecture, constraining nothing but coloring tone—just misses 9+ gate by a hair.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—continuity versus chaos—tightens once: tower falls, she still engraves. The act of tying the scrap around the cut rose is the visible trade-off: she chooses stewardship of one plant over any larger fight. Cost is legible but single-note; no second tightening or external complication inside the dome. Sufficient for 600-word scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from iterated concrete acts: engraving patience into wood, sheathing the blade, re-using fallen scrap. No abstract statement until the final line, which lands as Conceptual Repricing rather than moral. The refusal to articulate a thesis is itself the stance—theme stays tacit and potent.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays strictly inside Maren’s perceptual bandwidth—“sand hawk landing three stories above” is a lovely example of her impossible acuity. Rhythm modulates: long breathy sentences for dome warmth, clipped fragments for blade click. No head-hop; diction stays within her plausible lexicon (“cambium,” “caudex”) without showing off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence at least dual-loads (action + atmosphere). Metaphors are coherent—“column of smoke looked architectural”—and physically sustained. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with the hoe-and-kneel pace. Final line earns its punch by echoing “long habit” from paragraph three—pattern taught early, paid off.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The pacifist horticulturist who literally grows morals into plants is fresh, yet avoids gimmick by keeping botany accurate and stakes personal. Tower-fall as off-stage catalyst rather than set-piece is a smart inversion of spectacle. Risk: quiet ending could feel like non-event, but the Charged Poise rescues it. Not quite a 9+ because the external world remains a generic post-crisis backdrop.</comment>
