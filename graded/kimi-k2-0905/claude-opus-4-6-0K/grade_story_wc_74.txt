<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lena’s insomnia and the quiet hope that strangers carry buried kindness drive every micro-choice; her decision to paint the old man’s memory is earned by the prior failed canvases and the moon-triggered vision. Interiority stays concrete—“restless thing that lived behind her eyes,” “small act of hope laid down on canvas”—without therapy-speak. The only slip is that the final sleep beckons a touch too neatly, but the cost of four sleepless nights and the unfinished portraits remains visible, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Lena’s palm on the greenhouse glass crystallizes her belief that the kindness still lives in the old man, reweighting the earlier failed paintings with undeniable conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each stroke and moonlit vision deepens the density until the final saffron-quiet image. Orientation is anchored by line 6; no causality breaks. One hairline slip: the brush’s “moon-tipped” property is introduced late yet pays off at once, so no deduction touches the ending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The fogged greenhouse glass, exhaust-stained concrete, and saffron moonlight filter every perception; the moon-tipped brush functions as micro-setting that constrains the final strokes. Sensory selection narrows to condensation, muted light, and translucent skin—details that mirror Lena’s insomnia-softened attention. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating bodies. Environment charges the closure image when moonlight pools on her hand, passing the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove kindness survives in strangers—is signaled early and tightens through each aborted canvas until the old man’s portrait forecloses the option to keep searching; the visible price is four sleepless nights and the grandmother brush irreversibly yellowed with cadmium. Escalation is Accumulative: failed paintings → moon-vision → final portrait → earned exhaustion. No reversal, but the deepening reweights the premise with felt cost. Sufficient for 8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the particular: a lost Romansh syllable and a grocery climb in the rain, not an abstract lecture on kindness. The final image—old man mouthing a forgotten word while Lena finally sleeps—delivers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights every prior brushstroke. No moralizing, no thematic echo. Ambiguity lingers: the kindness is neither confirmed nor denied, only transferred onto canvas and into moonlight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature is insomnia-sharp—“smog-choked city,” “veins mapped a geography of years.” Rhythm swells and contracts with painting strokes; no filter-verb stacks. No dialogue, so no voice contamination. One lyrical compression—“daydream pulling her sideways out of time”—is taught early and paid off at closure. Distinct, controlled, 9-adjacent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Sentences do double duty: “glass panels fogged with the breath of plants” fuses setting and metaphor without overwriting. Metaphors are coherent—moonlight as saffron, lost language as pulse—never mixed. One paraphrase loop (“small acts survived… kindness like a second pulse”) costs −0.2. Otherwise propulsion is clean; final paragraph lands with crystalline clarity. No artifacts in the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusing insomnia, endangered Romansh, and moonlit grocery memory into a rooftop greenhouse portrait feels inevitable yet fresh; no trope cataloguing. The moon-tipped brush repurposed for oil lines transforms a heritage object without nostalgic cliché. Risk—quiet lyric ending instead of confrontation—heightens coherence. If names and places swapped, the emotional engine would fracture, passing the transformation test.</comment>
