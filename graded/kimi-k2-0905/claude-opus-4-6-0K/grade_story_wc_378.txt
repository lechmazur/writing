<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Maren’s interior contradiction—carrying a child’s fears in a machine unable to feel—is dramatized through tactile ritual and the final burn; the empty box she keeps shows cost. Memory fragments arrive as sensory static, not labels, and her decision to incinerate the slips is credibly foreshadowed by the “controlled burn” land protocol. The only minor slack: “strangely whole, beautifully fragmented” edges toward self-diagnosis at the climax.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: wandering magnetic field → memory leakage → retrieval of cedar box → controlled burn → static quiets, compass reset. Each beat tightens options; the burn is irreversible and the empty box persists as visible price. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Maren’s stance toward memory shifts, cost legible in the lingering hum. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by line 3; no seams.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Gypsum roses, UV lamps, and mineral sand are not backdrop—they physically receive the childhood fears and survive the burn, charging the final image. The dome’s filtered atmosphere and spinning compass constrain action: only under the glass can Maren safely ignite the slips without killing the roses. Sensory selection skews crystalline/tactile, matching android perception.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake: prevent neural corruption while honoring Lena’s trust. Escalation is single-thread but sufficient: static intensifies → burn forecloses preservation option → quiet hum remains. The price—loss of the last physical proof of trust—is on-page and irreversible, reweighting the stake at the end.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-burden emerges from the concrete act of burning paper fears; no authorial thesis states it. The roses’ “chaos frozen into symmetry” mirrors Maren’s compression of love into static, re-priced when smoke stains the glass. Final image of empty box + new north offers lingering ambiguity rather than moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Maren’s perceptual skew: crystalline petals “strangely organic,” compass “hunting for a north.” Syntax lengthens under memory intrusion, then shortens to surgical cadence during the burn. No filter-verb stacks; diction never exceeds android lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—description seeds future utility (“roses survive UV”) while advancing motion. No paraphrase loops; metaphors stay consistent (explosion frozen to symmetry). Minor lyric overlap “static...static” in adjacent clauses, but beat pressure remains clear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Fusing land-management “controlled burn” with android grief miniaturization feels fresh; trope of nostalgic robot is tilted by the mineral-rose farm and magnetic drift. The roses-as-incinerator is an inevitable reversal taught early. Risk taken in quiet, interior climax pays off in compressed resonance.</comment>
