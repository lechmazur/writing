<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Maren’s loner-observer profile is consistent and embodied (her laugh ricocheting through the geode), but she never faces a real trade-off or cost: the seeds drop into her lap, she works, she smiles. No contradictory impulse is tested; the interior tension promised by “it broke her heart” stays abstract. The job defines her more than any flaw or desire, so the final “began again” feels like reset, not earned endurance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure is a gentle CR: missing paths are conceptually repriced as “migrated,” reweighting the premise with wonder rather than loss. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each seed pane adds density until the library is whole—and the cost is the lingering knowledge that memory will keep scattering, forcing eternal labor. The only causal gap: the bird’s arrival is pure gift, but that coincidence complicates rather than resolves, satisfying Situational rules. Orientation is swift and spatially tracked; no late-rule patches.</comment>

<comment>The geode’s prismatic light is filtered through Maren’s professional eye—color as data—so description never stalls action; crater glass likewise doubles as tool and archive. Sensory economy is high: salt wind from a single tern wing-beat replaces weather exposition. The cave’s scale and fissure are used twice (entry and exit), anchoring choreography. Light refracting through finished panes at the end recharges the opening image, meeting the 9+ constraint test even if the setting itself does not alter tactics.</comment>

<comment>The dominant stake—will complete stories survive?—is signaled early and tightens when vanishings accelerate. One meaningful deepening occurs: seeds restore connective tissue, shifting the stakes from irretrievable loss to perpetual migration, with the conceded cost of unending labor. No reversible choice is forced upon Maren, so pressure plateaus after discovery, but the conceptual repricing lands cleanly. Meets short-form escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the conservation paradox: preservation requires accepting dispersal. Subtext lives in the gesture of pressing grief into glass—craft as mortal defiance. No declarative moral; the final library of color and shadow lets the reader feel the cost. The tern’s unseen onward flight invites reflection on anonymous continuities without sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-limited stays snug to Maren’s perceptual filter—light as “slow prismatic waves,” seeds like “punctuation.” Syntax is controlled, clauses breathing with discovery, no drumbeat repetition. No dialogue, so no contamination risk. Voice modulates from methodical recollectionist to surprised laughter, holding coherent stance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence lengths swell and contract with foam dissolving. No loops or synonym churn; every adjective (“iridescent,” “salvific”) earns keep. Metaphors stay coherent—foam as “fistful of dissolving froth” mirrors later glass permanence. One near-purple phrase (“language of longing. A grammar of joy”) is forgiven because it literalizes her craft.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The sea-foam recollectionist is a fresh occupational metaphor for memory work; coupling it with avian seed dispersal of lost paths is non-obvious yet inevitable once revealed. Crater glass as permanent emotional notation weaponizes a geology artifact rarely seen in fiction. Risky lyric accumulation pays off in the final light-show library. Concept commits fully—no retreat into metaphorical hand-waving.</comment>
