<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her throat aches, the cork circle presses her palm, she “listens” while Bertram scoffs. Contradictory impulses (obedience vs. her whisper-experiment) coexist in-scene, not in summary. The final stance crystallizes with cost: she risks professional ridicule and forfeits the horn’s authority. Only micro-gap: we never see her actually log the trawler’s 2° correction—data is implied, not dramatized—so the earned change feels 0.1 shy of full payment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative lens: scent vials, garden breath, and logbook entries layer until the quiet correction of the trawler reweights the stakes. Closure is a Charged Poise—Lira corks the vial, saving fragrance for tomorrow, while the light turns; the cost is the perpetual vigil she’s now bound to maintain in silence. Orientation anchors within 60 words; no lens ambiguity. Persistent constraint: she must keep forging records that contradict Bertram’s volume doctrine—career risk etched on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Cobalt tower, Atlantic cool front, dawn light, and oil-store bench are filtered through Lira’s keeper gaze—tools and weather matter. Micro-setting object: the cork itself constrains her next night’s experiment; its rough circle against palm charges the final image. Spatial choreography clean: spiral stairs, gallery, workbench, watch room tracked without drift. One hairline slip: “garden at the base” is mentioned but never entered—slight garden-as-prop rather than lived space.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prove gentle signals save ships—signaled in paragraph 4. Tightening occurs when she uncorks vial at dawn, foreclosing the horn option for that window; cost is implicit loss of institutional cover if Bertram discovers. Agency is accumulative: each dawn release layers evidence against his volume doctrine. Coincidence complicates—heat wave breaks—but resolution comes from her scent reaching the trawler, not luck. Could use one more on-page consequence (Bertram’s suspicion) to hit 8.5+ band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: volume vs. intimacy, institutional authority vs. private conviction. Subtext resides in the cork—tiny plug against institutional noise—and in the final 2° correction, a literal re-weighting of navigation. No moralizing; final image of turning light and breathing garden offers non-literal answer. Grandmother’s journals function as inherited counter-myth, not exposition. Resonance lingers: reader left sensing that quiet frequencies outlast screams.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is keeper-specific: foghorn “screamed like something wounded,” light “a blue flame,” scent “uncurled.” Rhythm modulates—long lyrical sentences under calm dawn, shorter beats when Bertram’s boots interrupt. Dialogue sparse, natural, subtextual: “Talking to the sea again?” / “Listening.” No head-hop; interior access stays tightly bound to Lira. Free indirect style clean: “She believed in vibrations…” registers as her idiom, not authorial intrusion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings diversify. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Metaphors are precise and physics-loyal: “tremor in the bones,” “sentence finally spoken aloud.” Information density high—each paragraph advances scent experiment, character risk, or atmospheric stakes. One micro-tighten: “scent moved seaward, invisible, unhurried” could compress to “scent slipped seaward,” but the extra beat serves cadence, not clutter. Closure line (“passed safely beyond the rocks”) lands with clean monosyllabic relief.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise—lighthouse keeper uses night-garden perfume as navigational signal—is fresh yet plausible within maritime folk-science. Synthesis of scent, vibration theory, and lighthouse tech feels inevitable, not gimmicky. Transformation test: remove garden scent and entire plot collapses. Avoids worn sea-metaphors; cobalt tower, dawn timing, cork talisman are specific to this tale. Risk lies in quiet resolution—no shipwreck averted at cliff-edge—but that quietness is the point, earned by prior layering.</comment>
