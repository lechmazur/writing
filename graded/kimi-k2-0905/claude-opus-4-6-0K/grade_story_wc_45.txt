<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren’s bone-setter identity is woven into every beat—she “reads” the changeling tooth as she would a fracture, and her grief for her own child is kept bodily (the cold hands she couldn’t warm). The interior contradiction—skepticism vs need to believe—peaks when she pockets the impossible tooth, a micro-choice that costs her the last of empirical safety. Closure is Earned Stasis: she kneels to listen for a cry she may never hear, accepting perpetual uncertainty as the price of renewed vocation. Only quibble: the “constellation” metaphor is stated twice, slightly diluting the visceral cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>One fluid scene, chronological and causally tight: because the wooden baby is axed, Maren walks; because Britta predicts, Maren enters the maze; because she finds the tooth, she re-commits to faith-healing. Orientation is clean by word 60 (village bone-setter, November, Thornfield hedge). Closure is Charged Poise: the final image of roses turning “toward her as if remembering some older sun” reweights every prior rational rejection with undeniable conceptual cost—she will keep searching a garden that should not exist.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Environment acts as surgical instrument: thorns catch like small hands, rose faces reposition to judge her, the oak root-hollow becomes the cradle she must decide to trust. Sensory hierarchy obeys Maren’s tactile bias—smell of chalk-apples, temperature of shade, bark grain under palm. The impossible botany (roses in November, star-reflecting basin) is never catalogued; it assaults her certainties and thus hers alone. Final image uses the garden’s agency to crystallize her stance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can she tolerate a fracture in empirical certainty severe enough to re-open the wound of her daughter’s death? Escalation is accretive: each sensory impossibility in the garden tightens the screw until the baby tooth becomes the decisive fulcrum—accept its wrong texture or retreat. Cost is felt: she trades clinical sovereignty for the forever-possibility of listening to illusory crying. One meaningful tightening, no reversal, perfectly adequate for 750-word scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: the ethics of healing when the healer herself is irreparably broken. Subtext loads the tooth—both infant relic and diagnostic artifact—so that “setting” a fairy bone becomes a proxy for setting her own guilt. Final image reframes prior skepticism as merely another splint awaiting removal. No moralizing, only the charged stance of a woman who chooses an unverifiable lullaby.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited clings to Maren’s sensory register: verbs of palpation (“feel the feel”), suspicion of miracles rendered in bone-setter jargon (“fractured radius of knowledge”). Rhythm accelerates inside the maze—long sentences tangle, then shorten at the tooth discovery. No dialogue, so voice must carry idiom; it does, through tactile diction and medical metaphor chains that never slump into textbook tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Almost no scaffolding; sentences carry double duty (action + metaphor, e.g., “splinters scattered like bones”). Figurative language peaks only at rose and star images, each tied to Maren’s perceptual shift. One paraphrase loop: “She had always been…she had always believed” could be compressed. Closure line is clean, no mixed metaphors, propels rather than decorates.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fair-folk changeling trope is inverted into a medical parable; the “garden behind the maze” trope is retooled as diagnostic theatre where flora take the patient role. Fresh synthesis: bone-setting as metaphysics. Risk is high—quiet ending, no infant recovered—yet coherence holds. Loses 0.5 because the constellation metaphor feels imported rather than grown from inside the fairy lore.</comment>
