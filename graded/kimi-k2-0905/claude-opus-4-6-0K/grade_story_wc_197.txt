<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Maren’s cultivated invisibility and the final act of “reappearing” are cleanly dramatized; the contradiction between self-erasure and public transmission is felt in-scene. One beat of interior summary (“She did not know how many would hear…”) keeps this from the 9-band. Otherwise motive, micro-choice, and embodied cost stay coherent and character-specific.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the broadcast holds, cost is legible (“some remembered”), and the lens stays Accumulative/Textural—pattern break of puddle-map → auric lagoon reweights meaning. Causality is intact: every link (key, booth, signal) is pre-seeded and paid off. No orientation debt; transitions are legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Golden lagoon under starlight is not postcard scenery—it supplies the only viable broadcast node and mirrors the “second sky” of doubled stars, charging the final image. Micro-setting (phone-booth panel, salt grass) constrains the physical act. One tighter sensory cue (sound of the relay click?) would nudge 9+.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—countering manufactured indifference—tightens once the abort signal arrives; the puddle-map deepens rather than widens options. Cost is visible: burned safe-houses, lost comrades, and the irreversible exposure of transmission. A second intermediate complication would push higher, but the single deepening satisfies short-form scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the accretion of soft erasures and the final refusal to let silence win; no character sermonizes. The auric lagoon re-prices the concept of “reflection” literally and politically in the closing image. Ambiguity remains—some remembered, some did not—inviting lingering tension.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Maren’s perceptual filter; puddle-reflections as map feels idiosyncratic and consistent. Rhythm modulates: longer cadence for lagoon awe, clipped for key-turn. One clause drifts toward editorial (“indifference was not a natural state”) but is saved by immediate grounding in the broadcast act.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, high-density; no scaffold loops or metaphor clutter. Sentence variety supports momentum. A single filter-verb cluster (“she saw… she moved… she had forgotten”) around the puddle sequence keeps this shy of 9+ perfection, but clarity never wavers.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Puddle-mirrors as living map and obsolete phone-booth network repurposed for counter-archive feel fresh yet inevitable. The concept of “softening” history rather than overt censorship is a non-obvious angle. Risk is present but controlled; no gimmickry obscures closure.</comment>
