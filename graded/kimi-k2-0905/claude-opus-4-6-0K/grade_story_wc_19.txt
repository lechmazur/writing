<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Maren’s claustrophobia and porcelain talisman are embodied early; the inversion-hour forces her to test that flaw in open air, producing a credible renunciation. The final beat—“the silence of a woman no longer afraid of open doors”—pays off the interior contradiction with visible emotional cost. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible skipped; micro-choices (counting seconds, releasing the doll) keep agency alive throughout.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each silence variety layers density until the gilded hush reweights the stake. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Maren’s new silence is earned by surviving the inversion, cost felt in the doll’s re-illuminated face. Orientation anchored by word 80; no lens ambiguity. Only nitpick: gravity rule is revealed rather than taught, but inversion is accepted as monthly given, so causality intact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Trellis, cloud-sea, and doll micro-setting all constrain action: lattice keeps her from falling, porcelain presses ribs during inversion, sky-ceiling prevents wall-building. Selective sensory triage—gilded hush, coat billowing downward—mirrors her suffocation terror without cataloguing. World rule (monthly inversion) is learned through immediate peril, not exposition. Environment directly charges the final image when doll catches upper-atmosphere gold.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—collect silences to understand mother’s descent—tightens when the inversion forces her to sample the ultimate quiet while dangling above cloud-ceiling. One meaningful deepening suffices: the sprouting silence invades her chest, foreclosing retreat; cost is the old terror neutralized, a loss of familiar identity. No antagonist needed; pressure is situational and internal. Escalation is legible under Accumulative lens; option foreclosed when she names the new quiet as hers.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of silence-as-freedom emerges from concrete sensory collection, not thesis. Final reconfiguration—owning an open-door silence—reweights earlier bunker dread without moralizing. Porcelain doll’s worn face carries understated maternal absence; no abstract pronouncements. Ambiguity persists: she descends back to a world that still digs bunkers, leaving resonance intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person limited stays tight to Maren’s perceptual filter: “lungs would seize at the sight of a closed door” is idiosyncratic, not diagnostic. Syntax lengthens and compresses with altitude—“stretching each contracted moment like taffy”—without losing clarity. No dialogue, so voice purity unbroken. Inversion paragraph uses short, gravity-defying fragments taught by context; pattern holds through final doll-to-light image.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “gilded hush, luminous and heavy at once” performs double sensory duty. No scaffold, loops, or register drift; metaphor vehicles stay aerodynamic. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves via image that recharges silences motif. Only two adjective clusters in inversion beat, but they serve disorientation, so no artifact penalty.</comment>

<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Inverting gravity above a hospitable cloud-trellis is fresh, yet rules are followed without late cheats. Silence-as-substance trope is retooled through sensory taxonomy rather than vague mysticism. Character-specific claustrophobia inversion—terrified of openness, terrified of closure—personalizes the cosmic gimmick. Risk distinction +0.3: structural inversion literalizes her psychological flip without gimmickry obscuring stakes.</comment>
