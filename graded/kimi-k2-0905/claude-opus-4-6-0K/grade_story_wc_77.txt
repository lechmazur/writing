<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Maren’s interior contradiction—simultaneously repulsed and magnetized—charges every beat; her micro-choice to press the too-fingered hand against the mirror crystallizes the stakes. The endurance cost is visible: she walks out “uncursed, unafraid” but still photographically erased, a price that forecloses any return to normal identity. Sorrel stays a functional cipher; her whispered prompts shape tactics yet lack interiority, capping relationship crucible credit. Overall, a hair under 9 because the advisor’s motived opacity keeps secondary pressure one-note.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands clean: Conceptual Repricing reweights the rule-set—“fear needs us more than we need it”—with undeniable social cost (permanent photographic erasure). Causal chain holds: paradoxical dictionary → speech act → mirror cascade → evaporating luminance. Orientation anchored by line 4; no disorientation debt. One minor warp: the dictionary’s mechanics are asserted rather than demonstrated mid-escalation, a hairline slip that keeps it from 9.3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Funhouse mirrors function as both environment and tool, constraining every tactical move; the clasp-as-micro-setting reprises at entrance and exit, its dulled moth-image charging the final “uncorrupted darkness.” Warm-mirror tactile detail and mercury-pool evaporation compress sensory hierarchy into action. Spatial choreography stays clean across the domino crack. One notch below 9 because exterior carnival geography remains vague, a negligible loss at this length.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—purge the parasitic luminance—tightens once yet decisively: naming fear forces either Maren’s erasure or fear’s eviction. Agency is crystalline; her paradoxical confession is the irreversible turn that narrows options to win-or-die. Cost is legible: permanent photographic curse. Misses 9.0 because escalation is single-pulse rather than compounded, acceptable for 700-word squeeze but not the layered pressure required for top band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: appetite masquerading as light, originality stolen by reflection. Final image—mirror shard showing only darkness—reweights “light” from salvation to parasite. Subtext in Sorrel’s moth clasp (devouring self) quietly echoes fear’s self-consuming need. No pseudo-profundity or moralizing; resonance stays particular and earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice sustains a hypnotic, lyric cadence that accelerates under mirror-crack pressure; perceptual signature—“photograph she had ruined by existing”—is character-unique. Compression taught early (“lingering luminance” repeats with shifting valence) stays legible. Filter verbs minimal; diction stays within Maren’s plausible lexicon. Dialogue only two whispered lines, but indirection works. One hairline slip: “unbosoming” as verb edges ornate, yet fits ritual register, keeping it sub-9 by a whisker.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>No loops, no scaffold; sentence variety breathes with escalation. Metaphors (“luminance bled…like mercury”) are sparse, precise, and paid off. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and re-charge motif. Just under 9 because two adjacent sentences open with “The…” in the crack cascade, a microscopic cadence echo that momentarily flattens propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Premise—photographic curse as after-death souvenir—feels fresh, yet “funhouse as fear temple” is familiar terrain. Specificity of moth-swallowing clasp and paradox dictionary transforms stock tropes. Emotional truth (grief as parasitic light) outweighs surface novelty. Risk in lyric compression pays off. Slight deduction for funhouse setting that could swap with haunted house without structural break, keeping it below 9.</comment>
