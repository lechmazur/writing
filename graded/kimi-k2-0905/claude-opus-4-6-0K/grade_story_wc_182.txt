<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sable’s quiet, scholar’s competence is rendered in tactile beats (citing acoustic fossils, cross-referencing dead languages) that reveal a hierarchy of values—knowledge before safety. Her decisive choice to confront the Custodial Silence is prepared by earlier micro-choices and carries visible professional risk. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. Only missing a sliver of contradictory impulse in-scene to enter 8+ band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal spine holds: because Maren arrives with a botanical map, Sable therefore researches negative space, therefore renegotiates entry—each linkage narrowing options. Closure lands as Charged Poise: “the music will be playing” reweights the rescue without tidy payoff and carries conceptual cost (the mountain’s melody she can now almost hear). One tightening beat suffices for this length; no orientation debt; lens clear.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The mountain-bookstore is not mere backdrop; shelf-lined granite corridors and altitude-specific flora constrain navigation and cipher decoding. Sensory selection skews bibliophilic (old paper scent, pressed petals) filtered through Sable’s archivist gaze. Spatial choreography is clean from floor 400 to 7,744. Setting charges the final image—the faint hum she now perceives—meeting 9+ gate requirement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“can unlearned lessons finally be heard?”—is signaled early and escalates through Sable’s single, high-cost negotiation that forecloses secrecy. No reversals needed; one meaningful tightening satisfies. Cost is legible: the Custodial Silence’s relinquishment implies future obligation the mountain may collect. Could edge higher if an explicit tactical loss were dramatized on-page, but pressure holds.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: ignored wisdom as unheard symphony, reframed by the ending image of perpetual music awaiting listeners. Subtext resides in gestures—Maren’s weep, Sable’s returned translations—rather than exposition. No moralizing line distills the point; resonance is earned. Complexity maintained: no guarantee humanity will listen this cycle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited clings to Sable’s perceptual signature—lexicon of extinct grammars, tactile acoustics of stone. Syntax stays controlled, slightly formal, mirroring a linguist’s precision. No head-hopping; distance stable. Dialogue minimal but natural, carrying subtext (“But at least the music will be playing”). Voice modulates subtly under stress, supporting the lyrical closure without purple drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Rhythm varies; sentences open with diverse structures, propelling ascent through clauses that mimic climbing floors. Figurative language is selective and purposeful—“missing tooth the tongue keeps finding” sharpens the idea of catalog absence. No filter-verb stacks or paraphrase loops detected in peak beats. Minor heightened diction (“proto-Enochian modified with chlorophyll notation”) stays within Sable’s wheelhouse, so no register penalty.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses library, mountain, and living index into an image that feels inevitable yet fresh. Botanical cryptography and negative-space bibliography transform familiar quest tropes into scholar-detective beats specific to this world. The unheard-symphony metaphor reweights the entire rescue concept, turning didactic theme into acoustic poignancy. Risky structure pays off: single negotiation replaces action set-pieces without losing stakes.</comment>
