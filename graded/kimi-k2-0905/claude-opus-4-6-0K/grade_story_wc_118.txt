<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Maren’s “hear the walls” motivation is concrete and unique, driving every beat; the final act of walking east with tweezers embodies her cost. Interiority stays specific—she never labels her feelings, only registers sensory detail. No contradictory impulse is dramatized on-page, so the arc is steady rather than fractious, capping her below the 9-band. Still, her odd perseverance feels lived-in and the closure choice is fully earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Maren renounces stopping, accepting endless witness while the displaced axis keeps turning—“the cost is felt” in the final image of her carrying silence east. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout: each salvaged text thickens the density of lost voices until the pattern crystallizes in her departure. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 6. One minor causality gap: how the tapestry fragment travelled inside the diary is untaught, but it never resolves conflict, so −0.2 only.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The reclaimed silo’s curved acoustics actively shape Maren’s method (she listens at walls) and supply the story’s central metaphor of stories pooling like water. Sensory triangulation—dust smell, bronze light, cold concrete—anchors every beat without checklist excess. The micro-setting of the half-burned diary pages constrains her handling (tweezers, pale light), charging the probe scene. Environment, body, and tool all press against choices and reconfigure in the final image, satisfying the 9-band gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“collect stories before walls forget”—is signaled early and tightens once: Elspeth’s diary confirms the dream-loss mechanism, shifting Maren from mere collection to conscious witness. Escalation is accretive, not causal, fitting the Accumulative lens; the tightening is sufficient for 600-word scale. Cost is legible: she accepts perpetual motion, ending with “silence and her strange, persistent purpose.” Could use one intermediate tactic change tied to the axis concept to reach 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: memory as the true axial tilt of a world that can no longer dream. Subtext runs through object handling—tweezers, soot-stiff tapestry—rather than exposition. Final image reweights earlier motifs (bronze quiet, axis, silence) without moralizing. Would reach 9+ if a single ironic gap between Maren’s hope of preservation and the certainty of erosion were dramatized in-scene.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Maren’s perceptual signature: auditory bias, tactile precision, medieval-text lexicon (“grain-silo acoustics”). Rhythm swells and subsides with her ascent/descent. No head-hop; psychic distance tightens during diary probe, widens at exit. Patterned elision (“the world did not end so much as exhale”) is taught early and paid off in closure cadence. Meets 9-band technical bar with zero voice slippage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence detected. Figurative language is sparse and precise—“stories pooling in its grain-silo acoustics like water in a well”—never clogs high-pressure beats. Information density high: one line often does description, worldview, and metaphor simultaneously. One paraphrase loop (“the world did not end so much as exhale / the end had come anyway”) costs −0.2, preventing 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses post-apocalyptic stillness with medieval tapestry prophecy, avoiding zombie tropes. The “walls remember” conceit gives fresh sensorial stakes to archival fiction. Dragons-on-globe image re-appears with reweighted meaning at closure, feeling inevitable. Risk in lyrical quietude pays off; no derivative echoes detected. Specificity of Elspeth’s seventeen-degree axial obsession anchors the concept in scholar verisimilitude.</comment>
