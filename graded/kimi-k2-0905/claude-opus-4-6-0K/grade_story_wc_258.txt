<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Maren’s detached empiricism is vivid in her card-mapping ritual and refusal of fortune-telling clichés; her “steady curiosity” appears only as thematic label and never exacts a cost or forces a trade-off, so interior contradiction stays theoretical. Jules’s arrival supplies external pressure, yet his confession triggers no visible micro-choice in Maren: she labels him “pattern,” shows maps, and resets to measuring without stake-shift or personal risk. Closure image of adding another data-thread is consistent but safe; no on-page price is paid, so the renunciation/change feels intellectual rather than lived. Characterization is strong on texture, weak on consequential choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens governs: each reading adds translucent sheet-density until the final “nine-centimeter” entry reweights the premise. Orientation is swift—loft, exchange office, post-crash Paris—within first 120 words; transitions are absent because the text is a single continuous scene. Closure lands as CR: the measuring tape’s latest gap conceptually reprices belief-engineering, showing the web’s unbroken expansion; cost is abstract (endless data-gathering) but legible. No meaningful tightening inside the beat—Maren’s stance neither narrows nor risks anything—keeps score below 8.8.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rain-beaded skylight, onyx-ink cards, and the cloth tape create a tactile micro-setting that constrains action: distances must be measured, cards laid flat, rainlight watched. The Marais loft’s inherited clutter mirrors Maren’s inherited method without overt symbolism. Selective sensory filtering (sound of rain, smell of paper) stays inside her empirical POV. Environment does not charge the final image—the tape is used the same way at exit as at entry—so it stops short of 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can cultural patterns be reverse-engineered?—is signaled early; pressure accumulates via each new data-point rather than a causal reversal. Jules’s confession is textured evidence, not a turn that threatens Maren’s goal; her options never contract and no price is exacted. One meaningful deepening occurs when she admits patterns might be “interrupted,” but the beat stays hypothetical. Escalation is present as density, not risk, meeting short-form threshold yet lacking felt cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: divination stripped of magic becomes data science, revealing collective delusion without offering escape. Subtext operates in the silence after Jules’s confession—Maren offers maps, not absolution—showing complicity as statistical inevitability. Final image of “multiplying paths” answers the trust-rebuilding question with cold topology rather than moral: patterns persist, measurement never ends. Ambiguity is purposeful; no moral is stated, resonance lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person hovers at mid-distance, filtering observations through Maren’s empirical lexicon (“data-set,” “geometry,” “topology”) without head-hop. Syntax is controlled, rhythmic, slightly academic—mirroring a mind calibrating distances. No dialogue is required; when Jules speaks, his diction is plainer, marking status contrast. Voice remains stable under pressure; no filter-verb clutter or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or paraphrase loops. Figurative language is sparse, precise: “tide retreating,” “trajectories of falling markets,” each linking finance and water imagery without strain. High information density—card ritual, crash context, inherited mystery—woven through action. Minor hedge phrase “she wasn’t sure” could be cut, but no artifact touches closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Merging tarot with data-viz topology to chart post-crash anxiety is a fresh synthesis; the measuring tape as unit of cultural distance is specific and memorable. Premise commits fully—no last-minute pivot to magic—and follows implication to conceptual exhaustion. Risk lies in making the protagonist observer-only; piece accepts that cost, achieving Earned Stasis. Transformation would survive location swap but not the exact ink, tape, and numeric idiom, satisfying proximity test.</comment>
