<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maren’s quiet, stubborn caretaking and illicit feeding feel lived-in and specific; her memory-tasting gift is shown, not told, and every action (pruning, grafting, offering soup) flows from a coherent hierarchy of values. Interiority stays concrete—“between copper and grief” anchors cosmic light in bodily perception. The final gesture of non-confrontational defiance costs her the safety of secrecy, earning the closure under an Earned Stasis. Only minor flattening: the inspectors’ instantaneous collapse edges toward wish-fulfillment, slightly undercutting the credibility of her risk.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: she pockets the new seeds while authorities quietly abandon their citations, reconfiguring power without a shouted victory. Causal chain holds—seed → eclipse → fruit → seeds again—each beat because/therefore. Orientation anchors within first 100 words; greenhouse spatial logic remains clean. One hairline slip: the inspectors’ paperwork vanishes without on-page consequence to Maren, so cost is felt more thematically than practically.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rusted iron ribs, broken glass, and “soil that remembered” act as micro-setting, constraining every act of pruning and grafting. Light angle at eclipse is measured like a scalpel—environment literally enables the seed’s eruption. Sensory triage keeps to Maren’s chef-biased attention: taste > sight > touch. Final window-sill angle reprises the greenhouse light, so setting charges the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—keep feeding the forgotten—tightens when regulations arrive; the fruit’s bloom escalates her exposure, narrowing options to covert propagation or surrender. Pruning and tasting are agentive beats, not just ritual. Cost lands as social jeopardy (inspectors could shut her down) but would be sharper if one inspector had verbally escalated before crumpling. Still, the quiet tightening fits the “gentle” premise.</comment>

<comment>Theme of generative decay emerges organically: rust as nutrient, condemned people and plants still reaching. Memory-as-flavor motif threads from first paragraph to final soup without ever naming the theme aloud. Triple conjunction becomes a cosmic permission rather than spectacle, reweighting neglect into possibility. Final image of seedlings in condemned light offers CR that revalues ruin itself as fertile ground.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited holds tight to Maren’s synesthetic attention; diction stays culinary (“synaptic plasticity” is the only slightly academic outlier, forgiven by context). Rhythm modulates—long horticultural sentences broken by tasted memories in bite-size fragments. No dialogue, so voice carries all subtext; silence of inspectors is scored through her perception. Texture remains consistent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry triple duty—e.g., “stubborn, feral things that twisted through the rust” shows botany, character worldview, and stakes in one breath. Figurative language is selective; no mixed metaphors, no loops. Only minor scaffold: “she cared about what grew… she cared about what grew” echo could be trimmed. Otherwise propulsion stays lean to the luminous final clause.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Memory-tasting chef grafted onto mythic horticulture feels fresh, yet emotionally concrete—flavor as archive of the dispossessed. Celestial trigger could have read gimmicky but is justified by mother’s “it’ll know when,” making cosmic alignment feel destined rather than contrived. Conceptual risk—quiet rebellion through feeding—pays off without sentimentality. No derivative aftertaste; the synthesis lingers.</comment>
