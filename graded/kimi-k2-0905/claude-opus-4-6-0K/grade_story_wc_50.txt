<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren’s interior contradiction—locksmith who now unlocks time rather than doors—remains abstract; we never see her hands hesitate over a lock she refuses to pick. The notebooks and spiral timer trace a credible arc, but her emotional cost is summarized (“content to wait”) rather than embodied at the exit beat. The renunciation lands, yet the moment of felt forfeiture is off-stage, keeping the score below the 9-band gate.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>A cleanly taught Accumulative/Textural lens: each cavern visit adds density until the timer’s spiral reversal reweights the stake. Orientation is swift; the cracked nautilus crystal anchors who, where, when by line 4. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—her departing footsteps become the cavern’s new composition—so the cost is audible even though Maren’s private loss is not physically dramatized. One tightening cycle satisfies short-form escalation; no causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The marble throat, parabolic sweeps, and light-angled acoustics are filtered through Maren’s locksmith gaze; every sensory note serves her reverse-engineering goal. The timer’s brass and cracked crystal evolve from prop to lens, constraining her final choice to leave. Frost-bit fields above provide temporal shorthand, avoiding exposition. Spatial choreography remains coherent across lantern placements and echo trajectories.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“store wonder in numbers before the world grows loud again”—is signaled early and tightens once when the timer begins its spiral run. The escalation is textural: each echo generation thickens until the final one reconfigures her options. No external antagonist is needed; the cavern’s creative pressure suffices. The cost is conceptual (her footprints absorbed as new material) rather than viscerally felt, capping entry into the 8.8+ band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of measurement: a locksmith learns that some locks open only when you stop forcing them. The echo-harvest motif accretes meaning without declarative statements, culminating in the image of stone “composing” her exit. The refusal to domesticate wonder into mechanical time carries lingering ambiguity—readers sense both triumph and bereavement. No moralizing sentence mars the close.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains a perceptual signature rooted in tactile precision—“oiled the gears with patience,” “veined white throat.” Rhythm modulates with long, prism-splitting sentences that mimic echo delay, then tightens into the short final ascent. No filter-verb clutter; every metaphor is locksmith or acoustic-bound. The prose teaches its pattern early and repays it at the last line.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sentence variety and muscular verbs drive momentum; only one paraphrase loop (“echoes weren’t mere repetitions… they were harvested versions”) momentarily stalls. Information density is high—each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual work. No mixed metaphors or register drift. The final paragraph’s cadence mirrors the timer’s spiral, earning the high-band placement.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of locksmith craft, acoustic archaeology, and geological creativity feels specific and non-obvious. The spiral-crack-as-lens reframes damage as aperture, a fresh inflection that refracts both light and meaning. Risk is taken in the quiet, accumulative structure rather than in plot pyrotechnics, and it pays off in the closing image. Could nudge higher with a sharper felt cost on the page.</comment>
