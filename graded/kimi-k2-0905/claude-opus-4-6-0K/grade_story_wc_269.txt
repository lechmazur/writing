<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren’s interior contradiction—scientist who trusts data yet keeps a torn, obsolete map—is vivid and embodied. The tapping ritual gives her a tactile, non-generic pulse; her final quiet renunciation of closure on the vanished paths lands with felt cost. No second character appears, so relationship bullets are waived; single-POV interiority is consistent and specific. The one minor lapse: “witness” title is named more than dramatized in present beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the seabed shift reweights the atlas page from nostalgia to evidence, with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain holds—bleaching → collapse → tide anomaly → path erasure—tight under Accumulative lens. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no disorientation penalties. Tapping motif reprises at the exact beat the pilings shudder, crystallizing the Renunciation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The station itself—the steel desk, tide gauge housing, concrete pilings—functions as micro-setting that constrains every ritual and reading. Atlas page reappears as tactile object handled twice, charging the final reconfiguration. Sensory hierarchy is filtered through Maren’s scientist gaze: color-loss timing, footpath ink width, sediment weight. No geographical drift; scale stays tight to instruments and torn paper.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—why paths vanish—tightens when data drop contradicts expected rise, forcing her to relinquish the drowning myth for the collapse truth. One meaningful deepening: the same reefs she once watched bleach are now the geological culprits. Cost is legible: her lifelong hydraulic explanation is partially overturned, and the atlas page becomes forensic, not nostalgic. Pressure accumulates rather than reverses, fitting Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges as “memory is stored in substrate, not sentiment”—reef skeletons, thermal mass, and ink on paper all carry lagging consequence. No overt thesis statements; final image lets atlas page stay pinned as silent indictment. The reader is left to feel the oceans’ “periodically eternal” indictment rather than read a moral. Ambiguity is productive: is science complicit witness or mere archivist?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: scientific precision married to tactile ritual (“hairline ink,” “sediment weight”). Compression is taught early—“periodically eternal” coined and repeated with shifting inflection. No unreliable drift; diction stays within Maren’s lexicon. Rhythm accelerates into short declaratives at anomaly reveal, then relaxes into resigned final sentence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or causality. Figurative language is sparse, precise: “oceans held memory in their thermal mass the way old wood holds the shape of a nail.” Opening and closing lines bookend with object-image symmetry (torn page → pinned page). Only hairline slip: “periodically eternal” risks over-coinage, but repetition is pattern-taught and re-priced at end.</comment>

<comment>Freshest synthesis: tide gauge data考古学拼接成pottery曲线 + 人类学消失的footpaths = 地质层面的道德延迟报应。Risk—using post-ban still-rising seas—avoids cliché by focusing on substrate collapse, not inundation. Atlas page as forensic evidence而非nostalgia object reframes eco-grief genre. Conceptual integrity commits fully; no late rule changes.</comment>
