<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren’s contradictory impulses—contractual obedience vs. caretaker devotion—play out in live micro-choices: the tuning-fork test, ribbon tie, and final climb. Fen’s shift from legal enforcer to structural claimant is credibly seeded by Maren’s concrete demonstrations. The cost (career risk for Fen, exile endured for Maren) is legible on the last page. Interiority stays embodied, never drifts into label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure earns Earned Stasis: Fen files the claim, Maren keeps mending, both accept foreseeable wrath—cost is overt. Causal chain holds: because the trees buttress the vault, therefore demolition = collapse; because Maren proves it, Fen’s tactics pivot. Orientation is clear by line 30; no lens ambiguity at end. Persistent constraint (cathedral’s structural dependence) shapes every beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The vertical orchard is not backdrop; its fracture lines dictate Maren’s tools and Fen’s legal pivot. The ribbon re-weights from nostalgic relic to binding mark of continuance. Spatial choreography is immaculate—scaffold, nave, rafters tracked without drift. Fog-filtered rose-window light and resonant fork tone integrate sensory hierarchy with POV’s quartz-eye bias.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—cathedral’s survival vs. Compact’s liquidation—tightens once: from eviction threat to structural dependency claim. Agency sits with Maren’s demonstration and Fen’s legislative counter-move; both carry professional peril as felt price. No coincidence; escalation is causal under knowledge gain. One meaningful turn suffices at this length and is delivered.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of persistence versus legal seasonality emerges through event, not lecture: “deciduous contracts” is spoken once yet enacted by every beat. Subtext in gesture—Fen catching the twig, holding it through the scene—carries the shift. Final image of falling blossoms as “shed contracts” reweights the metaphor without moralizing. Ambiguity remains: Compact may still win, which complicates the ethic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person close clings to Maren’s quartz-eye perceptual filter: refracted light, fracture-reading, tactile bark. Syntax grows sinuous under scaffolding strain, then steadies on descent, mirroring knee protest. Dialogue carries generational idiom difference—Maren’s proverbial cadence vs. Fen’s clipped legalisms—without ventriloquism. No head-hop; psychic distance modulates deliberately.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening structure; high information density—one line can set, act, and symbolize. Metaphors (arthritic roots, shed contracts) stay consistent to botanical through-line. Zero paraphrase loops; no filter-verb clusters. One mixed image—“clicking lens” sound beside fog hush—barely audible, does not blur sense.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Cathedral-orchard graft feels inevitable yet unseen elsewhere; living buttress converts biological growth into architectural keystone, literalizing “persistence.” Legal concept of “deciduous contract” germinates from the same biological frame, unifying world-law and theme. Risk in marrying ecological fantasy to bureaucratic stakes pays off: closure requires both wood and writ. Specificity of quartz-eye profession and harmonic diagnosis prevents trope recycling.</comment>
