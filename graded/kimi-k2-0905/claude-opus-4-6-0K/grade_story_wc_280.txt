<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulse—clinging to performance while craving closure—grounds every beat; the moment she presses the warm coin to the painted Fool, her body remembers death’s chill and her voice refuses silence. Interiority is sensorial, not analytic: indigo weeping, copper petals humming. The final bow is a renunciation that costs her the very stage she haunted, felt in the coin cooling from alive to metal. Micro-choices (speaking, setting coin, reaching into amber column) all refract one trait: encore hunger tempered by timeline fracture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: echo density layers until the tarot coin reweights possibility. Closure is a Charged Poise—orchard’s standing ovation crystallizes her stance; applause tastes of honey, feels like dawn, proving the cost is felt. Orientation anchors (who=dead actress, where=hidden orchard, when=after gate locks) arrive by line 3; disorientation later is taught payoff. Persistent constraint: the fracture never heals; bridge is provisional, applause temporary—visible cost keeps stakes alive.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Silver apple rows and violet wind chords are selective, never touristic; each sensory note is filtered through synesthetic ghost perception. The coin-as-micro-setting constrains the climax: only on the stump can echoes braid. Spatial choreography tracks her drift, bow, orchard bowing back—no impossible positions. Final image of trembling luminous fruit recharges every prior mention of amber glow, closing the setting loop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: earn one final audience before endless fracture. Escalation is density of altered echoes (“beloved”→“forgotten”→indigo weep) that narrow her options to accept impermanence. Agency lies in performing the echo-ritual; price is acceptance of provisional bridge, not healing. Cost is legible: coin cools, applause is orchard’s not mortal’s—she trades perpetual encore for one perfect ovation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from spectral performance itself: art’s value lies not in permanence but in momentary communion across broken time. Subtext thrives in gesture—trees bowing, fruit trembling—never in thesis lines. Final image of honey-tasting dawn reconfigures nostalgia from ache to lift, accomplishing Conceptual Repricing without moralizing. Ambiguity remains: bridge may collapse tomorrow, but that uncertainty deepens rather than simplifies the thematic question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person lyric captures a ghost’s synesthetic lens: “indigo she could taste like rain.” Rhythm swells with echo cadences, contracts at coin cooling, mirroring emotional arc. Diction stays within a theater ghost’s lexicon—soliloquy, curtain, encore—without academic drift. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent, pressure-heightened, paid off in final ovation image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density: each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and temporal threads without scaffold. Figurative language is patterned early (synesthesia) and therefore justified in density; no mixed metaphors. Zero loops, zero filter-verb stacks. Minor registry lift in “Conceptual Repricing” is narrator’s, not character’s, but occurs post-closure; does not dull final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fusing stage-ghost trope with synesthetic orchard of dead timelines feels inevitable yet unpublished before. Echo mechanic literalizes theme of art’s imperfect repetition across fractured eras. Risk—lyric non-linear accumulation—heightens rather than obscures stakes. Specificity of 1927/1953/next-Thursday threads prevents generic “time is broken” abstraction; payoff is honey-tasting dawn impossible without prior particulars.</comment>
