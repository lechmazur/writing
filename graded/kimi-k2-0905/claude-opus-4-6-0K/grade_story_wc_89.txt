<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Maren’s interior contradiction—wanting to grieve yet surrendering to cosmic intimacy—surfaces only once, late; her listening gift is shown more than tested. The phoenix-bond cost is palpable, but Aleron’s half-bird form reads more symbol than crucible, blunting relationship-as-pressure. Still, the body-rewrite is endured, not chosen, giving a lean Earned Stasis that satisfies closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each spice-song thickens the membrane until scent becomes sibling; the final image of feathered twosome standing in null-shadow reweights the opening “orchard with no memory of sunlight.” Orientation clean at 60 words, no props teleported; single transition into metamorphosis is legible. Closure is Charged Poise: permanent moonlight, permanent alteration, cost felt in “cast no shadow at all.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silver-barked pulse-soil, clove-cardamom air, and upward-falling petals are not backdrop but tools that coax the spell; braided roots literally clutch the returned body. Micro-setting succeeds: Maren’s lengthening fingers and iridescent talons become the environment she must inhabit. Final image reuses moonlight as anti-shadow, charging the closure. No occupational errors; spatial choreography tight in seven-tree ring.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reverse death—declared at paragraph 4; each exhaled spice-song tightens feasibility of return, payment visible in feather-splinters. One deepening: resistance collapses into surrender, narrowing option from human to avian dyad. Agency is renunciation/acceptance rather than active attack, fitting Accumulative lens. Price (body-form) is irreversible, shown on page, satisfying felt-cost gate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges as “listening is costlier than speaking” and “love reforges even ontology”; no authorial thesis stated. Fortune cookie recurs only as seed but earns its place by birthing the spice method; subtext coils in silence between feathered siblings. Final anti-shadow image offers non-literal answer: bond survives by ceasing to cast definition. Sentimentality avoided; awe preserved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close clings to Maren’s sensory choreography; perceptual signature vivid—scents “sing,” bark “pulses.” Rhythm flexes with pressure: short clauses during transformation, languid sentences for orchard lull. No head-hopping; phoenix-brother’s voice arrives as internal vibration, not quoted. Diction stays within Maren’s earthy lexicon; filter verbs minimal. Non-standard grammar absent; no artifact contamination.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentences carry double duty—e.g., “Petals fell upward” condenses world-rule + wonder. Figurative density peaks but stays coherent: “luminance that felt less like light and more like attention” teaches orchard’s sentience early, paid off at close. No scaffold loops; paragraph breaks mirror breath of spell. One clause slightly overwrought (“cosmic intimacy of being known completely”) yet doesn’t occlude causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Moon-orchard as eternal ICU for resurrection, spice-scent as software of necromancy—fresh synthesis. Phoenix resurrection folded into sibling grief rather than hero quest; fortune-cookie igniting occult chemistry is sly risk that pays off. Transformation borne by listening rather than sword or spell flips genre convention. Specificity high: bat-harmonic vanilla, dead-temple pepper—could not swap ingredients without collapsing mechanism.</comment>
