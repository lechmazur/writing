<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maren’s survivor guilt and need to atone for “performing” crisis are sharply embodied in the dust she still tastes and the wrist she rubs; the decision to walk the names is a credible micro-choice that costs her the last comfort of detachment. Interiority stays concrete, but the epiphany “this was not a limitation but a language” drifts toward label-speak and blunts the final contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The accumulative pattern—each footstep adds a name, each echo returns it—tightens once when she reaches the focal point and hears her own whisper come back unchanged, a Resonant Reconfiguration that costs her the fiction of rehearsed suffering. Orientation is clean by line 10; the lens holds; the missing-pawns image reweights the premise at closure without forced exposition.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The whispering gallery is not backdrop but instrument: the acoustics force her to slow, curve, reverse—each physical constraint shapes how and which names she can spell. The chessboard’s absent pawns mirror the unheard rescuers and return in the final image, charging the closing beat with conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes are legible early: will she keep performing crisis or honor the real one? Pressure escalates accumulatively—each step adds weight of memory until the gallery returns the name intact, foreclosing the option to forget. No reversals are needed; the single deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between spectacle and invisible mercy; the final image of the returned whisper reweights “small gestures” as the true load-bearing beams of history. No moral is stated; the chessboard’s empty pawn row does the conceptual repricing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Maren’s perceptual filter—dust, wrist, echo—without head-hop. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for memory, clipped fragments for footfall spelling; the final whisper sentence lands with clean cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but never purple; each image pulls double duty (“dust cemented into her lungs” = backstory + body). One paraphrase loop (“She kept walking. She kept spelling.”) is minor; no mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks mar the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The crisis-actor who fakes collapse to honor the real collapse she survived is fresh; the footfall-alphabet converts a lyric gimmick into archival ritual. Risk lies in the quiet ending—no explosion, only echo—yet the choice feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
