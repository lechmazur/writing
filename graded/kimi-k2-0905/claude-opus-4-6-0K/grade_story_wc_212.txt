<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maren’s interiority is concrete—her “furious tranquillity” is felt in bone and breath—and the acorn-cap micro-choice visibly tilts her stance. The lineage burden is shown, not told, through the journal echo and the vortex rising through her palms. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene, however; the moment of vault-reopening reads as destined acceptance rather than a forked decision, capping the score below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a pure Resonant Reconfiguration: the icebound greenhouse becomes generative again without thaw—conceptual cost legible in “life had remembered how to begin.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern-ordering intensifies texture until the vortex column reassembles ancestral seed-ghosts. Causality is lyric rather than sequential, but the because/therefore is “because order reached critical mass, therefore the vault returns,” paid off in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The atrium’s frost-coated trellis, iron, and fountain are not backdrop but instruments Maren sorts into constellation-mirrors; the ice itself is the tool that constrains and finally enables reopening. Micro-setting (acorn cup) charges the final image when it fills with spiral light. Sensory hierarchy obeys her seed-saver gaze: starlight is “cold rivers,” ice “granular, heavy as wet sand.” No spatial drift; all bodies and distances track.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restart the vault or let ancestral memory die—is signaled in paragraph two. Escalation is textural: each symmetrical alignment increases pattern density until entropy thins and seeds stir. The tightening forecloses the option of passive guardianship; the price is the irreversible opening of a channel she must now steward. Cost is conceptual but unmistakable: “borrowed time” becomes lived responsibility the instant the cap hums.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inverse of expected apocalypse: life restarts not by melting ice but by perfecting frozen order—“life had remembered how to begin.” The acorn cap’s shift from absence to vessel of light reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext whispers in silence: the creature’s soundless breath is the vacuum where human language yields to older pattern. Final image offers complex ambiguity—greenhouse reborn yet still icebound—inviting reflection on memory versus growth.</answer>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is crystalline, slow-rotation syntax that mirrors spiral inheritance: “starlight poured in cold rivers,” “slow rotation of galaxies.” Compression is purposeful—elided transit, no filler—pattern taught by fourth sentence. Filter verbs appear only when voice-motivated (“she felt furiously tranquil”). Psychic distance tightens from cosmic to palm-pressed tile in final beat, modulating with pressure. No head-hopping; single POV remains stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm alternates between long spiral clauses and fragmentary percussion—“She understood now.”—creating natural breath. Figurative language is dense yet coherent: every metaphor is celestial or crystalline, never mixed. Zero paraphrase loops; no sentence opens with the same stem twice in succession. Information density high: one line can layer sensory, symbolic, and causal work. Minor −0.1 for “granular, heavy as wet sand” echoing itself, but this reinforces texture rather than drags.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The seed-vault premise is familiar; the inversion—order not heat as the generative force—is non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. “Vortex inheritance” as living current passed matrilineally re-enchants epigenetics without exposition. Risk is taken by making climax a quiet crystallization rather than thawed action; coherence survives. Specificity—acorn cap, frost trellis geometry, silent prismatic creature—anchors the abstract, preventing allegory drift.</comment>
