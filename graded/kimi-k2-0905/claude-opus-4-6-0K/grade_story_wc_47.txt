<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elena’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the contradiction between her urge to hide and her deliberate act of “proffering” the pendant is dramatized, not declared. The only knock is that the sister remains a silhouette—no distinct speech or micro-choice—so the relationship crucible is inferred rather than tested on the page. Still, the final gesture carries a palpable cost: the amber leaves her body, sealing a visible forfeiture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the amber’s transfer converts a static keepsake into a living record of possible repair, felt cost registered in the trembling hand. The accumulative drive holds—each moss-lined server rack thickens the texture until the pendant beat crystallizes the new stance. Orientation is clean by line 5; no causal or spatial drift. One tightening is enough for this length, and it lands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The derelict data-center-as-terrarium is not backdrop; the dripping icicles literally carve the branching channels Elena later seeds, so environment shapes tactics and charges the final image. Sensory selection is POV-true—“ribcages of strange metal animals” sees light before people. Micro-setting supremacy: concrete panel, pendant, and moss spores all constrain choice inside one contiguous room.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—whether Elena will remain sealed inside her wound or risk reopening it—surfaces early and tightens once: the sister’s arrival forces a public/private collision. The pendant proffer is a decisive, irreversible cost; it forecloses total withdrawal. Pressure is purely situational but coherent; no coincidence rescues. One meaningful turn satisfies scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from concrete horticultural action: fractures become fertile channels. No exposition moralizes; the amber’s redefinition from prison to record is earned through tactile transfer. Final image reweights prior material without标语—reader feels that vulnerability might now be medium, not wound.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is unmistakable: light moves before people, moss before machines. Syntax breathes—long lyrical sentences for reverie, crisp “She crossed the moss-soft floor” for action. No head-hop; distance stable. “Honeyed hush” refrain is interior coinage, not writerly decoration. Dialogue absent by design; voice remains singular and pressure-calibrated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet buoyant—each sentence carries image + emotion + forward motion. No filter-verb stacks, no mixed metaphors; vehicles stay biological/light-based. Minor scaffold: “she had begun to use the pattern as a template” could compress, but artifact does not touch closure. Read-aloud rhythm modulates with thaw-drip cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses three non-obvious arenas—viral confession trauma, abandoned server farm, and moss gardening—into an inevitable metaphor ecosystem. Icicle-grafting as method of healing cracks feels singular yet predestined. Risk: lyric stillness could deflate tension, yet pressure holds through sensory investment and pendant forfeiture.</comment>
