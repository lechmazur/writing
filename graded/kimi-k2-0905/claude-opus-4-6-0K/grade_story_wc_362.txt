<comment>Sera’s interiority pulses through crystalline metaphors that feel native to her; “she tracked it the way meteorologists track pressure systems” crystallizes vocation and obsession in one breath. The prism’s warmth in her palm is the only embodied beat, but it lands late and alone—no prior micro-choice shows her risking anything tangible. Because the story never forces her to test her theory in a way that could publicly fail, her motivation stays steady-state rather than intensifying; the emotional cost is felt, yet not paid by her on the page.</comment>

<comment>Pattern is taught immediately: quartz arbor → prism → frost assay; each beat deepens the same inquiry under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The single scene obeys time and space; mist erases the arbor just as frost melts, giving a clean Charged Poise closure—Delia’s years slide down the glass, reweighting the premise without narrative comment. No orientation debt; causality never breaks. The only bar to 9 is that Sera’s personal stake is observation, not endangerment, so the cost is conceptual more than lived.</comment>

<comment>Frozen-rose thorns and quartz pillars are sketched with photographer’s economy; one line and the place stays tactile. Body-as-setting works: frost on the windshield becomes the laboratory bench, constraining every reading she takes. Larger world (hospital, town) is left fogged—correct at this length. Final image of melting frost as “tears/rain/something no instrument…could name” returns sensory specificity to theme, earning its lyric lift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“prove emotion imprints or be dismissed as fraud”—is declared early and tightens through each frost sketch; failure would cost her vocation. No antagonist appears, but the skeptic’s implied voice exerts steady pressure. The single deepening is the prism warming: physical anomaly that confirms her rule-set, foreclosing doubt without external crisis. Cost is intellectual legitimacy rather than limb or love, capping intensity just below the 8.8 gate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme—objects remember, grief leaves measurable residue—emerges solely through procedure and image; no character editorializes it. “Truthful lie” refrain threads the concept without preaching, and the final runoff of frost re-prices the premise: proof exists yet remains unshareable. Ambiguity is productive, not evasive. Minor deduction for an early aphoristic cluster (“grief has weight…joy leaves fingerprints”) that slightly front-loads the idea before it is dramatized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person keeps psychic distance consistent, yet diction (“shifted hush,” “truthful lies”) is unmistakably Sera’s idiom, a scientist-poet fused register. Rhythm breathes with procedure—long sentences for observation, staccato note-taking for data. No dialogue, so voice carries all; each metaphor is filtered through her perceptual instruments (meteorology, optics). Pattern is taught from line one and never slips, justifying the lyric height of the ending.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and image-dense; every descriptor does double duty (“climbing roses now dormant in winter” grounds both season and latent emotion). No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors—vehicles stay optical/atmospheric. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing,” “accumulative resonance”) is earned by context; register never drifts into abstraction for its own sake. Frost verbs—“feathered,” “branched,” “streamed”—vary sentence openings and propel the eye downhill to the final melt.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The “emotion-recorded-in-ice” conceit refreshes both ghost story and lab-notebook tropes; execution feels inevitable, not gimmicky. Risk is taken by rejecting confrontation—no sceptic arrives, no storm breaks—yet tension holds through pattern accretion. Specificity of frost fractals versus hospital sunsets roots the concept in lived detail, warding off abstraction. Could push higher if Sera faced a harder ethical fork; as is, originality lies in quiet method more than in stakes.</comment>
