<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren’s involuntary truth-telling is dramatized through the painful betrayal of Gareth; the micro-choice to keep the riddle and repeat it crystallizes her endurance with visible cost. Interiority is concrete (“words tasted like ash”) and the final stance is earned. Missing a second contradictory impulse in-scene keeps this just outside 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: blackout → riddle → naming Gareth → Maren’s vow to keep asking. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: her future tolls will perpetuate wonder at the price of perpetual complicity. Cost is legible in the final line “That was enough,” spoken over the ash taste.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The tower’s bare rods and empty hive chambers are returned to in the final image, recharging the earlier “honest skyline.” Micro-setting—the matchbox in her pocket—literally travels into the booth light and constrains her next move. Sensory selection (amber, nectar, ash) stays filtered through Maren’s mournful attention.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether wonder can survive routine—tightens when Maren must choose between loyalty to Gareth and civic duty. The reveal narrows her options to complicity or silence; she pays with perpetual moral debt. One meaningful turn suffices; cost is felt on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the riddle itself: small, overlooked systems keep cities alive. The final image of Maren repeating the toll reframes the blackout as sacrament rather than sabotage. No moralizing statement—meaning stays embodied in the matchbox she pockets.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Maren’s perceptual bias: she clocks boots on iron, tastes ash, notices light like spilled honey. Syntax mirrors her measured resignation; no head-hopping. Distinctive without purple overlay.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; every sentence advances story or atmosphere. No loops or scaffold. Figurative language (“sky the color of nectar”) is selective and purposeful, never crowding causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Lightning-farming bee-drones and a truth-compelled toll keeper synthesize into a fresh parable about infrastructure as ecosystem. The riddle-as-sabotage device feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk is taken—blackout as gift—yet clarity holds.</comment>
