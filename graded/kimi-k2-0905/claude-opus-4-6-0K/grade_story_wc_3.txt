<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Senna’s grief-sharpened curiosity is vivid and embodied; her tactile reading of the seed against her teeth and ribs makes the scholar’s precision felt. The moment she presses the seed into the fissure crystallizes her hierarchy of values—knowledge over safety—yet the beat is compressed and her internal contradiction (duty to Tariq vs. fear of vanishing) is asserted more than dramatized in-scene, keeping the renunciation just shy of full-cost ignition.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: planting the seed reweights “unfinished business” into ongoing stewardship, the cost legible in the indigo sky she may never descend from. The causal chain—spirit invitation → climb → read → plant—never wavers; the reflective blocks are anchored to seed-touch and arbor-hum and tilt her present stance, satisfying BRR. Orientation is established by line 3; transitions are seamless; lens is Accumulative/Textural and held without slippage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The arbor’s magnetic hum, ozone scent, and converging field lines are not backdrop but instrument: they guide Senna’s choice of fissure and determine where the seed can root. Every sensory note is filtered through her translator’s bias—cuneiform texture against teeth, magnetic throb up kneecaps—so the setting literally inhabits her body and charges the final image. Environment constrains and enables; no caps triggered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“understand the physics of transition”—is signaled in paragraph 5 and tightens when inscription reframes death as resonance, foreclosing her hope of retrieving Tariq. One meaningful deepening suffices: knowledge gained costs her the option to follow; agency is renunciation rather than conquest. Cost is visible in the burning eyes and the whispered name carried downward—she pays with acceptance of permanent absence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: cuneiform wedges become the architecture of grief, seed becomes proxy for unfinished research. The final image—name descending roots—reweights transition from loss to continuity without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: does planting honor or merely extend the haunting? Emotional aftereffect is earned, not asserted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice carries a scholar’s lyrical precision: “methodical to the point of tenderness,” “second skeleton,” “touching distance.” Syntax lengthens under reflection, shortens at the seed-planting beat, mirroring pulse. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains tight to Senna’s tactile epistemology. Register stays within her plausible lexicon; only “physics of transition” flirts with abstraction but is earned by prior context.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is varied and propulsive; sentences perform multiple jobs (e.g., “She pressed the seed against her chest and felt it pulse faintly, magnetically, as though responding to the iron in her blood”). Zero loops, scaffolds, or mixed metaphors; figurative language is sparse and coherent. High information density with no line-level artifact; final image is uncluttered and resonant.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses Sumerian scholarship with magnetospheric botany—fresh, non-obvious, yet inevitable given character expertise. The “haunted ambition” trope is transformed into literal arbor-rooted research continuation. Specific detail (pre-Sargonic wedges, field-line fissure) prevents generic substitution; removing seed or arbor collapses the story. Risk in lyric speculative mode heightens meaning without gimmickry.</comment>
