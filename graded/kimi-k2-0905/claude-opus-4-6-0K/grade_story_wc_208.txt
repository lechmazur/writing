<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Maren’s interiority is concrete and character-specific—her “arguing with the wood” and reading water like road signs feel lived-in. The contradictory impulse to relinquish control to the storm while later choosing to encode new knowledge is dramatized, not declared. The final renunciation—leaving the framed slide—carries visible cost (she departs with “nothing but the memory”), earned by the prior beats of recognition and carving. Only the faintest label-speak (“timewoven alliances” placed by the slide) keeps this from a 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Maren’s understanding of her art shifts from solitary act to relay in a charged poise under the archway, cost paid by the literal relinquishing of the artifact and the conceptual foreclosing of her former isolation. Causal chain holds: GPS failure → drift to arch → discovery → recognition → encoding → departure. Orientation is anchored within the first 120 words; no ambiguity. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of layered images and relayed knowledge intensifies until the final reweighting. One tightening suffices.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The basalt archway’s turbine hum and tidal pool are not backdrop but active constraint: the hum vibrates in her chest while she carves, the tide sets the carving deadline, the niche determines where the frame must rest. Micro-setting (driftwood in her skiff, glass in her palm) constrains the carving action. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—she notices spray, grain, starlight in sailor’s order of urgency. Final image of constellations on wet stone recharges the earlier constellation map, environment directly charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she keep the slide or pass the relay?—is signaled once discovered. Escalation is textural: each tilt of the glass deepens the stake from curiosity to recognition to responsibility. The single meaningful tightening occurs when she decides to carve a frame instead of a figure, foreclosing personal possession. Cost is legible: she leaves the artifact and accepts perpetual apprenticeship. Could wish for one earlier external obstacle, but the internal pressure suffices under accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme—knowledge as gift economy across time—emerges through the slide’s layered images and her carved frame, never stated. The final image of “hands she would never touch” reweights prior solitude into continuity, a non-literal answer. Subtext operates in the shift from “arguing with wood” to listening to it. No moralizing; the turbine hum and starlight carry the conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Maren’s perceptual signature—water as mood, wood as interlocutor. Syntax lengthens and compresses with tidal rhythm; diction remains within a sailor-carver’s lexicon. No head-hopping; psychic distance stable. The single epithet “timewoven alliances” is the only momentary POV leakage, but it reads as the slide’s implanted phrase, not authorial intrusion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet aerodynamic: “storm exhaled its last gusts” does triple duty—weather, mood, transition. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or decision. Metaphors stay coherent (cathedral arch, turbine hum) and physically grounded. Rhythm modulates from long wave-like clauses to short knife-cut fragments during carving, propelling to the final line.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The lantern-slide-as-map is fresh, yet the relay concept feels inevitable for a driftwood artist who already leaves anonymous gifts. Risk lies in the quiet refusal of possession; the boldness is thematic, not pyrotechnic. Specificity of maritime carpentry and tidal timing prevents generic allegory. Slight deduction because the “network across time” idea has contemporary echo, but execution here is singular.</comment>
