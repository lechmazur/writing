<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maren’s contradictory impulses—clutching the blank and then choosing to carve a hand instead of a lion—are dramatized in embodied micro-choices; her final cut is earned by the prior two-year paralysis and the kettle-time pressure. Interiority is concrete, never diagnostic, and the “hauntingly practical” quality of the wood functions as an externalized flaw that complicates her release. Voice, perception, and hierarchy of values stay strictly bound to her widow-skewed lens; no safety-hedging sentimentality. Cost is legible: the first chip relinquishes the phantom Teodor’s intended lion, foreclosing that ghost-shape forever.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the instant the gouge bites the ash, the meaning of the blank flips from preserved ghost to active vessel, reconfiguring “here and gone” under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is intact—the kettle’s rising scream literalizes the narrowing window—and the spatial anchors (loft, skylight, bench) are fixed by word 50. No lens ambiguity; the final image crystallizes the new geometry of calm Maren must now inhabit alone.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The rain-beaded skylight is not backdrop but a refractive constraint: its amber distortion filters the “rust-hued peace” that colors her decision. The ash blank’s physical properties—soft grain, pencil ghosts—literally determine what shape can be carved, charging the final hand. Loft topography is economically seeded: kettle, bench, coaster made from oak slice; every prop is handled, none listed. Weather beads evolve into rivers that mirror her blurred focus, anchoring time inside a single wet afternoon.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can she use the wood without betraying Teodor?—tightens exactly once: when the kettle’s scream forces the first cut, converting stasis into action. Agency is hers alone; no external antagonist, but the blank itself exerts counter-pressure as “fossil” and “not-yet.” Cost is visible on the page: the lion is relinquished, the hand chosen, the path irreversible. Escalation is micro but decisive; coincidence absent; pressure coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without dictation: love’s demand to be used, not enshrined. The blank’s transformation from lion-ghost to open hand reweights “here and gone” from elegy to instrument. Subtext resides in silence—no memorial speech, just the scrape of ash. Final image offers non-literal answer: an empty hand can now hold anything, including loss itself.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Maren’s circus-widow perceptual set: “smelled of sawdust and big cats,” whip/lathe equivalency, professional shorthand never explained. Syntax lengthens during reflection, then fragments as the kettle climbs—“The kettle screamed.”—mirroring pulse. No dialogue, so voice distinction judged by internal idiom alone; it remains singular. Filter verbs avoided; metaphors (fossil, lens, geometry) are POV-appropriate and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is taut, rhythmic, information-dense: each sentence performs at least two jobs—e.g., “The blank contained him... crystallized time” simultaneously explicates grief, object permanence, and carving physics. No scaffold, loops, or synonym churn; figurative language is sparse enough to avoid density penalty. Read-aloud cadence modulates from long reflective coils to the staccato final clause: “And Maren... began to give the shapeless thing a shape it could live inside.” Copy clean; tense stable.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Widow-carves-husband’s-intended-lion into open hand is fresh synthesis of familiar grief arc; circus specificity (winter quarters, lathe, big-cat scent) particularizes. Risk taken in quiet closure—no spectacle, just first chip—earns its smallness by two years’ prior refusal. Not quite 9+ because the “lessons from loss” list edges toward thematic echo, slightly dampening surprise.</comment>
